  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—replacing performance with witness—is signaled early and tightens once: the week of patient mapping narrows Elias's professional identity, and the sabbatical email forecloses academic ambition with felt opportunity cost. Under the Accumulative lens, this single deepening is structurally sufficient. However, the turn lacks on-page reversal or complication; the flood has already stripped drama before page one, so Elias's observational work proceeds without friction. No secondary pressure tests his patience or competes with the new stance, leaving escalation more methodical than charged.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (discover her brother's truth and her own purpose) is signaled early. The ledger revelation tightens options causally. However, the final choice to drop the ledger and walk on feels more like acceptance than a forced trade-off with competing costs dramatized on the page. The brother remains off-stage, so the stakes lack a second character to create immediate pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs but the price—emotional release—is asserted more than wrestled with in contradictory action.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—translating silence into music to redeem the *Capriccio*—is signaled early and tightens when the first key produces nothing, forcing reversal of the heat-map. The piano sequence escalates through bleeding fingers and the storm's yielding, a meaningful pressure point. However, the final choice to "sail back into the storm" lacks visible trade-off or forfeiture; it feels more declarative than costly, and no live option is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—granting rest to the restless dead—is signaled early and tightens when the ledger blurs and the lens vibrates. The climb represents escalation driven by Elias's agency, and the cost is legible: the lens crumbles, and Elias adds his own name, foreclosing a path. The dead's appearance and re-sinking constitutes a meaningful reversal that narrows options. Minor deduction: the internal conflict (rationalist versus believer) could apply more sustained pressure; the shift feels compressed rather than earned through multiple micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (survival without disappearing) signals early and tightens when the patrols torch the arbor, forcing Elias from covert aid to open defiance. The twelve-bell ringing is a clear escalation driven by protagonist agency, and the communal stand that follows raises the cost—kindness becomes visible crime. The patrols' hesitation and departure feel slightly undercooked (officer's internal calculus is told, not dramatized), but the persistent constraint (sanctions, visibility as danger) shapes tactics throughout and charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: find where unused love goes. The jade press to sternum and the camera obscura's shadow-split serve as one meaningful tightening that narrows uncertainty to revelation. However, escalation is largely textural—density of image and motif—rather than a decision-forcing bind. Elias faces no live trade-off or visible price; the jade grows "warm, then weightless, then gone" without dramatizing what he gave up or what path closed. The child's shadow in the final beat hints at ongoing responsibility, but Elias's agency in becoming "keeper" is asserted post-closure rather than tested on the page. Cost clarity falls short of the 8.0+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—escaping temporal entrapment and understanding time's texture—is signaled early and tightens when Liora climbs into the photograph and realizes she's "trapped in when." Her decision to run sideways along the hyperbolic curve and hurl the fragment is driven by protagonist agency and narrows options with visible cost (collapse, destroying the fragment). The woman's warning and the photographs' screaming voices provide pressure. One clear reversal occurs when the fragment unravels and the maze resets, reweighting Liora's understanding and future approach.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—retrieving seeds to plant resilience—is signaled early and tightens when the guard appears, forcing Lena to choose between escape and completing her mission. Her piano-key trap narrows options and the planting act forecloses return (empty pockets, walking away). Cost is visible: she leaves herself exposed, walks toward hunger, and commits to tomorrow's risk. The escalation is clean under the Causal lens. The piece does not reach 8+ because the guard's threat deflates quickly (he falls into a pit with minimal struggle), reducing the felt price of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—finding "the sound of trust breaking"—is signaled early and pursued through imprinting absences. The forge-lighting and copper-imprint sequence provides one meaningful tightening: the metal "remembers" and the greenhouse trembles, escalating sensory pressure. However, the resolution ("Trust didn't break like glass. It eroded.") reads as thematic realization rather than a choice that narrows options or forces a tradeoff. The wading into the tide is acceptance, not agency that forecloses a path with visible cost. Coincidence does not resolve, but the protagonist's passivity at closure keeps this in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—stealing the portrait to claim an illuminated moment—is signaled early and tightens when the mirror reveals her own fate. The stationmaster's entrance raises cost ("your luck runs out… imminent"), and Liora's decision to hurl the jar constitutes protagonist-driven agency that narrows options and forecloses her old path. The escalation is meaningful: she shifts from passive collector to active agent willing to "break" time itself. One beat of deepening (mirror revelation) followed by a decisive tightening (jar throw) fits the Accumulative lens and this length.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: whether to complete her father's project or forge her own path, signaled early ("she'd sworn she wouldn't" return) and tightened when she discovers the second bookmark's "controlled collapse" instructions. Pressure accumulates through the thaw (groaning ice, drips, the flood hiss) and deepens when she realizes the crack is "a record," not a failure. The valve-turn is protagonist-driven and forecloses the original sanctuary project with felt cost: she leaves the bookmark behind and walks away with empty tools. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful tightening (discovering the bookmark sequence, choosing to flood and then leave) is sufficient. However, the story does not dramatize a live counter-desire or complication after the valve turn; the walk to the observatory reads as smooth resolution rather than a final test.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—proving Lena exists legally and professionally—is signaled early and drives the search. The cast's decrypted message provides one meaningful tightening that narrows options and points to the ledger. Closure cost is legible: Lena bleeds onto the shell and walks away from the water phobia still intact. However, no on-page decision faces genuine opposition or trade-off; the ledger simply awaits retrieval once the clue resolves. The girl never resists, the security guard never appears, and Lena's phobia is invoked but never tested in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—"to draw a map of an endless night"—is signaled early but remains abstract and contemplative rather than tested by opposition or choice. No reversal narrows options; Eldrin's actions (tracing pages, exhaling, releasing the booklet) are iterative meditations, not escalations driven by agency. The closure is an image of dissolution, not a decision with visible cost that forecloses a live path. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens pressure should deepen through density or cadence shift; here it disperses rather than tightens, and no antagonist or constraint forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake—"Where do thoughts come from?"—is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page action tests it concretely. The procedural question ("Find what was lost") arrives late and off-page, weakening escalation. One tightening occurs when the violin whispers "You were never just a janitor," prompting the memory flood, but X-7's agency is passive observation rather than decision that narrows options. No visible cost: the courtyard reforms, the violin is whole, and X-7 "began to remember" without forfeiting a path or paying a price legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: Lena's desire to free honesty without words, signaled early via her doodle habit. The couple's arrival complicates but does not escalate Lena's internal stake; she observes, draws, slides the ticket—actions presented as smooth rather than pressured. No on-page reversal or tightening choice that narrows options. The couple's wordless recognition ("Us") is told, not earned by prior friction. Cost is conceptual (Lena's shift from "cryptic" to "clear") but not visibly forfeited or tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: proving the garden knows its gardener against pragmatic tallying. One meaningful tightening occurs when the elders return and declare her section "deficient," forcing her to lead them to the marbles. The reversal—elders kneel, doubt flickers, ledgers stay closed—is motivated by her demonstration but lands without visible trade-off or forfeited path. Agency is present in her choice to show rather than argue, yet the resolution feels granted rather than wrestled from conflict. The cost is implied (years of withering under accusation) but not dramatized in the closure beat, capping escalation impact.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—proving time moves sideways—is signaled early and tightens when Elias pulls the lever despite AI warnings, narrowing his options to demonstration or continued obscurity. The nexus activation forces a trade-off: K-11's disappearance "elsewhen" validates his theory but forecloses future access to the specimen, a visible cost. Pressure accumulates through the AI's escalating warnings and the station's physical groaning, and the final renunciation (resting rather than pulling again) crystallizes his stance with undeniable consequence. One meaningful tightening is sufficient at this length, and the cost is legible in K-11's departure and the station's held breath.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: decode the ghost's communication and break the silence. Pressure escalates through increasingly direct clues—blurred face, coded notes, explicit instructions—that narrow Elias's interpretive options and force a shift from passive observation to active engagement. The tightening is meaningful: the discovery of Clara's name and the instruction to "play the silence" reframes the entire enterprise from decryption to duet, raising the cost of response. Agency is present in Elias's choice to wait rather than play conventionally, a renunciation that enables the ghost's reply. Cost is legible but primarily atmospheric: the opera house shifts from tomb to duet space, foreclosing solitary practice. A more visceral price—what Elias risks or loses by crossing this threshold—would elevate the stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (warn or withhold truth) is signaled early and tightens when Liora realizes the storm breaks "now," not dawn—a reversal that narrows her window and forecloses inaction. The cost is visible: station destruction, unanswered radio, her erasure from the ledgers. Agency operates as renunciation (she chooses silence over warning), and the final walk embodies Earned Stasis with undeniable price. One slip: the storm's arrival feels coincidentally timed to her epiphany rather than caused by her delay, slightly weakening escalation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—confronting the weight of his father's confession—is signaled early and tightens when the sump water moves unprompted. Elias's agency is clear: he turns the valve wheel under pressure, triggering the geyser and apparition, then chooses to carry the wheel out rather than flee. The cost is legible (he inherits the ghost shift), though the escalation relies on a single reversal. Coincidence does not resolve; his action does.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—"to witness change without judgment"—is signaled early but never tested or complicated on the page. No reversal, no tightening, no choice that narrows options. The keeper performs the same ritual at the beginning and end without friction or cost; the refuge opens, they enter, they watch, they leave, they fold another swan. The stake remains abstract and uncontested. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or a cadence shift should reweigh the stake; neither occurs—only looped description.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: helping Mira find her voice. The eclipse road trip is a clear tightening choice that forecloses normal session work and raises exposure. The climax—Elias singing, Mira humming, Lila sobbing—delivers a turn with embodied emotion and visible cost (the vial relinquished, Lila's fear unclenching). One meaningful deepening is sufficient at this length. Agency is present but feels facilitative rather than forged under competing pressures; Elias's own want versus need remains implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: preserving/collecting stories that outlast dreamers. Pressure tightens when the tapestry's axis moves and Elias feels the tug, forcing him to choose non-resistance ("He didn't resist"). The choice forecloses balance, committing him to iterative wandering. Cost is visible: he walks away from the silo's shelter into a rain-scented wind with no clouds, accepting endless collection over stasis. One meaningful deepening (the axis pivot) drives the ending; no reversals required under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: escape discovery while preserving the orchestration system. The knock from the fisherman's daughter tightens options (men are coming); Chen's handoff of the microdot and his own departure narrow the path with visible cost (lighthouse goes dark, twenty-year tenure ends). Agency is clear in the decision to leave and pass the film. Escalation reads as accumulative pressure—fortune-writing habit, specs leak, imminent arrival, departure—with one decisive tightening when he trades the film for his own exit. Cost is felt in the ending image: the lighthouse silent, the system handed off, no return possible.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake (illuminate hidden assumptions vs. stop possession) signals early but remains conceptual. One meaningful deepening occurs when the indigo trail reveals the anchor's incomplete design, narrowing the priest's understanding. However, the priest's agency is passive observation followed by voluntary dissolution; no on-page reversal forces a trade-off between competing goods. The possession "hesitates" at the end, but this shift arises from the novice's repetition, not from a choice the priest made that foreclosed a path with visible cost. Escalation under Accumulative lens: density increases through motif layering, but pressure doesn't tighten options—merely reweights thematic meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Li Wei's need to conduct rather than merely record—is signaled early and tightens once when the shell's meaning shifts from *hearing* to *holding*, prompting his balcony decision to finally shape sound. However, escalation is minimal: the courier's arrival adds no genuine pressure, and the resolution (raising hands to conduct) feels more like thematic assertion than a choice that narrows options with visible cost. Under the Accumulative lens, the cadence shift and sensory crescendo (ice groaning, horizon trembling) provide meaningful deepening, but agency remains metaphorical rather than tested by friction.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—escape from the recursive viaduct loop—is signaled early and coheres under the Hybrid lens. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias confronts his shadow-self and forces the merger, narrowing options. However, the escalation relies on symbolic assertion ("lunged," "collision wasn't physical") rather than concrete tradeoffs or visible prices paid during the attempt. The cost at closure (tablet crumbles, viaduct vanishes) is legible, but the path to it feels more told than dramatized, limiting agency and earned consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming a sense of purpose after being deemed "useless"—is signaled early and tightens when the drum maker offers the backward songs, which test whether Elias can reimagine teaching. The phonograph demonstration is the single decisive beat that narrows his options: he cannot return to conventional methods. Agency is present in his choice to keep the wrapped needle and commit to this new pedagogy, foreclosing the path of traditional instruction. The cost is visible: he accepts a niche that some will reject, and the final image ("children would come, eventually") acknowledges uncertain reception rather than guaranteed success. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with one meaningful deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake: whether Elias will act on the message warning that the quarantine zone "is learning" or remain a passive observer. The message tube's arrival provides one meaningful tightening (the zone is no longer dormant), and his decision to file the note and begin recording narrows his options to continued documentation rather than intervention. The cost is implicit—he accepts isolation and potential danger—but the price lacks specificity: what does he lose by not warning the Bureau or leaving? The escalation relies on atmospheric intensification (the door creak, the silence "wouldn't stay silent") rather than a concrete constraint that alters his tactics. Agency is present but muted; Elias's choice to record feels consistent with prior habit rather than a renunciation that forecloses a visible alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding the rope's pattern and its connection to impossible choices—is signaled early and sustained. One tightening occurs when the beings add their thread and the rope snaps from resonance, narrowing the poet's options to either walk away or commit. Yet the escalation is contemplative rather than urgent; the poet "wondered," "laughed," "sat for a long time" without a live opponent or cost that makes refusal genuinely painful. The ending gesture (carving the ladder) is a choice, but what concrete path it forecloses or what immediate price it exacts remains implied rather than dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—Liora's choice between solitary preservation of the past and collaborative creation toward the future—is signaled early and tightens when the child arrives. The reversal (child's appearance) and tightening (Liora abandons her father's melody to co-create) are driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens. The cost is legible: she forecloses finishing her father's work, accepting incompleteness as the truth. Coincidence complicates (child's arrival) but does not resolve; Liora's final action (playing "the first note of tomorrow") is her choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: whether Liora will deliver the counterfeit emotion the chemist paid for or force him to face authentic grief. The key tightening occurs when she presses the petal to her own wrist instead of simply handing it back, a protagonist-driven choice that narrows his options and forecloses the comfortable lie. The scent change and his tears mark a visible cost—he loses the palliative he wanted but gains confrontation with "the man he'd been when she loved him." The chemist's agency is limited (he gasps, cries, but doesn't choose), making this more about Liora's professional/ethical decision, though the ending shows him leaving transformed. The half-truth versus truth opposition structures the conflict cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Elias's desire to act on his attraction and generosity instinct. The pressure tightens when he leaves the note weighted by the locket, narrowing his options to await her response. Her arrival and the locket's reveal create a reversal that opens the partnership path. One meaningful escalation occurs—moving from observation to proposition to enacted plan. Cost is present (locket surrendered, ledger unbalanced) but the transition from wary strangers to collaborators feels compressed; we see the decision summarized ("By dawn, they'd drafted a plan") rather than dramatized with friction, which keeps the escalation from feeling fully earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—grafting onto community—is signaled early and tightens when Reed decides to organize the collective search rather than work alone. The escalation is modest: she finds Syl, they paint together, the village joins, and the arbor is completed with collective touch. One meaningful deepening occurs when Syl's tag shifts from "I was here, and so were you" to "We are here," reweighting the premise from individual trace to collective presence. Agency is Reed's choice to search and to let Syl leave, but the cost—her vulnerability, the uncertainty of Syl's return—is conceptual rather than viscerally paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving the moths and preventing the giant's waking—is signaled early and sustained. Elspeth's choice to hurl the jar is a meaningful tightening that narrows options, and pulling the echo's leash escalates pressure into the final beat. However, agency feels reactive rather than driven by internal contradiction: the boy offers a problem, she solves it with an object from her satchel. The cost of the action (the boy unraveling, the pendant burning cold, the giant stirring) is described but not felt as a trade-off or forfeiture that Elspeth visibly weighs.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding grief through magical mathematics—is signaled early and tightens when the incantation yields only an ambiguous mist, not answers. The protagonist's agency is renunciation (he stops reaching, accepts non-balance) with visible cost: the clear eye clouds, and he leaves the proof unsolved. However, the story lacks a second beat of escalation or trade-off between the opening and the mist scene; the pressure is steady rather than climbing.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: Elias's desire to be visible versus his seventeen-year rule to remain hidden. The outage provides the complication; his decision to drop the tape is the first tightening (breaking the archive rule), the photo escalates, and stepping into light with the key is the closure choice that forecloses his former path with on-page cost. The woman's "breath hitched" and "eyes filled with something raw and bright" register the impact. One meaningful deepening under a causal lens; the protagonist's agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (Why this tree? Why now?) is signaled early and tightens when Liora realizes "the linden wasn't surviving the season—it was using it." The tightening forecloses her prior method (control, pruning) with on-page cost: she pulls up stakes, the trellis sags under wild growth, and she stops taking notes. Agency is clear—her decision to "let go" and surrender alters tactics. The final beat (handing a leaf to a customer) narrows options and closes the prior stance. Escalation is driven by protagonist choice under the Accumulative lens. One reversal (from fighting to releasing) is sufficient and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear: Elias seeks meaning to break his creative and existential paralysis. The brooch-to-slot choice is protagonist-driven and irreversible, foreclosing his prior stasis. The cavern vision reweights his prior paintings and insomnia as the island's call, narrowing options to acceptance. The cost is legible: he trades autonomy for purpose ("the one stupid enough to keep pulling the thread"), and the returned brooch signals ongoing obligation. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length; no spurious reversals pad the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake—Liora's search for the extraordinary—is signaled early, but pressure remains diffuse. The pearl-touch triggers the entity's appearance, yet no opposition or cost complicates the encounter; the entity lectures rather than tests. The vision is granted on request ("Show me"), and departure is frictionless. One micro-tightening occurs (her breath hitches when she realizes she hadn't foreseen the entity), but it deflates immediately into philosophical dialogue. No live trade-off or tactic shift narrows options before the walk-away ending.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—compiling fragments into meaning and deciding whether to sound the herald—is signaled early and tightens when Elias completes the ledger and chooses to pass the valve rather than blow it himself. The tightening forecloses a live option (reclaiming the herald role) with visible cost (he climbs away from the triumphant crowd). Agency operates through renunciation with on-page consequence: the valve now belongs to the child, and Elias's work shifts from archivist to witness. Pressure accumulates through community contributions (locket, teacup) and culminates in the choice on the lighthouse roof, consistent with the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—finding the fortress/naming the unspoken truth—is signaled early and tightens when the punch "bites" the air, opening the platform. The voice's question forces the confession ("I don't know where she went"), a renunciation that forecloses the obsessive mapping detour. Agency is clear: he whispers the answer, steps forward, then chooses to return. The cost is the surrender of certainty ("only carried with trembling certainty"). One meaningful tightening occurs; no multiple reversals are needed at this length, and the escalation reads as deepening rather than causal turns.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—finding a way to hold her brother's memory—is signaled early and sustained. The tile's discovery and her transcription attempt provide escalation beats. However, the key turn (symbols glowing, brother appearing) arrives through the tile's magic rather than Liora's choice under pressure. The whale song crescendos and "space stretched," but Liora's agency in that moment is passive observation. One meaningful tightening occurs (her decision to press her palm to the tile), but the cost of that choice is not legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—discovering what happens after goodbye—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lysander presses the fragment to the pillar, triggering the escondite's transformation and forcing his leap into the unknown. The cost is conceptual (dimensional dispersal, loss of fixed identity) and legible in the final beats ("maybe he was everywhere"). However, the escalation is more atmospheric than driven by protagonist agency under pressure; the amulet's expansion does most of the work. No explicit antagonist or secondary pressure complicates the path.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (twelve lives vs. one ledger) is signaled early and tightens when Lira realizes the math is "twelve for her." The ink pot mechanic—names dissolving, the pot warming and shattering—creates one meaningful escalation. The girl's arrival and their collaboration feel convenient rather than protagonist-driven, weakening agency at the peak. The minister's men as off-page antagonists never materialize on the page, so the final escape lacks embodied cost or loss that would elevate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake: the stationer's need to capture and invent histories. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens but does not meaningfully tighten. The lamp's new hum is a complication, not a reversal; once Elara's name surfaces, he transcribes her story without obstacle or trade-off. No on-page agency forces a difficult choice—he simply continues his ritual. The ending commits him to more of the same ("other histories to invent"), which is Charged Poise but lacks a visible cost that forecloses an alternative path. One beat (the transcription) is developed; escalation via a second constraint or loss is absent. The piece reads as a single sustained texture rather than a tightening conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—Daniel seeking texture of others' memories to reclaim or redefine his erased existence—is signaled early but never tightens into a live choice with visible trade-off. The gathering behavior remains consistent but does not escalate; no reversal forces him to risk or renounce. The ledger discovery could narrow options (confront authorship vs. continue collecting) but he folds it into the bundle without friction. Final act reads as ritual dissolution rather than agency-driven decision with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—decoding the universal riddle—is signaled early and tightens when the compass stills and points at the cello, shell, and Elias himself. The reversal arrives when he understands the riddle is a ledger, not a code, and his role shifts from solver to contributor. The journal's dissolution forces urgency, though the threat remains abstract. Agency is renunciation (letting the last page dissolve without scrambling) and attention (playing the cello as decoding), with cost legible in the blank shell and the choice to write on his own skin. The escalation is single-step and conceptual under the Accumulative lens, sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving Lumina's fluid autonomy against developer encroachment—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elira embeds the chip in the mural, reweighting her choice from internal conflict to public commitment. However, the escalation lacks on-page cost: the developers remain off-stage, no live confrontation occurs, and Elira's final action ("picked up her can again") reads as continuation rather than a decision that narrows options or forecloses a path under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—capturing beauty before industrial erasure—is signaled early and tightens through the canister pulses and the approaching drones' "distant hum." Elias's agency drives each beat (planting, photographing, departing), and the cost is visible in the line "Three hours to outlast the future" and the final renunciation of the crater. However, the escalation is linear rather than reversing or deepening; the drones never complicate his plan, only approach as a ticking clock, so pressure accumulates without a meaningful turn that narrows his options or forces a trade-off mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: prevent the *Mariner*'s navigation failure, signaled early through the "singing wrong" array. Escalation operates by accumulative deepening under the Textural lens: Elias decodes feedback, weaves through the crowd, applies the film—each beat tightens his diagnostic certainty and raises the stakes (the crowd's excitement contrasts his solitary knowledge). The navigation chime and parted mist are the payoff, altering the ship's path with visible cost (Elias's anonymity persists; no one stops him, no one thanks him beyond the captain's unanswered call). Agency is quiet but decisive: his choice to intervene forecloses passivity, and his return to the shop forecloses pursuit of acknowledgment.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—"to find where the rivers begin"—is signaled early and drives Lena to the ice. One meaningful tightening occurs when she presses her palm to the surface and the ice sighs, narrowing her options to stepping forward. The cost is legible (she vanishes, the falcon carries nothing back), but her agency at the peak reads more as mystical invitation than a trade-off between competing goods. No reversal tests her commitment; the water parts and she accepts.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (revival of the town) is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when the archway groans and the tuner quickens his pace, narrowing options and raising temporal pressure. The protagonist's agency—walking with deliberate rhythm, striking the fork at the well—drives the accumulation. Cost is legible in the final reflection ("the work was not done—it never would be") and the implicit eternal vigilance required. Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening from "wild hush" to "golden fire" and child's laughter reweights the stake with felt endurance cost.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—harnessing the hush to rewrite guilt—is signaled early and tested when Liora uncorks the vial despite knowing "it rewrites you." The signal's death and Elias's appearance deepen the beat, and her final refusal to answer future calls narrows options with visible cost (gear sold, inland move). Yet the escalation is more textural than causal: the rebreather's one-hour limit should force urgency, but the three-day rescue and half-full tank erase that tightening, replacing embodied countdown with summary convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—retrieving his father's name to rewrite legacy—is signaled early and tightens once: lattice unfolds, Elias plucks the name with cost (complicity in deaths, warden's arrival). The reversal (claiming "Nothing" becomes truth) narrows his public options and charges the return. Pressure accumulates through whispers and copperlight flicker. Agency is present but the climb itself unfolds without visible tradeoff (stamina, injury, tool failure); the cost crystallizes only after extraction. One meaningful pressure point suffices at this length, but the lack of mid-climb friction or visible price (time, fatigue, discovery risk dramatized in action) keeps this from 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (wake Vesper) is signaled early and sustained. The keeper's vial of black sap and Liora's repeated "excavations" accumulate pressure, but the tightening is textural (density increase) rather than a decision-point that narrows live options. The final awakening arrives as fulfillment of pattern, not a choice with visible tradeoff. Cost is declared ("each appearance cost her," "veil began to unravel") but not dramatized as a moment where Liora weighs and forfeits something on the page, leaving the escalation under the Accumulative lens functional but not sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—transforming ruin into reverence—is signaled early but remains abstract. The sleepwalking sequence presents repetitive actions (press plate, veins rise) without a reversal or tightening that narrows options until the Heart Chamber, where the labyrinth shifts in response to his touch. That moment reconfigures the physical space but lacks a visible trade-off or price paid by Elias; he simply wakes to find the work done. No secondary constraint (time, resource, social cost) shapes tactics, and the resolution feels granted rather than earned through protagonist agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—restore the blighted orchard—is signaled early and drives all action. Pressure accumulates through three days of uncovering, the seed discovery, the planting, and the dream that precedes the sapling's emergence. The sapling cracking the stone is a meaningful tightening that validates his commitment and narrows options (he will continue deeper). However, escalation relies more on atmospheric buildup than protagonist agency facing resistance; no antagonist or complication tests his choice to plant the seed, and the dream functions as a gift rather than a hard-won turn.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: crafting a name that fits the client's need. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lena hesitates at the mailbox, weighing whether to send the name. However, the pressure doesn't escalate through genuine opposition or narrowing options—she simply completes the transaction. The cost of mailing is asserted ("the moment before the letter left her hands") but not dramatized as a visible trade-off. Agency is present but the stakes remain stable rather than deepening under accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving the stars' "honesty" against the Council's censorship—is signaled early, but escalation under the Accumulative lens requires a density increase or pattern break that reweights cost, and here the "broadcasting" climax is told rather than shown. The courier's warning ("they're coming at dawn") tightens the timeline, yet Elias's response (aligning telescope and flame, "pulling the right thread") lacks visible trade-off or narrowed options. The enforcers' arrival "early" is a micro-turn, but the dome's shattering resolves the problem without on-page consequence to Elias—his smile and closed eyes suggest transcendence rather than sacrifice. Agency is present (Elias chooses to stay and broadcast) but the cost is conceptual and未付款; we are told the embroidery will survive and the flame burns still, removing the stakes' teeth.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: whether Liora will send/release the apology to her sister, signaled early via the letter in her pocket. Pressure accumulates through the mangroves' song, the spirits' question ("What are you waiting for?"), and her own escalating evocations—first the condensation message, then a second attempt "without fear." One meaningful tightening occurs when she moves from hesitation to release. However, the stakes remain abstract; we don't see what Liora risks losing or gaining concretely if the sister receives or ignores the message. The spirits' question and the act of releasing the letter provide a turn, but the cost is more thematic than visceral—no live option is visibly foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Lena's need to "graft new meaning" onto trauma artifacts—is signaled early and tested twice (cast, photo). The boy's request intensifies the pattern but doesn't escalate difficulty; Lena's coral gift resolves his need without visible trade-off or tactical adjustment. Her choice to walk toward the mist suggests iterative endurance (Earned Stasis), but no live option is foreclosed on the page. The shrapnel memory and anesthetic detail prime physical cost but don't constrain her final moves. Pressure coheres under the situational lens yet lacks a meaningful tightening that narrows her options or forces a sacrifice scaled to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—rediscovering lost joy and stitching time's torn edges—is signaled in the opening third and pursued through each beat. The piece tightens once when Liora realizes she must display the film publicly ("She knew what she had to do"), but this beat lacks visible hesitation or cost; no one objects, no resource is scarce, no danger emerges. The climactic projection brings others to witness the transformation, yet Liora's agency is curatorial rather than under pressure; coincidence (the fog parts, the last light cooperates) completes the effect. The stakes remain abstract ("a promise") rather than testing a concrete trade-off or foreclosing a path for Liora with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—exchanging certainty for curiosity—is signaled early and drives Liora's choices. The nested awakenings provide textural deepening and pattern intensification rather than causal reversals, which fits the accumulative lens. However, the cost of stepping through the door is conceptual (leaving the "real" garden) rather than a visible trade-off with dramatized consequence. The old man's "question you haven't spoken yet" offers a mystical deepening but not a pressure point that narrows options with felt urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—evading cognitive taxation and sustaining covert communication—is clear and present throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when the black-eyed Susans signal "they know," forcing a shift to rosemary ("proceed with caution"). The final morning glory loop ("now") promises escalation, but the story compresses the resulting action into summary ("stepped into the chaos they'd grown"), leaving the cost and tactical consequence legible but not dramatized. Agency is present but the peak choice lacks on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—photosynthesizing pain into beauty, waking the dead, dissolving war—is signaled early and repeated, but it remains thematic rather than tested by on-page pressure. The ghost's arrival and transformation offer a micro turn, yet he dissolves without resistance or cost to the poet. The new war beginning beyond the horizon and her decision to "sing louder" suggest escalation, but the tightening is asserted rather than dramatized through narrowed options or a visible trade-off. No live option is foreclosed; the poet's tactics (singing, writing, sending the manual) accumulate but do not shift under pressure. The manual sequence introduces variety but no rising cost or consequence that alters her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (preserve sounds vs. awaken what should stay forgotten) is signaled early and tightens through one decisive turn: repair succeeds but releases names that call forth dangerous memory. Liora's agency drives escalation—she strikes the match, seals the crack, then chooses to break the chime entirely. The final act forecloses preservation with visible cost (shattered chime, empty hands, sunlit wreckage). Pressure coheres under the Causal lens; the glass-orchids shattering and books bleeding ink viscerally render consequences. One credible loss (her life's work) alters the final stance from curation to mourning.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: restore the archive before it burns at dawn. The ticking clock (emissaries arrive at dawn, "she had minutes") applies clear pressure. One meaningful tightening: the inkwell shatters, indigo mist seals the scrolls, and the torches gutter out—Elara's action (singing in the harmonic gaps) forecloses the path of passive scholarship and forces her to trust her voice. The cost is visible: a decade of mistrust, the shattered inkwell, and the risk of repeating her past mistake. Agency is present, though the emissaries' passive retreat (torches guttering) undercuts the felt resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to reveal the machinist's hidden compassionate design—is signaled early and drives all beats. One meaningful tightening: Liora's walk-away option is articulated, then foreclosed when she lays the blueprint on the table, a protagonist-driven reversal that narrows her social future. The elders' initial resistance creates external pressure, and her choice trades valley safety doctrine for a riskier, gentler system. Cost is legible: "Let them see… Let them hear…" she stakes her reputation and the valley's immediate safety on an untested theory.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: whether Elias can trust again (externalized in sending the pigeon to Luca). The meteorite letter and Madame Holloway's observation create one meaningful tightening—he lies about the ledgers, then commits to the flight. The pigeon's return with sheet music delivers a decisive shift, foreclosing his isolationist stance with felt cost (the rusty hum, years of silence broken). Minor: the middle beat (Madame's interruption) briefly stalls rather than escalates, and Luca's motivations remain off-page, reducing antagonistic friction slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (find the missing child) and tightens when Elias intuits she's beyond the maze. The corn-husk note ("center isn't the middle") forces a tactical pivot to the sinkhole, and his descent is an agency-driven choice that forecloses simple rescue. Cost is present but muted—Elias's internal resistance to joining her "threshold" world dissolves quickly in the firefly beat without visible struggle, softening the escalation's bite.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—Elara seeking "the rhythm of belonging"—is signaled early but remains abstract and never faces a concrete on-page test. Kael's arrival introduces the possibility of connection, yet no reversal or tightening forces Elara to choose between competing goods or pay a visible price. The shared exhale and jellyfirefly surge are accumulative texture, not escalation under pressure. By sunrise, Elara stays and Kael leaves, but this separation is presented as mutual acceptance rather than a choice that narrows options or forecloses a live alternative with dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: recover missing memory-pieces before they fade. The bird's "hurry" and "time was a thief here" inject urgency. One meaningful tightening occurs when the shard cuts her thumb and she realizes "the missing pieces were inside her all along," which narrows options and shifts her stance from searcher to vessel. Cost is legible in "her heart heavier." But the stakes are abstract and the turn feels announced rather than forced by prior pressure; no live tradeoff or foreclosed path tests her commitment on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (serenade monotony by orchestrating serendipity) is signaled early and tightens through calculated incorporation of environmental variables. Lior's agency—timing the note to the torch flare, weaving the gull's cry—drives escalation under the Accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening occurs when the crowd's collective gasp harmonizes with his final arpeggio, validating his method. However, the moth-woman's challenge is deflected verbally rather than forcing a visible trade-off or cost that alters his next move, capping the band.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—to inscribe a cosmic verse and "fledge"—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through image density and ritual progression rather than through reversals or narrowing options. No on-page tightening forces a trade-off; the protagonist moves toward her goal without impediment or visible price paid in the moment. The ending crystallizes her transformation but does not foreclose a live alternative or show a cost that alters tactics. Under the Accumulative lens, the piece deepens atmosphere but lacks a meaningful escalation that narrows choices.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: Elias's need to sustain meaning in the mundane ritual before the day's uncertainty. The stone drop deepens pressure—ripples become "noctilucent reckonings" that forecast tide generosity and wind turn—narrowing his options to accept what the patterns reveal. The reaching for the next stone at closure is agency as endurance, foreclosing hope that the ritual might end. One tightening is sufficient for this length; visible cost (continuing despite the daughter's absence) is on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: how to translate pain and reconnect with Lila without cutting her. The ex-wife's call tightens options by delivering an ultimatum, and Elias's opening of the box is a reversal that narrows his path from avoidance to offering. The drawing and photo constitute agency under pressure, forecloses the path of silence, and the descent marks a visible cost (leaving the relic behind). Escalation is driven by protagonist choice. Weakness: the fire backstory, while emotionally charged, remains summary; the reader never sees the crew's loss on the page, reducing its tactical weight in the present conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—"puzzling out new equations for hope"—is signaled early but remains abstract and never faces an on-page test with cost. Pressure accumulates texturally (decorations, gauge needle, tide rising) but does not tighten options or force a trade-off. The "revitalized" beat offers a shift in description (kelp into gold, shells hum, driftwood into wings) yet is not driven by Liora's agency or prior causality; it reads as a coincidental transformation. No reversal or deepening narrows her path; she sketches, arranges, laughs, and releases without renouncing or choosing between competing goods. The final image gestures at openness ("the next trial, the next balloon") but costs nothing visible.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can reconcile with his family's trapped memories and his own role in that legacy—is signaled early and tightens when he finds his mother's face in the negative, escalates when he hears his own name through the sealed door, and culminates in the mural completion that transforms the corridor's echo. The tightening is meaningful: the door "groaned open" after he burns the varnish, forcing confrontation with the shrine. Visible cost: he sits, spills negatives "like confessions," completes the mural through dawn, and walks away with "burden of legacy...no longer a chain, but a thread"—a renunciation that forecloses returning to passive listening. One micro-turn (the door's disappearance) reads convenient rather than earned by his prior agency, softening the final price slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Liora's ongoing trade in borrowed heartbeats and possibilities, knowing every vision steals from another—is signaled early and operates throughout. One meaningful deepening occurs: the heartbeat unravels, the woman receives her vision, the soldier will forget, and Liora walks away empty-handed, a pattern she repeats. Yet this is presented as routine rather than a turn that narrows options; the stakes are declared (the cost to the soldier, the woman's repeated payments) but not tested by a choice that forecloses a live path. The city "needs its mirages" and Liora needs "the hush before the next ringing," but no on-page pressure forces her to alter tactics or endure a new cost.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (treaty signing vs. futility) is signaled immediately. Escalation tightens through Kael's reach toward the blade, Veyra's invocation of his past words, and his final trembling signature—one meaningful choice that forecloses the option of immediate violence. The cost is legible: "his voice was already unraveling, already human" and Veyra's acknowledgment "You'll break this one too." Agency drives the turn; the signing is earned by prior causality. No second reversal is required at this length, and the Accumulative lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake: preserving the egg as counterpoint to erasure. The piece offers one meaningful deepening—Elias shifts from hoarding absence to releasing presence—but the escalation is muted: placing the egg entails no visible trade-off (no one threatens to discover him, no physical or social cost materializes on the page). The act is declared "absurd, pointless" and "no one would ever know," undercutting felt cost. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure accumulates through imagery but does not tighten options or impose a legible price at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—defying the lullaby of conformity by freeing the echoes—is signaled early but never tightened by a live cost or competing pressure. The three threads dissolve in sequence without escalation; no reversal tests Liora's commitment, and the sanctuary gates seal *after* she walks away, removing agency from the closure beat. The ending declares freedom and laughter but does not dramatize a forfeited path or visible price; coincidence (threads already loosened for the next courtesan) replaces protagonist cost.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—exploring ethical storytelling through puppet shows—is signaled but remains abstract. One meaningful tightening occurs: the miner's accusation prompts Elias's decision to expose the seams. However, the confrontation is summarized ("Tonight's performance had gone wrong"), not dramatized, so the reversal lacks on-page immediacy. The cost of the new approach is conceptual and forward-facing rather than felt in the present. Agency is present (renunciation of precision) but the price is not legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—honoring the forgotten migration—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the wing is knotted into the spiral, but the escalation is conceptual rather than felt; Lior faces no visible trade-off or narrowing of options. The resolution (gathering new materials) restates the opening stance without a dramatized cost that forecloses a path. Agency is present but does not alter tactics or stakes on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: preserve forgotten names while forgiving herself for prior silence. The tightening occurs when Elira unravels and reconfigures the rope, threading the card's perforations into its core—an irreversible act that transforms the names from static echoes into "living heat." This narrows options (the card dissolves, foreclosing physical preservation) and reweights the cost (she must let go to preserve). The sanctum's trembling and the aurora's response provide external pressure that coheres under the Accumulative lens. Agency is clear: her decision to reconfigure drives the escalation and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Lior's quest to understand why paths choose walkers—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens when the terminal commands "INTERPRET THE DREAMER BEFORE THE DREAM INTERPRETS YOU," then escalates as the film shows dream-Lior being chosen, forcing Lior to confront her role. The storm's thrumming synchronizes with her pulse, and her choice to reach toward it (not the dream or past) narrows options. Cost is visible in the wafer seal turning to ash and her relinquishing the need for answers. However, the escalation is primarily Accumulative rather than a sharp reversal; the single tightening (film revelation) does its job, but the final run feels more like lyric release than a high-stakes trade-off with legible consequences that foreclose a named alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—decoding the tile to understand its message—is signaled early and tightens through the three-night mapping and the threshold hesitation. The descent and altar placement provide one meaningful deepening that changes knowledge under the Accumulative lens. Agency is present (pressing the tile, kneeling in recognition) but the cost is conceptual rather than visceral: no live option is visibly foreclosed, and the "devotion too vast for numbers" remains abstract. The piece coheres but lacks a sharp trade-off or visible price that would elevate pressure into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—shedding resentment versus holding Kael responsible—is signaled early and tightens through Lior's micro-choices: breaking the pin (renunciation), dialogue with the ghost that tests his stance, then pressing the pin back (a reversal) before the final release. The escalation operates via accumulative pressure rather than external antagonist, consistent with the inferred lens. Cost is visible: Lior lets the box fall, Kael becomes solid "for the first time in years," and they walk out together, foreclosing the old grievance. One minor gap: the sanctuary's dissolution and "world outside realigned" moment feels slightly convenience-plotted, as if the environment rewards the internal shift without requiring a tactical trade-off on Lior's part.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—escaping memory and achieving reunion with the lost brother—is signaled early. The sextant's repair through synchronized breathing constitutes one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens, and the orchard's transformation tightens pressure by making the abstract concrete. However, escalation relies on accumulation of atmosphere rather than a dramatized choice that forecloses a live option with visible cost. The protagonist's agency at closure is passive ("let the fog take him") rather than a decision that tests competing goods or unavoidable harms, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: bridging the rift with the daughter by understanding why she left. One clear tightening: the mender digs for the root, finds the box, reads the note—pressure narrows to the whispered question and the sprout's accusatory reply. The apple-bite at the end is protagonist agency with visible cost (breaking their own compliance). Escalation is Accumulative: the mender's persistence deepens as the orchard "hums," the seed pulses, the sprout points. The final reconfiguration—untying the ribbon, binding it to their wrist—closes a live option (clinging to old wisdom) with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to pursue forbidden knowledge and how to use it—is signaled early. Veyra rejects documentation (curator #1) and destruction (curator #2), choosing curation for the next inquirer. This is a tightening under the Accumulative lens, but the pressure never forecloses a live option with felt cost: she steps through the door, finds the museum intact, smiles, and catalogs. The orchard's approval ("silent approval") and the pistachio shell cameo are atmospheric rather than costly. No price paid, no path closed.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—reaching the Library before the traveler—is signaled early and tightens when the traveler blocks the aisle with the pocket watch ticking backward. Elias's renegotiation attempt ("Give me the Library, and I'll give you the name you lost") is a clear on-page choice driven by his resourceful exploitation. The reversal when the Library "wasn't empty. It was *listening*" reweights the entire pursuit, and the traveler's lunge past Elias into the chasm escalates to visible cost: Elias loses the diary's contents and becomes a gap himself. Agency is present in Elias's theft, manipulation, and final step forward, though coincidence (the traveler arriving "finally") initiates the sequence. The cost—erasure from his own memory—forecloses his life's work with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—recapturing the erased twin—is signaled early and tightens when Liora tears the page from the ledger, a choice that narrows options (irreversible destruction of the owner's record). The final decision to help other lost souls instead of escaping immediately raises the cost, but the stakes themselves do not escalate further; the new goal appears rather than emerging from prior pressure. Agency is present (tearing the page, speaking the story) but the turn feels declarative more than forced by mounting opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—translate confusion into clarity via the door—is signaled early and pressure tightens through the rope's reweaving. The third braid locking with "a sound like a sigh" provides one meaningful escalation. Yet the resolution hinges on Elara's breath reforming the ledger names, a moment that reads more lyric than causal; luck or symbolic convenience rather than protagonist agency drives the figure's nod and the door's disappearance. The price (not recording the event) is conceptually present but not felt as a live forfeiture that narrows her options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (preserving the bloom of hush as the "last unbroken verse") is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening: the bloom unfolds, the beings recoil, then Eldrin chooses invitation over weapon, narrowing his stance with visible cost (mutual listening replaces solitary control). The final act—pressing the stone to his chest—is Eldrin's decision, and the beings' harmonization follows as earned consequence. Agency is clear; coincidence complicates (the ice groans, fissure splits) but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake signaled early: rekindle the beacon to align coincidences and find meaning in collapse. One meaningful tightening occurs when the prism mends and the beacon flares, narrowing her interpretation from "bringing the past back" to "seeing the shape of it." The realization that "the stars had aligned…and for one thistle-blown moment, the world had meant something" reconfigures her endurance—she'll climb again because "if the beacon could flare once, it could flare twice." Agency is decision with visible cost: she chooses solitary repetition over despair. No antagonist required; pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—sculpting identity from collective memory—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through her method (measuring shadows, tracing memory), the Spear's shadow-twitch complication, and the vision that reweights her approach. The tightening is internal: she moves from trying to dam the river to letting it flow, which narrows her former tactic and forecloses the archivist-as-sculptor path. Agency is renunciation with a felt cost (abandoning the chase), though the price could be sharper on the page to enter the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—defying the cursed starless sky—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when Liora climbs despite village warnings. The rocket launch is a protagonist-driven reversal that triggers the fortress trembling and bloom cascade, narrowing options (she must descend or face villagers). The cost is visible: her pockets lighter, the kerosene knot's purpose fulfilled, and the world "heavier than it had been yesterday. But so was she." Agency (lighting fires where the sky turned its back) drives the turn. One meaningful escalation suffices at this length, and the price—walking away from cheers, leaving the fortress—charges the final image under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether the chronicler can offer the fisherman a path through grief—is signaled early and remains coherent under the accumulative lens. The cicada's warming and the chronicler's vision of the fisherman's future constitute one meaningful deepening that reweights his options. However, the chronicler's own agency is passive; she observes, understands, and gives, but no on-page choice narrows her own path or imposes a felt trade-off. The fisherman's departure at dawn and the hermit crab's new shell provide closure participation, but the pressure remains more atmospheric than escalatory. One tightening is present, but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: escape the bunker's "coffin" to sprout. Pressure escalates across three inversions: observation, climb, harvest. The third inversion introduces the bloom and gilded palm, which immediately unlock the bunker's collapse—effective tightening but slightly telescoped. The father's "They're coming" arrives too late to create friction; it declares urgency without on-page consequence. The child's final choice (pressing palm to wall, sprouting) is protagonist-driven with visible cost (father abandoned, bunker destroyed), but the rapid endgame keeps this shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is legible: Elias seeks to teach silence how to comfort, the passenger carries unspoken sorrow. Pressure operates through accumulation (dial turns, vial shifts, sound modulation) rather than overt conflict, fitting the textural lens. However, escalation is minimal—Elias performs his established routine without a meaningful tightening or choice that narrows options. The passenger's exhale and departure register as relief, not a trade-off with visible cost. No on-page reversal or deepening alters tactics; the terrace drifts as it always has.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.9)
    One dominant stake (reach the throne before sunrise, later reframed as unmake it) is signaled early and drives the sequence. The tightening occurs when Elsin realizes the throne must be destroyed, not claimed—a meaningful pressure point. However, the escalation is knowledge-driven rather than choice-constrained; she faces no on-page obstacle, rival, or internal temptation resisting the final act. The cost (foregoing ascension, vanishing into myth) is conceptual and arrives without a dramatized trade-off or visible loss of a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Lior will remain in self-imposed isolation or release the shadows—is signaled early and coheres. Pressure tightens when the shadow touches his wrist and the doorknocker offers passage. The turn (striking the ring, stepping through) narrows options with a felt cost, though the trade-off could be sharper on the page. One meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens is present.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: whether Lina will engage with or break the "quantum promise" loop. The first message introduces the choice; the second pressures her to "translate" pressure; her reply tests leverage. The tightening occurs when she twists the bolt and sees the *Eidolon* suspended, forcing her to choose between becoming the loop or breaking it. Her decision to squeeze until bleeding and unthread the concept narrows options and produces visible cost (blood, empty hands, diamond as residue). Under the situational lens, coincidence (finding the bolt, receiving messages) complicates but does not resolve; Lina's agency—squeezing, choosing not to check the final message—drives closure.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the hidden truth to end his failure—is signaled early and tightens when the letters arrive, then deepens when the mirror reflection corrects his approach. The reversal (striking the wrong note → tuning the wave) narrows options and the resolution depends on Elias's shift from seeking to listening. However, the escalation is more conceptual than visceral; the standing-wave mechanism and mirrored guidance feel externally provided rather than hard-won through protagonist agency under pressure, capping the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—breaking the knight's withdrawal and speaking again—is signaled early. One meaningful turn occurs when he breaks the gauntlet seal, but the escalation is more atmospheric accumulation (threads tightening, program flaring) than a protagonist-driven decision that forecloses a live alternative with visible cost. The siege as "performance" reframes backstory, yet the knight's agency in the greenhouse remains reactive to mystical pressures rather than a choice between competing goods. The program's command "UNSNAP" serves as external prompt rather than internally contested calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: whether Elias will honor forgotten lives or let them remain unread. The button discovery tightens options (investigate or file away), the genealogical match deepens commitment (Alan Hendricks's MIA status makes Daniel's claim concrete), and the mailing act forecloses passivity with visible cost—Elias invests research time, emotional labor, and the risk that Daniel will never receive it. Agency is clear: Elias's decision to send the envelope is his own, shaped by his file-closure trauma. No antagonist needed; pressure coheres through the weight of systemic indifference and Elias's internal drive. The final move to Maria's file demonstrates sustained commitment rather than one-off heroism, raising the stakes quietly.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (preserve erased histories against Council revision) is signaled early and tightens when Rook's voice announces the archive will burn tomorrow, narrowing Lena's window and forcing the match-and-ledger infiltration. That tightening is protagonist-driven and forecloses her safer archivist identity with on-page cost (quits, becomes fugitive). The resolution avoids convenience; her theft seeds the Quiet Rebellion. However, the escalation path is straightforward—one major turn rather than compounding reversals—and the felt price, while present, could be sharper in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—to hush the prophecy—is signaled early, but escalation is shallow: the grotto "resists" with thickening mist and a face in the prism, yet the protagonist's tactics do not change, and he simply plays "the last phrase" to collapse the whisper without visible cost or trade-off. The prophecy's return as a slip of paper is a plot reversal, not an earned tightening driven by protagonist agency. No meaningful pressure point narrows options; the protagonist's departure and return feel cyclical rather than a deepening that forecloses a path. Coincidence (the paper's presence) complicates but does not resolve, yet it also does not force a stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—decode the leaves' message—is signaled early and pursued through the speck-as-key revelation. One tightening occurs when Liora places the speck atop her seed tower and the arbor responds with glowing runes, narrowing her options to climb or remain. However, escalation is atmospheric rather than driven by her agency: the monuments melt and dissolve on their own, the arbor forms the ladder without her forcing it. The final choice to eat the sapling leaf and accept transformation lacks visible friction or trade-off; no live alternative is dramatized. Cost is implied (she becomes part-arbor) but not legible as a sacrifice or foreclosed path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: finding a reason to stop fixing what can't be fixed, signaled early. Escalation under Accumulative lens proceeds through object encounters (compass, ledger command "Improvise") that reweight his understanding. The tinkerer's agency drives the resolution: he strips the gear, repurposes it, and stops winding the clock—a renunciation with visible cost. One meaningful deepening when he grasps "You've been collecting the wrong kind of time." The waterfall voice feels convenient rather than pressure-born, slightly undercutting escalation integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is Liora's need to understand Veyra's work and her own rivalry-driven identity. Feeding the coin into the crucible is a clear escalation that narrows options (risk of ash vs. understanding) and the vial's memory deepens the pressure. The tightening is meaningful and the cost—accepting the weight, beginning her own transmutation—lands on the page. Minor issue: the workshop epilogue adds a second transmutation beat that restates rather than extends the prior closure, slightly flattening the earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: help the lost soul find peace, signaled when Liora hears the broken laughter and pursues it. The tightening occurs when she realizes the soul wants "to be the joke, not the punchline"—a shift from standard release to integration of joy. This reweights her method and narrows her toolkit to the petals and shared laughter. However, no live alternative is dramatized and rejected; Liora's path feels inevitable rather than chosen under pressure. The joke exchange and resulting chorus provide emotional resolution, but the protagonist faces no visible cost or trade-off that alters her later options. Escalation is present but gentle, fitting the Accumulative lens, yet lacking the sharpness that would push into the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering/enacting the mathematics of mercy through surviving penance—is signaled early and tightens when the basin vision forces Liran to confront the interrogator's accusation and his grandmother's injunction. The pillars' harmonic resonance narrows options by imposing physical ordeal, and the strap snapping marks a decisive release with visible cost (the penance completed, the body "whole" but the mind "a ledger of absences"). Agency is present in kneeling, bracing, and choosing to listen at the end, though the forest itself applies much of the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—finding an anchor to ground Lior's intuitive gift—is signaled early and tightens when the lens fragment calls to her, then deepens when Elara Vey's name and log entry reveal a kindred "between" story. The painter's directive to "unfasten the past" and Lior's slotting the lens into her coat constitute agency under the Accumulative lens, but the escalation is textural (density increase, motif return) rather than a narrowing of live options with visible tradeoff. The cost is largely conceptual: Lior accepts the burden of carrying overlooked histories, but no on-page forfeiture or visible sacrifice appears—she gains validation and purpose without losing a competing path. One meaningful deepening (the lens revealing Elara's inscription, the market lights flaring) is sufficient for this length, yet the pressure reads more as accumulation than irreversible choice.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—discovering what the ceiling hides—is signaled early and tightens when Elias realizes the cracks are a door, then deepens when he understands the mechanism's purpose (pausing, not ending, the circus). His agency drives the turn: he chooses to unmake rather than repair, with visible cost (destroying the preserved laugh, ending the mechanism). The ghosts' watching creates secondary pressure. One meaningful reversal occurs when "The cracks weren't from decay. They were seams"—reframing the problem and foreclosing repair as an option. The price paid (the shattered laugh, the mechanism's destruction) is concrete and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.2)
    One dominant stake—whether to release the destabilizing whisper—is signaled early and drives the arc. The tightening moment ("the rupture came...from Elias himself") narrows options and leads to his dissolution, but the escalation is asserted rather than forced by a prior constraint or trade-off. No on-page reversal tests his commitment; the library's collapse and his smile suggest earned closure, yet the cost (his vanishing into light) feels decorative rather than a visible forfeiture of a live option or relationship. Agency is present but the price legibility is low.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—Elias's need to force the archaeologists to see the Republic as something more than a "failed experiment"—is signaled early and drives the escalation. The shard's use narrows his options (it will turn to dust), and the vision itself is a meaningful tightening that reweights the dispute. The cost is legible: the shard is destroyed, and Elias stays behind while the archaeologists leave. However, the pressure is largely internal and philosophical; Taelis offers minimal opposition beyond one line of accusation, and the "dispute" never escalates into a concrete on-page confrontation with stakes that feel urgent or reversible. The escalation reads more as accumulative texture than causal tightening, which fits the inferred Hybrid lens but limits the score because the protagonist's agency at the peak moment (triggering the vision) feels like an inevitability rather than a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: whether to repair (or release) the stone's hunger and reclaim stolen light. Pressure accumulates as Elias recognizes the covenant, the stone's desire, and his complicity in "stealing time from entropy." The key tightening occurs when he decides to "unwind something older" and lets the stone consume him, forecloses his life with visible cost (erasure by light). Agency is clear: Elias chooses sacrifice despite the voice warning "You can't fix this." The escalation is textural—density and metaphoric charge rise—and the cost (his dissolution) is unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (find the place where explanations fail) is signaled early via the compass and father's coordinates. Escalation: he walks the catwalks → follows compass to cliffs → enters lagoon → wades deeper → touches arch → suspended in chamber → hears father's voice → drops hand. The tightening is one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens: each beat adds density until the threshold moment forces the renunciation. Agency is Elias's hand-drop, a refusal that forecloses further delving with visible cost (burning notes, ending the search). No coincidence resolves; the compass leads him to non-answer, and he accepts it.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: reach Port Veyra and sell the driftwood. One meaningful tightening occurs when the GPS fails and the storm traps Elias at the archway, forcing him to engage the lantern slide and carve. The slide's light "threading through the storm" and the subsequent path reveal constitute a deepening rather than a causal reversal—pressure accumulates via the mystical loom metaphor rather than narrowing options through protagonist agency. Cost is present (he loses the slide and GPS) but feels more like mystical exchange than a trade-off Elias consciously weighs. The carving choice alters his immediate tactic but the agency feels more reactive than self-determined.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why flowers bloom at night—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through Liora's repeated engagement with the postcards and window, deepening when she sees the preserved flowers and realizes the flowers open "because the world was finally still enough to hear them." This tightening reweights her stance but does not force a high-stakes choice with immediate visible cost; instead, she renounces painting in favor of listening, an act of Earned Stasis. The escalation is coherent under the Accumulative lens but lacks a sharp reversal or forced trade-off that would raise the score into the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: uncovering Liora's buried truth versus the Revision Board's erasure. The parley-via-shells is a meaningful tightening that narrows options, and the officers' retreat raises the question of release. Yet the escalation is driven by coincidence (officers appear, then leave) rather than Elias's agency; he waits and arranges shells, but their retreat is unexplained, undercutting earned closure. The final act—releasing diary pages—feels symbolic rather than a costly trade-off, and no live consequence is shown for the choice to "set free" versus archive.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—reimagining the cove—is signaled early and tightens when the alchemist rejects comfort and chooses "conception." The bottle warming and the return of sensory life (cinnamon, laughter, hammer) mark one meaningful pressure turn. However, escalation is gentle: coincidence (the bottle "had been waiting") enables rather than complicates, and the final act (releasing the bottle, turning toward work) is acceptance rather than a contested tradeoff. Agency is present but the cost—what he forfeits by succeeding—is not dramatized on the page, capping the band.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to record or renounce the prophecy—is signaled when the Akkadian voice emerges and Elias recognizes it as prophecy ("Prophecy was never intentional"). The piece operates under an Accumulative lens, so escalation reads as density increase: the voice returns closer ("You are the hinge"), Elias's hands shake (70 years of steadiness broken), and he chooses to sketch his fear rather than the prophecy itself, then commits to burial. One meaningful tightening narrows options with felt cost. Agency is renunciation (he will not record it, "that would be hubris"), and the cost is legible in the repeated phrase "But the garden would remember." No reversals are required under this lens; the deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: prevent the vortex from taking the seeds as it took her mother. Pressure escalates through one meaningful tightening—ice shattering, vortex howling, roots erupting—that narrows options to a single charged act (pressing the seed). The cost is legible: the chick transforms, the vortex quiets but will return, and Liora accepts the cyclical inheritance. Agency is strong (her decision to push the seed despite the vortex's wail). Minor gap: the method's success feels somewhat convenient, as we don't see her fail or adapt tactics mid-attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: ensure the siren sings true to give the valley time before the solstice storm. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias discovers the warped aftertone and has "minutes before zero hour"—options narrow to immediate action. His reweaving of the bindings is protagonist-driven agency with visible cost (the abbot would call it reckless). The test-then-fix-then-confirm structure provides escalation under the Causal lens. Price is legible: he works alone against the clock, risking a failed warning if his unorthodox method fails.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake (finding connection/meaning in cosmic solitude) is signaled early but never tested by competing pressure. The meteor shower arrives as gift rather than dilemma; Eli's choice to "let it in" despite alarms faces no genuine cost—the station improves, the lantern heals, and he departs empowered. No reversal or tightening narrows his options; escalation is atmospheric accumulation without tactical friction. The star's agency (it waits, it responds, it merges) displaces protagonist decision-making at the crucial turn.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: breaking/honoring the covenant and the beekeeper's silence. The ghosts' arrival and box-opening provide one meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens; the beekeeper's exhaled breath and decision to open foreclose his path of absolute silence with legible cost (departure, transformation passed to others). Pressure coheres. Minor cap: the protagonist's agency tilts passive—ghosts initiate, he responds—though his exhaled breath and lifting the comb are micro-choices that enable closure.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding time's texture—is signaled but remains abstract. Elias climbs the silo and discovers artifacts without meaningful resistance or narrowing options. The revelation about Marlen "unraveling" time arrives as exposition, not a turn earned by prior pressure. No on-page choice forces a trade-off or forecloses a path with visible cost; the ending asserts new stakes ("work to do") rather than resolving dramatized conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake: discovering/articulating beauty in incompletion, signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through collecting acts (feather, kite, string) and writing attempts, tightening when the poem "felt alive—not because it was finished, but because it wasn't." The poet's choice to retrieve the kite and later refuse to write the shiver are agency beats that narrow options. Cost is present but oblique—he forecloses capture in favor of fraying—which registers as renunciation with felt weight scaled to this length. One clear deepening under the Accumulative lens; no reversals required.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: proving interspecies respect through remodeling, against temple doctrine. Pressure tightens in the western-quadrant beat when elders demand uprooting for symmetry and Elira binds the sapling anyway, narrowing her options (she has six months; she spends them on heresy). The diary's final line—"We were never meant to outlast the things we love. Only to tend them."—and Tomas picking up the wire articulate cost: the work will take years, and Elira won't see it. Escalation is modest but coherent under the Accumulative lens: her defiance, the sapling's turn toward the pillar, Tomas's conversion. One meaningful tightening (bind the sapling) and one visible cost (her death, his inheritance of years) meet the length requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—proving the pilgrimage hypothesis and answering "where do you belong?"—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the terminal asks "What do you miss?" and her answer unlocks the next layer. However, the escalation is more atmospheric than agential; Elara doesn't face a forced choice or trade-off. The figure's arrival and the galaxy hologram feel like invitations rather than obstacles. The cost (her lab gathering dust, no return) is narrated after the fact rather than weighed on the page. Agency is present but the pressure doesn't narrow her options; she never considers refusing.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—letting a garden reclaim a battlefield—is signaled early and sustained, but it faces no meaningful opposition or tightening on the page. The coachman performs his ritual without complication, error, or reversal; no beat narrows his options or forces a trade-off. The piece accumulates texture (birds, seeds, tide) but does not escalate pressure under the Accumulative lens because the final reconfiguration is told in distant summary rather than dramatized through a choice or renunciation with visible cost in the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—following the cylinder's message to find the source—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when Rook locates the dome, but the final beat hinges on the vines pulling him in rather than a choice that narrows his options with visible cost. The cylinder's voice and the leaf act as guides, not obstacles; no reversal tests his commitment. The settlement's rules ("no digging too deep") are mentioned but never enforce consequence. One meaningful deepening occurs (discovery of her bones), but coincidence (leaf melts wax, vines pull) resolves rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—turning confusion into exploration—is signaled early and tightens through the anomaly's appearance and Lira's decision to leap. The compass needle's snap into place and the sketch's alignment create one meaningful reversal that narrows options. However, escalation feels more atmospheric than choice-driven: the light "envelops" Lira passively rather than her seizing it through tactical struggle. The cost (leaving the station, risking the void) is implied but not deeply felt on the page—no visible trade-off or foreclosed alternative that tests commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—retrieving the sundial lid to restore the sky/honor the master—signals early and tightens through the swap sequence. The Keeper's confrontation and Lirien's counter-offer ("the chance to embrace it") narrow options, and her pressing palm to the window before the exchange adds one meaningful pressure point. Closure shows visible cost: Lirien steps into the unknown with open arms, the sky begins mending, but the ending's escalation is more Accumulative (pattern completion) than causal squeeze. The Keeper's transformation lacks a visible price on his side—what does giving the lid cost him beyond trembling hands?

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—preserving memory against the penumbra—is signaled early but never dramatized as a live trade-off. No on-page reversal narrows Liora's options or forces her to sacrifice one goal for another. The penumbra's "hunger" is described but does not escalate pressure; it simply "recoils" at the end without earned causality. The final "walking" is poetic but lacks visible cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (reclaim buried talent vs. sustain refusal) is signaled early and tightens when Elias realizes "the language wasn't for speaking. It was for *planting*." That insight narrows his options to one on-page act: writing the first truth. The pain-of-remembering thread and the feather clue create accumulative pressure. However, the final sequence offers little overt friction—Elias steps through the door, picks up the pen, and begins without a dramatized moment of hesitation or trade-off, which keeps the peak beat from fully testing commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) is signaled early and pursued throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when he kneels and the metal absorbs his regret, narrowing options. However, the tutor's agency is passive—the village thaws because he weaves threads, but no live choice between competing goods or unavoidable harms tests his commitment. The girl's checkmate feels like coincidence rather than a consequence of his prior decisions. Cost is felt (he laughs, breaking the ice around his heart) but not legible as a tactical forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: expose the elders' false absolution before the ritual completes. Pressure escalates when the chant begins, Liora climbs against the clock, and her whispered accusation falters the ritual—each move narrows options. The spire's shattering and the elders' screams provide visible consequence. One gap: Liora's agency in the climax is assertion-heavy ("She didn't watch... she knew") rather than a dramatized decision with visible cost. The "forged hush" and her resumption of carving suggest Earned Stasis, but the emotional or tactical price of potentially causing deaths is told, not shown in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—repair the statue to conjure meaning before the sea claims the workshop—is signaled early and pressure tightens through the ticking clock ("three breaths left, maybe four"). The alchemist's choice to press the charm, slide the third key, and step forward demonstrates agency that forecloses retreat; the cost is legible in the dissolution of "all the half-finished repairs of a lifetime." Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening occurs when the statue's invitation shifts the alchemist from passive mending to active self-sacrifice. Minor issue: the exact nature of the trade-off (what the alchemist loses versus gains) remains more symbolic than tactically clear, which slightly softens the felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—keeping the promise to hide the shell "where the water forgets to move"—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through Elias's years of painting grief, the mirror's crack opening the caves, and his wrong turn leading to the oasis. One meaningful tightening occurs when he places the shell in the pool and sees his mother's reflection, narrowing his path to the final renunciation of the surface world. The cost is legible: he abandons the village, burns his paintings, and chooses "temporary eternity" over linear time. However, the escalation is textural rather than confrontational; no external antagonist tests the choice, and the leap itself is unopposed.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—proving whispers travel farther—is signaled early and tightens when the boats turn, then deepens when Harkin pockets the cork with recognition. Escalation is accumulative: vibrations → exhaled scent → boats turning → Harkin's transformation → Elias no longer needing the cork. Cost is legible: Elias must relinquish the proof and step into embodied action. Minor gap: the fishermen's muttering about dreams is recounted rather than dramatized, softening the pressure slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: Lena's need to chart loss and guide the drowned home. The piece delivers one meaningful tightening—tonight she moves from recording to directing ("Start walking")—that narrows her role from passive receiver to active navigator with visible cost (her solitude, her ache). The phone calls escalate in clarity with lunar phases, and the final act (hanging up, lighting a candle, rolling fresh paper) forecloses her prior isolation. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; the maps function as both tactic and constraint. The reversal is modest but earned, and the cost (years of waiting, the weight lifting) is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: survive scrutiny without revealing the eye. The warlord's arrival tightens pressure; Lior's smearing of truffle pulp over the eye is an on-page tactical choice driven by his occlusion skill. Burial is protagonist-driven renunciation that forecloses future use with visible cost (he climbs away, "didn't look back"). One meaningful escalation and a final choice that narrows options permanently.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—decoding the stranger's gesture—is signaled early and tightens through investigation: the flower steeping reveals "fragments of a face," Elias grasps that "memories weren't his," and he chooses to pass them on. Under accumulative lens, the deepening reweights the boutonnière from relic to vessel. However, the key realization arrives through summary reflection ("Elias understood now") rather than a pressure-test choice that forecloses a live option with visible friction. The cost—letting the memory go—is legible at closure but not fought for on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—find the doorway and fulfill the promise—is signaled early and tightens as the creek rises. One clear escalation occurs when the chip flares and the ants guide him to the fissure, narrowing options. The door's voice ("You promised you'd come back") charges the peak choice with visible cost: stepping through seals the cavern and forecloses return. However, the resolution introduces the woman and the house without prior friction; this convenience deflates the earned pressure. The promise is kept, but the final image (wet ink on the map) reads as symbolic rather than a tactical consequence of prior choices.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (unravel recurring dream / fulfill childhood bargain) signals early and tightens when the memory surfaces mid-scene, revealing the climb as covenant rather than curiosity. The queen's agency drives escalation: she burns the priest's warning, climbs alone, and dips her hand into the fissure despite the pain. One meaningful deepening occurs when starlight triggers the childhood memory, narrowing her path to acceptance. The cost is legible (throne lost, transformation irreversible), though the final act reads more as surrender to inevitability than a choice that wrestles with competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—Elias's drive to capture presence—is signaled early and tightens once when Liora reframes density as return rather than extraction. The jump "through" the moment functions as a crystallization under the Accumulative lens, but agency feels more like mutual surrender than a choice that forecloses a path; I see no visible tactical cost or trade-off on the page. The nexus "holds its breath," the fall is "weightless," and they land laughing—pressure dissipates rather than landing with a price. One meaningful deepening is present, but escalation under the chosen lens lacks bite at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—escape the chronicler loop—is signaled early and tightens when Younger arrives with an identical scroll. The burn decision is a meaningful reversal that narrows options (no more revisions possible). Agency is clear: Older offers the choice, Younger lights the match, Older walks outside. The cost is visible (scroll destroyed, role abandoned, hands no longer tremble) and forecloses the revision path. Accumulative pressure coheres through recursive imagery (scroll, grave, cabin) until the pattern breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake is Elias's search for meaning after sensory loss, signaled early. The woman's arrival introduces a micro-reversal (she seeks understanding, not repair), and Elias's response narrows from "trying to reclaim" smell to "realize the absence itself was a kind of map." Under the Accumulative lens, this is a deepening rather than an escalation. However, no live option is foreclosed: Elias does not choose to stop a former habit, refuse a path, or pay a visible price. The screw is interpreted, not tested under pressure, so agency remains observational.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—transforming scars into stories before the storm forces her hand—is signaled early and tightens once: when the rune for *unbinding* flares and the quill sheds its tip, Lian must press it to her oldest scar, softening the silvered line into "a thread of light." This tightening forecloses passivity and forces active renunciation of fear with visible cost (the quill loses its tip; she steps into the storm). Agency is clear: Lian carves, presses, traces, and whispers the rune's true name. However, the escalation reads as a single deepening rather than a layered narrowing of options; the storm "held its breath" but never truly threatens on the page, leaving the external pressure more atmospheric than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake is the overdue apology and the orchard's survival, signaled in the opening third. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara pours the perfume and its magic drags up "every unsent letter," forcing both characters into painful honesty ("It hurts" / "That means it's working"). The resolution—mutual planting—is earned by Mara's choice to step into the current and Elias's reciprocal touch of the tendril, with visible cost: the perfume is spent, the trees still fall, and both must begin again. Agency is clear, but the escalation is compact; a second micro-reversal (e.g., Elias initially refusing the bottle, then reconsidering when a tree shudders) would have added another pressure point and deepened the climb to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—unraveling cosmic illusions—is signaled early but never tightens into a trade-off with visible alternatives. The dictionary-tearing moment is the sole pressure point, yet it arrives without prior escalation or a cost that narrows later options; the witness simply succeeds. The voice's question ("Do you seek the beginning or the end?") is declared a test but never answered or dramatized as a dilemma. The ending asserts relief ("the weight... felt light") without showing what was sacrificed to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: whether to wind the clock and pull the ship through or release it, signaled early when the horizon wavers. Escalation is causal and protagonist-driven: Elias presses the key, counts, feels the warmth and smells copper, sees the ship split the horizon, stands in two places, then chooses to let go. The tightening is visible when the woman grabs his wrist and the cost is legible on the page: the ship vanishes, the new notch appears, and he smiles knowing gates can never be perfectly closed.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to accept her father's probability model or find "kindness" on "the other side of probability"—is signaled early and tightens when Lila chooses blue over gold, then again when she refuses to choose at all. The second lighting represents escalation: moving from binary selection to synthesis. The cost is legible in the final image: she walks away from the lantern (and implicitly the hospital vigil), gambling on a language her father would call nonsense. Under the Hybrid lens, this reads as one meaningful deepening that narrows her path with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: Elias helping the caller find the courage to "loop back" (try again). The piece tightens once when the caller cries and Elias offers "Try again tomorrow," narrowing immediate closure and reweighting the interaction from resolution to ongoing process. Agency is present in Elias's choice to hang up first, foreclosing further talk and affirming his role as operator who teaches process, not solution. Cost is felt in the caller's ragged crying and Elias's perpetual waiting, though the price is more atmospheric than sharply transactional. Under Accumulative lens, the tightening suffices; a second reversal is not required at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: regenerating the covenant through memory-work. One meaningful deepening: she moves from steeping memory passively to actively tracing the locket photo onto vellum and whispering the old words, which the harbor answers. The tightening is clear—her ritual forecloses passive grief and commits her to return—but the price (solitude, incompleteness, "not yet whole") is more implied than dramatized in a pivotal choice under immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—finding Carter/the cure—is signaled early and tightens through Lena's tactical choices (fix radio, trade story, follow Mira). The virologist-to-forger reveal narrows options and reframes the quest. The ending delivers conceptual cost: Lena relinquishes the rock and accepts that the cure isn't possession but circulation. One weakness: the ledger-of-names concept arrives late and doesn't face on-page resistance, so the final trade feels more thematic than pressure-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: find the stillpoint to navigate his uncharted grief. The quest proceeds through accumulation (trail of notes, ring warming, music stopping) but lacks a meaningful on-page tightening or trade-off. Elian encounters no obstacles, no wrong turns, no cost that forces him to renounce or endure—he simply unfolds toward the goal. The clearing's discovery and the bone's appearance feel granted rather than earned by protagonist agency. The final reconfiguration (grief mapped, path chosen) reads as Charged Poise under the Accumulative lens, but the pressure never escalates or narrows options; the journey is smooth and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can find meaning in past mistakes—is signaled early and deepens when the transmission rewrites his understanding ("The seeds were never wrong. The soil was"). Under the Accumulative lens, this moment tightens his stance. However, escalation is conceptual rather than pressured: the anomaly pulses, words appear, and Elias accepts the insight without visible resistance or trade-off. No live option is foreclosed on the page; the decision to "plant again" feels inevitable rather than earned through agency under duress. Cost is implied (years of correction abandoned) but not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—restoring forgotten songs—is signaled early and pressure tightens when the faceless stranger appears and "the harbor itself had flinched." The climax (waves rising, camera drinking the stranger) narrows options under the Accumulative lens, but agency is split between Elias's signing and Liora's camera with no clear protagonist choice that forecloses a path. The resolution ("we remembered them back") is told, not dramatized as a visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: protect the promise from weaponization. The discovery of the ledger and decision to burn it constitute one meaningful tightening with visible cost (he erases the names, including hers). However, the escalation is mostly reflective realization rather than antagonistic pressure or a forced trade-off. No on-page opposition complicates his choice; the fire is an unchallenged act. The cost is legible but the path to it lacks friction.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Lira reclaiming her mind from stolen memories—is signaled early and tightens through her drumming action. One meaningful deepening occurs: she moves from passive sabotage (humming off-key, drumming during scans) to active release (slapping the lagoon to free the memories). However, the escalation lacks visible cost or trade-off. No antagonist pressure materializes; the doctors are mentioned but never threaten on the page. The resolution ("her mind was her own") is asserted without showing what she risked or lost to achieve it, and coincidence (the garden's resonant properties) resolves the problem she did not help create.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—proving quiet persistence outlasts brute force—is signaled early and drives Lior's measured walk. The woman's challenge provides one meaningful tightening (navigate without raising voice to earn the unchanging map), but the escalation lacks a second beat where options narrow or a price is paid. Lior's success feels preordained; no live tactic fails, no loss alters his approach. The coin's use at the dent is a reversal in form but not in felt cost—Lior doesn't sacrifice or risk anything on-page to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—the boy's need to process shame and reconnect with his father—is signaled early and tightens through the guardian's pattern-weaving, which narrows his emotional options from coiled shame to eased tension. One meaningful turn: the boy kneels and touches the water, his breath steadying, his steps no longer dragging. The cost is visible: he leaves the crumpled note behind and must now face his father without the weight of unsaid words. The guardian's agency is renunciation (silence, waiting) with on-page cost (continued isolation). No antagonist required; the boy's internal pressure drives escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: saving the library. The piece accumulates pressure through coordinated displays, escalating to the council's noon arrival with hammers—a clear, irreversible threat. The foreman swinging his hammer is the peak tightening; when the filings sing and the workers lower their tools, options narrow with visible cost (the council's authority is undercut, the grotto's autonomy grows). Agency is distributed across Elias and his students but driven by Elias's plan. The cost at closure is legible: the library remains, but the grotto's "hungry" pulse suggests an uncontrolled consequence. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the synchronized displays and magnetic chains are causally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—Elias's pull toward transformation versus remaining on land—is signaled early and tightens when the whale calls and the scrimshaw vibrates. The dive is a clear decision that forecloses his terrestrial life with visible cost (dockworkers gasp, he leaves without looking back). However, the escalation is more atmospheric accumulation than a reversal or turn that narrows options; the pull is linear rather than conflicted. The whale and scrimshaw enable rather than resist, so pressure comes from Elias's own hesitation, which is underdramatized. Cost at closure is felt but could be sharper if the land or community had applied counter-pressure in a concrete beat.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (how to hold grief without performing or preserving it falsely) is signaled early and tightens when Lena mounts the rail, announces the scream, and delivers it—forecloses the Mandate's stillness with visible cost (the cracked mask, the burned tin). The whittling-lesson offer is a tactic shift that narrows options (no return to silent clutching). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: objects and gestures accumulate weight until the scream breaks the pattern. No antagonist required; the post-Mandate hush itself is the constraint. One reversal (scream) with a clear escalation path.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—striding through boundaries once thought sacred—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elira realizes the ban was about containment, not exclusion, which reframes her agency and drives her final act at the water's edge. The cost is visible in the ice fracturing and the elders' inevitable outcry, though the piece leans more on conceptual weight than on a dramatic reversal or trade-off between competing goods. Agency reads as decision and endurance, but the escalation under the Accumulative lens is more atmospheric than conflict-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Elias seeking connection and acceptance of his way of seeing—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens. One meaningful tightening occurs when Liora asks "What's next?" and Elias responds with a thorn (*patience*), crystallizing their mutual commitment. However, escalation is gentle; no live option is foreclosed with visible cost. The old woman's bargain (two paintings) is declared but not felt as a price that alters tactics or charges the ending image, and the phoenix serves as atmospheric backdrop rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering "the texture of connection"—is signaled early and remains coherent. One tightening occurs when the lens + resonator produces the unexpected hum, narrowing Liora's search to this specific method. However, agency is passive observation rather than decision under pressure; Liora adjusts the lens and follows the path without visible trade-offs or foreclosed options. The cost is told ("some pilgrimages weren't meant to be finished") rather than dramatized through a choice that narrows her tactics or forces a sacrifice scaled to this length.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (transforming solitary grief into communal teaching) is signaled early and tightens when Lena moves from making reliquary jewelry to making cranes with coordinates, then to tattooing herself, and finally to teaching a stranger. One meaningful tightening: the discovery of the copper flower shifts her from burial to bloom. The winter coda narrows options by committing her to a public practice. Agency is clear (renunciation of isolation, endurance of vulnerability) with visible cost (open curtains, tattooed arm, stranger's trembling reliance). The escalation is Accumulative, but the final beat summarizes rather than dramatizes the teaching moment, slightly lowering pressure legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias reverse-engineering the crash's cultural patterns—is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page reversal tightens his options or forces a trade-off. The visitor's confession ("her brother had been the guru") introduces new information but does not escalate pressure for Elias; he responds with advice, not a decision under duress. The final moment (dealing another spread, laughing at the upside-down Wheel of Fortune) gestures at ongoing inquiry but lacks the felt cost or narrowed path that would elevate escalation. The piece operates as a vignette of method rather than a story of narrowing choices.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—purifying the past without succumbing like prior scholars—is signaled early but never tested by a live antagonist or narrowing consequence. The historian's action (turning the pagoda) triggers a cascade, yet no trade-off or resource cost is visible; she simply receives enlightenment and walks away intact. The "weight of knowing" is thematic rather than tactical, and the escalation consists of atmospheric intensification (dust, hum rising to scream) without a reversal or choice under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving the poet's hope-shadow—is signaled early and tightens when Liora realizes "some shadows, once freed, sought vessels" and she is "already half-empty." The reversal (her recognition that the curator lied to protect her) forces the trade-off: offer her own shadow or leave the hope restless. The cost is legible on-page ("her shadow thin but present") and forecloses a path (she becomes bound to the library). Escalation is smooth under the Accumulative lens, though the curator's passive role and lack of on-page resistance slightly diffuse tension.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—Elias reconstructing both tail and self-respect—is signaled early and deepens through the three-layer structure. Each layer (salve, apothecary visit, letters) narrows his path toward penance with visible cost: returning to the market risks confrontation, offering free labor forfeits income. The accumulative lens holds; escalation reads as density increase rather than reversal, which is valid. One meaningful tightening occurs when he leaves medicine for "the next child," reweighting prior guilt. Agency is clear throughout, and the final poise ("the only con left was convincing himself he deserved to try") charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: Liora seeks to "read the stories in scars" to achieve closure (for herself via others' pain). The plants' voices deepen pressure by showing her a memory not her own, reframing scars as "displaced miracles...healing that arrived too late." The archive door opening and the mother's file sliding free constitute a meaningful tightening that narrows options to confronting her origin wound. The final act—writing on the file, then renouncing decoding—is protagonist-driven and forecloses interpretation with felt cost (she must carry ambiguity). However, the choice lacks visible friction or a competing want; she simply "understood" and acted. No antagonist or secondary pressure, which fits the Accumulative lens, but the turn from seeking to carrying could show more on-page resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding goodbye letters stored in film—is signaled early and undergoes one meaningful deepening when Elara realizes the letters exist "as absence—as the shape of a song waiting to be remembered." Her agency is primarily perceptual (psychometry, crystal gazing) rather than decisional; the final act of threading the film and turning off the projector renounces the search with felt cost, but the escalation relies on revelation rather than choice-driven tightening. One clear turn is present but the cost at closure is more atmospheric than transactional.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is signaled early and tightens once: Liora kneels at the well, presses the instrument to the water, and "began to sing," which triggers the archway's dissolution. However, the escalation is passive; the instrument's needles "spun wildly" and "her hands moved on their own," reducing protagonist agency. No on-page reversal tests her commitment; the archway "shuddered" and creativity "surged outward—through her" without a visible trade-off or foreclosed path. The resolution (paintings sold, music made strangers weep) is summarized off-page, and the cost (doubt, stifled work) is named but not dramatized as a price paid in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: preventing another world reset, signaled early via the toppled white king and "the world had already reset too many times." Pressure accumulates through the Möbius-strip tracks and the spark's weight, but escalation relies more on atmospheric intensification than on a clear tightening that forecloses options. Hollow's agency (placing the spark, winding the clock) drives the resolution, yet the cost—though felt in the transformation—lacks a visible trade-off or renunciation that would narrow tactics. One meaningful deepening occurs, but the price remains implicit rather than dramatized as a loss or omission that alters later choices.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake ("unravel the hum") is signaled early, but no on-page reversal or tightening forces a trade-off. The philosopher listens, the hum intensifies, he understands, he leaves the gear—a linear drift without escalation. No cost is legible: what does he forfeit by internalizing the frontier? What option is foreclosed? The final walk is continuation, not closure crystallization. Accumulative lens allows pattern-building, but even under that lens, pressure must cohere and deepen; here it plateaus into metaphysical glide.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—whether to continue crossing or to stay—is signaled early and tightens when Liora kneels by the fire and asks "What do you do when the courage you needed was for staying, not going?" One meaningful deepening occurs when she presses the punch into her palm, narrowing her options. Agency is clear in the final act: she releases the punch, forfeiting her crossing role with visible cost. The escalation operates under an accumulative lens, building through layered images rather than reversals. Minor deduction: the woman's guidance feels slightly too convenient, reducing friction.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether to restore the piano and break the fortress's enforced silence—emerges clearly. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias finds the cracked wax seal and chooses to enter, but the escalation is primarily atmospheric (vibration, sustained note, teacup shattering) rather than driven by protagonist agency. The cost of handing over the bolt is conceptual (the fortress "had never been safe") but not dramatized as a visible forfeiture—guests will complain, but no specific relationship, position, or safety net is shown collapsing on the page. The pianist's presence and the bolt's sudden warmth function as coincidence that complicates rather than a causal chain Elias set in motion.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and sustained: unmask the pretender to restore the throne's truth. Escalation operates through three messages across centuries, each tightening the warning, until the third ("Sunder the crown, or it will sunder you") forces Veythas to act. The price is legible and dramatized: he must sacrifice Lirien's name, the library shatters, the scepter cracks, and the kingdom ends. The pretender's relief ("I never wanted it") and Veythas's epitaph ("Here the lie ended") close the pressure arc with visible cost. One meaningful tightening—the third message—narrows options and forces the choice to sunder, meeting the lens requirement for Causal escalation with Accumulative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—discovering why paths disappear—is signaled early and tightens when Lena assembles all fragments and the sonar reveals a line. The receded tide and exposed road force a binary: report or follow. Agency is clear in Lena's choice to wade out despite Voss's protest, foreclosing her position at the station with visible cost (the station's systems failing, her refusal to record). The escalation is driven by her action (tapping, assembling) under the Accumulative lens, and the final step onto the submerged road carries undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (reignite the stalled rebellion via discovered meaning) is signaled early. One meaningful deepening occurs when Lena touches the stone and the hum surges, foreclosing passive waiting and opening collective action. Agency is present (her decision to press the slab, shout, pass the glasses), but the final escalation spreads to the collective ("filled with the sound of reignition") which diffuses individual cost. The rebellion's ignition feels earned by the stone-circle discovery, though coincidence (ancient artifact untouched, suddenly active) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—evolving tradition versus rigid reconstruction—is signaled early and sustained. Liora's choice to unseal the amber is a meaningful turn that narrows options (heresy versus stasis). However, opposition dissolves too easily: the Council elder's resistance vanishes when the vine touches his boot, and by dusk "even the skeptical" kneel without dramatized friction. The grandson's midnight reversal ("You were right") feels summarized rather than tested. One tightening is present but cost remains atmospheric rather than personal or tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—anchoring optimism in realism while metabolizing trauma—is signaled early and tightens when Lena releases the photograph. Her agency is clear: she chooses to let the wind take it, plucks the leaf, returns to prune. The embodied pause technique imposes a visible cost (pain, breath held, the freeze itself) and the final act forecloses the path of paralysis. One meaningful deepening occurs when the child's misrecognition ("Look, a bird!") allows Lena to see the photograph differently, reweighting her relationship to the image. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; the tide coming in and the tour group's fading laughter bracket the turn. No antagonist needed; internal and environmental pressures suffice.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=4.4)
    The dominant stake—painting truth by "letting the dark shape what remained"—is declared rather than tested. No live option is foreclosed; the "redesign" occurs in summary without visible resistance or cost. The walls' hunger and Elara's surrender carry atmospheric weight but no causal tightening that narrows her choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—stop the slow-thief—is signaled early and escalates when Kael encounters the thief and learns he's collecting fractured time, not just stealing it. The ink-spilling confrontation provides one meaningful tightening that narrows options. Agency is present: Kael chooses to follow rather than kill, stepping through the threshold. However, the thief's disappearance and Kael's realization feel more like coincidental reveals than pressure-driven reversals; the cost of crossing is implied but not felt as a trade-off in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (expose erasure vs. self-preservation) signals early and escalates through the letter's demand, Elara's hesitation, then her irreversible command input. The flood spreads "uncontainable as fire," forcing the Overseers' response. Elara's agency drives the turn; her death is the visible price. The tightening from internal conflict to gunfire is clean and causal, though the "No. I've just remembered" line edges toward posed defiance rather than lived cost under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: tend the continuity (roses, dome) versus flee the collapsing world. The pressure tightens when the sandbag's impact cracks the glass, forcing Liora to choose between repair and escape; her decision to kneel again and wait for the plants' guidance is Earned Stasis with visible cost (isolation, danger deferred). The knife's transformation from weapon to carving tool, and the final image of patching the dome, narrows her options and forecloses flight. Agency is renunciation under accumulative pressure; the cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: to silence the impostor echo wearing his daughter's voice and reclaim agency over grief. One meaningful tightening occurs when the rail spike strikes the hollow and the goddess's mouth whispers back, forcing the fisher to command silence; this narrows options and the constellations snap into place with visible cost (blackened stems, the echo "too sharp to keep"). The final renunciation—letting the last echo drown—forecloses the thirty-year pursuit. However, the goddess's defeat reads somewhat convenient: "voiced silence... as a command" and she simply "was gone" without prolonged struggle or visible tactical adaptation, slightly undercutting escalation intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—whether to bury or expose the truth—is signaled in the journalist's opening challenge and tightens when Lydia finds the damning ledger entry, then escalates decisively when the plates arrive. Agency is clear: she chooses to investigate, then to publish, forecloses the orbit of regret, and the cost is legible (risking familial loyalty and institutional stability). One meaningful reversal (the ledger reveals her father's complicity) narrows options and the plates provide leverage for the final push. Coincidence complicates (the man arrives with plates) but does not resolve; Lydia's decision to act closes the loop.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake (silencing guilt) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening: Elara writes the memory, feeds it to the machine, the amber cracks, and the voice rebukes her—tightening options from erasure to witness. Agency is present in her final choice to reach for the baby and continue tattooing. Cost is visible: the cry doesn't stop, and she must endure rather than erase. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres. No multiple reversals required at this length; the single turn is sufficient but not intensely narrow.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—discovering meaning in the mess during the village's enforced forgetting—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens. One meaningful tightening: the flake burns and instructs "interject now, or it collapses," forcing Lior's hand-plunge that shifts the mandala and triggers the grotto's chorus. The cost is conceptual and opportunity-based (he must keep drawing the void perpetually), legible in "some things were meant to be devoured." Agency is present (choice to interject, to draw again), but the escalation is a single pressure point rather than layered reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: preserve memory against erasure, signaled early ("the stones remembered"). The confrontation with the commander is the story's one meaningful tightening, raising the cost of Elias's defiance from abstract threat to immediate death. His choice to continue ("Go ahead") and his declaration of what mercy *carries* force the commander's reversal. The resolution hinges on Elias's stance crystallization, and the commander's joining alters the plaza's state with visible cost (sword dropped, role abandoned). One additional reversal—the stones beginning to glow—follows from cumulative naming rather than protagonist agency, which slightly softens the escalation's sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—luring Elias from despair—is signaled when Lydia recognizes "the set of his jaw, the hollow look in his eyes." One meaningful tightening occurs when she "pulled the timeline taut" and shows him future visions, forcing the choice to pocket the pills. The escalation is accumulative (texture building to a single decision point) rather than causal with reversals. Elias's agency is minimal; the visions and Lydia's intervention do the lifting, and his internal resistance or trade-off is not dramatized. The cost is felt but not sharp: "the path sealed shut" and he'll forget, suggesting ephemerality over a visible forfeiture that changes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Lena's desire to illuminate the pathways Mira walked—is signaled early and tightens when she presses the sliver to her temple, revealing the lattice of connections. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening (the choice to paint rather than immediately follow) that reweights her options, though the escalation relies more on accumulating lyric intensity than on narrowing tactical choices through visible prices paid. Agency is present in the final act of painting and leaving the door open, but the middle beats summarize key transformations ("She devised the sequence without thinking") rather than dramatizing the friction between want and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.9)
    One dominant stake (becoming the voice of the unknown) is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through deepening mystery (floating fossil, pulsing lichen) under the Accumulative lens, but no meaningful tightening or trade-off occurs. Lior encounters no opposition, internal friction, or cost; the cave simply "answers" when spoken to. The resolution is gifted by the environment rather than earned by protagonist agency, and no visible price is paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake is signaled early: retrieve the ninth button or the hourglass shatters and time spills unchecked. Elias's descent to the well and the button's retrieval tighten options, and the ledger's final entry ("Button #9—missing. Consequence: the hourglass breaks") raises cost. Yet the resolution sidesteps the declared stakes; the hourglass doesn't break, the cliffs stand steady "for now," and Elias simply waits for the next echo. The escalation is present but the final cost is deferred rather than paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: whether Lena will re-engage with the network after being burned. The coded message and pillbox opening tighten pressure, forcing her from hiding to action. The ally's request and her decision to "vouchsafe one last thing" narrow options with visible cost (abandoning the pillbox, stepping toward coordinates). Escalation is accumulative and causal; the final move forecloses retreat. Slight deduction: the ally's role is expository rather than applying sustained pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—when to cross—is signaled early and tightens through two escalations: first fog-lift (heartbeats counted), second lift plus gutter-slowing, then the decision and silent gutters at mid-crossing. Agency belongs to the coachman's attentive reading and his "Now," but the girl's "Wait" and needle-gift apply secondary pressure that reweights the ending. Cost is visible: the girl forgoes her mother and prior life, the coachman accepts another decade of solitary duty. The ticking timeframe and fog-rule create persistent constraint that narrows the window.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why some places resist change—is signaled early and drives the potter's return and ritual. Pressure accumulates through textural density (the thrum, the bee, the glass warming) rather than causal reversals, consistent with the Accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening occurs when the potter embeds the glass and fires the bowl, then leaves it in the oasis, a gesture that reweights his relationship to the place. The cost is conceptual (departure, the bowl left as offering) rather than viscerally felt, which limits the score's ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—Lena's isolation versus the invitation to hope—is signaled early and tightens when Elias offers the second gauge tooth and she "let[s] herself believe." The tightening is achieved through accumulative pressure: wilting basil, nicked thumb, Elias's presence, the two keys "to a lock neither of them needed anymore." One felt cost: belief forecloses her prior refusal. Escalation reads cleanly under the Accumulative lens with a meaningful deepening, though the stakes remain intimate rather than urgent, which fits the design.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—translating isolation into independence—is signaled early and tightens through the translator's hour ritual. The Hesperornis lunging at its reflection triggers the shockwave that presents the new book, narrowing options toward Lior's realization. The final door-opening forecloses his prior isolation with visible cost (abandoning the "debt repaid" compact). Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful deepening suffices; however, the protagonist's agency in peak beats (bird acts, book appears, doors open) leans passive, with Lior mostly receiving rather than driving the cascade.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—whether to release hoarded secrets—is signaled early and drives the two spiral-placement beats. However, escalation is minimal: Liora hesitates briefly, then gives both spirals without visible cost or trade-off. The monk's invitation and the artist's acceptance are frictionless; no reversal tests her commitment. The installation itself is not a problem she helped create, so the resolution feels externally supplied. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful tightening or deepening is required; here the pattern repeats rather than intensifies.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: prove the signal is manipulative and disrupt its pattern to restore agency. One meaningful tightening occurs when Liora sends the first pulse and the signal "knew"—the response as laughter raises cost. Her choice to adjust frequency again and persist narrows options (defying the dean, accepting isolation). The final image shows consequence: the campus pauses, the signal shifts to curiosity, and the dean searches for her. However, the escalation is somewhat linear—Liora calibrates, transmits, observes—without a second on-page reversal that forces a harder trade-off. Coincidence does not resolve; her action drives the change.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: retrieve the Architect-King's key to unseal the city's blueprint. Pressure escalates through the compass test ("its point now aimed at his chest") that forces a choice under spatial mutiny. The resolution—driving the key into the table—is Elias's agency, not luck, and the cost is visible: he trades claustrophobic fear for a new relationship with the city's geometry. One credible tightening (the chamber rearranging, the organ screaming) narrows options before closure. The "test" moment could land harder if the stakes of failure were more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: bearing witness to Liora's erasure and reclaiming her name from silence. Pressure accumulates through the ritual, the echo's appearance, and the vision of her murder, tightening when Elias realizes "she'd been *erased*" and that the case won't reopen. The final choice—walking toward the child's cough—forecloses his isolation with visible cost (he carries the unsolved weight forward). Agency is present in his deliberate ritual and decision to speak her name; the mayor's son's untouchability raises the cost. One meaningful deepening under the accumulative lens, though the final move toward the cough feels slightly understated for the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—redeeming Orin's name by reaching the threshold—is signaled early and tightens when Liora's alarms force a choice. Elias's sprint to the deck and press of the nail to glass constitute protagonist-driven escalation with a visible gamble: he risks his life and loses the nail's charge. The world-snap forecloses the direct reunion, imposing a clear opportunity cost. One meaningful tightening (alarms → sprint → threshold attempt) is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake: whether Elias will accept the hitchhiker's invitation to step sideways out of his story. Pressure accumulates through sensory intensification (glass hum, air scent, golden threads) and the hitchhiker's challenge ("if you dare to recount"). The tightening occurs when Elias lifts the glass and sees the alternate road, then plays the note that parts the asphalt—a decision that forecloses his bridge-fiddler life. The cost is legible (pullout seals behind him, glass becomes nothing) but felt more as atmospheric loss than embodied sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why paths circle back—is signaled early and tightens through the train's stillness versus the highway's motion. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias runs his palm along the cage grooves, shifting from intellectual question to embodied recognition. The final choice (walking away, not wondering) forecloses the forward-momentum path his father lived. Cost is legible: he leaves the question unanswered in favor of acceptance. However, the escalation is more textural accumulation than a protagonist decision under pressure that narrows prior options; the tightening reads as realization rather than forced trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—decode temple inscriptions to understand his sister's vanishing—is signaled early. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is more textural than causal: the telescope aligns, light threads through his chest, pages flip violently, but these feel like metaphoric events rather than choices that narrow options with visible trade-offs. The final relinquishment (ledger vanishes, words dissolve) carries conceptual cost, but the middle lacks a specific pressure point where Elias must sacrifice something concrete to proceed. Coincidence (the stars align at this exact night) complicates without clear agency driving the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—discovering what took his brother—is signaled early and tightens when the plant reveals the brother jumped rather than being taken. That reversal forecloses Eldrin's prior narrative and forces the choice to walk away, a visible renunciation with cost ("some confessions were better left frozen"). The lake's answer and the plant's digestion of truth drive escalation under the accumulative lens. Cost is felt in his refusal to look back and his acceptance of silence, though the physical price (pocketing the key, walking) could be heavier.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—uneclipsing the covenant by finding the intersection—is signaled early and drives Liora's journey into the maze. Pressure tightens when her scars guide her inward and the chasm opens, forcing her to run across the bridge. The encounter with future-Liora introduces a reversal ("not ready"), but the resolution feels too accommodating: future-Liora simply gifts the insight, and Liora awakens with the sprouted clipping, her goal achieved without a clear trade-off. The ending reconfigures her state (shadows no longer rooted), but the cost of that transformation—what specific path or desire was foreclosed—remains abstract. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening occurs, but the price lacks the on-page visibility needed for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Liora wants to "trammel fate itself" and mend herself by bartering her guilt. Pressure tightens when the roots pull "the name of the child she'd failed to save"—a live cost that narrows her to one path: resist or surrender. The orchard's agency (pulling, weaving, releasing) creates situational pressure; Liora's decision to "not resist" and her active stitching demonstrate protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens. The trade forecloses the option to carry guilt forward, and the price is visible: empty hands, a wilting flower, and the acknowledgment that scars remain. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—discovering purpose after the applause ends—is signaled early and tightened by the widow's rebuke and the grille cloth's arrival. One meaningful deepening: the cloth reweights his professional detachment into personal reckoning, narrowing his options from appraisal-for-hire to self-chosen meaning. The foreman's shrug and Liam's decision to take the scrap create a modest turn with visible cost (rejecting monetary value, embracing subjective worth). Agency is endurance and attention rather than confrontation, appropriate to the lens. Minor: the escalation is more textural accumulation than a because/therefore pressure spike; the widow scene sets up thematic friction but doesn't force an on-page tactical choice that Liam must navigate under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding transition without rupture—is signaled early and drives the action coherently. The climb and invocation represent a tightening that narrows options and imposes physical cost (two days, the risk of the unknown). Agency is clear: Elias plants the seed and reaches for the flower. The reversal (wind flowing upward, world tilting) arises from his decision. However, the final beat's cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt; the reunion with his wife reads as reward without immediate friction or trade-off dramatized on the page, which softens the pressure at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder in routine—is signaled early but remains thematic rather than pressured by a concrete dilemma. The woman's request (melt the key into a spoon) introduces a task, but no opposition or cost complicates it; Elias performs the work smoothly. The moon's phase shift is mentioned as causing rib ache, yet this bodily constraint never alters his tactics or the outcome. One micro-tightening occurs when the creel shudders and Elias understands the objects are molting skins, but this is realization, not a reversal that forecloses options. No visible price is paid; the spoon's creation and the woman's departure leave the status quo intact.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake: find the latent radiance. One meaningful tightening occurs when the inspector realizes "the pearl wasn't for keeping. It was for giving" and absorbs it, altering her mission. However, the higher-ups' opposition is declared but never tests her on the page; she walks away from the radio without visible consequence. The shells' trail provides accumulative pressure, but the final choice lacks a trade-off or felt cost that forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: finding self-forgiveness via the path the map doesn't show, signaled early through graffiti and the sister's absence. One meaningful tightening: stopping medication sharpens immediacy ("before he decided to start the medication again"), and walking to the bridge narrows options to brave/sorry (graffiti fork). At the bridge, squeezing the bellows and turning right is a protagonist-driven decision that forecloses the mapped route with felt cost (not yet forgiveness, but a beginning). No coincidence resolves; the path emerges from his refusal to look back. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through recurring objects (map, bellows, graffiti) that reweight his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: document the unspoken words before the library dissolves. The watch's countdown and the second letter's posting provide one meaningful tightening. Agency is present in tearing the page and writing the third letter, but the escalation feels conceptual rather than tactical—no live trade-off dramatized on the page (e.g., what she risks by writing versus staying silent). The cost at closure is the watch's surrender, which reweights her stance, but the pressure remains atmospheric rather than forcing a visible choice under competing harms.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (contract payment versus letting the symphony propagate) is signaled by paragraph four and tightens when Elara lifts the violin and hears Silas's voice, which reframes the empire-dream calculus. The smashing forecloses her contract and freedom with visible cost ("thief, fraud, madwoman" report, dawn auction missed). Agency is decision under pressure. One beat-level gap: the coffee-stain vision offers three paths but the "third option" introduction feels slightly late; earlier plant-urgency cues could have seeded the propagation logic more causally.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—capturing one last spark before oblivion for the dead—is signaled early. One meaningful deepening occurs when the emerald chip reveals the threshold and the woman's message, reweighting Liora's understanding. However, no on-page reversal narrows options or imposes a felt trade-off; the grotto "holds its breath," then the chip dulls, but Liora's agency reads as receptive witnessing rather than a decision that forecloses a path. Under the Accumulative lens, this is functional but lacks the tightening or visible cost that would elevate escalation into the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: Maren seeks the source of contentment, "the well before the drawing." Pressure coheres and tightens when she plucks the twilight shoot, triggering the grotto's recoil and her vision of the spiral thread. The gift to the arsonist is protagonist-driven agency with visible cost (hairpin gone, burden transferred). One clear deepening—seeing the thread, absorbing the shoot—narrows options and forecloses her solitary path. Cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (release borrowed guilt to reclaim self) is signaled early and tightens through the unhooking sequence, which forecloses his conscience-for-hire role with visible cost (threads dissolving, cloak becoming quilt). The shard's hiss ("You never unhooked") creates clear internal pressure. Under the Accumulative lens, the density increase and cadence shift (from polished routine to uncertain beam) reweight the stake. The woman's arrival deflates solo cost: her offer to "help you carry yours" grants external support at the moment Elias should face the full weight of his choice alone.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—teaching vanishing by modeling presence—is signaled early but never tested on the page; no student arrives, no choice is forced. The trance sequence deepens the pond-stone pattern and the body-age shifts, but neither narrows options or creates a visible trade-off. The final step into the grotto reads as a crystallization of stance (Charged Poise under Accumulative lens), yet no prior reversal or on-page confrontation compels it. Escalation is textural density increase rather than causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake: survive the Hollow Maw by embodying stillness. The flock's disruption (lagging bird) signals the anomaly and the skimmer's arrowhead ritual tightens pressure, but no meaningful reversal or escalation narrows his options—he performs the ritual and waits. The Maw's passing is coincidental (it does not find him) rather than forced by the skimmer's tactical alteration. Agency is present (whisper binding words, press arrowhead) but cost legibility is low; survival feels assured by ancestral knowledge rather than a trade-off with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—retrieve the keystone and prove worth—is signaled early. One tightening occurs when Marlin discovers mist-walking, reframing the challenge. However, the keeper's lesson and the keystone's properties arrive without resistance; Marlin does not face a live choice or trade-off at the summit. The closing renunciation (walking away from the deans) carries conceptual weight but lacks on-page cost legibility—what does he forfeit by leaving the keystone? The escalation relies more on thematic accumulation than protagonist agency narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—discovering the color of sound—is signaled early and coheres through Elias's progression from journal obsession to the library door. Pressure tightens when he finds the key, unlocks the door, and confronts the figure's challenge, narrowing his path to a single choice: light his own lantern. However, the escalation is more atmospheric than agent-driven; Elias wades, ducks, finds, and unlocks in a sequence of discoveries rather than decisions under friction. The cost of his final act (releasing the lantern, dissolving the vision) is implied—his light "no longer yellow but threaded with hues"—but what he forfeits or what path closes remains abstract. The figure's assertion that "the color of sound isn't found—it's made" reframes the stake conceptually, yet Elias's choice to light the lantern feels inevitable rather than a trade-off with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—interpret the prophecy to prevent the universe's final collapse—is signaled early and coheres. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds through texture and the static's increasing clarity rather than a causal reversal. Liora's agency is primarily attentional and interpretive (arranging coins, tuning frequency) until the climactic dissolution. The cost is conceptual (she becomes "a question, humming backwards") and the ending reconfigures her purpose, but the escalation lacks a visible trade-off or foreclosed option that would bring it into the high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: giving names to nameless fears. The reaper's agency drives escalation: he chooses to play the recordings again, to step into the beam, to press each crystallized fear into a monster. The naming sequence tightens pressure through accumulation and irreversible action: "You'll regret this" arrives as warning, and the release of named monsters into the world forecloses retreat. The cost is legible on the page: monsters now hunt ("a child woke screaming"), and "something coiled" follows him. The coincidence of dusk timing the ritual does not resolve but enables; the reaper's decision to proceed despite foreseen regret earns the closure. One meaningful deepening occurs when the Leviathan gains identity and weight.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring the cosmic imbalance—is signaled early and tested through escalating action: studying drips, whispering the tuning spell, striking the bell harder. Pressure tightens when drips stutter "like a hesitant heart," then reverses when they synchronize and fish return. Agency is present: Elias's choices (hauling the bell, studying patterns, striking twice) drive causality. The cost is legible: three moons of study, bleeding fingers, and the acceptance that "the imbalance was not gone." However, the villagers' eventual climb feels like external validation rather than a complicating force.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—transform memory from weight to current—is signaled early ("photographs…pressing like a confession") and escalates through the photograph trail (child's shoe, ring, father's watch, blank scraped frame). The blank photo ("failed attempt to expunge") creates visible cost before the turn; lighting the photographs one by one narrows options (he cannot reclaim them) and the reservoir's giving-back vision reweights the stakes. Agency is renunciation with on-page cost: he releases archive and bottle, walks away to record as son. The tightening is meaningful—patrol duty versus storytelling—and the price (sinking bottle, burning photos) is unmistakable. No antagonist required; pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens and the final image of "hands…reaching not to pull him under, but to lift" reconfigures the opening "reservoir's hunger."

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—harmonizing logic and intuition—is signaled early and remains coherent. The ritual sequence (striking flint, tilting crystal toward flame) provides one meaningful tightening when the fire turns blue and the orchard vanishes. However, the escalation is linear rather than pressured; no reversal tests her commitment, and the starlings function as atmospheric metaphor without altering her options. The final step through the door reads as inevitability rather than a choice with visible cost. Under Accumulative lens, one decisive intensification is sufficient, but the lack of a felt trade-off or foreclosed path caps the score.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—secure the payload, preserve trust—is signaled early and tightens through the descent sequence. One meaningful deepening when she steps into darkness forecloses hesitation with visible cost (exposure, solitary burden). The choice not to answer the radio at the end demonstrates agency through renunciation. Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens via rising dread and physical descent. Minor issue: the opposition remains abstract (unnamed "hands that would weaponize silence") rather than embodied, reducing friction.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—merge before the custody hearing dissolves both halves—is signaled early and tightens once through Kael's choice to act. The blood ritual meaningfully narrows options (irreversible merge vs. legal battle) and the cost is visible (pain, jars dissolve, world shifts). However, escalation is thin: Veyra's arrival and the three-day deadline don't create intermediate pressure points or force trade-offs before the climax. The Emperor's memory-wipes and historians remain background context rather than on-page antagonistic force that adapts or complicates Kael's moves.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring laughter to the household—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the blower dies and real laughter erupts, forcing Elias to confront his ritual's irrelevance. Agency is present (he climbs to join them) but the pressure does not escalate through his choices; the household's laughter breaks out independently, making the turn situational rather than driven by protagonist decision. Cost is implied (abandoning the tunnel, relinquishing control) but never felt as a trade-off—the household welcomes him without friction, softening the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: whether to remain keeper or release the books (and herself). The figure's arrival and demand ("Give it back") tightens options. Lyssa's hand-over is an on-page decision with visible cost—her body dissolves, her purpose ends. The escalation is quiet but coherent under the Accumulative lens: the books' whispers become shouts, the mist shifts, the figure appears, Lyssa chooses. Agency is renunciation with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Elias proving his method of creative destruction—is signaled early and tightens through the feeding sequence to the forbidden incantation. The crozier's hunger narrows his options, and the final turn (guild fleeing, Elias staying) is earned by his agency. Visible cost: his scars reverse (body alteration), the guild will burn the nexus (social consequence), and he forecloses his past identity. The escalation is coherent under the Causal lens with a meaningful tightening and felt price at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—tuning the unheard frequency—is signaled early, but escalation is thin: Elara climbs, places the fragment, the dish shatters, the note persists. No reversal narrows her options; the shattering appears catastrophic but immediately reveals it was not. The jump at closure lacks visible cost because gravity's reversal is asserted, not earned, and her laughter flattens the moment's stakes rather than charging them.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—ferry unraveling in five minutes—is signaled by the radio crackle midway. Lira's response (kneel, press hourglass, whisper names) tightens the situation into stabilization, but no live alternative or tradeoff is dramatized; her competence absorbs the pressure without visible forfeit. The "merging the lanes" maneuver reads as skill demonstration rather than a choice that narrows options or costs her something on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs (the shudder, the silver water, the snap into place), meeting the Accumulative lens minimum.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—proving memories "were never ours to begin with" and creating connection—is signaled early and drives Elias's threading work. One meaningful tightening occurs when the woman announces dismantling, and the eruption sequence raises tension through sensory and emotional layering. However, the escalation lacks a decisive trade-off or visible price; Elias's "unsettling calm" and the sinew thread's automatic reformation undercut the sense that he has foreclosed a path or paid a cost. The resolution reads as completion rather than transformation, and no live option is visibly narrowed at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—learning to navigate by starlight and escaping the city's stagnation—is signaled early and tightens through Kael's skepticism and the elders' resistance. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elira adjusts the chain link's angle and Kael perceives "a flicker. A path. The horizon unfolded," which narrows ignorance and opens new possibilities under the accumulative lens. However, the escalation feels more told than dramatized: "after the aliens, it was the only thing keeping her from drowning" and "their hearts no longer afraid of the dark" summarize rather than enact pressure. The cost—foreclosing the old navigation methods—is conceptually present but not viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—finding "her" before the mist does—is signaled early via the hearing aid's whisper. Pressure tightens when Elias touches the glove and the mist screams, forcing the encounter with the woman and child. However, the escalation is largely atmospheric rather than driven by Elias's agency; he follows the pulse passively until the glove touch triggers the vision. The final shift (from chasing to being led) reweights his role with felt cost (kneeling, dead aid, acceptance of a dual mission), but the vision itself is coincidental revelation rather than earned turn. One meaningful tightening is present, sufficient for this length under a Hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: retrieve evidence of the "unremembered" and escape before the tide seals the phase seam. One meaningful tightening occurs when the detector spikes and the gold fleck vibrates, signaling the junction box's importance. Yet Elias's decision to take the fleck and cross back feels preordained—no live option is visibly foreclosed, no resource spent. The "minutes before the phase seam sealed" creates urgency in principle, but on the page he "exhales" and transitions without dramatized friction or visible cost, leaving escalation more asserted than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding the static and her own erasure—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the voice's questions and the ink patterns, but Lena never faces a meaningful trade-off or reversal. The "digital ghost" offers defragmentation and she accepts; no cost is visible in her choice. The ending posture ("ready to listen") reconfigures her stance, but without a on-page tightening that narrows options or a visible price paid, escalation remains conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—capture the dying language before it dissolves—is signaled early and tightens once when the echoes turn "alive" and wrap around her. That single meaningful deepening fits this length, but the protagonist's agency is diluted: she "tried to run" and "should have stopped" rather than making a visible, on-page choice that narrows options with felt cost. Coincidence does not resolve, yet the peak turn reads as event-driven (the diamond pulses, the canyon inhales) rather than protagonist-driven under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (Elias hunting the thing that took his sister) is declared but never tested on the page; he encounters phone and garden forces that act on him rather than forcing a trade-off or tactical shift he must navigate. No meaningful tightening occurs—the garden erupts, he's told he has a choice, and the vines pull him under without visible cost or a decision that narrows live options. The "after the missing returned" frame suggests pressure, but those returnees remain off-stage shadows with no impact on Elias's immediate tactics, and coincidence (arrowhead spontaneously transforming, phone ringing with his own voice) drives the turns rather than protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—reawakening life in a mechanical world—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the violinist's playing and the ground's response, but escalation lacks a meaningful tightening or trade-off. The statues "felt its vibrations" and "faltered," yet no on-page reversal forces the violinist to alter tactics or pay a visible price; she plays louder and the world complies. The climax ("She played the last note") arrives without prior constraint or sacrifice that would make the outcome feel earned rather than granted. Agency is present but uncontested, reducing the felt weight of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: deliver the storm to "where the promises broke." One meaningful tightening occurs when drones approach ("Time was up") and Elias must run, then the post office door opens before he touches it—pressure coheres. Agency is present in the choice to cross after dark and to carry the bottle to Seventh despite risk, though the final act (setting bottle on counter, storm sighing still) feels more ritualistic than agonistic. The cost is signaled as perpetual labor ("Again. And again") but remains abstract; we don't see a specific option foreclosed or a visible price paid in the final beat beyond continued effort.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Lior interpreting silence as retreat versus offering—signals early and tightens when the woman asks him to sing. The fragment discovery and corridor navigation deepen pressure through sensory accumulation rather than reversal. The climax (hand-shaping melody, train settling, woman fading) reconfigures his stance with conceptual cost: the work is endless, the door is built piece by piece. No sharp antagonist or decisive loss, but the accumulative lens supports this and the final cost (perpetual building, no completion) is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding "the place where stories live"—is signaled early in Voss's question and Elias's reflection. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias performs the ritual and the library transforms from static archive to living recursion. The cost is legible: the scarf dissolves, foreclosing physical possession in exchange for pattern-memory. Under the Accumulative lens, this pressure tightens through density increase and cadence shift, though the protagonist's agency in the ritual feels more enactment than contested choice.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—capturing the runaway dream before it dissolves—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when "the first attempt failed" and she adjusts, then "the woman's edges began to fray, her voice dissolving," forcing the librarian's choice. However, the choice itself ("Stay" versus taking the dream back) lacks clear consequence: the dream's "footstep, half-erased by the tide" suggests a loss, but her immediate return to cataloging and the promise of more hunts dilutes any felt cost. The escalation reads as lyric intensification rather than narrowing options under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: free the idea/girl trapped by fear. The piece delivers one meaningful tightening when the locksmith exhales and "listened—not to the metal, but to the space between the strands," which narrows method and raises conceptual cost. The man's snarl ("You were supposed to free *her*") and the locksmith's correction ("Not her. The *idea*") constitute a micro-turn that reweights the stakes. Cost is legible: she accepts permanent ambiguity (unopened locket, ordinary hair) and the city's held breath implies consequences still unfolding.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—recovering stolen memories—is signaled early and tightens when Elias realizes gaps in his own mind. One meaningful escalation occurs when he presses the mushroom to the pedestal, triggering memory surges and the sky's repair, a choice that forecloses retreat and summons the memory eater. The cost is legible: he accepts life's full weight and confronts the thief. However, the memory eater's emergence feels coincidental rather than forced by Elias's agency, and the final exchange ("always gave the wrong answers") lands as rhetorical closure without a visible price paid in that beat.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: teach Kael to bind doors/shadows and survive the return. The teacup misreading tightens into live annotation under the shadow's lunge, forcing Kael's first binding with visible cost (smudged fingers, the hiss of resistance). Agency is clear: Elspeth's withholding and Kael's tracing both foreclose paths. The shadow's testing and the final binding create one credible escalation. No false reversals; the pressure coheres under the accumulative lens and the price (unspoken cost of return) charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (preserve wonder's color) signals early and tightens when the seed "was not meant for soil"; the girl's fading and Elias's pruning-to-give choice narrow options with visible price (his departure, the debt acknowledged). The tightening is sufficient for the accumulative lens, yet the escalation curve flattens after the succor beat—Elias's final decision to leave "by dawn" occurs off-page, and the villagers' consumption of the apple feels coincidental rather than a protagonist-driven reversal. Cost at closure is conceptual (debt, loneliness echo) rather than the felt trade-off that would anchor higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to mend the net and maintain the town's illusion or unravel it and free the restless spirits—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Elias lets the needle drop. His agency (deliberate unraveling) forecloses the path of restoration with visible cost: the sanctuary shatters, the drowned rise, his identity shifts from restorer to conduit. The tightening is driven by protagonist choice under the Accumulative lens, and the cost is legible on the page (prisms breaking, spirits laughing, doors unlatched). One micro turn (the needle hovering) sets up the decisive release.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.9)
    One dominant stake—interpreting the uncharted lands via the henge's silence—is signaled early and tightens when Elara overlays the films and discovers the temporal threshold. The flicker "above" the henge and the realization that "the map wasn't a boundary" constitute a meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. However, no on-page obstacle opposes her; discovery unfolds without resistance, friction, or visible price paid in the vault. Agency at closure is renunciation ("She didn't step through. Not yet") but the cost of waiting versus crossing is conceptual rather than felt as a lived trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: whether to pursue or abandon the mystery of Amelia's threshold-crossing. One meaningful tightening occurs when the snow falls upward and Liora "understood at last"—this narrows her options toward renunciation. The decision to file a false report and leave the globe behind is protagonist-driven and forecloses her investigative path with quiet cost (the lie "settled into her like sediment"). However, the escalation relies more on accumulative metaphor than on a dramatized pressure point that tests competing goods; the Electra discovery and notebook mainly supply context rather than forcing an on-page dilemma. Cost is legible but slightly diffuse across the final sequence rather than concentrated in one beat.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: whether to release or contain the ghost's hunger. Pressure tightens when the graffiti rips to reveal "something bright and terrible" and the ghost's need becomes "a pressure behind his ribs." The balladeer's agency—encoding the rest symbol and slamming the bolt plate—drives the turn, and the ghost unravels as a result. The cost is legible (the silence he carries, the work continuing) but leans conceptual; the valley's glowing graffiti and the child waking suggest consequence, yet the balladeer's own tactics and options after the act remain atmospherically open rather than visibly foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: Liora's shift from viewing the spire as prison to recognizing it as a lens for joy. The diary's cipher revelation deepens this stake by showing the servant's prior attempt at the same transformation. Pressure accumulates through the elevator's climb and unfolds to a meaningful tightening when "Look up" forces her gaze toward the burning ice. The final choice to climb carries agency (endurance with visible cost: "every frozen step"), but no live alternative path is foreclosed on the page—she simply accepts what was already present.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—proving that empty spaces remember—is signaled early and sustained through Elias's decade-long recording and his choice to let the string snap. However, escalation is passive: the gondola drifts, he observes, then accepts the fall without a tactical choice that narrows options. The string's magical restoration removes consequence rather than imposing cost. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through a pattern break or cadence shift that reweights the stake; instead, the piece offers steady atmospheric accumulation without a meaningful tightening that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—mirroring the infinite inside walls—is signaled early and drives the night's work. Pressure tightens via the dawn deadline and the oak's imminent destruction, culminating in the ceiling's collapse that dramatizes the limit she'd denied. The choice to paint "nothing" the next morning is a micro turn that deepens the arc, though the post-fire scene dilutes urgency; the demolition crew's arrival feels more atmospheric than a live force narrowing her options. Agency is clear: she builds, witnesses failure, and shifts medium with visible cost (the knife set aside).

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: escape the loop and restore the ship's course. The discovery sequence tightens options (engines failing, crew grumbling) and Liora's tracing the hopscotch grid is the protagonist-driven act that snaps the loop. One meaningful deepening occurs when the phrasebook map overlays the grid, reweighting prior clues. Cost is visible in the weeks adrift and the crew's skepticism melting only after proof. Minor slip: the crew's collective shift from doubt to wonder happens in summary rather than through individual resistance that Liora must overcome.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (recovering her sister) is signaled early and drives all choices. Pressure tightens when the first gear sighs, the second resists with "something darker than rust," and the third triggers the water-mirror's hum—a meaningful escalation under the Accumulative lens. The child's shake of the head narrows options to a single irreversible reach. Agency is clear: the locksmith's action (reaching in, grasping the watch) opens the door below. Cost is visible in her transformation from mender to key, a role she cannot unmake. Minor deduction for the convenience of the child guiding her at the pivotal moment rather than forcing a harder calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—building a sanctuary from wreckage—is signaled early but never tightens into a live either/or choice with visible cost. The watering-bell ritual and Liora's tracing of cracks function as repeated gestures rather than escalating pressure; no reversal narrows her options or forces a trade-off on the page. Kael's presence and the arrival of strangers add texture but generate no meaningful opposition or friction. The ending's "We stay" reads as a communal affirmation rather than a decision that forecloses a path, and the conceptual price (what Liora or the group sacrifices to remain) is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—postponing the final chime versus releasing stolen moments—is signaled but abstract. Pressure accumulates through poetic intensification (the puppet head's song, the voices in the walls) rather than tactical tightening or a choice that forecloses a live option. The resolution (inserting the head) is framed as inevitable and Elias's acceptance is smooth, without visible hesitation or trade-off between competing goods. No reversal or deepening choice narrows his options on the page; the cost (his life's work ending) is told, not dramatized through a moment of refusal or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—guiding the girl to safety before the birds and frost lock the path—is signaled early and tightens through Liora's decision to press the last nut into the dirt, foreclosing her own escape. The mechanical birds' stiffening joints and the incoming frost supply a visible time pressure. The resolution is earned by Liora's agency: she chooses to expend her final prepared resource, and the traveler's freedom below is the on-page consequence. Deduction: the escalation happens primarily in Liora's reflection rather than through a second on-page reversal or complication; the girl's plea and Liora's response occur quickly without sustained resistance or a visible trade-off mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is Elias's need to reconcile surviving his sister's death, signaled early through the chrysalis and scar memory. Pressure accumulates via textural deepening: foam spirals trigger insight, chrysalis examination shifts from keepsake to ritual object, and the girl's question ("Where'd the butterfly go?") forces articulation. The final choice—wading toward convergence instead of building—narrows options with visible cost (abandoning his decade-long atonement strategy). One meaningful tightening when he stops calculating and starts seeing the water's reunification pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—finding "where stories begin"—is signaled early but never tested by genuine opposition or escalating cost. The patron's request is accommodated without friction; Liora incises, the slate fractures, the exchange completes. No reversal or deepening forces a trade-off; the "next customer" framing suggests repetition rather than transformation. The piece lacks a single on-page moment where Liora's agency forecloses a path or pays a visible price, keeping pressure static and illustrative.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake: Elias seeks to relieve the burden of the soldier's bitter memory by giving it to the pavilion. The piece signals this early and follows through, but pressure never tightens—the ritual succeeds without obstacle, and no live choice narrows options. The "sandpapering" metaphor suggests prior labor, yet on-page we see only pouring and waiting. No complication arises; the pavilion accepts the offering, the weight lifts, and Elias returns unburdened. The cost (time away from the kitchen, repeated compulsion) is mentioned but not felt in the moment. A secondary thread (his own guilt dissolving into others') hovers but never crystallizes into a forcing choice.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: restore communication among fractured workers. The pressure tightens when Liora climbs with the rehabilitated weight and confronts Elias, then deepens when he accepts the engraved object and index cards. Agency is present—Liora's decision to inscribe and return the weight—but the turn feels more symbolic than costly; Elias's laughter and agreement arrive quickly without a visible trade-off. The final choir scene and workers' translations suggest outcomes, yet the on-page escalation lacks a sharp, irrevocable choice that narrows options under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Lena seeks to prove memories are entangled, not lost. The mirror adjustments create one meaningful tightening (reflections deepen from stranger to constellation to probe's call), but escalation is textural rather than causal—visions accumulate without narrowing her options or forcing a trade-off. Agency is observation and adjustment, not decision under pressure. The ending forecloses no live path; she walks as "cartographer," an identity she desired from the start. Cost is conceptual (accepting the void inside) but not legible as a visible price paid—no stamina loss, no tool failure, no tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—finding her brother—is clear from the vision beat and drives every choice. The one-hour inversion tightens urgency; the grotto's collapse forces the lunge for the jar. Lysara's agency (following the manuscript, pressing the doodle, reaching for the seed) narrows options with visible cost: the chamber seals, the seeds vanish, her brother remains unreachable. The final pivot to planting the seed and "reentering as a key" crystallizes a new tactic with undeniable pressure, though the physical price of that shift could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—to voice the sculpture's grief—is signaled early and tightens through Elias's iterative adjustments (thumbnail strum, insulator application). The escalation is driven by accumulative deepening rather than causal reversals: each strumming attempt layers meaning until the siskins respond and the insulator weeps. One meaningful intensification occurs when the bird trills and Elias answers, narrowing the act to communion; however, the visible price is muted—he simply leaves—so the cost lacks the sharpness required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—translating the nexus's silence into legible beauty—is signaled early and tightens when the girl asks why he counts spaces and again when she reveals the Eclipsed Covenant gambit. Elias's agency drives the turn: his choice to move "toward the dent in the stone, the flaw that made the whole thing real" reweights the game from fear-of-playing to acceptance-of-imperfection, a meaningful deepening with visible cost (releasing the stone). The nexus's magnetic shift aligns pieces into "something jagged and luminous," a charged image that reconfigures the covenant without explicit antagonist or multiple reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—recover the diary's meaning before the fireworks drown it out—is signaled early and tightens through the clasp opening and the discovery of "the silence of a choice not made." Elias's pivot from avoidance to engagement narrows his options (he walks to the ruins, commits to public repair work). The morning coda, while conceptually resonant, introduces the "Silence repaired here" sign and the music-box customer without prior setup, weakening the felt cost of that choice. One meaningful deepening is present, but the escalation could press harder if the night scene forced a micro-decision with visible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—cultivating serenity within motion—is signaled early and pursued through the theft, planting, and bloom. Pressure tightens when the Elders arrive and the flower's perfume forces truths to surface, narrowing Liora's options from secrecy to confrontation. The resolution is earned by Liora's recognition and the village's unlocking of the vault, though the Elders' "disapproval softening like wax" could carry more visible friction. One meaningful tightening (flower as mirror, not wisdom) reweights the stakes. Agency is clear: Liora plants, interprets, and extends the bridge; the village responds with trust. Cost is present but mild—no loss of status, only reframing.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    One dominant stake—find the source of resilience—is signaled early and tightens through the discovery sequence (moss properties → arch fracture → seed retrieval). Veyra's agency drives each beat: she chooses to dive, land, reach inside, and aim for the core. The inversion's hour functions as a live clock that forces her retreat and return. However, the escalation is largely additive (new wonders appear) rather than a genuine narrowing of options or forced trade-off; Veyra never loses anything or confronts a competing cost on the page, muting the pressure that would elevate this into the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding and surviving the wind anomaly—is signaled early and escalates through the shattered anemometer and encircling vortex. The flare strike narrows options (wind recoils, containers exhale) and Veyra's final logging of "Listen" forecloses her prior purely data-driven approach with visible cost (lost patch, shattered instrument). One meaningful tightening suffices; the cost is professional and epistemological, legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—unfettering the aurora versus taming it—is signaled early and coheres. One meaningful tightening occurs: the amber sheet crumbles after the third chime, foreclosing return to the elders' method. But escalation is thin: each chime simply adds another color and another metaphor without raising cost or narrowing options. Liora's agency is assertion, not decision under competing pressure; she never hesitates, doubts, or pays a visible price on the page. The ending reconfigures the world's state (aurora stays, ice sings) but the protagonist's situation and relationships remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (seal/open the breach) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Elias "played the flute again, not to seal the breach, but to widen it"—a reversal that narrows options and foregrounds a trade-off. The encounter with the child complicates pressure ("You let me in"), and the driftwood self-rearrangement raises urgency. Agency at closure is clear: crossing the threshold is Elias's choice with visible cost (abandonment of the keeper role, leaving the flute behind). No explicit antagonist beyond internal doubt and the child's voice; the situational/accumulative lens supports this. Escalation under that lens is one decisive intensification—sufficient at this length—but the child's materialization arrives late (past midpoint) and the mechanics of threat remain atmospheric rather than concretely constraint-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding the mathematics of emotion—is signaled early but remains conceptual. The halo fragment's pulse and the moving ink constitute a tightening, and Elias's decision to "let the borrowed emotions dissolve" marks a turn, but the escalation lacks a visible tradeoff. The stars' return feels like a gift rather than a consequence of protagonist agency. Coincidence (the fragment's arrival, its autonomous activation) complicates but does not resolve, yet the resolution itself—stars speaking in feelings—lacks on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—finding what hums to understand the mentor's absence—is signaled early but never dramatized as a live choice with competing costs. The woman's appearance and instant demonstration remove the courier's agency: she crushes the seed, reveals the mentor's fate through exposition, and weaves the bridge without the courier's effort or sacrifice. The "trembling hands" → "hands didn't tremble" arc substitutes emotional summary for a pressure-tested decision. One tightening occurs (pendant burns, he rips it free), but this does not narrow options or force a trade-off; the resolution unfolds as mystical inevitability rather than protagonist-driven escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: proving objects absorb emotions, which braids with avoiding his mother's fate. One meaningful tightening when the prism begins answering (not just absorbing) forces the trade-off between proof and safety. The climax—hurling the prism—is driven by Elias's agency with visible cost: he walks away with empty pockets, proof unproven. The frost moving and reshaping into his mother's face provides a clear reversal that narrows his options from observer to inheritor, compelling the final renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: carrying the message across impossible distance. One meaningful tightening: cracking the bead releases the "raveling silence" as thread, enabling the tapestry's completion and forcing the trade-off (message carries, sender stays). The cost is legible on the page—her bones woven into roots, his reply requiring another lifetime—and escalation is driven by her agency. The lover's mirror action deepens rather than resolves, sustaining pressure into the final image (orchard waits, loom hums).

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—coaxing resilience from a broken planet—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the smith feeds the silk into the fissure and the ground groans, forcing the moment of planetary response. However, the escalation lacks visible cost or trade-off for the protagonist; the silk is spent, but no personal forfeiture or tactical narrowing is shown. The resolution (planet awakens, orchards ripen, arches hold) feels granted rather than earned through protagonist sacrifice or difficult choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: "to discover the weight of a withheld truth," signaled by Liora's pocketing of the shard and her pursuit of the seam. One meaningful tightening occurs when the seam snaps shut, then reopens only after she closes her eyes and expands her map inward—a choice that narrows her options to internal perception. However, the escalation lacks a visible trade-off: what does she renounce or forfeit by stepping through? The man's presence and hand-holding deflate tension rather than test her commitment. Coincidence (the man waiting, the shard transforming) complicates but does not resolve, yet the final step forward carries no legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will remain isolated or accept communion with the keepers' legacy—is signaled early through his ritual with the glass and escalates when the letters shift from anonymous ("The tower remembers your hands") to named and instructive (the stone spiral, "Stay"). His agency drives the tightening: climbing the stairs for the first time, adding his stone, lighting the candle, and writing his reply all narrow his options until the skiff becomes expendable. The cost is visible and felt: he forecloses his departure, letting the skiff rot, and commits to building upward with voices he cannot see. No antagonist is needed; the pressure is internal and accumulative, with each layer of stones raising the stakes of connection versus retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Liora must steer the storm and deny the shadows their dawn. One tightening occurs when the shadowed shape appears and she whispers refusal, bending the light to hold the line. However, the cost of this denial is not legible—the storm simply defers, the light "wins," and she descends unharmed, already anticipating repetition. No live option is foreclosed, no visible trade-off enacted. Escalation reads as atmospheric accumulation rather than agency under pressure narrowing her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why some people magnetize stories—is signaled early and coheres. One meaningful tightening occurs when the dye master unfolds the wing in the village square and the stories come through him, forcing a realization that narrows his initial question. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency (he chooses to travel, to paint) and the cost is visible (the wing dissolves, his arms burn). No major reversal; the discovery flows smoothly without friction or competing options that test commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: understanding the labyrinth's relationship to broken things and sorrow, tied to Elias's role as keeper. Pressure accumulates through the sextant's disassembly (each screw a held breath, each piece pulsing), peaks when he feels the astronomer's quantified grief, and deepens with the trees-witness realization that reconfigures his work from repair to conduit. One meaningful tightening: the mirror reflection showing the stranger's face, then Elias again, crystallizes his understanding and sends him back to the north wall crack with new purpose. Agency is enacted through the decision to continue his work ("He had work to do"), an Earned Stasis with conceptual cost—he accepts the weight of being the one who "passed the sorrow along." The escalation is textural and contemplative rather than causal; coincidence (finding the sextant) complicates but does not resolve, fitting the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (rekindle the dying realm) is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when Liora's solo song receives response from the mirror world, narrowing her task from impossible solitary labor to communal restoration. Cost is visible: throat burning, bleeding fingers, and the line "It wasn't just the realm that had been dying. It was her" makes the personal price legible. Agency drives escalation—she chooses to dig, to sing louder, to persist. However, the villagers' arrival lacks dramatized trigger; they appear at closure without prior complication or choice that would summon them, reading as coincidental resolution rather than earned by protagonist action. The persistent constraint (trapped memories, hungry trees) shapes her tactics effectively until the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Lena's guilt and need to reconcile her mistake—is signaled early. The invitation and the hidden chamber deepen the pressure, but the escalation is primarily atmospheric rather than agonistic. Voss's reflection offers absolution rather than a dilemma; Lena doesn't face a trade-off or forgo a live option. The clock striking midnight is a temporal marker but doesn't tighten tactics. The locking of the door forecloses hiding, but the choice feels granted by spectral permission rather than earned through on-page agency under competing pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: restoring the city's refusal to adjust to horror, signaled early through Liora's observation and the vanished bakery. The tightening occurs when Liora plants crumbs and the wheat erupts, forcing the city to stop adjusting; guards abandon posts, the prince returns. Her agency (baking, distributing loaves) drives the escalation under the Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual but legible: years of normalized strangeness are confronted. No reversals required by this lens; the deepening through baking is sufficient and the price (the city's absolution being "tenuous") charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (extract meaning before vows fade) is signaled early and the collapsing shelf provides escalation. The door marked "Remember" and the bridge are tightening moves that narrow Elias's options. However, the woman's appearance as an invitation rather than a complication flattens the pressure; she offers resolution without requiring a trade-off. The final step onto the bridge costs Elias his ledger and his life's work, but the text tells us "The bridge held" and "the air smelled of spring" without showing what he relinquishes or fears losing, so the cost is conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (avenge father/settle debt) is signaled immediately and drives all tactics. The tightening occurs when Lena's false-starts bait transforms into the laugh—"the first crack in the ice"—narrowing Veyne's options and crystallizing his exposure. Agency is hers: the trap, the timing, the refusal. Cost is legible: she must carry the knowledge of trust breaking and relinquish direct vengeance, accepting the market's justice. The market's rules provide the persistent constraint that shapes her method.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding weather-carriers—is signaled early, but escalation reads as atmospheric intensification rather than narrowing options through protagonist agency. The compass ring's dissolution is a meaningful turn, yet it happens *to* Lira rather than *through* her choice. The cost of becoming the storm is felt abstractly ("the world tilted… *forward*") but not tied to a visible trade-off or foreclosed path on the page. The forests' vote introduces pressure but lacks causal linkage to her prior actions.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (uncork suppressed creativity) signals early and tightens once when Elias presses the lock to the painting and turns the dial "to a memory"—this narrows options from safe charcoal to irreversible color. The cost is visible: arms burning, leaving the lantern, ascending with color-stained fingers. No second reversal is required at this length. Minor gap: the mother's paint tubes resolve a problem (lack of color) they did not help create on the page, slightly softening agency.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will continue gilding truth or embrace raw candor—is signaled early and tightens through the map assembly, Archive discovery, and writing sequence. The pedestal's question ("What did you come to say?") deepens pressure by forcing articulation. However, the escalation feels somewhat linear rather than a true reversal or complication; the Archive grants permission rather than testing Elias's resolve against a counterpressure. The final choice (not opening the new fragment) forecloses his old craft with felt cost, meeting the length's requirement for one meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.2)
    One dominant stake—preserving wonder through kinetic sculpture—is signaled early and maintained. The ice-shattering beat delivers a meaningful tightening: the sculpture spins faster, the ice thins, and the moment of release narrows to a single perfect sound. However, escalation is largely textural rather than driven by protagonist agency or opposition. Liora kneels, sets, exhales, watches—but no decision or renunciation forecloses a live option. The piece accumulates pressure through image and cadence rather than through choices that alter tactics or reveal trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (Elias's stasis vs. change) is signaled early through the static and box, then tightened by the magnetic shift forcing the burn decision. The fire is protagonist-driven agency with visible cost: years of growth reduced to ash, his fears dissolved, and the final walk forecloses his caretaker identity. The escalation operates under a causal lens—discovery narrows options, burn pays the price, departure completes the arc—with one clear reversal (from preservation to destruction to departure). No coincidence rescues; the woman's prior departure seeds but does not solve Elias's choice.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—honoring Elena's voice and facilitating communal healing—is signaled early. The mailbox opening provides one meaningful tightening, but Mira's agency is limited: she observes, opens, and shares without facing a competing cost or trade-off. The resolution (community members leaving replies) happens off-page by noon, softening the immediacy. Under the Accumulative lens, one clear deepening is present, but the escalation lacks a visible price that forecloses an option for Mira herself.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—unlock the scientist's final cipher and decide what to do with his secrets—is signaled early and tightens when the dice trigger the failsafe. One meaningful escalation: Lira must dance to "LIBERATE," then chooses to flood the lab, dissolving the journals and sinking the dice. Agency is clear (she presses the console, dances, kicks upward), and the cost is visible (the scientist's name forgotten, the lab a tomb). However, the choice to liberate feels predetermined by theme rather than tested by a live obstacle; no credible counter-pressure forces her to weigh keeping the secrets. The escalation is a deepening more than a tightening, which fits the Accumulative lens but slightly softens the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear early: recover his wife's vanished memories. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through the stone's shifting weight and the chamber's gravitational pull, tightening to the moment when the stone disintegrates and he glimpses her silhouette—a reversal that narrows his options and forces recognition. The final act (discarding his tools) is driven by his agency and carries visible cost: he forfeits his method but commits to beginning again. The ending leaves consequences open yet legible, with the stirring below suggesting persistent danger. Strong escalation and cost clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake ("hush a prophecy") is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page reversal tightens options or forces a trade-off with visible cost. The snap of the prophecy-thread reads as a micro turn, yet she does not pursue a new tactic—she simply waits, and the wing drifts back "lighter." Agency is passive (receiving the wing's return) rather than a decision or renunciation that forecloses a path. Escalation under the Accumulative lens requires a cadence shift or density increase that reweights the stake; here the arc flattens into lyric stasis without pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—learning the building's language to understand its whispers—is signaled early and tightens when Elias signs the blood contract, which opens the building's grief and transforms passive listening into active interrogation. The woman's silhouette revelation and Elias's question "What did you do to her?" supply a meaningful deepening with felt cost (he staggers, the building exhales decades of grief). Agency operates through renunciation and inheritance: Elias accepts the tutor cycle, foreclosing a path away from the brownstone's demands. The escalation is Accumulative; one decisive intensification (contract signing) is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—preserving memory against erasure—is signaled early and drives all major choices. Liora's decision to bury the shell at the lattice heart narrows options (she cannot retrieve it) and the patrol's arrival forces her final stance. The cost is legible: her body dragged away, yet her archive persists. However, escalation relies on a single tightening (the archival act) rather than multiple reversals, and the patrol's hesitation when touching the light reads as externally imposed resistance rather than a choice-driven complication.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—undoing the Emperor's decrees and confronting the regime's cruelty—is signaled early and sustained. The forger's choice to stay rather than flee, the thorn's application, and the Emperor's request to be taught constitute a meaningful tightening that narrows options and imposes cost (the forger's life's work dissolves, the Emperor's authority collapses). The reversal from vengeance to forgiveness is thematically coherent, yet the Emperor's capitulation arrives without prior dramatized struggle or tactical resistance, softening the earned quality of the turn. Coincidence does not resolve, but the Emperor's sudden vulnerability feels insufficiently contested, capping escalation in the upper-7 band.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—learning why some people echo—is signaled early and drives Veyra's descent. Pressure accumulates through progressive disclosure (name, location, then mechanism), and the confrontation with Kaelis tightens when she realizes he's been severing threads to ensure silence. Her sung response using the nexus's voice is a clear act of agency that narrows options (threads snap, Kaelis loses his power). However, the resolution hinges on a late-breaking ability (singing the universe's voice through the shell) not foreshadowed in her skillset, and Kaelis's defeat feels abrupt without visible struggle or tactical cost to Veyra.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—Lena helping the widow see the true ghost—is signaled early and tightens through the globe ritual. The widow's misidentification becomes a revelation with cost: she must redirect grief from husband to son's survival. Lena's own closure moment (salvaging her mother's fragments) deepens the theme with visible constraint. The escalation reads clearly under the Accumulative lens through ritual intensification. Minor issue: the fisherman's toy backstory arrives late and could have seeded earlier to maximize earned reversal weight.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is legible: appreciating and perpetuating hidden patterns/effort. Kael's teaching moment (the minnows responding to Liora's whistle) narrows her worldview and the handoff of the whisk at closure enacts a trade-off—she inherits the philosopher's labor. One meaningful tightening occurs when Liora's initial skepticism ("Why fix what no one sees?") gives way to embodied participation. The cost is conceptual (accepting unseen work) rather than sharply felt in a moment of renunciation, which keeps escalation pressure moderate but coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—excavating the truth behind the Hollow Star myth—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when Elias discovers the stillpoint pushes back with "meaning" and the reconstructed letters hint at a quarantine rather than accident. However, the escalation lacks a meaningful on-page trade-off or narrowing of options; Elias moves from discovery to acceptance without a beat where he must choose between competing goods or face a visible price. The tremor and uncoiling entity arrive as external events rather than consequences of his agency, and coincidence (the voice on the radio, the entity's awakening) drives the climax rather than protagonist decision.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will "carve the dawn" or "let it carve" him—is signaled early and sustained, but escalation under the Causal lens is thin: the storm tightens, the crack appears, the voice demands a choice, and Elias acts. The reversal (sealing then breaking the portico) reads more as a decisive pivot than a turn that narrows options through cost; we don't see what he loses by choosing to open rather than lock. The voices wail in "betrayal" but no tactical consequence or trade-off materializes on the page. Agency is present (he acts deliberately), but the price—becoming the prophet, the city rising—feels more like ascension than sacrifice, undercutting the promised dilemma between allegiances.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: Elias's need to preserve/translate sounds versus isolation. The girl's arrival provides meaningful escalation—his choice to give rather than hoard narrows options and forecloses his prior path. One substantive tightening occurs when he places her hand on the music box, choosing transmission over possession. Cost is legible: he relinquishes his exclusive claim to the preserved past. The conflict lacks a second reversal, but one deepening is sufficient at this length under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: the artifact is "a bomb" and the ice is thinning. One meaningful tightening occurs when she must act before the tide turns and the ice fails. Her agency is a decision with on-page cost: turning the key unravels her "cell by cell." The monks' misunderstanding of absolution versus her insight ("matching") sets up the reversal. The cost is visible in her ragged gasps and transformation. No antagonist appears, but the sphere's unstable energy and the ice's decay supply coherent pressure under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—proving that patience can enact revolution—is signaled early and pursued throughout. However, escalation is minimal: Lior listens, hears a tremor, and the viaduct rises without his active intervention. No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows his options; the sister's accusation is background, and the "others" remain offstage. The final act (stepping onto the viaduct) is a gesture of validation rather than a decision under competing pressures. Cost is implied (leaving the sanctuary) but not viscerally felt or shown to foreclose a live alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—exposing the city's deliberate erasure of Underground Railroad routes—is signaled early and escalates through discovery of fresh brickwork and imminent flooding. The sealed wall and water seepage create genuine pressure that narrows options. Elias's decision to run toward the archives rather than retreat represents agency, though the cost (drowning risk, career jeopardy) is more implied than dramatized. One meaningful tightening (wall trembling, water breaking through) is present and sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Elias's need to stop waiting and act on long-deferred apologies—is signaled early and tightens when the heart's melody prompts him to retrieve the twelve-year letter. The peak choice (sealing and mailing the letter, then beginning more) narrows his prior paralysis to commitment, with visible cost (the storm walk, the exposure of shame). Under the accumulative lens, one deepening plus the final sequence constitutes sufficient escalation for this length. No antagonist is required; the constraint is internal and temporal.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—achieving flight that transcends falling—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure tightens through repeated crash-test cycles and culminates when the new wings "listened" and she transitions from falling to conducting. The arrow tip's integration and the kaleidoscope's blueprint moment deepen her approach. Agency is visible in her decision to lash the arrow to her chestplate and leap despite the other gliders' warnings. Cost is legible: the workshop collapses, her body requires borrowed parts, and she must transliterate herself back together. However, the escalation reads more as iterative density increase than a decision that forecloses a live option with visible trade-off. The final leap after the workshop's destruction demonstrates commitment but doesn't dramatize a competing fear or sacrifice in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—finding Elias and the truth of the Astraeus erasure—is signaled early and escalates through the query notification, the numbers trail, and the override confrontation. The system's resistance ("Access denied") creates a clear obstacle Lena must choose to breach, raising stakes to termination. The crystal insertion is a decisive act with immediate consequence: files flood back, alarms wail, flagged for death. The cost is legible and immediate. One micro-turn when the numbers rearrange to reveal her mother's birthdate deepens emotional pressure without diluting the primary drive.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preventing the girl from standing alone on the ice—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is thin: Elias decides to wait and step forward, but no on-page reversal or complication narrows his options. The child never appears in scene, so the confrontation with the ice is anticipated rather than dramatized. The cost of his choice (stepping onto dangerous ice, shattering his tools) is legible but not tested; coincidence does not resolve, but agency is limited to a single decision without visible friction or trade-off that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—whether to proceed with the clinic appointment—is signaled early and tightens through the ice-crossing beat, which narrows her stance from "learning endings" to risking connection. The laugh is a meaningful micro-turn. However, the cancellation itself happens off-page between paragraphs without visible trade-off or friction; we're told the reason ("wrong kind of ending") but don't see her weigh what she loses by staying. One on-page tightening (ice-crossing) plus one told pivot limits escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is Lior's intersubjective reckoning with Mira's absence and their mismatch. One meaningful deepening occurs when he finds the letter, traces her words, and shifts from confusion to understanding that "the mismatch itself had been the point." The tightening is conceptual rather than a live decision that narrows tactical options. Escalation is present but subtle; the piece leans accumulative, so pressure coheres through layered reflection rather than a discrete reversal. Cost is implied in his return to solitary work but not foregrounded as a visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve the clearing's memory against the prophet's erasure—is signaled in the first two paragraphs and coheres throughout. One meaningful tightening: the parapet "groaned, then sang" after Lysan recalls "the shape of silence," the clearing's edges sharpening from blur to hold. Agency is renunciation and endurance (kneeling, staying, touching light and reverent) with visible cost: the weight in her chest, the knowledge she cannot hold it forever but "long enough." The voice's regretful "*You can't hold it forever*" and Lysan's measured reply dramatize the tradeoff between immediate rescue and long-term survival. Under Accumulative lens, the single consecration deepens rather than reverses, fitting the inferred mode.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: transmute the town's grief into collective healing through art. Pressure accumulates through gathering images and waiting for the right light, but no live complication tests the protagonist's approach—the girl, butterfly, and light all cooperate. The photograph is taken without resistance or cost; the bakery son's future response is narrated rather than dramatized. One meaningful deepening occurs (adding lavender to the case beside the weeping man's photo), but escalation remains gentle and the final act feels assured rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.7)
    The dominant stake—decode the crystal's pattern to understand why the world went quiet—is signaled early and tightens when the woman reveals the phenomenon is global, raising the cost from personal obsession to collective testimony. Elias's agency is clear: he chooses to speak to the crystal, maps the distortions, and decides to collaborate. The tightening is meaningful (one crystallization is sufficient at this length) and the cost is visible: he abandons solitary pursuit. The woman's arrival could read as coincidental timing, but it complicates rather than resolves, which is acceptable under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Elias's need to locate something unnamed—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The sculpture's animation provides a tightening moment, yet Elias's response (running toward, pressing the tape) is reactive rather than a trade-off that forecloses a live option. The final release of arrows hints at renunciation but the cost (what he gives up by stopping) is not legible enough to enter the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—whether to let the observatory collapse or "restructure the moment"—is signaled by midpoint and tightens when Elias climbs to the turret. His decision to touch the spinning hand and match its rhythm narrows options (from fixing to flowing) and forecloses his former identity as repairer. However, the escalation lacks a visible price paid on the page: the astronomers' miracle and his departure are reported consequences rather than dramatized friction. Under the Accumulative lens, the cadence shift and pattern break suffice for one meaningful deepening, but the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt in the moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: executing a goodbye that honors rather than begs. Pressure tightens when Mrs. Calloway's bitterness ("hell of a hymn") gives way to memory, then to acceptance ("You play it flawless"), forcing Lena to stay present through the nurse's arrival. The vinyl drop is protagonist-driven renunciation that forecloses maternal grief with visible cost. Agency is clear in Lena's choice to play despite protest, to remain until breathing slows, and to release the shard—each narrowing her options under the inferred Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering where shadows go—is signaled early and tightens when the automaton reveals they "feed" and Elara must choose whether to open the second door. The warning "became the first shadow to walk at noon" raises cost, and her decision forecloses return (door seals). However, escalation is linear; the automaton's compliance is convenient, and no failed attempt or tactical shift appears before the final crossing, so pressure accumulates more than it compounds.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding why the substitute wore her brother's shape—is signaled early and drives Liora's entry into the garden. One meaningful tightening occurs when the changeling presses its forehead to hers, flooding her with memories and reframing the problem. The final bargain ("You can have him back, but you have to make it right") lacks on-page resistance or visible cost; the changeling's compliance feels frictionless, and no live option is foreclosed at the moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: passing the knowledge of stillness-light to the next generation, signaled early through "keeper" and grandmother memory. The girl's arrival provides one tightening (a live student appears), but pressure remains static rather than escalating—Liora faces no cost, refusal, or internal conflict when accepting the role. The coincidental timing (child arrives exactly when Liora is ready) undercuts agency. The "weight of understanding" in the girl's grip gestures toward cost but does not dramatize it with a visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—escaping the noise and grafting new meaning onto old wounds—is signaled early. The piece offers one meaningful deepening: Lena's decision to proffer the pendant narrows her options (she gives up her grandmother's anchor) and charges the final image. However, the escalation is more textural than causal; Javier's arrival and his kneeling feel facilitated rather than forced by prior pressure. The cost is felt but oblique—Lena loses her protective object yet gains "the moss"—without a visible trade-off that alters later tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias's struggle to finish *The Drowning Hour* and release control—is signaled early and tightens when the cameo figures appear and the faceless composite confronts him. One meaningful reversal occurs: his manuscript begins writing itself, forcing him to choose between continued control and surrender to the current. The cost is visible (his body vanishes, the story remakes him) and the resolution is earned by his agency (pressing the seashell, murmuring "I'm listening," writing faster, letting the water take him). Coincidence does not resolve; the figures and ink-bleeding are consequences of his proximity to the nexus and his willingness to listen.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—restore the arbor or lose the village's luck—is signaled early and remains coherent under the accumulative lens. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira's first note cracks yet the arbor responds, raising the cost of continuing. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency (her decision to sing despite trembling) and the price is legible (throat burned, chest tight). However, the resistance is largely internal; no external complication or second reversal tests her commitment mid-song, and the vines' cooperation feels immediate rather than grudging, reducing tension in the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving starlight—is signaled early and accumulates through repeated attempts. The piece offers one deepening: the realization "she had not been preserving light. She had been teaching it how to stay." However, escalation operates via thematic intensification rather than a narrowing of options or a live trade-off with visible cost. No reversal or tactical pivot emerges from failure or resistance; the alchemist succeeds on this attempt without dramatized friction.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—capturing wonder to answer his daughter's question and preserve fleeting moments—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the wounded season nears its end, forcing faster work as echoes thin. The wife's lullaby surfacing is a micro-turn that validates the mechanism's potential, narrowing options to "take it home" or abandon the project. The final choice to leave the timer running forecloses secrecy and exposes the work to discovery, a visible cost. However, the locksmith faces no meaningful opposition or complication; gears align smoothly, and the mechanism works on the first attempt, reducing felt struggle. The escalation reads as internal urgency (seasonal deadline) rather than antagonistic pressure or failed attempts.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—releasing collected burdens to avoid dissolution—is clear and tested on the page. The sequence tightens: fisherman's grief crumbles, blacksmith's rage flakes, child's fear clings, then the grotto reverses pressure by offering back all prior weights. This reversal narrows Elira's options and forces the conceptual trade: she can no longer collect without being claimed. The cost is legible in her vanishing and the villagers' loss of her presence. One friction: the grotto's counter-move arrives without prior setup, so the escalation reads more as reveal than consequence of her prior choices.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—containing/releasing the husband's memory through carving—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the widow decides not to take the mid-leap lion to market. The girl's question functions as a micro-turn that crystallizes the widow's understanding ("Here and gone"), and the final choice to keep the carving forecloses the prior pattern of selling, a renunciation with visible cost (no market income, but a lesson harvested). Agency is embodied in the decision to place the lion in light rather than currency. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: each carving attempt deepens her engagement with impermanence until the resolution becomes inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake signaled early: Lira collects fragments to ensure the architect-self "doesn't follow me," establishing a reckoning with eroded ambition. Pressure deepens when the lagoon births multiple past selves and the chorus of "You left us all" forces acknowledgment. The final leap is protagonist-driven agency under the Accumulative lens—she chooses surrender over evasion—and forecloses the scavenger path with visible cost (hands pull her under, she doesn't struggle). The ghost's "bring something better than a camera" adds a constraint that reweights tactics at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—solving the terminal's failed equation and finding a way *through*—is signaled early and tightens when Lena maps the sextant's angles to traveler paths, then narrows further when she repurposes the bypass schematics to include the pedestrian bridge. One meaningful on-page reversal occurs when the hydroponics system sighs open, revealing the terminal isn't abandoned but *resurrecting*. The escalation is driven by Lena's agency (tracing, slotting, calculating) under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible but muted: she forgoes the restoration fantasy and accepts imperfect passage, yet the sacrifice doesn't fully foreclose a live option with visible emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: make peace with the abandoned dream by releasing it rather than completing it to elder specifications. The story signals this early ("the dream he had abandoned") and tightens it through the scribe's kneeling choice, the deliberate fracture, and the asymmetrical assembly. The first chime ("a sob, the second a gasp") reweights the dream with emotional cost. Agency is clear: the scribe chooses to "let the fracture spread" and arranges the pieces "as they had always wanted to be." The ending forecloses the elder-approved path with visible cost (the broken forecourt, the scattered gears). The price—heresy, ruin in the elders' eyes—is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake (understanding her father's lie-architecture vs. letting go) is signaled early and tightens once when the sundial's shadow "points inward," triggering the marshes detour and ledger-drop. That move forecloses the mapped chase with visible cost (years of pursuit, the ledger itself). The final turn—steering back to docks but planning to refuse sale—adds a second meaningful narrowing. Agency is clear (her decisions drive each turn) and the Accumulative lens supports the gradual reweighting. Pressure coheres but escalation is modest; the middle marshes passage accumulates mood more than rising stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: preserve the archive the secret weavers left behind. The rope's fulgurite knot provides one meaningful tightening—Elias discovers it's a preservation device, not a storm ward—that reweights his goal from passive collection to active tending. Agency at closure is a micro-choice (splicing in the seed pod), but no live opposition or trade-off appears; the harbor "answers" cooperatively, and no visible price (time, stamina, social cost) alters his tactics. The escalation reads as deepening understanding rather than narrowing options under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias chronicling the prince's absence to help the princess heal—is signaled early but never tested or complicated. No reversal occurs: Elias finds the locket, interprets it, and will deliver his conclusion without friction or trade-off. The piece declares escalation ("The thread grew warm… pulsing like a heartbeat") but the mechanics remain vague and cost-free. The final assertion that "he would be ready to board" introduces a new goal without prior setup or visible price. Pressure is asserted through metaphor rather than dramatized through narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—reawakening beauty in a mechanical world—is signaled early and tightened when Aldric pierces the egg's membrane, narrowing options from hypothesis to irreversible act. The creature's birth constitutes a meaningful deepening: instead of the legendary sky-singer, something "new" and flawed emerges, reweighting the prince's goal with visible cost (the palace shudders, advisors will call it failure). Agency is clear in the prince's choice to assemble tools and pierce the membrane despite "quaking certainty" of doom. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through escalating images, and the final moment forecloses the path of mechanical efficiency with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (proving compassion as strength, not weakness) is signaled but never concretely tested. The boy's rescue is low-cost: Liora faces no dilemma, no material trade-off, no choice that forecloses another path. The village's whispers remain distant threat rather than present pressure. The final alarm offers potential escalation but occurs off-page. One tightening is present (wound-binding with the red thread), but it demonstrates existing skill rather than forcing a values-choice under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: liberating trapped memories, signaled early and tested at the door and in the chamber. One meaningful tightening occurs when the younger-voice hiss creates friction and Liora hesitates before pulling. Agency is decision (pressing box, pulling threads, leaving) but the younger voice's challenge resolves without sustained negotiation or visible trade-off that narrows future options. The chamber trembling and voices unmuzzling imply consequence, yet the departure ("didn't wait to see what happened next") sidesteps on-page aftermath cost. Escalation is present but the peak choice lacks a hard either/or that forecloses a path with legible price to Liora herself.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: escape the cycle of bloom-decay without using fire. The gear's sonar pinging narrows options by revealing one path with a cost (memory). Veyra's agency—choosing to forfeit the memory of her first bloom—forecloses return and breaks the pattern. Pressure tightens once through the reveal-and-price structure. The cost is on the page (memory taken, garden left, others will not understand). No antagonist or second reversal is required; the single deepening suffices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—discovering the shape of collective grief—is signaled early and tightens through the father's lesson ("Grief isn't a line. It's the space between them"). The carver's chisel slip and the resulting crack in Liora's stone provide a micro-reversal that deepens pressure. Agency manifests in the shift from etching letters to hollowing space, then in the decision to teach the daughter. The cost is visible: fifteen years of weight, the scream never voiced, and the acceptance of guidance from the dead. The final image of the butterfly on the table forecloses solitary mourning and commits the family to shared ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: restore communal acknowledgment of unspoken debts. One meaningful tightening occurs when the pendulum's pause "felt different—longer, heavier," prompting Elias to press the rake to the bob and accept the council's future wrath. Agency is clear: he chooses to alter the chime's cadence knowing it will provoke outrage. The final act (reaching for the knife to carve the next name) forecloses normal re-entry into village life with felt cost. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; no second reversal is required at this length. The backstory-heavy structure means the on-page escalation moment is brief, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—discovering the shape of intentions knotted in the tapestry—is signaled early and tightens through three progressive knot-unravelings that release scent, voices, and vision. The final knot's noose of silver thread delivers a meaningful turn: the widow wanted truth unraveled, not buried. Cost is legible on the page (Elias now carries the knowledge and will confront her at dawn), and the escalation is driven by protagonist agency. However, the chess match and widow's presence feel more framing than pressure-applying, and no live loss (time, safety, social cost) alters tactics mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is seeding innovation within constraint, signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the hesitation before the first stroke narrows options, and the spire's song validates her coaxing. Agency is renunciation ("stepping back"), consistent with Accumulative lens. The cost is conceptual—control relinquished—but no live tactic is visibly altered or resource spent on the page. Band guardrail for 8.0+ requires a trade-off; here the price remains implied.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—restoring stories to the city under threat of execution—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the girl arrives with transcribed lyrics, validating the broadcast's reach and raising the stakes by revealing a traceable listener. Elias's decision to let her broadcast ("What do you want to say?") narrows options with visible risk: the Ministry will know the alcove's location. However, the escalation is muted because the Ministry's response occurs off-page in summary, and Elias's vanishing feels more like author intervention than a choice with dramatized cost. The piece leans accumulative, and pressure coheres under that lens, but the final beat substitutes report for scene.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: to crystallize fleeting emotion through controlled dissolution and viewer perception—"the mirage of safety." One tightening occurs when Liora scatters powder over the ashes, knowing it will last only hours, creating urgency for the patrons' encounter. The reversal is micro: she burned the portrait because understanding was "the enemy of art," converting comprehension into deliberate incompletion. Agency is present in the burning and scattering, though the renunciation of understanding could carry more on-page friction or trade-off. The cost—perpetual motion, never settling—is legible in the final image of her kneeling in the next city. Escalation is modest but coherent under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—preserving truth against official erasure—is signaled early and tightens through Veyra's warning, Elias's week of vault-building, and the final confrontation. Escalation is causal and protagonist-driven: he moves from polishing one cog to hoarding an archive to blocking the pumps with his body. The foreman's laugh and "History's written by the dry" mark the reversal where Elias's physical stand cannot stop the machinery. The cost is unambiguous: he drowns, the clerk records "structural failure," but the cog ticks on in the silt—a trade-off between witness and survival that the story earns through prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—braiding diverse voices into harmony after hatred unlearned the choir—is signaled early and tightens when only four remain. One meaningful deepening occurs: Elias places the rosette in the center and invites presence over loudness, prompting the others to hum the negative space. Agency is clear (decision to hum, invitation to join) and forecloses the path of silence with felt cost (fragility, thinness of voices). The contralto's arrival and the tenor's hesitant touch are micro-reversals that test commitment. Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens and the final hum reweights the possibility of harmony.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—Elias's desire to reconcile his gift with purpose—is signaled early but remains static. No meaningful tightening occurs: he finds the seed, plants it, harvests it, and shares it in linear sequence without opposition or complication. The critics and elders are mentioned as abstract pressure but never materialize on-page to test his choice. The "first dish" moment is summarized rather than dramatized. Agency is present (he chooses to cook rather than sell/hoard) but the choice faces no visible cost or foreclosed path—no patron rejects him, no consequence lands within the story's frame.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder against routine—is signaled early and tightens when Elias climbs the tower with the irreplaceable seed. The choice to plant it forecloses returning to his father's legacy and accepting predictable disbelief. One meaningful deepening: the beehive's chaotic flight reweights the blackout from failure to invitation. Cost is visible (empty lacquer box, future engineer interrogation) and scaled to this length. However, the engineers' future response is only predicted, not tested on the page, and the city's "stopped looking up" diagnosis is asserted in exposition rather than pressured by a live obstacle during the climb or planting.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (understanding alive houses) is signaled early and sustained. The orris shard placement and ritual arrangement constitute one meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens. The final renunciation (leaving the shard) narrows options with felt cost. However, the escalation is gentle—no sharp reversal or high-stakes choice tests commitment. The voice whispering "You're close now" adds a micro turn but doesn't sharply raise pressure. Cost is visible but understated.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: stop the poisoning of the "sea's new god" (initially human's goal, inverted to Liora's). One meaningful deepening: each revelation narrows the human's certainty until the ampoule slips. Agency at closure is present—pressing the seam, removing the helmet—though the human's compliance feels guided rather than wrestled. Cost is legible (drowning as transformation) but the helmet removal forecloses survival without visible struggle or trade-off internal to the human's want versus fear.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake signaled early: to understand the staircase/missed opportunity, later reweighted to choosing the climb itself. One meaningful tightening: the chipped die's stutter narrows her options from abstract proof to concrete sideways leap, forcing the door to appear. Agency is clear: she hurls the dice, runs sideways, presses the door, turns back—each decision forecloses a path. Cost is visible: leaving the smooth die, abandoning the café threshold, accepting perpetual motion as her stance. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through the dice experiment and the rupture discovery. No coincidence resolves; the door appears because she acts on her proof.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake: proving strangers remember kindness, signaled by the opening (forty-three nights awake) and the calligrapher's gift. One meaningful tightening: the child's laughter enters, prompting the painter to transcribe it into the dying script, which triggers the leaf's disappearance and the painter's first sleep. The cost is legible—exhaustion, the brush worn by "more than one hand," the leaf gone—but remains largely conceptual. Agency is clear (the painter chooses to write the laughter) but the external pressure is atmospheric rather than confrontational.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—rescue dying arts—is signaled early and tightens when Liora sees the hands slipping beneath the city's foundations. The lens revelation forces a meaningful choice: preserve the singular artifact or disperse its power. The beekeeper's absorption raises cost, though his vanishing three winters ago blunts immediacy. Pressure accumulates through the baker's clumsy letters and the child's dry loaf, culminating in Liora's shattering act that forecloses hoarding in favor of collective renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—stepping beyond fate—is signaled early and tightens when Elias pulls the yoyo, triggering the stones to reveal the path. One meaningful pressure point (the mechanism's song, the path opening) narrows options under the Accumulative lens. However, escalation is atmospheric rather than decision-driven: Elias faces no on-page dilemma or cost-bearing choice at the threshold; he steps without hesitation. The price (erasure from the world) is conceptual and arrives after the act, not as a visible tradeoff that shapes the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake: confront the doppelgänger to end the photographic curse. One meaningful tightening: Lysander lunges through the thing and pulls the filmstrip, which causes the funhouse to shudder and the thing to dissolve. Agency is present (the lunge, the choice to let the filmstrip burn). Cost is legible but muted: the clasp "now held a new kind of hunger," implying an ongoing burden, and the final "Next" suggests unfinished business. The escalation is clear under the Accumulative lens (mirrors weep, the funhouse exhales, the reflection winks), but the price is more conceptual than visceral. The advisor's voice and the final lipstick "Next" imply Lysander has entered a cycle rather than escaped, which reweights but doesn't fully dramatize the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—turning storm resistance into rhythm—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the rising "hum" and Leeward's escalating strikes, but this is primarily atmospheric intensification rather than a narrowing of options or a trade-off with visible cost. The sea's answer and Leeward's laugh feel like arrival at a goal rather than a choice that forecloses a path. No meaningful reversal or tightening that alters tactics is dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: understanding the watchers and the expedition's fate. Pressure accumulates through each revelation (map crack, harmonic reply, watchers' advance, twin gate) and tightens when Elyas blows the final sequence, forcing the watchers to approach and the gate to open. Agency is present in his decision to sound the notes and step forward, with visible cost (whistle crumbles, city destabilizes). One meaningful deepening occurs when the shells reveal the expedition was "taken" rather than lost, narrowing Elyas's options to confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: expose the ledger's truth before the Church buries it again. Pressure tightens when Callahan arrives and calls the police, forcing Elias to act. However, the escalation is external (someone else's radio call) rather than driven by Elias's agency; he counters with documents but doesn't risk or sacrifice on the page. The resolution—slipping into shadows with a photo—avoids rather than confronts cost. One reversal (the archivist's warning) initiates the scene, but the climax lacks a trade-off that forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake signaled early: Elias seeks to "wrest meaning from what others abandoned." One meaningful tightening occurs when he finds the stranger's note and replies, then escalates when he discovers the century-dead Keeper mirrored his obsession. Agency is present—he chooses to seal his own note, trade the inkwell—but the pressure feels reflective rather than urgent. The cost (giving up the heirloom) is visible but quiet; no live option is foreclosed under duress, only gently redirected.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is established early: Elias seeks to trace honest origins and expose historical erasures. The stamp's coordinates create one meaningful tightening—he must act during the blackout window before noise returns. The discovery of his own name in the ledger is a reversal that narrows options: continue the quest or accept surveillance and return to work. He chooses the latter, a renunciation with visible cost (leaves the book, keeps working in silence). The blackout clock provides pressure but the three-day jump dilutes immediacy. Agency is present but the resolution leans more toward acceptance than a high-cost trade-off that redefines his situation.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—completing the basilica to recover her daughter's voice and transform grief—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens in one meaningful turn: the gem installation causes pain ("the kind that didn't just hurt but *rewrote*"), forcing the maker into the recording itself, which narrows her choice to surrender or resist. She chooses surrender ("let go"), and the cost is visible: her dissolution into the dream-stuff. The escalation is driven by her agency (pressing the gem in despite its hunger), meeting the lens requirement. A minor friction: the cranes' sudden animation and the isle's reversal from sinking to rising feel more like consequences of her choice than obstacles she navigates, slightly softening the protagonist-driven tightening in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—find where potential pools—is signaled early ("pocket of unused time") and tightens when Lena places the geode on the console and keys in the frequency, narrowing options to reach/pull the thread or stop. The reversal occurs when the lattice resolves and one thread glows brighter, presenting the choice. Her agency is clear: she keys the frequency, ignores the warning, and reaches in, forecloses the path of passive survival with the cost that "The observatory's lights died." Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens (density increases from hospital→morgue→observatory→console) and the final "She was the perturbation" crystallizes her stance. The cost is visible (observatory shutdown, darkness) and conceptual (she chooses awakening over restoration).

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: decoding the frequency of belonging through the chip and observatory. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lena's drone seizes the chip, forcing the pilgrim's lunge and the observatory's response. The resolution—chip placement, constellation reveal, hand-clasp—narrows options (Lena "stops being surprised," accepts connection). Cost is legible but soft: the emotional price of "no longer being alone in the dark" is felt, yet no tactical trade-off or forfeited path is visible on the page. Escalation under Accumulative lens is present but single-beat.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will confront the truth of Harkin's disappearance—is signaled early and tightens when the note materializes with tomorrow's date. The piece escalates through textural accumulation: guilt intensifies from reflection to symbolic gesture (hurling the watch hand) to the forced decision (attending the meeting). Agency is clear in the final choice, though the stakes remain somewhat abstract; we understand the emotional cost of seven years' guilt but lack concrete consequences of what attending the meeting will cost or yield beyond closure of the internal loop.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—securing the boy's freedom—is signaled early ("the boy was Kaelis's nephew, taken for desertion") and escalates under Causal pressure: "They won't release the boy" → Elias adjusts terms with the drawer pull → Kaelis's memory tips the trade → the boy goes free. One meaningful tightening: the deal forecloses the cache location and requires Kaelis to trust Elias, narrowing options. The cost is visible: the war "limps on," Elias gives up his father's drawer pull, and the boy still faces an uncertain forgiveness. Agency is clear—Elias's decision to offer the cache and Kaelis's choice to accept—and coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—whether to leave or stay—is signaled early and tightens when Elias opens the letter, foreclosing the paddle-out option with visible cost (abandoning his navigator role). The decision to walk inland is protagonist-driven under the Accumulative lens. However, the bar scene and whiskey moment don't meaningfully escalate; they restate the turn rather than deepen it, and the post-office step is told in summary rather than dramatized with on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—choosing redemption over erasure—is signaled early but escalation remains largely atmospheric rather than decision-driven. The lake encounter intensifies pressure symbolically, but Liam's agency in throwing the baseball feels reactive to mystical prompting rather than hard-won turn that narrows live options. The chess-game ending suggests reconciliation, yet we don't see what concrete path he's foreclosing or what tactical cost he pays on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs (confronting his reflection), but the price lacks sharp edges.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: resurrect her brother, signaled early ("buried beneath the oldest tree," fortune's prophecy). Two conjuring attempts escalate through agency and visible cost: first try summons a flickering phantom, second collapses the stag into stardust. The fortune crumbling marks irreversible threshold. The final acceptance ("she was the bridge") narrows options—she cannot reclaim him unchanged—but the cost of becoming porous/hybrid could be more viscerally depicted in the ending image to reach higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—recovering lost time and finding her brother—is signaled early and remains coherent, but the escalation lacks a meaningful tightening that narrows Liora's options under pressure. The glade shifts, the brother appears, and the ink reveals the ledger-map without Liora making a high-cost decision that forecloses alternatives. The brother's directive to "repent... For time" initiates the release rather than Liora's agency driving the turn. One observable cost appears (her fingers pass through him, confirming loss), but it arrives passively rather than through protagonist choice, placing the piece in the functional mid-band for conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (open the locked dimension) is signaled early and pursued across multiple beats. Pressure tightens when the thread snaps, then escalates when the tear widens and hands reach through, forcing Lien to push despite fear. Agency is clear: she picks up the needle again, stitches, and crosses. The final act forecloses her old existence (the Eulogy is gone) with visible cost, and the child's presence reweights her isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding transformation—is signaled early and tightens when Elira discovers the prophecy. The decision to throw the vials into the lava narrows her path (she trades light for fire, fulfilling the prophecy), but the escalation is declarative rather than agonistic; no competing option is dramatized, so the choice feels inevitable without friction. The tide's recession raises the stakes externally, yet Elira's agency in stepping onto the raft reads passive—acceptance rather than a trade-off with visible cost. One tightening deepens pressure, but the cost at closure (empty hands, island arrival) is more implied than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—breaking Veythar's grip via the armory—is signaled early and escalates through clear causal steps: blackout timed to dial reset, hatch opened, armory unlocked, signal sent. Kael's agency drives each turn, and the cost is legible (siege engines to ash, fort's power broken, Kael now fugitive). One slip: the villagers' readiness is coincidental to Kael's success rather than tested on the page, and the final image asserts change ("the world had changed") rather than showing immediate consequence that forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: understanding and keeping the sacred patterns to prevent "something that wanted the promises broken." Pressure accumulates through her curse's repeated confirmations (eel flick, aurora flare, mother's voice crack) and tightens when the dust shivers, the aurora snaps into a ring, and the mirror-water reflects her unraveling. One meaningful deepening: realizing "the promise had never been to her. She was just the one cursed to keep it." Agency is present in her final push ("pressed her palms to the sand...and pushed"), though the eels' return and the patterns' mechanics feel partly automated. Cost is legible in bleeding fingers, dust in bones, and the永續 obligation ("place more tomorrow"), foreclosing escape.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—releasing the censored poem and the weight of unsaid words—is signaled early but never faces a meaningful on-page tightening or reversal. Elias moves from holding the poem to tearing it without a dramatized choice or visible cost; the storm provides atmospheric pressure but does not narrow his options. The timer chimes function as ambient beats rather than escalation devices. The final walk-out asserts relief ("each step lighter") but no prior scene tested his commitment or forced a trade-off. Under an Accumulative lens, the piece lacks a decisive deepening that reweights the stake with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—proving ethical governance theory—signals early and tightens when Elias realizes the sundial holds the answer, not the Council. The duel is a negotiation; each thrust and parry narrows interpretive options. Liora's twelve-year code forces Elias to see her buried question, escalating intellectual to relational stakes. The key's reveal and partnership decision land with felt cost: both abandon the Council's verdict for a shared map. One clean reversal when "You've been here before" reframes the duel from competition to test.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will stay or molt again—is signaled early via the "itch behind his ribs" and tightens through Maren's察觉 ("You're leaving") and his half-lie. The tin's reopening and the violet exchange constitute one meaningful deepening that narrows options and culminates in his choosing to remain ("the itch quieted"). Under the Accumulative lens, this qualifies as sufficient escalation with felt cost: he forecloses flight. However, the middle third recycles thematic assertions without new tactical pressure, and the guards' future threat ("would come eventually") hovers as abstract menace rather than on-page complication. Agency is present but gentle; the final renunciation is more contemplative than crucible-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake: reunion with the lost lover vs. endless solitary vigil. Lena's agency drives escalation: she studies compasses (desperation into plan), splices hidden frames into the film (strategically creative), threads the projector, plays piano to unfold the path, and walks through the manifested door. The story delivers one meaningful tightening when the compasses lock in unison and the film's path becomes real, narrowing her options to "walk or remain." Cost is visible: she abandons the old piano and station, the projector burns out, and she crosses a threshold that forecloses return. Minor limitation: the lover's arrival in the refuge risks feeling like reward without parallel cost on his side, though the dialogue ("You're late" / "So are you") implies mutual culpability.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—protecting collective memory from the hungry dreams—is signaled early and remains coherent. Liora's choice to bite the seed is a meaningful tightening that forecloses her former self with visible cost (violet teeth, altered perception, name forgotten). The discovery that "the island itself, trying to remember *her*" reverses the framing and deepens pressure. The monsoon arrival coinciding with her transformation creates convergence. However, the villagers' dreams as antagonistic force remain somewhat abstract; old Manik's forgetting is told rather than dramatized, reducing the urgency of the threat she's countering.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—finding the shape of unspoken apologies—is signaled early and tightens when Elias decodes the compass's lace pattern into an active method. The accumulative lens supports one meaningful deepening: from passive grief to ritual planting. Agency is clear in the choice to plant the compass, foreclosing the search for his brother. However, the escalation feels gentle rather than wrenching; no live option is visibly discarded with friction. The cost (accepting loss, releasing the need for literal reunion) is present but diffuse, not dramatically tested in a moment of competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake of escaping temporal entrapment escalates under Accumulative lens through density increases like photograph disintegration and the woman's warning.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)

Cost is legible in the geyser scene and his decision to carry the wheel. Pressure coheres under the causal lens, with no coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under Accumulative lens, escalation through density increase reweights stake of witnessing without judgment. Keeper's agency in ritual deepens cost of lost self. No explicit conflict, but internal stakes are felt and culminate in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—how Elias will relate to collapse and control—is clear and coherent, and it tightens as he moves from measuring stars to mapping rot to renouncing his prior professional script. Escalation is mostly internal and textural, not driven by hard external opposition. The sabbatical email and empty vial function as a credible, consequential stance crystallization. Still, the pressure remains very gentle, with little sense of real risk or competing obligation pushing back.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.6)
    The primary conflict is internal—how to respond to the fire’s devastation and the brother’s betrayal—and the stakes are existential rather than physical. The key escalation comes with recognizing her brother’s handwriting, which deepens the loss and complicates any fantasy of a clean, external villain. The later decision to drop the ledger and not hinge her path on it provides a real, if quiet, foreclosure of one option in favor of an uncomfortable ambiguity. However, tension remains mostly atmospheric; there’s little additional narrowing of options after the handwriting reveal, so pressure grows more in theme than in concrete dilemmas.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora can break or transform the imposed silence and what that does to the world—is signaled early and escalates as she shifts from failed key press to experimental fusion of emotion-map and frozen air, to world-level sonic rupture. Pressure tightens as she commits more of her body (bleeding fingers) and more of herself (embracing the storm instead of fleeing it). The final decision to sail back into the storm is clearly an earned, higher-stakes extension of her initial goal. The conflict remains more metaphysical and aesthetic than materially harrowing, which slightly mutes the visceral feel of “price paid” despite the strong conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring a signal so the dead can truly rest—is clear and present early, with a meaningful tightening when the ledger’s names blur and he realizes the city “wasn’t finished sinking.” Elias’s agency drives the escalation: he chooses to respond to the call, to carry the shard, to ascend the lighthouse, to exhale into the lens. The resolution is earned, with emotional and conceptual stakes rather than survival stakes, but overt opposition remains relatively soft (currents “insist” rather than truly endanger him). As a result, the conflict feels profound but somewhat cushioned, with limited on-page cost beyond fatigue and surrender to his role.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes—hunger versus punishment under sanctions—are clear and present from early on, and the burning of the arbor is a sharp tightening that forces Elias from secrecy to open declaration. The shift from anonymous runs to public distribution under armed scrutiny is a credible raising of risk. However, the patrols’ withdrawal comes with relatively little on-page cost beyond implied danger, so the consequences feel somewhat cushioned. The internal conflict between anonymity and visible leadership is present but could have been sharpened further in the decisive moment.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—can Elias finally locate and responsibly carry unused love—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates in a soft, lyric way: discovery of the Tear, the apparition, and the revelation of his past-life failure each deepen the emotional stakes. However, there is little friction or jeopardy once he engages with the jade; no option feels genuinely foreclosed or contested, and his final acceptance is almost immediately rewarded rather than tested. The piece has meaningful deepening but not a hard choice under pressure, which limits conflict intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora will be trapped in a retrocognitive loop or escape the maze’s temporal hunger—is established and escalates clearly once she steps into the photograph. Pressure deepens when she recognizes the pattern of others being trapped and chooses to run “sideways” and sacrifice the halo, foreclosing the path of further retrocognitive exploration. The cost is primarily conceptual and emotional rather than viscerally felt, which keeps the tension high but not razor-sharp. Still, the sequence from activation to near-entrapment to renunciation reads as a coherent, earned tightening under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—securing and planting the seeds as the wall falls—is clear from early on and tightens through the vault puzzle and guard encounter. The “impede, then proceed” instruction becomes a concrete tactic, yielding a satisfying reversal when Lena uses the piano to drop the guard. Escalation is present but a bit smooth; the puzzle solves without visible near-failure, and the guard is neutralized quickly, so pressure never fully peaks. Still, her choice to scatter all the seeds and leave with empty pockets reads as a meaningful commitment with ongoing cost.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Elias will relinquish his curated absences and accept a new way of relating to loss—is signaled early and deepened through the ritual of imprinting, especially the high-stakes choice of using his sister’s silence. Escalation arrives with the rekindled forge, the last of the coal, and the greenhouse physically beginning to flood as he conducts the final imprint. His decision to extinguish the forge and enter the rising tide, with the knowledge that the greenhouse will be gone by morning, provides a credible price and resolution. Pressure is more internal and textural than oppositional, so some readers might want one more explicit moment where he nearly clings to the old pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—whether Liora can subvert an apparently fixed fate/luck “countdown”—is clear, and tension builds from infiltration to mirror revelation to the decisive shattering of the jar. Escalation is more conceptual than combative; the stationmaster’s armed appearance promises one kind of conflict, but he quickly recedes into exposition as the metaphysical stakes take over. Liora’s agency drives the climax, yet the concrete cost of her success (death? transcendence?) is more implied than viscerally dramatized, which softens the sense of paid price. Still, there is a real narrowing of options once she sees her “luck running out,” and her choice to break time is a genuine turn.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether and how to resurrect or transform the sanctuary for dangerous inquiry—is clear, and pressure tightens when Elara realizes her father anticipated a controlled collapse and has left her the means to enact it. Turning the final valve is an earned, high-stakes act that forecloses the option of nostalgic preservation. The conflict is largely internal and quietly handled, with no sharp external squeeze in the climax; this keeps escalation from feeling as intense as it could, though it remains coherent and meaningful.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering proof of her existence and agency—is clear and present from early on, and escalates as the girl’s message and the shell’s demands narrow her path toward exposing the fraud. The core turn is the shift from reactive flight (hiding, distrust) to active engagement (bleeding on the shell, climbing for the ledger), which is a meaningful tightening. However, the path to success is relatively unresisted; there’s little opposition beyond atmosphere and her shaken state, so danger feels conceptual more than visceral. The emotional price is credible, but adding one more concrete obstacle or risk could deepen the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake is Eldrin’s drive to map the endless night and his orientation to silence—whether he remains a distinct cartographer or allows himself to be absorbed into what he’s mapping. There is a clear deepening as the focus moves from historical silences (the defender) to cosmic ones (the star) and finally to Eldrin’s own erasure. However, tension stays gentle; no concrete alternative path is vividly on the table at the end, so the “choice” to let go reads more like a natural slide than a pressured trade-off. This keeps conflict resonant but relatively low-intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—X-7’s need to locate the origin of its thoughts/identity—is clear early and tightens as the violin triggers increasingly disruptive perceptions. Conflict is primarily internal and epistemic, escalating through the courtyard dissolving and the onslaught of alternate lives; the cost is the destabilization of its prior “just a janitor” self-concept. However, tension rarely sharpens into explicit dilemma or competing goods; pressure is strong but more revelatory than choice-driven. The final act of claiming its true name provides a credible crystallization of stance.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.6)
    The conflict is primarily internal and situational: mistrust vs. the desire for connection and honesty, staged through the couple’s near-silent confrontation. There is a clear tightening when Lena moves from passive listening to the risky act of offering her drawing, and a secondary deepening when she decides to institutionalize this practice via the scattered tickets. However, the cost of these choices remains relatively soft and implied (emotional exposure, possible misreading) rather than sharply dramatized. The tension is steady and satisfying for a quiet story, but not pushed into a higher-stakes or more agonized register.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central conflict—wonder and relational care versus quantification and extraction—is clear, with the elders’ accusation and later visit raising modest but coherent pressure. The tightening arrives when they formally declare her section “deficient,” compelling her choice to demonstrate rather than defend herself verbally. Stakes remain largely conceptual and emotional; there’s little sense that anything catastrophic will happen if she fails, which keeps the tension subdued. Still, her endurance and the elders’ reorientation at the end read as an earned, if quiet, resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—proving time’s sideways nature versus obeying protocols and preserving K‑11—comes through, and pressure escalates as the field destabilizes and K‑11’s vitals “flatline” into transition. Elias’s agency drives the key turns: he chooses to pull the lever, to refine the adjustment, and to accept K‑11’s disappearance as proof rather than failure. However, the external stakes (danger to the station, permanent loss or ethical harm) stay mostly conceptual; we don’t feel a sharp foreclosure of options beyond “this breaks twelve protocols.” The tension is atmospheric and intellectual rather than viscerally testing him against a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake is whether Elias will remain a passive inhabitant of a haunted space or accept a riskier, more intimate engagement with the ghost’s “code.” Pressure escalates via increasingly explicit signs culminating in the specific instruction and hidden key/program, which he chooses to follow. The final act of “playing the silence” is a clear, agentive response that redefines his relationship to the haunting. Still, the cost of failure or success remains mostly emotional and inferred, so tension hums rather than bites.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central stake—whether Liora will use her oracle authority to warn and perhaps save the station, or relinquish that responsibility—is signaled early via her fear of the barometer’s needle and the looming storm. Pressure tightens effectively when the lowland observatory calls and when she realizes the storm will break now, not at dawn, collapsing her room for hedged forecasts. Her agency at the climax is clear: she consciously chooses silence and self-erasure, paying with her role, life, and the station’s fate. The conflict remains largely internal and metaphysical, with minimal on-page pushback from other agents, which slightly mutes the sense of escalating opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether he will confront or evade the buried horror implied by his father’s confession—is established early and escalates via sensory disturbances, the radio glitch, and the unsettling movement of the sump water. The key tightening is his decision to seize and turn the valve wheel under mounting uncanny pressure, forcing the apparition and a shift in his relationship to the truth. Internal and external pressures braid well, though the danger remains more atmospheric than viscerally consequential, so the felt cost is a notch softer than it could be. Still, the narrative avoids static creepiness; each beat meaningfully narrows his emotional options.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.5)
    The primary stake—whether the keeper remains a person or yields fully to being a witness—remains largely internal and contemplative, with minimal escalation. The entry into the refuge and the swan’s transformation are the main tightening beats, but they don’t force a fresh dilemma so much as affirm an existing choice. The cost (loss of name, blurring edges) is there but accepted almost without resistance, which softens tension. As a result, the piece feels richly atmospheric but relatively static in pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can reconnect with her voice and how Elias can midwife that—is established early and focused throughout. Escalation is present but gentle: three sessions of minimal progress, then the high-risk/high-hope choice to use the eclipse and the ridge song as a catalyst. Elias’s decision to press the vial into Mira’s hand and sing the “roots drinking rain” song is a clear tightening that leads to change. However, the story largely sidesteps the possibility of failure or real setback, so the pressure never feels truly acute.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Elias can engage the displaced axis of the world through stories—is clear but largely internal and conceptual. There is a meaningful tightening when the tapestry’s axis “moves,” the world tilts, and Elias chooses not to resist the pull, then elects to leave the silo. However, the cost and danger of this choice are more implied than sharply felt; opposition is atmospheric rather than active. Tension is steady and textured, but not intensely escalated.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—what happens to the film and to Chen if “they” arrive—emerges clearly, with a meaningful tightening at the knock and the revelation “They’re coming for the film.” Chen’s decisions (passing the microdot to the daughter, choosing the train) resolve the external situation with credible agency, and the internal stake (his role as keeper vs. orchestrator) is folded into that. However, the danger remains mostly offstage and the pressure curve is relatively gentle; we never feel a moment where he is truly trapped or forced into a painful trade-off, which keeps escalation from fully peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether this encounter will reinforce the anchor as prison or reframe it as a listening device—is clear, and the cost of the priest’s choice is palpable. Escalation comes through deepening: the indigo reveals the anchor’s assumptions, begins to rise, and finally consumes the priest, with the possession thinning. External opposition (the possessing entity) is more a foil than an active threat, which keeps tension somewhat abstract. Still, the conceptual pressure tightens effectively toward the priest’s sacrifice and the reweighted stalemate with the possession.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Li Wei will remain a passive fortune-writer or claim authorship as a “conductor”—is clear and thematically coherent. Pressure accumulates texturally via fatigue, the eerie amplification of the spire, the cracking lake, and the courier’s impatient knock, which together sharpen the moment he chooses to step away from his desk and raise his hands to the air. However, opposition stays largely atmospheric; no concrete consequence challenges or tests his choice within the scene. The conflict is compelling but remains more contemplative than sharply escalated.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will remain trapped in endlessly regenerating timelines or integrate himself and move forward—is legible early and pays off. Pressure escalates from disorientation in time to a direct confrontation with another self, culminating in the risky choice to merge rather than flee or reset. The cost is clear: he loses his inherited tool/power and the entire structure that defined his existence. Still, conflict remains primarily internal and conceptual; a bit more felt risk (fear, hesitation, or tangible near-failure) at the merge beat would deepen the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will remain emotionally numb and professionally stalled or reengage with music/teaching through a new mode—is clear. Pressure escalates when the backward songs are played and he must decide whether to accept this alternate way of hearing and what it implies for his identity as a teacher. The turn from carrying the needle as a token of failure to accepting it as a reminder that “silence isn’t empty” provides a credible costed shift. Conflict remains largely internal and relatively smooth; a more visible moment of doubt or rejection could have heightened the sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—how a lifelong, solitary observer responds when the anomaly he studies becomes sentient and follows him home—is clear and grows through the message, recollection of prior storms, and the closing door-creak. Tension escalates texturally: from vague watchers to a military-banded pigeon to the chilling line “It’s breathing now. Not like us,” to the realization that his home is no longer safe. Agency is quiet but real in his decision to keep the note secret and to reorient his listening, a kind of earned stasis. The lack of a sharper on-page crisis or trade-off keeps escalation just below the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias continues to be consumed/exploited by grief-triggering scents—is signaled early and tightened via the uncorking of the vial and the revelation that his tears feed the Luminara. The discovery that the flowers "fed" on ultraviolet and his sorrow reframes his past decade of behavior and narrows options in the moment: continue to grieve in this way or cut off the flowers’ lifeline. His choice to leave and destroy his lantern business is clearly a costed renunciation. Escalation is primarily internal and conceptual rather than confrontational, which suits the piece but keeps the pressure more contemplative than harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—what to do with this charged rope and, by extension, with impossible choices/time’s pattern—is clear and culminates in his decision to pull the rope to snapping and later to carve it into a ladder. Pressure escalates gently through discovery (humming rope, bloodstain), beings adding their thread, and the resonant snap; the choice between cutting and walking away versus pulling taut is legible and real. However, conflict remains primarily conceptual and internal, with little tangible risk or loss beyond the abstract burden of insight, which limits felt intensity. The piece excels as meditative tension rather than acute jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Liora carries beauty forward from isolation into a damaged world—is clear and gains pressure once the child appears as a potential heir/audience. The main tightening is the transition from solitary repetition of her father’s unfinished melody to co-creating something new with the girl. However, the “dawn choice” remains mostly hypothetical; no external pressure forces a concrete decision or visible sacrifice beyond her internal stance. The tension is quiet and accumulative rather than sharply escalated, which fits the mode but limits peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.9)
    The central stake—whether Liora will give the chemist the painless counterfeit he paid for or the painful truth he actually needs—is clear and active throughout. Pressure escalates as the petal “knows” and reveals the wife and his reframed narrative, culminating in Liora’s choice to take on the ache herself. The cost is primarily internal (he must confront himself; she must bear the shared longing), which suits the story but keeps the conflict on a quieter plane. It’s effective and coherent, though the tension never quite feels razor-edge in the way a top-tier piece might manage even at this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—a morally tinged choice between staying a detached broker or risking exposure to help unseen workers—is present but stays low-key. The main escalation is Elias moving from anonymous gestures (oranges, keeping the locket) to initiating a direct, risky partnership; however, there’s minimal resistance from the librarian or external forces. Ethical tension around theft/redistribution is gestured at via the “ledger balanced less neatly” line but never materially pressures a decision. The result is pleasing but gentler than a truly gripping conflict arc.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Reed (and the village) can transform the incomplete arbor into a true site of belonging—is clear and tightened by the need for a dedication and the choice to seek an elusive, possibly unwilling artist. Pressure escalates in a gentle, accumulative way: from solitary lack to communal search to the risk of confronting Syl and inscribing a collective “we.” The cost (risking rejection, Syl’s departure, Reed’s acceptance of an ongoing, unclosed web) is present but understated; there’s little concrete jeopardy or loss beyond bittersweet absence. The conflict feels authentic but never quite bites as hard as the premise allows.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—preventing the giant’s waking and the erasure of her moths/city—is clear and escalates from personal (a single moth) to systemic (the city’s temporal integrity). The key tightening turn is the boy’s conditional threat with the moth and her counter-move of sacrificing the jar, which forecloses an option and costs her something valuable. However, the conflict resolves with relative ease: we don’t see meaningful resistance, alternative tactics, or a concrete sense of what losing the jar specifically denies her later. The pressure is coherent and grows, but the climax could carry more friction and on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—can he transform his need for precision into a stance that can live with ambiguous loss—is clear from early on and tightens as the ritual partially succeeds (orchard “remembered green,” mist forming his wife’s almost-face) before failing to give him closure. The key escalation is his decision to perform the “ask” spell and then to reach for the forming face, which generates the story’s sharpest emotional reversal when it dissolves. The cost lands in his realization that some losses cannot be mourned cleanly or solved, only carried. The conflict is primarily internal and textural, but it does grow and culminate rather than remaining static.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will risk his invisible safety and the archives’ rules to reach this woman—is clear from the moment he contemplates using the tape. Escalation is modest but coherent: from listening and watching, to the small transgression of dangling the tape, to the more intimate dropping of the photo, to stepping partially, then symbolically fully, into mutual recognition via the key. The cost is emotional and ethical rather than physical, but it’s present in the abandonment of his long-held rules and anonymity. The conflict could edge higher if the consequences of breaking protocol were more concretely looming, but for this length the pressure suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora will continue to control the nursery or surrender to a wilder, more mutual form of growth—is clear and on-page. Escalation is primarily internal: the microscope scene and the recognition that the tree “had stopped fighting the storm” meaningfully deepen the pressure on her existing worldview. The turn where she pulls up the stakes is a credible, consequential choice but the external stakes (business risk, reputation) remain mostly implicit rather than dramatized. Tension is steady and thematically apt, but never becomes sharply acute.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake is existential/artistic: whether Elias remains a passive, war-haunted insomniac or accepts a more dangerous, sacrificial role as the island’s instrument. Pressure escalates cleanly through the discovery, descent, exchange, and vision, with the key tightening at the moment he places the brooch in the amber woman’s hand. However, his path rarely confronts him with genuinely hard alternatives—curiosity pulls him forward more than conflict tests his limits—so the sense of cost remains more implied than sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is Liora’s relationship to magic and to her own clairvoyance, signaled early and resolved by her choice to leave the pearl. Pressure escalates somewhat—from unease at the cave’s song to the unsettling presence to the overwhelming vision—but opposition is gentle and the entity is more guide than antagonist. As a result, tension never truly bites; she is rarely at risk of refusing the insight or paying a sharper price. The conflict works for a quiet, lyric piece but falls short of maximal dramatic urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—how the city will reclaim its voice and memory—is clear and increasingly focused on whether there must be a herald at all. Pressure escalates through realization rather than confrontation, culminating in Elias’s choice to let the girl inherit the valve and to forego a proclamation. The cost and narrowing of options are subtle: he gives up a potential public role and accepts that absence will remain part of the city’s texture. Tension remains mostly conceptual and emotional; a slightly sharper on-page test of his resolve could raise the sense of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether he will use this occult system to retrieve his sister or to confront/accept his not-knowing—is clear, and the pressure coheres around entering and then refusing the station. Escalation is primarily internal but does tighten: from following cracks, to activating the punch, to facing the question and his sister on the platform, to the choice to step back into the mist. The cost of not boarding (and of abandoning precision as shield) is felt, though a slightly sharper dramatization of temptation vs. refusal at the platform could heighten this further. Still, the resolution reads as an earned stance rather than a soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora will remain sealed in skeptical grief or risk re-entering relationship with her brother’s memory—is clear and escalates through successive intensifications of vision and whalesong. Her key choices (to transcribe, to lean into the apparition, to press her palm to the tile, to let the tile go and keep listening) all advance that conflict. The cost of glimpsing her brother yet not “summoning” him into permanence is conceptually powerful but somewhat under-dramatized; a sharper articulation of what she forfeits by not clinging to the tile would heighten the sense of price. Still, the emotional pressure builds coherently to her new stance.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Lysander will risk a true, irreversible “goodbye” by surrendering the fragment—is present and culminates in his act of dropping it. There is one clear tightening beat when the corridor opens and the amulet’s curiosity becomes almost animate, nudging him toward a decision. However, pressure is mostly philosophical and aesthetic; there’s little sense of danger or cost beyond abstraction, so tension never fully sharpens. The resolution is convincingly tied to his agency, but the conflict remains more meditative than truly fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes—twelve asylum seekers’ lives and Lira’s assumption of her father’s debt—are concrete and introduced early, and the pressure coherently tightens from private experiment to systemic rupture. The key turn is the girl’s revelation (“That’s how many they’ll kill when they find it empty”), which reframes the cost of erasing names, followed by Lira’s choice to commit fully and then to flee. The magical backlash raises the scale of consequence from individual fairness to institutional breakdown, which suits the thematic ambitions. The price remains a bit abstract emotionally in the final beats; we feel risk and upheaval more than a sharply focused sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.4)
    Conflict is primarily internal and conceptual: his drive to extract textures of time versus the elusiveness of the past. The main escalation is the lamp’s altered hum, which raises curiosity and urgency but not a tangible risk or opposing force. Stakes remain gentle—he might miss a story or fail to capture its texture, but nothing on the page truly pushes back against him or forces a sacrifice. The result is beautiful but somewhat placid pressure, more contemplative than tense.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—how Daniel will exist after bureaucratic death—remains legible, and pressure accumulates from passive listening to sleepless haunting to an active ritual offering. The ledger scene and the unusually high tide are credible tightenings, and his decision to relinquish the page/label bundle is a clear stance. Still, there is little explicit opposition or risk beyond mood and metaphysical cost; conflict rarely bites back in concrete terms. Escalation is effective for a quiet piece but not maximally bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—what to do with the “universal riddle” and his identity as debunker vs believer—is signaled clearly and tightened by the dissolving journal and the chest-compass finally stilling. Escalation comes from the music experiments: from hum as memory to hum as conversation, to full chorus and physical trembling of the observatory. His key act is to stop trying to preserve notes and instead play/inscribe, which resolves the tension in an internally consistent way. However, the conflict never quite bites in a way that forces a painful trade-off beyond a graceful acceptance of a new role, keeping the stakes more contemplative than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stakes—whether Lumina can stay fluid in the face of imposed grids, and whether Elira will capitulate to order—are clear and present early. Escalation comes through her proactive choice to target the clocktower and to embed the stolen chip into the mural, turning symbolic resistance into a bolder, more irreversible stance. However, the conflict remains largely preparatory and strategic; we never see a plan truly constrain or a loss land in-scene, so the felt cost of escalation is moderate rather than searing. Internal and external pressures are well-braided but could use one sharper on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—preserving a vanishing beauty in memory before industrial destruction—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates through the live clock (three hours to drilling), the staged chemical glows, and the growing hum of approaching drones, culminating in his decision to leave with only his silent record. Conflict is primarily internal and situational (witness vs erasure) rather than confrontational, but the story does crystallize his stance: he chooses witnessing over futile resistance. The escalation is effective yet remains relatively low-key, with no sharp reversal or on-page loss beyond the anticipated destruction.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—whether the Mariner will launch safely on its maiden voyage with a flawed navigation core—is clear and time-bound by the lifting anchor. Pressure does deepen as he moves from diagnosis at the barrel to physically applying the iridescent film before departure. However, the conflict remains largely frictionless: no one resists him, he encounters no serious obstacle, and his fix works on the first try. The escalation is therefore more procedural than truly testing, limiting the ceiling here.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Lena will respond to the call and become the herald at this inexplicable river-source—is clear and escalates from eerie signal to world-altering act. The main tightening comes when she moves from observing patterns inside to kneeling on the thinning ice and physically inviting the lake to answer, and then to stepping forward as the ice seals behind her. However, pressure feels more fated than contested: there’s minimal sense of alternative paths or genuine hesitation, so cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt. The conflict is effective but relatively low-friction, which keeps the escalation from reaching the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—reviving the town and holding off collapse—is legible and does tighten somewhat with the archway’s groan and the admission that he is “late.” Pressure escalates texturally via accumulating echoes and phantom activity, culminating in the first living child’s laughter as a clear success beat. However, opposition remains largely atmospheric; nothing directly challenges his method or forces a genuine trade-off beyond time and effort, so escalation feels more steady than sharply tested. The result is a beautifully sustained tension, but not a deeply contested one.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stakes—whether Liora will risk literal and psychic destruction to escape her guilt—are clearly established and tightened by the failing signal and dwindling oxygen. The key turn is her deliberate override of the instinct to flee in favor of opening the vial, leading to the hush immersion. The cost is primarily internal: she sacrifices the hope of undoing the past for the harder task of living with it, then forecloses the path back by refusing future signals and leaving the sea. The later rescue with an untouched body slightly blunts the physical stakes, keeping this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stakes—whether Elias can reconfigure the lighthouse’s cycle of lies, curses, and deaths by reclaiming his father’s name—are coherent and present early. There is a meaningful tightening when he begins interacting with the lattice and the whispers, and again when the hush falls and the bodies’ discovery clock is invoked. However, external opposition is minimal; the “they were coming” pressure never materializes as an on-page confrontation, which softens the sense of cost under direct threat. The conflict thus feels more atmospheric than sharply escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—Liora’s willingness to spend herself to wake Vesper—is legible early and tightens as each appearance is framed as costly excavation. Pressure escalates when the oldest tree cracks open and Liora channels her essence into the bead, forcing an implicit trade: her continued existence versus Vesper’s awakening. The cost lands clearly in her unraveling and the bead’s destruction; the option of “simply haunting” feels foreclosed by the rules of resonance. Conflict remains mostly internal and situational rather than oppositional, but it deepens credibly under the accumulative, lyric lens.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is internal and conceptual: whether Elias remains in the labyrinth’s cradle or steps into the ruined wharf-world as an awakened weaver. Pressure escalates mainly through revelation—the Heart Chamber, the plate’s activation, the realization that the labyrinth is a loom—rather than through visible external opposition or hard choices. His final decision to walk awake toward the wharf is meaningful but not sharply contested; risk and cost are implied, not dramatized as a trade-off against a tempting alternative. The tension is effective for a lyric piece but relatively gentle for elite publication standards.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether life and “faith” (in roots, saints, community) can be coaxed back into a blighted place—is present from early on and does deepen as Elias uncovers the seed and mural. Escalation is more atmospheric than pressured; there’s no real resistance from the environment or people, and Elias never confronts a moment where he might stop or fail. The sapling’s emergence reweights the situation but arrives without much preceding jeopardy, so the cost of success feels low. Tension is sustained at a soft hum rather than tightened through hard choices or visible losses.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lena can craft and then release an identity that “carries the sea but doesn’t drown”—is clear but remains internally scaled and low-intensity. There is a modest tightening at the moment she hesitates at the mailbox, which narrows her options to either retain or relinquish control of the name. However, tension around this choice is underdeveloped; no significant reversal or consequence beyond quiet acceptance is dramatized. The conflict between her control/perfectionism and her role in others’ reinvention could be pushed harder for greater bite.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether truth/stories or the Council’s narrative will define reality through the coup—is clear and present from the opening and tightens once the courier warns him. Elias’s refusal to flee in favor of synchronizing telescope and flame is a genuine, high-cost choice that leads directly to his death and the coup’s exposure. External pressure escalates well (illegal flame, impending raid, boots on stairs), and the internal conflict between survival and principled defiance is implied even if under-dramatized. The only ceiling comes from the conflict feeling more mythic than viscerally fraught in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether to stay in the safe stasis of silence or risk genuine change toward her sister—is signaled early and sharpened by the spirits’ question and her repeated half-measures (evoking words that vanish, pressing the shard without drawing blood). Escalation is internal but legible: the second condensation message and the silence that follows push her to an irrevocable act with the letter. The cost is the relinquishing of her cherished liminal state and the illusion of endless possibility, with no guarantee of response. The pressure could be marginally heightened by a more concrete external consequence or time pressure, but for this mode it still reads strong.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lena will continue to bear and translate others’ grief despite her own damage—is signaled and gently tightened through the cast, the boy’s request, and her final movement into the mist. Internal and external conflicts are braided: each new “translation” is both service and self-wounding. However, escalation is largely tonal and symbolic, without a sharp on-page test that clearly forecloses an alternative path (e.g., refusal or collapse). The result is powerful but more of a deepening than a pressured turning point, which keeps this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming and sharing lost communal joy—remains coherent throughout, and Liora’s decision to publicly display the film is a meaningful tightening. However, there is almost no resistance (internal or external); once she decides to act, the process unfolds without friction, reversal, or visible jeopardy. The only real “cost” is the images’ impermanence, which is thematically apt but gently felt. As a result, tension is more contemplative than pressured, holding the piece below higher-stakes bands.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora will relinquish the safety of preservation/certainty for the risk of ongoing awakening—is legible early and tightened through successive, more disorienting awakenings and the blank fresco demanding new work. Her agency drives the major turns, especially the decision to paint a door instead of restoring and then to step through it, foreclosing her return to the ordinary world. The cost of that choice (self-erasure from the garden, unending cyclical awakenings) is implied but could be made slightly more felt on the page rather than purely conceptual. There is solid escalation, but tension remains mostly philosophical/lyric rather than viscerally pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving untaxable thought via a coded botanical resistance—is legible early and coherently threaded. Pressure does escalate: from clandestine planning to the first ominous “they know” signal to the Ministry’s uprooting of gardens and the “now” call. However, the conflict remains largely situational and anticipatory; Elias never has to choose between two costly options or sacrifice something concrete in scene. As a result, the ending feels exciting and ominous but not as sharply priced as it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stake—whether and how war’s damage can be transmuted—tightens as a new war begins, a ghost confronts her, and she moves from solitary singing to writing and disseminating a manual. Pressure escalates in a textural way: from private ritual to direct encounter, then to systemic intervention (manual, net of words, snared sun). Her key agency moment is to “sing louder” and then write a manual instead of a eulogy, an earned stance that forecloses retreat into mere mourning. Still, the conflict remains largely conceptual, with limited on-page sense of risk or possible failure.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central stake—whether to preserve or silence dangerous, forgotten sounds—tightens well from quiet caretaking to an existentially charged choice. Escalation is clear: fixing the chime awakens names, the library convulses, and she must decide whether to destroy the very object she’s just repaired and what her life is built around. The cost is palpable in the wrecked library and her loss of vocation, though the external stakes for the “world below” remain more implied than felt. Pressure remains coherent and is resolved by her decisive, morally complex act, not by coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—save the archive and, symbolically, rehabilitate truth—is clear early and tightened by the emissaries’ approach and the inkwell’s dangerous pulsing. Her decision to press her palm to the parchment and sing is a strong agency moment that resolves the external threat and internal guilt in one move. However, the resolution comes relatively smoothly once she chooses; the emissaries never exert direct on-page counter-pressure, and the personal cost of success is more implied burden than felt sacrifice. Escalation is solid but could be sharpened by a more tangible or ambivalent consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—what kind of water-control system the valley will embrace, and what that means morally—is signaled early and sharpened when Liora discovers the hidden sluices. Pressure deepens as she realizes her father was right and must choose between safe conformity and risky compassion, culminating in her open defiance of the elders’ implied demand to lie. However, the external conflict with the elders never truly bites on the page; their quick, almost serene acceptance blurs the sense of price paid and makes the climax feel slightly under-contested. Internal stakes are strong, external stakes feel somewhat under-dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will risk breaking his self-imposed silence and reengage with Luca and music—is clearly signaled and plays through to the end. Internal and external pressures interweave well: Madame Holloway’s expectations and the disciplined pigeon work contrast with the disruptive meteorite and letter. Escalation is subtle rather than dramatic: the meaningful tightening comes when he chooses to send a pigeon “Find him. Bring him back” and then, on receiving Luca’s music, allows himself to hum. The conflict remains largely internal and low-voltage; a slightly sharper sense of what he concretely fears losing now (beyond psychic safety) would heighten the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—finding a missing child who may be beyond ordinary reach—is clear and escalates from communal search to solitary threshold-crossing. The key tightening is Elias choosing to trust his intuition and Liora’s clues over the official search, culminating in his decision to descend and then not insist on her return. However, once he reaches the sinkhole, conflict softens: Liora appears safe and calm, and there is no concrete obstacle to reunion or refusal, so the danger feels more retroactive than live. The emotional cost is primarily internal and thematic rather than viscerally felt in that climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara’s isolation endures or is reconfigured by connection—is clear but very low-key. There is one main tightening: Kael’s arrival and shared witnessing of the respite, culminating in hand-holding and his departure versus her choice to stay. However, “until sunrise” doesn’t function as a live clock so much as a gentle boundary, and the cost of her choice is more implied than sharply felt. The conflict never quite spikes into a moment where she must visibly trade one value against another on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is internal—whether she will locate and integrate the “missing paths” before memory fades and accept the cost of carrying them—which is signaled early and paid off. Escalation occurs via density and intensity rather than reversals: the humming shards → the map insight → the blood revelation → the surge of memories. However, the time pressure and potential downside of failure remain fuzzy, so tension stays more atmospheric than gripping. The final choice to let the memories in and then leave the cave does foreclose an option (remaining separate, or remaining inside), but the risk calculus never feels sharply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is the success of Lior’s attempt to bend apparent randomness into a precise, private composition, with secondary stakes around being recognized or not. Escalation is primarily textural, moving from isolated observations (coin, sailor) to a dense convergence at the torch’s near-extinguishing. However, opposition is largely abstract—there’s no real threat beyond failure of coincidence—and the cost of failure or success is conceptual rather than visceral. The story tightens effectively for its mode, but the pressure never feels truly knife-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether she can transform exile into a new kind of belonging through this dangerous verse—is clear and sustained. Escalation is internal and textural: from intention to observing the gap (heron), to committing to the verse that “bit deep,” to the charged aftermath. The price (permanent break from sea, becoming a “gap”) is conceptual rather than dramatized via concrete resistance or failure, keeping tension quieter. It’s strong for a lyric piece but doesn’t quite reach the sharpness of conflict a top-tier venue often demands.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake is whether Elias can secure a sense of meaning and guidance before the working day—and its risks for the fishermen—begins. Pressure escalates gently through the act of throwing the stone, reading the ripples, and recalling his daughter’s absence, then releases as he confirms what the harbor “already knew” and returns to the docks. The internal and external stakes (personal meaning vs. the sea’s generosity and danger) are nicely braided but never quite tighten into a sharp dilemma. The quietness is intentional, yet a slightly more acute on-page cost or friction point would strengthen the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will remain in self-protective silence or risk renewed connection with his daughter—is clear and intact throughout. Pressure escalates internally: the ex-wife’s call triggers the question, the box and note intensify it, and the drawings/text are a small but real leap of vulnerability. The cost is largely emotional and anticipatory (no guarantee of Lila’s response), which fits the quiet scale but slightly softens the felt edge of consequence. Still, the renunciation of his old avoidance pattern and the choice to leave the box behind provide a genuine narrowing of options and an earned, if gentle, turn.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora can meaningfully “solve” hope rather than have it washed away—is clear and escalates via the gauge and the transforming decorations. The key tightening is the moment the needle measures “potential” and the patterns revitalize, forcing her to step into the center and accept a new stance. However, the conflict remains largely internal and conceptual, with minimal felt risk or trade-off beyond a shift in worldview. The tension is satisfying for a lyric piece but not especially sharp or cutting.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.0)
    The primary stake—whether Elias will confront or continue to sidestep the burden of familial memory—is clear and intensifies from eerie curiosity to intimate confrontation. Pressure escalates effectively when he recognizes his mother’s eyes, hears his own name at the sealed door, and chooses to burn the varnish and enter. The final act of redrawing the mural as faces and stories credibly resolves the conflict by transforming his mapping practice into an act of acknowledgement. The stakes are largely internal and could bear one more concrete threat or loss to feel fully high-band in terms of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.4)
    The conflict is primarily ethical and internal: Liora’s trade in hopeful illusions versus the physical and psychic costs to others and to her own sense of self. Stakes (a mother’s desperate hope, a soldier’s stolen heartbeat, Liora’s refusal of her own vision) are clear and conceptually strong, but escalation remains subtle—more a deepening of the pattern than a sharp tightening that forecloses new options. Her key act of renunciation (not looking at herself, then unraveling the heartbeat) is believable and carries cost, though it reads as continuation rather than a pointed turning point. The quietness works for the mode but slightly limits the sense of increasing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether to end this particular phase of a seemingly endless war—is legible early and maintained. Pressure escalates modestly but clearly: initial distrust, invocation of past signing and children, then the embodied act of Kael taking and signing the parchment. The cost is emotionally visible (his shaking hand, “You want me to sign my name to another grave?”), and Veyra’s admission of likely future failure adds a moral sting. Still, the escalation is relatively linear and could use one more concrete complication or risk to fully test the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will continue to live purely by extraction and erasure or commit a small, costly refusal—is clear and localized in the egg decision. Internal conflict (legacy/masterpiece vs pointless, private gesture) is strong, and the “enough” spelled by the cracks provides a clear tightening. The thunder drawing closer provides a mild ambient pressure rather than a hard clock, so the escalation remains mostly tonal. It works for a quiet piece, but a slightly sharper sense of risk or loss tied to the act could heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora will submit to the lullaby of conformity or risk herself to free the echoes—is established early and carried through. Escalation is primarily textural and conceptual: each thread she untangles raises the emotional and metaphysical stakes, culminating in the sanctuary’s shuddering and the irreversible seal of the gates. The conflict remains mostly internal/philosophical rather than physically perilous, which fits the piece but keeps tension at a controlled simmer rather than a boil. The price of her choice (carrying a thousand voices, being locked away from retreat) is legible and gives the resolution weight.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central conflict—whether his manipulative art harms people and how he should change—is clear and meaningfully sharpened by the miner’s outburst and question. Pressure escalates primarily through accumulating self-reproach and reconsideration rather than new events, leading to a quiet but real narrowing of options (continue deceptive control vs. reveal the strings). The cost of loosening control is implied rather than dramatized, so the stakes remain somewhat abstract. Overall, tension is steady and thoughtful but rarely feels acute.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure is quiet but real: the monarchs’ extinction, the futility of his gestures, and his need to honor them despite inevitable decay. The tightening comes as the migration is declared over and the spiral starts to unravel, testing whether he will accept that his work vanishes. His agency is an endurance/renunciation choice—continuing to build ephemeral signals instead of seeking permanence—though the conflict remains largely internal and could use one sharper moment of potential disengagement.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Elira can forgive herself while preserving the lost names—is clear and the pressure coherently rises from preparation to ritual to transformation to departure. The main tightening occurs when she chooses to “reconfigure” the rope instead of merely unraveling it, accepting the risk of altering an ancestral artifact. The cost is primarily internal (relinquishing her old preservationist rigidity and years of self-punishment), and that cost is legible in the language of “chiseling regrets” and the sanctum’s shift from dirge to lullaby. What keeps this below the very top band is the relative smoothness of the process: nothing meaningfully resists her or truly threatens failure once the ritual begins, so tension stays more meditative than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—how Lior will relate to paths that “choose” and to the loss of certainty—is clear and under steady pressure from the storm, the terminal commands, and the film. Escalation is present (from eerie bunker to personal dream-film to reality rewriting), but it stays mostly in the register of conceptual revelation rather than forcing a sharp, agonized choice with visible on-page consequences. Her final move (reaching to the storm and running “through”) reweights options but doesn’t fully dramatize what she’s giving up beyond an idea. The conflict is compelling but slightly soft-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes are internal—whether Qishti will remain a purely measuring mind or risk stepping into a covenant with the unknown—and they tighten meaningfully at the opened passage and the altar. External conflict (guards, overseers, possible punishment) is gestured at but never actually constrains him in-scene, which keeps tension more meditative than pressing. His choice to descend and place the tile provides genuine agency and a quiet cost (siding with something older and perhaps dangerous, accepting that his metrics are insufficient). Still, escalation could be sharper if either physical peril or internal resistance intensified at the key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Lior clings to grievance or embraces a risky grace—is clear early and intensifies through the dialogue and flashback beats. Escalation is largely internal but credible: from holding the broken pin as an emblem of loss to re-inserting it to "convince the past it could be different." The cost is legible: relinquishing the safety of blame and the sanctuary’s insulating silence in favor of a vulnerable, renewed relationship. The conflict stays mostly on a single register; an additional concrete pressure or countervailing temptation could have sharpened the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether he remains bound to grief/grounding or lets the old self dissolve enough to reunite with his brother/old dream—is clear and sustained. Pressure escalates via the ritual’s increasing success: the sextant humming, metal melting, orchard constellations, the brother’s voice, culminating in his choice to let the fog take him and step through the sky. The conflict is almost entirely internal; there’s little overt resistance once he begins the breathing, so the struggle feels more contemplative than sharply contested. Still, the final renunciation of his prior way of living reads as a genuine, costly turn.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the mender will cling to old vows or re-open themselves to the daughter’s perspective—is clearly signaled but remains largely internal. Pressure escalates via the excavation and magical immediacy of the sprout and orchard-voice, which force the mender to confront their blind spot (“Why didn’t you read mine?”). The closing choices (tying on the ribbon, eating the apple, leaving the doll) credibly foreclose the path of rigid obedience. Still, tension operates more as steady ache than tightening vise, keeping pressure strong but not maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—how to engage with dangerous, nonlinear knowledge—is legible early and coherently deepens as Veyra confronts visions of the museum burning and prior curators’ failures. The major tightening comes when she realizes the orchard is a protected library and that her approach (document/destroy vs. selective engagement) has real consequences. Her decision to pluck a single blossom and redefine the key as “Complicated” is an earned stance crystallization that forecloses simpler paths. The price she pays (accepting ongoing, unresolved complexity and cyclical responsibility) is conceptually sharp but not strongly felt as personal loss, which keeps tension solid rather than searing.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—seizing the Library’s power before the traveler—appears early and coheres throughout, with the key tightening when Elias offers to “renegotiate” for the lost name. The turn where the traveler speaks Liora and the Library opens is a clean escalation, immediately followed by reversal as the “rescue” reveals itself as a trap. The cost to Elias (loss of the diary’s content, his collected gaps, and the very name he’s leveraging) is clear and on-page. Conflict is more conceptual than visceral, and Elias’s climactic agency is primarily in his earlier manipulation rather than an active choice at the doorway, which keeps this in the strong-but-not-razor-edged band.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering the erased twin and then extending that rescue to others—is legible early and deepens when the fog reveals a multitude of lost souls, forcing Liora to choose between an escape with her sister and a larger, riskier task. Escalation is mostly one clean tightening rather than multiple reversals: finding the ledger and using the swatch to rewrite reality. The cost is present but somewhat softened; the ship’s sinking is thematically apt but largely framed as necessary release rather than a painful loss. Overall, pressure grows coherently but could be made more viscerally fraught in the moment of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—how an archivist confronts an impossible, unrecordable phenomenon—is clear, and the rope-weaving is a genuine attempt that escalates pressure as gears stutter and the door responds. However, the conflict remains mostly intellectual and spiritual; there is little sense of real danger or of options closing beyond “understand vs. become.” Her final choice to merge rather than archive functions as a resolution but never feels truly contested on the page. Raising the felt risk (personal, temporal, or institutional) would give the escalation more bite.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving the caves’ last unbroken verse in the face of the beings’ storm—is clearly stated and tested when Eldrin attempts to draw out the bloom of hush. The main escalation comes when the beings’ song presses in, the hush briefly stills the storm, and the fissure opens, forcing a reframing from “weapon” to “choice.” However, pressure is relatively gentle: Eldrin never seems in real danger of failing, and no concrete alternative path is foreclosed with visible personal cost. The conflict resolves into harmony credibly but without a strong sense of loss or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether she can rekindle the beacon and thereby confirm that coincidences have pattern/meaning—is established early and carried through. There is a clear escalation from tracing the paths to the tower igniting, but external resistance or meaningful risk is minimal; success comes without much on-page opposition or real uncertainty. Internal stakes deepen (her understanding of what she’s really seeking), yet they’re resolved quickly once the flare occurs. As a result, tension is present but relatively gentle rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether she can force a stable identity from accumulating others’ memories—emerges early and tightens as the Spear’s shadow “twitches” and the offered memory confronts her method. The main escalation is conceptual: the vault-versus-river realization reframes her life’s work and forces a costly renunciation of control. Her choice to stop sculpting and simply listen is a credible earned stasis that forecloses a long-held path. Because conflict is almost entirely internal and never quite threatens a concrete loss beyond worldview, the pressure feels slightly muted relative to the beauty of the realization.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether light and memory can be rekindled in a cursed, starless place—is clear and scales appropriately for the length. There is one meaningful tightening when she finds “Defy the weight” and chooses to act in defiance of the villagers’ fear and the sky’s refusal. However, resistance is largely atmospheric; nothing truly pushes back against her beyond inherited dread, so escalation feels more like a smooth rise than a pressured test. The victory comes without a sharp on-page sacrifice or reversal, limiting tension.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—how to respond to the fisherman’s grief and question about fate—is clear but quietly handled. Pressure deepens as she listens in the grotto and glimpses the “shape” of his future, culminating in the decision to give up the cicada and answer obliquely. Escalation is more conceptual than dramatic; there is no sharp reversal, but there is a meaningful tightening when she chooses renunciation (of the cicada and of explicit prophecy) over direct comfort. The relatively low overt conflict keeps this from higher bands, but within a lyric, accumulative mode the stakes still read as real.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—confining “safety” versus dangerous self-actualization—is legible from early on and tightens with each inversion as the trellis grows more potent and the bunker more coffin-like. The central turn is appropriately driven by the child’s choice to take the bloom’s silence and later to unfold the bunker and leave, which forecloses return and abandons the father. Internal and external conflicts are mostly well-braided, but the off-page approaching “they” and the father’s role as a largely static obstacle keep stakes a bit more abstract than they need to be. A clearer on-page cost or danger in that final confrontation would raise the pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether silence can hold and redirect grief rather than erase or accuse—is clear early and tightened via the storm glass’s darkening and the passenger’s flinch at the child’s laughter. Escalation is subtle but real: from mere monitoring to active intervention (dial, spoon, explanation) that visibly affects her body language and the city’s soundscape. The conflict remains primarily internal and ambient, with no sharp reversal or narrowed options beyond this one shared passage. That quietness suits the mode but keeps the sense of risk and cost at an understated level rather than fully acute.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elsin will restart or end the cycle of ascension—emerges clearly and tightens as she descends, learns the throne’s true purpose, and confronts it. The main escalation comes from knowledge deepening rather than external resistance, and her act of placing the flake into the throne is a genuine, consequential choice that forecloses a path for herself and the city. However, both danger and inner conflict feel relatively low-friction; there’s little sense that she might waver or fail once the revelation lands. The pressure is coherent and sufficient for length, but not maximally sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lior will cling to his severed connections (ghost-debts) or release them at the cost of his self-protective isolation—is clear and tightened well through the encroaching signs and the shadow’s confrontation. The pressure intensifies from subtle hauntings to a direct demand: “You don’t have to let us in, but you have to let us go,” forcing a trade-off between clean silence and genuine release. His agency in seizing and turning the ring earns the resolution, but the sense of immediate risk if he refuses (what happens if he doesn’t let them go?) remains more implied than viscerally dramatized. The conflict is rich and coherent, just slightly under-escalated in concrete consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Lina will submit to or break the “quantum promise” loop that echoes her MLM past—is clearly seeded and tightened through the escalating messages and the “break it or become it” ultimatum. Her agency drives the key turns: snarky reply, decision to twist the bolt, and later refusal to check the final buzz, each narrowing her options and entailing cost. Internal and external conflicts interweave effectively: her history with exploitative systems informs how she reads and resists this metaphysical one. The escalation is primarily internal and conceptual rather than physically perilous, so the tension is strong but not quite maximal for elite outlets.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will remain a mute endpoint or bridge into the dynasty’s hidden intuition—is clear and followed through. Pressure deepens as the vague family myth becomes an embodied phenomenon (standing waves, the mirror, the reflection’s admonition) and forces him to revise his approach from seeking to listening. However, the conflict is largely internal and meditative, with minimal resistance or reversal once the mirror appears; the “of course” moment undercuts potential struggle. The cost and narrowing of options register, but the sequence never truly tightens into a hard dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether the knight remains trapped in silent, complicit spectatorship or risks joining the dangerous performance—is clear and escalates effectively through the tightening threads and the imperative to *unsnap*. His agency at the key turn (breaking the gauntlet, speaking) earns the resolution, and the cost (painful return to voice and role) is on the page. The conflict’s consequences remain more metaphysical than concrete, which slightly mutes visceral tension even as conceptual stakes run high.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will let another file pass into oblivion or intervene to honor Daniel’s hidden history—is clearly established. Pressure builds modestly as curiosity turns into emotional investment, culminating in the choice to research and send the envelope. The escalation is more tonal and ethical than dramatic; there’s no strong reversal or moment where he risks something tangible beyond his own guardedness. For a quiet story this is sufficient, but the felt cost of his decision could be sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving the erased and resisting the Council’s revisionism—is clear early and tightened when Rook warns, “They’re moving the last archive tomorrow… Burning what’s left.” That information forces Lena into immediate action, and her decision to burn the archive and steal the ledger is a meaningful stance crystallization. However, the key conflict beats (infiltration, moral calculus of arson versus preservation, risk of capture) are summarized rather than dramatized, which blunts felt pressure and visible cost in the climactic operation. The quieter, accumulative pressure around indifference and memory carries tension, but there’s room for one more concrete, on-page test of her commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether he can contain or hush a dangerous prophecy through his art—is clear and active on the page, and pressure rises as the grotto resists his attempts. The escalation from initial playing to the grotto answering, the prism weeping rainbows, and the younger screaming self in the glass provides a meaningful tightening. However, the external consequences of failure remain more atmospheric than concrete, so the felt price is mostly his ongoing servitude rather than a sharply articulated harm. The final choice to return is thematically strong but reads as quiet endurance rather than a hard-forced trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora will assume the charged role of “key’s keeper” and accept the transformation it entails—is clear and intensifies across the piece. Escalation is present: the key manifests, the dead/forgotten return in uncanny forms, the arbor reshapes into a ladder, and finally she eats the sapling’s leaf and jumps, foreclosing a human life. However, on-page tension is largely conceptual and aesthetic; Liora meets each heightening without visible fear or doubt, softening the felt price. The conflict remains compelling but somewhat serene, more ritual acceptance than pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether he can stop compulsively “fixing what can’t be fixed”—is present from the first paragraph and tightens meaningfully once the waterfall questions him and offers the ledger. His agency drives each major turn: following the leaves downward, inserting the gear into the compass, choosing not to wind the clock, and finally letting the last gear go. The escalation is more contemplative than visceral; while that suits the mode, the cost of his renunciation remains largely conceptual rather than dramatized in a concrete loss or sacrifice. That keeps the pressure strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora will risk repeating the experiment that likely killed Veyra, and what legacy she will accept—is clear and thematically tied to her fear of the name’s weight. Escalation comes from her decision to feed the coin into the crucible despite explicit peril (“reduce her to ash”), then to pour the memory vial into her own furnace. However, the decisions read a bit unopposed; once she resolves to try, there’s little sustained internal wrestling or counter-pressure in the peak beats. The cost is primarily conceptual and emotional, and it lands, but more friction in the choice moments would sharpen the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether this singular, laughing soul will remain broken or be re-integrated—is clear, but the pressure is quiet and mostly internal. Escalation occurs via realization rather than reversal: Liora shifts from assuming release to recognizing the need for “integration,” then acts by using the petals and inviting a joke. Her agency shapes the resolution, yet the options never feel sharply narrowed or dangerous, and there’s little tangible price paid beyond emotional openness. It works for a lyric piece, but for elite venues the conflict could use one more beat of pressure or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Liran can metabolize his torture and the “math of mercy” without breaking—is present early and sharpened at the shrine. Escalation is primarily internal and textural: interrogation memories, the interrogator’s vision, the pillars’ “song,” and his submission of forehead to the water. His agency consists of enduring, engaging, and accepting the cost of insight rather than fleeing or shutting down, which suits the mode. Still, antagonistic pressure is somewhat diffuse, and the external situation (e.g., danger if he fails) remains abstract, limiting visceral stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lior can find a meaningful anchor and re-engage with overlooked histories—is clear but kept almost entirely on an interior, conceptual plane. There is a mild tightening when Elara’s name and log appear and the market’s lights dim, but no real narrowing of options or hard trade-off; Lior never risks or relinquishes anything she clearly values. The resolution arises from a realization plus a small ritual act (fitting the lens into the coat) rather than a pressured choice with visible cost. As a result, tension is present but gentle, more contemplative than compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the paused circus mechanism will restart and re-enslave the ghosts or be permanently unwound—is legible and escalates from puzzling cracks to a moral choice. The key tightening comes when the ticket girl reveals “They forgot to wind it down,” reframing his job from repair to liberation. Elias’s agency in choosing to destroy the gears rather than “fix” them provides earned resolution. Still, the conflict is mostly one-sided; there’s little resistance (internal or external) to complicate that choice or to register a sharp price beyond the conceptual loss of the show.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central stake—whether the brittle, “perfect” system of the library will hold or fall, and what Elias will choose when it doesn’t—is cued early and tightened by the forbidden act of printing the bottled whisper. Escalation is clear and accumulative: restless library → ominous frost → deployment of destabilizing whisper → violent shuddering and multi-library glimpses → revelation that Elias himself is the system’s rupture point → dissolution. Elias’s main act of agency is double-edged: using the whisper in an attempt to stabilize, and then accepting that the true, necessary outcome is collapse and awakening. The piece is more lyric than suspenseful—Elias rarely feels in doubt or at risk of a different choice—which slightly mutes tension even as the cost is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—the cultural and interpretive battle over the Republic’s legacy—is clear and tight, and Elias’s ritual is a direct, escalated response. The main tightening comes when the shard activates and briefly restores the cathedral, forcing Taelis to confront the living weight of what she’d reduced to data. However, external resistance is relatively soft and short-lived; the argument resolves after one miraculous proof without significant further challenge. The internal and external conflicts interweave well but could register one more pressured test of his goal.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will attempt to “fix” the cursed construct and at what cost—tightens steadily from examination to bodily commitment to full surrender of self. His agency drives the turn: pressing the stone to his chest, cranking the mechanism, and allowing it to “take his honesty first” are explicit, escalating choices. The price is legible both personally and civically (his erasure, clocks running backward, thieves choking on truth). Conflict remains mostly internal and metaphysical, but the pressure never feels static or vague.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will pursue or renounce the lure of ultimate explanation—is legible and escalates as he moves from factory to cliffs to arch. The lagoon sequence and the arches chamber represent a clear tightening and conceptual raising of stakes, but the danger remains mostly metaphysical; physical or relational cost is implied more than felt. His choice to drop his hand and later burn the notes does foreclose a path in a credible earned-stasis way. A slightly sharper sense of what he risks (sanity, death, being trapped across a threshold) at the hinge point would deepen tension.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—finding a way back from being lost in the storm—exists but never feels sharply pressured; once the slide is tried, the solution unfolds with little real resistance or risk. The internal stake of wanting to “leave a mark” is more textured but also unfolds without genuine threat of loss or failure. Escalation consists mainly of deepening understanding rather than narrowing options, which suits the lyric mode but keeps tension relatively soft. The closure is earned, but the path there lacks a truly testing turn.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake is Liora’s need to understand the flowers/silence, and there is a clear tightening when the postcards become “clues” and the glass finally “shivers,” pushing her into a new understanding. However, opposition and cost are gentle: nothing truly resists her beyond ambiguity and her own previous habit of seeking answers. The key turn—choosing to listen and not paint—is meaningful but low-pressure, with only a lightly implied price in relinquishing control and explanation. For a top-tier venue, one more concrete or emotionally fraught pressure point would help.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether buried truth will be erased, weaponized, or transformed—is clear and present early. Pressure escalates with the appearance of the Historical Revision Board and Elias’s forced choice between running, opposing, or signaling, culminating in his renunciation of archival possession. However, the external conflict resolves quite easily once he arranges the shells; the Board’s retreat feels low-cost and almost mystical, shifting most of the real price to internal terrain. The internal conflict is strong enough to carry the story, but one more concrete consequence or risk in the confrontation scene would deepen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether he can and will truly reconstitute the town rather than live in sterile survival—is clear and thematically apt. Pressure escalates via the bottle demanding “conception,” the gradual thickening of sensory reality, and the risk that this might be illusion or a repeat of past wish-disaster, though that risk stays mostly implicit. His main tightening choice is to commit fully to the vision (keeping eyes closed, intensifying concentration) and then to relinquish the bottle once the town is alive. The conflict remains somewhat internal and contemplative; a slightly sharper articulation of potential loss or failure on the page would push stakes higher.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    The primary conflict is internal and conceptual: what it means to receive an unintended prophecy and how a scrupulous archivist should respond. Pressure escalates once the Akkadian voice speaks and especially when it personalizes the warning (“You are the hinge”), narrowing his options to exploit, suppress, or ritualize the event. However, the stakes remain abstract—the city’s danger and the tower’s “weeping” are gestured at more than concretely felt—and there is no strong external counterforce pushing against his ethic. The resulting tension is atmospheric and meaningful but not quite at a gut-twist level.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central stake—whether Liora can outmaneuver the vortex and preserve her seed inheritance—is present early and escalates as the vortex wakes, howls, and physically shatters the ice. Her choice to spend the last acorn and root the chick against the vortex’s pull is an earned peak turn. The external danger and internal resolve interweave well, though the felt cost of that choice (what’s irrevocably foreclosed) could be made slightly more visceral on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the bell will warn the valley in time—is stated early and followed through, with the key tightening when Elias hears the warped aftertone and realizes the new bindings might fail under solstice winds. His swift decision to undo and reweave the rope under a ticking “minutes before zero hour” clock provides a credible escalation. However, the danger remains abstract and off-stage; we never see even a near-miss, so the felt cost and pressure stay relatively subdued. The conflict is more technical and philosophical than visceral, which suits the piece but limits intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is existential and emotional—Eli’s solitude versus connection and meaning—signaled early and tightened by the star’s arrival and the station’s alarms. The key escalation is his refusal to follow safety protocols in favor of opening himself to the star, then choosing to leave the only home he’s known. However, external stakes (physical danger, institutional consequences) remain abstract, so tension relies almost entirely on spiritual/emotional framing. The conflict resolves cleanly in Eli’s favor with relatively little friction, which slightly blunts the sense of price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether his chosen silence and custodianship will hold or transform when confronted by the ghosts/covenant—tightens effectively around the box’s seam shivering and the demand to “break it.” Pressure escalates not through reversals but through density: the humming ghosts, physical vibration, and the box finally opening into a blinding, wing-like sound. His action (accepting the opening, lifting the comb) is a credible crystallization of stance rather than a dramatic volte-face, and it leads to a clear reweighting of the world. Stakes remain mostly conceptual and spiritual, so visceral cost is present but muted.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s need to reclaim or reconfigure time in a world where it’s broken—is present but mostly conceptual and under-pressured. Escalation is gentle: each discovery deepens his understanding but he faces no real resistance, deadline, or concrete threat, and his choice at the end feels inevitable rather than hard-won. The note and twin watch provide the main tightening, shifting him from passive observer to active continuer of Marlen’s work. A sharper sense of what he stands to lose or a more tangible obstacle would lift the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes are entirely internal—the poet’s relationship to incompleteness—and that’s valid for this mode but yields relatively low pressure. There is a soft escalation: from passive observation to active inscription, then to wading in after the fallen kite and tying its frayed string to himself. However, no single moment sharply forecloses an alternative path; his acceptance feels more like a gentle crystallization than a tested choice. The piece could gain tension if one object (feather or kite) demanded a trade-off that visibly cost him something more than damp trousers.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elira can spend her last months reshaping the orchard’s philosophy in defiance of the elders—remains clear and coherent, and tension heightens modestly when the specific sapling is threatened with uprooting. The conflict is quiet and largely ideological, but the scene with Tomas functions as a meaningful tightening where her stance is tested and partially transmitted. Cost is legible in her physical deterioration and ultimate death, and in the implied ongoing struggle against institutional doctrine. Escalation is more accumulative than sharply turning, which fits the mode but keeps it just shy of peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will cling to disenchanting skepticism or surrender to a universe that may be "homesick"—is clear and escalates through the door, terminal questions, hologram, and the figure’s offer. Each step narrows her options conceptually, culminating in a committed departure with a real (if mostly implied) personal cost. However, tension could sharpen if her ties to the human world and her professional identity were more actively in conflict at the moment of decision, rather than mainly in backstory. The lack of a serious on-page temptation to refuse keeps this from a higher pressure score.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether life can reclaim a place structured by mass death—is clear and tonally supported, and his repeated returns with different seeds imply persistence against a resistant environment. However, escalation is gentle: there’s no sharp turn where options narrow or a meaningful alternative is foreclosed. His agency is steady ritual rather than tested commitment, and no on-page moment forces a painful trade-off. The conflict remains more atmospheric than pressurized, which works lyrically but limits impact at elite-publication standards.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Rook will obey the riddle and risk himself to transform distance into a new kind of closeness—is signaled early and tightened as he leaves the safety of the settlement for the unknown dome. Pressure escalates in an accumulative way: from eerie message to physical journey to the intimate, binding encounter with the vines in the dark. His choice to reach into the dome and allow himself to be taken is a clear, costly act that forecloses the path of solitary, surface existence. The conflict is more existential and atmospheric than combative, so while tension is strong, it never quite bites into hard dilemma between sharply opposed options.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lira remains in the dead station or risks herself to follow the anomaly—is present but under-articulated in terms of concrete danger or loss. There is escalation (from eerie quiet to anomaly to compass activation to literal leap), and her agency clearly drives the turn. However, opposition is mostly ambient (void, abandonment) rather than sharply dramatized, so the pressure feels more wondrous than harrowing. The cost of jumping (potential death, permanent severance from “home” as place) is only lightly implied, which softens the tension curve.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming the lid/legacy under the eye of a controlling Keeper—is clear, and there is a meaningful tightening when he catches her and confronts her at the chessboard. Her choice to reveal his name and leave him a chance at change delivers a quiet but credible resolution. However, opposition never bites very hard: the climb is described as perilous but passes without complication, and the Keeper shifts from threat to ally fairly quickly with no serious test of her plan. The result is elegant but somewhat low-tension, more fable-like than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether anything meaningful can persist against a devouring force of forgetting—is legible early and deepens as we move from collected gestures to the pawns’ “unbinding” to the weaponized silence of the wings. Pressure escalates when the penumbra “stirred,” then “lunged,” and Liora responds by shifting from cataloguing to actively inscribing *release* and sacrificing the board’s old form. Agency drives the turn: she chooses a tactic (walk-spells, breaking the board) that forecloses the old game and its rules. The internal emotional risk of that move (abandoning the comfort of narrative/story for silence) could be made more viscerally costly to reach a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake is Elias choosing whether to continue numbing/evading his talent or to inhabit it fully; this is signaled early via the pain of remembering and his history of suppression. Pressure escalates as the stone reveals his past and reframes his “pain of remembering” as the cost of refusing his future, leading to the charged act of planting the glyph-seed and stepping through the door. The internal and external conflicts (stone’s call vs. his fear of what seeing entails) are well braided but remain largely lyrical—there’s little sense that he might truly turn away at the last moment. The result is beautiful but somewhat low-torque; the choice reads inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether he will face and integrate his failures or continue to flee—is signaled early and steadily tightened through the tapestry’s painful revelations and the confrontation with the etched “impossible” move. Escalation is largely internal but clear: from abstract regret to embodied engagement with the girl and the board. The cost is the surrender of his defensive distance and self-image as infallible tutor, dramatized through being bested in seven moves and choosing to play again. The conflict could feel sharper if one more moment explicitly tempted him to retreat, but as-is it still reads as a meaningful narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora can subvert the absolution ritual before it disperses responsibility again—is clear and lives under a visible clock (“before the ritual”). Pressure escalates coherently from the canyon’s held breath to the rising chant, the opalescent glow, the first sabotaging line, and finally the shattering spire amid unleashed echoes. Agency is central: her choice to speak/carve at that exact fissure at that exact moment triggers the story’s turn. For elite-level stakes, the visible cost to Liora herself at the climax (risk of death, exile, or specific loss) could be sharpened beyond bleeding hands and implied danger.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central stake—will the alchemist’s ultimate act of repair matter, or will everything dissolve into the acid sea—is clearly signaled and tightened by the physical decay around them. Escalation tracks well: from touching the statue to inserting the right key, to the statue opening and forcing a commitment to step forward or be claimed by the sea. Internal and external stakes interlock: the choice is both “save the world / embrace meaning” and “surrender control / identity,” with the cost of abandoning all the small repairs of a lifetime. The only constraint is that the world-scale consequence is more symbolic than concretely opposed on the page, so tension stays at a powerful but intimate register.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—how Elias will relate to time, grief, and his promise—stays clear and culminates in his choice to abandon the surface world for the cave. There is a meaningful tightening when he discovers the pool and then later burns his paintings, foreclosing a return to his prior life. Still, the pressure is more elegiac than tense; opposition is largely internal and never quite sharpens into a moment where he might believably choose differently. The result is resonant but soft-edged in terms of felt jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether subtle, intentional “whispers” can call and change people more effectively than blunt force—is clear and tied to Elias’s need to be heard. Pressure escalates from private listening to an experimental beckoning that must succeed (boats turning) to a relational test when Harkin confronts him, forcing him to reveal and relinquish the cork. The cost is mostly internal and relational (surrendering proof, Harkin’s shaken certainties, Elias giving up his talisman), not life-and-death, which keeps the tension quiet rather than sharp. Still, the conflict between methods (horn vs intent, shout vs whisper) resolves in a way that feels earned and materially alters their options going forward.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Lena’s mapping of loss can become more than an obsessive memorial—is clear, and the midnight call pattern creates gentle but coherent pressure. The key tightening is her decision to reverse the usual dynamic by dialing out and telling the woman “Start walking,” transforming her role from archivist to guide. However, the conflict remains largely internal and textural; there is little direct on-page resistance or a sharply articulated price to this shift beyond implied emotional strain, so the sense of escalation is strong-but-muted rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Lior will expose or neutralize the eye under the constraints of a no-lie world—is clear early and tightens as the warlord’s men approach. The key escalation comes from his choice to smear truffle over the eye and test that strategy against interrogation, then escalate further by burying it, foreclosing a powerful option. Internal and external pressures (survival vs moral danger of revelation) are well braided, though the confrontation with the men is resolved a bit quickly and safely, muting peak tension slightly. Still, the final renunciation reads as a real cost-bearing decision, not a default.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will accept, decode, and ethically handle the stranger’s transferred memories—is legible but remains quiet and cerebral. His 72-hour investigation and the saltwater ritual provide a meaningful deepening of pressure, culminating in his decision to pin the boutonnière back on and climb to the lantern room. However, there’s little sense of alternative paths or real jeopardy if he refused or failed; the conflict lacks a sharper edge or concrete cost beyond mood. As a result, tension is steady and absorbing but rarely gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—will he finally answer the promise and accept the cost of a different life—is clear and escalates through the chip’s insistence, the ants’ test, and the roaring creek. The strongest tightening is at the doorway, where he must choose between “unsold maps” and the “child’s sob,” and the creek’s arrival forecloses dithering. However, the external peril of the water feels more atmospheric than truly constraining his tactics, and we don’t quite see a concrete loss from abandoning his former life. The pressure is coherent and satisfying, but not razor-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—what she will trade (crown, humanity, soul) to answer the grotto’s call—is clear and escalates steadily from ominous dreams to literal bodily dissolution. The high priest’s warning, the forbidden climb, and the fireflies turning into teeth each provide a tightening turn that narrows her options. Her decision to immerse her hand in the fissure is an unambiguous, costly act that resolves the central tension in a way consistent with her values. The primary limitation is the relative absence of real tactical resistance; she never seriously tries, or even imagines, an alternative, which flattens the moral calculus somewhat.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—how Elias will orient to presence (capturing vs. becoming/giving)—is signaled, but pressure stays low and largely interior. There is one meaningful tightening when he recognizes the shell as a key and chooses to hand it to Liora and jump, but this decision is not strongly opposed or risky on the page. Internal and external conflict are well braided symbolically, yet there’s no real sense that he might refuse or fail, so escalation is more contemplative deepening than sharpened dilemma. The cost of his choice remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.3)
    The central stake—whether Elias stays trapped as the “keeper of forgotten hours” or abandons that role—is legible and escalates from private nostalgia to direct confrontation with his younger self. The pressure tightens around the scroll: lie or tell the truth, keep revising or allow its destruction. Burning the scroll is a clear, protagonist-driven act that forecloses a path with cost (the scream of misquoted voices, the end of his chronicler identity). The conflict is more internal/thematic than peril-driven, but it deepens rather than stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes are quiet but real: the woman’s desire to decode her grandmother’s legacy and Elias’s ongoing negotiation with his own loss and purpose. Pressure coheres more emotionally than causally, deepening as he interprets the screw and recognizes parallels to his own life. However, escalation is subtle, with no strong reversal or forced trade-off; the story maintains a gentle gradient rather than a clear tightening hinge. The final choice—to frame time as something to be read and to record the woman’s hands—feels earned but not heavily contested.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.0)
    The primary conflict—Lian’s fear of what runes and storms can do to her versus her need to use them to transform—is clearly established and tightened over the scene. Escalation is internal but legible: from trembling with the quill to inscribing *unbinding* into stone, enduring its flare, allowing the quill to shed, and finally daring to apply the crystallized tip to her oldest scar. The cost is primarily psychic (relinquishing her defensive stance toward scars and storms), and while subtle, it does foreclose the path of continued avoidance. External pressure from the storm is present but could be felt a bit more viscerally to further heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stakes—reconciling with Elias and honoring the doomed orchard—are clearly established and interwoven, and the perfume ritual is a meaningful tightening that forces them to confront buried hurt. The magic’s pain (“It hurts.” / “Good. That means it’s working.”) makes the emotional price explicit, and the refusal of a neat external fix (the trees still fall) keeps the conflict from dissolving into convenience. However, the pressure arc remains relatively smooth; there’s little sense that Mara’s plan might fail or backfire in any way that would change her tactics, which slightly softens escalation. The piece works very well as a quiet, situational deepening, but one sharper trade-off or near-miss choice could further sharpen stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether to perpetuate or break the spiral arbitration of history and meaning—is clearly present and progressively tightened through the shifting dictionary, the question of “beginning or end,” and the revelation that the library is dying. The major turn is his active destruction of the dictionary, a choice that forecloses the continuation of history-as-arbitration and leads to the universe’s reset. Internal and external conflicts are interwoven but largely on an abstract plane, so the tension feels more conceptual than visceral. Still, the escalation is legible and the resolution is earned by his actions rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will use his inherited authority to pull a lost ship through at potential cost to himself and reality—is clear early and escalates smoothly via the countdown, black water, and his split presence on ship and cliff. The arrival of the woman’s warning crystallizes the conflict and forces a decisive renunciation with visible moral cost. Internal and external pressures (Bureau expectations, father’s legacy, the pleading crew) are well braided, though his precise fear of consequences remains somewhat implied rather than sharply articulated. The choice feels earned and irreversible, if not quite as agonizing on the page as it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lena can find a way of understanding systems that doesn’t repeat the hospital’s blind spots and lets her grieve—is clear early and coherently pursued. Pressure escalates quietly as she moves from observing anomalies to attempting to interface with the network and, crucially, to relinquishing the scanner and her technician stance. The internal cost of letting go of familiar tools and a purely instrumental mindset is legible but stays largely conceptual rather than being forced by a concrete on-page ultimatum. The piece favors deepening over overt reversals, which suits the mode but caps intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether to obey a “responsible” recovery script or risk a different, more magical way of seeking meaning and perhaps help—is clearly signaled and coherently pressured. Escalation occurs as she moves from minor defiance (leaving the hospital) to experimental risk (choosing blue) to a full commitment to contradiction (refusing to choose a path and walking into the light). Agency drives each turn, and the final leap forecloses the safer, inherited path. The emotional and ethical cost is present but could be edged sharper with one more concrete nod to what she’s risking in the real world at the moment of crossing.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s need to manage loneliness by mediating other people’s endings—is clear but under-intensified. We’re told this caller is “different,” yet on the page her presence doesn’t significantly alter his tactics or force a new kind of risk; the pattern mostly repeats with a slightly softer emotional crest. The main tightening is her crying and his choice to invite a repeat call and then hang up first, but this feels more like a reaffirmation than a pressured turn. As a result, tension is gently sustained rather than meaningfully escalated.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether memory, ritual, and “small moments” can regenerate a broken covenant—is clear, but the pressure is gentle and largely internal. There is one meaningful deepening: the realization that context keeps shifting “this time, by her hand,” which reframes her copying as an act that changes the world rather than merely preserves it. However, the conflict never quite bites; no concrete obstacle tests her commitment beyond the ache of loss. As a result, tension is more meditative than urgent, which limits the sense of escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether loneliness can be “cured” and how Lena will handle that power—is present but largely conceptual and faces little on-page resistance. The main tightening is the shift from seeking a virologist with a miracle drug to confronting that the “cure” is relational and ledger-based, which reweights her goal but doesn’t force a difficult trade-off under pressure. Her choice to leave the rock behind is meaningful but not heavily contested; she never seriously considers hoarding it. As a result, escalation feels more like graceful deepening than genuine narrowing of options with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—can he find the stillpoint in time to reconfigure his relationship to grief—is clear and signaled early. Escalation occurs through pattern break rather than overt danger: the ring’s warming, the thickening musical labyrinth, and then the radical silence where “the music stopped.” The cost is internal and credible (accepting mapped grief rather than erasure), but external pressure (what happens if he fails during this pause?) remains somewhat abstract, keeping tension below peak levels. Still, the stillpoint moment is a genuine tightening and resolves via his agency and endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    The primary conflict is internal—how Elias relates to his past errors and the mutable universe—framed against the pressure of the anomaly’s edit-like presence. There is a clear deepening when the vellum pre-writes “The seeds were never wrong. The soil was,” forcing a reinterpretation of his supposed failure. The later choice to walk to the hydroponic bays and “plant again” offers a credible, if quiet, escalation of commitment. However, the stakes never bite quite as hard on the page—there’s little concrete risk or irreversible loss visible in the present moment, keeping tension relatively low-key.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—fighting a devouring force of forgetting to “remember them back”—is clear and escalates meaningfully once the harbor flinches and the faceless singer appears. Pressure tightens through concrete turns: appearance of the shadow, then the singer’s hungry “note,” then the choice to advance and use the camera + signs as weapons. Agency is strong, particularly in Liora’s lunge *toward* danger and Elias’s decision to keep signing, but the cost is more conceptual/ontological than visceral; they win without clear risk of loss beyond implication. That keeps the conflict powerful but stops it just shy of the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the dangerous “promise” survives—is clear and escalates from fragments to the intact ledger, forcing a final, irrevocable act of destruction. Internal conflict between honoring the archivist’s belief and preventing harm is present and paid off in his decision to burn the book and archive. However, the pressure remains almost entirely internal; there’s no external counterforce or live alternative tactic to heighten the moral calculus beyond a single, though strong, choice. As a result, tension is deep but not particularly dynamic in terms of reversals or narrowed options.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—Lira reclaiming her mind and freeing others’ memories from exploitative captivity—is signaled early and followed through. Pressure escalates as her drumming summons increasingly intense, specific memories, culminating in the decision to fully release them despite potential consequences. The cost is present but somewhat lightly handled; we intuit social/medical fallout and the loss of potential “healing,” but it isn’t confronted directly on the page. The internal vs external stakes could tighten further with one more explicit friction point about what she’s giving up.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—can Lior meet the challenge on his own quiet terms and thereby earn/understand the unchanging map—is clear and thematically aligned. Pressure escalates from noticing the off-rhythm walk, to receiving the shifting map, to committing to navigate using listening and the coin. However, the path to the “choice” dent unfolds with little resistance or genuine risk on the page; success feels almost inevitable once he decides to step past her. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, which keeps tension from reaching a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the boy can endure his shame and move toward reconnection—is clear from his entrance “carrying his father’s silence like a second skin.” Pressure escalates subtly as the guardian’s weaving intensifies and the mirror’s image shifts from canal to sky to the boy himself bathed in starlight, culminating in his decision to leave the note and walk away steadier. The conflict is almost entirely internal and lyrical, which suits the piece but keeps the sense of cost relatively soft; nothing is truly foreclosed, though a charged new trajectory is established. One more concrete on-page risk or resistance could sharpen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—saving the library from closure—is clear from early on, and pressure escalates through the coordinated displays to the noon hammer attempt. Elias’s agency drives the key turns: recruiting students, mapping the grotto lines into filings, and accepting a strategy that exposes the conflict rather than “winning” outright. However, opposition folds quickly: the workers back off after one painful strike, and we don’t see a serious counter-move or a visible sacrifice beyond the risk taken. The cost therefore feels more conceptual than embodied, keeping the conflict solid but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias remains bound to the dying island or answers the sea’s call—is signaled early and escalates as the whale’s call deepens, the scrimshaw vibrates, and his body physically “unfolds.” His agency in returning the scrimshaw and choosing to dive without looking back earns the resolution. However, antagonistic pressure is mostly situational and internal; the dockworkers’ awareness never concretely challenges him, and his doubts or fears barely flare before being overridden by destiny/recognition. The result is a beautiful but relatively unopposed escalation, with limited sense of price paid beyond implication.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Lena will remain in the Mandate’s emotional paralysis or risk genuine feeling—is signaled early and sharpened by the arrival of the happiness tin. Escalation is quiet but definite: from numb observation to a physicalized break (the scream) and then to a new pattern of coping (teaching whittling). The main turn is internal, yet Harkin’s presence and the turbines’ oppressive hum keep a subtle situational pressure on her choice. Stakes are more intimate than dramatic, but they are clear and pay off without soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elira will submit to inherited sacred boundaries or let the atrium change her into someone who dissolves them—is clear and escalates as she synchronizes with the quartz and triggers the lake’s fracturing. Pressure deepens through her recognition that the ban was to contain the atrium, not the poets, and through the visible consequences (the glyphs rewriting, the hum climbing, the lake thawing). However, conflict remains largely internal and conceptual, with little true resistance or risk of failure in the moment; once she steps inside, her trajectory toward transformation is relatively unimpeded. The result is thematically potent but somewhat low on felt jeopardy or hard trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can transform his fear of silence into a shared, imperfect aliveness with Liora—is clear but softly pressed. There is a meaningful tightening when he composes the thorned-petal message and effectively asks Liora to “awaken,” risking their dynamic, and when he asks her to “stay.” However, pressure never bites very hard; no option feels truly dangerous or mutually exclusive, so the trade-offs remain gentle. The emotional resolution is earned but the escalation curve is modest, more deepening texture than genuine squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—can Liora discover a different mode of connection through sound—remains coherent, and there is a clear escalation in the phenomena she triggers. However, conflict stays mostly internal and situational; the researchers’ mild objection (“It’s not supposed to do that”) offers little real pressure, and no option is truly foreclosed with visible pain. The main tightening comes from the hum turning into a voice-like presence and then into a path that draws her deeper, culminating in her choice to leave the bell and accept an open-ended pilgrimage. It’s a satisfying deepening for a lyric piece, but tension never quite sharpens into genuine risk or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Lena will remain entombed in solitary grief or allow it to transform into connection—is clear and present early. Pressure coherently deepens as she moves from memorial jewelry to self-marking to sending cranes into the world and, finally, directly mentoring another mourner. The turns are all inward, and the path from discovery of the flower to communal teaching is a bit smooth, with limited resistance or real risk at each step, which modestly blunts tension.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding how belief and "decentralized trust" metastasized into a crash—is clear but remains intellectual rather than urgent. The main tightening occurs when the visitor personalizes the stakes (her brother as guru), which heightens moral complexity but doesn’t substantially narrow options or force a hard trade-off. Elias’s response—no sympathy, handing her the tape, refocusing on cultural measurement—reads as steady continuation rather than escalated pressure. As a result, tension hums rather than ratchets, and no on-page choice carries visible cost beyond implication.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether she can engage with this catastrophic knowledge without repeating history—is legible early and coheres throughout. Pressure escalates via the pagoda’s activation, the vision of her hollowed future self, and the chamber’s physical destabilization, culminating in her decision to unmake rather than decode. The cost is conceptual and emotional rather than concrete harm, but the choice clearly forecloses the path of mastery in favor of renunciation. Stakes could feel sharper if the potential consequences of failure were dramatized more viscerally than as inherited lore.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether and how to contain this unbound hope without being consumed—is clear and escalates as Liora confirms the stone’s history and the curator’s lie. The pressure tightens when she realizes “some shadows, once freed, sought vessels” and that she is vulnerable; her choice to offer her own shadow forecloses a major personal path. The cost is present but emotionally muted; she doesn’t visibly wrestle long with the loss of part of herself, so the peak tension could be sharpened. Still, the internal and conceptual conflict is coherent and resolves through her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can live in a way that justifies his self-concept as a healer rather than a con—is signaled early and coherently pursued. Pressure deepens rather than reverses: going back to the market, giving real medicine away, and contacting past victims each foreclose paths of anonymity and comfort. However, the external resistance is mild; no one actively opposes him on the page, so tension remains mostly interior and low-temperature. The final choice to continue outward into the world is meaningful but not sharply contested in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora will keep compulsively “reading” wounds or accept living with unanswered pain—is clear and tightened by the discovery of her mother’s file and the plants’ commentary. Pressure escalates texturally rather than via reversals: the frozen time, invasive plant voices, and the revelation that she is “the wound that wouldn’t close” all deepen the psychic cost. Her final act (writing on the file, then choosing not to decode her own scar) credibly forecloses her old mode of control. Still, conflict remains largely internal and lyrical, with limited sense that any alternative path remains live once the thematic frame is declared.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether she can retrieve/understand his unspoken goodbye and thereby let go—is legible from early on and tightens as visions deepen and the storm breaks. Pressure escalates texturally: first contact, then the discovery the letters are in the reels, then the realization that the “place” is a specific night/when, culminating in the choice to accept goodbye. The cost is internal but explicit: ending the search and accepting that the love existed but will not be revived. The conflict remains primarily interior and quiet, but it doesn’t feel static.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora will respond to the call and release the trapped creativity—is established, and the urgency (“before the light fades”) gives a faint clock. There is escalation in the shift from mysterious whispers to the violent surge of ink-and-ember creativity and the archway’s dissolution. However, tension is relatively soft: Liora encounters little opposition, internal or external, and success seems assured once she commits, with no genuine risk that freeing “ideas too wild for the world” might backfire. The result is a beautiful but low-friction arc where pressure deepens atmospherically more than it narrows options or enforces a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether this run on the looped tracks will nurture possibility rather than trigger another reset—is clear, and pressure does accumulate as Hollow discovers the spark and realizes the clock’s significance. Yet escalation is largely conceptual and lyrical; Hollow faces no real alternative path, and there’s little on-page resistance to his choice to protect the spark. The result is emotionally resonant but relatively gentle in terms of conflict and visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether he can “unravel” the hum and find the mind’s frontier—is clear, but the pressure remains meditative rather than urgent. There is one meaningful deepening when the clearing of fractal trees appears and the hum begins to act on him, culminating in the realization that he must become it. Still, there’s little sense of risk or competing options; nothing truly presses back against his quest. As a result, the internal conflict resolves smoothly without a pronounced sense of cost or tested commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether Liora will keep crossing or find the courage to remain—is clear, and it does tighten as she questions herself and ultimately lets the punch go. Internal and external pressures (the woman at the fire, the watching guides/passengers, the water as “persistent question”) reinforce the same axis of choice. However, the escalation is low-intensity and almost entirely interior; there’s little true resistance or risk beyond identity loss, which softens the sense of cost. The result is resonant but not sharply pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to re-enable a dangerous instrument that once enforced “safety” through silence—is clear and tight. Pressure escalates as the vibration in the walls intensifies, the bolt warms and pulses, the guests’ aborted scream demonstrates the lingering power of silence, and Elias must choose whether to hand over the bolt. The cost is primarily conceptual and social (shattering the fortress’s illusion of safety) rather than immediate physical peril, but it’s still felt. One slightly more concrete consequence or risk to Elias personally would clarify the price he’s paying in this moment.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether to destroy the scepter and thus unmake the pretender’s claim at the price of Lirien’s name and the kingdom’s suspended state—is legible and escalates once when Veythas commits to the sacrifice. Internal and external stakes are interwoven (truth vs. loyalty vs. political order), and the sunder choice clearly forecloses a path. However, the three-hundred-year delay and the final confrontation with the pretender feel too frictionless; there is little on-page testing of Veythas’s resolve or resistance from the opposing side. The pressure arc is coherent but relatively smooth, without a sharp beat where multiple live options feel painfully viable.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether to treat these anomalies as data to report or as paths to follow—is present early and tightens effectively toward the climax. Escalation is clear: from eerie gauges and folklore to an on-screen anomaly, to a physically exposed road, to the alarmed station and rapidly rising water as she must choose. The final choice is credibly hers (not a coincidence-based resolution), but the concrete danger and ethical trade-off are more implied than fully dramatized. A touch more friction—Lena actually hesitating or weighing Voss’s world against her grandmother’s—would sharpen the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.2)
    The core stake—whether the rebellion will stay dead in its lull or be reanimated—comes through clearly and escalates from private yearning to communal ignition. Pressure is mostly situational and internal, with the hum acting as catalyst rather than a true antagonist. Once Lena commits to the stones, events tilt in her favor without meaningful setback or visible sacrifice beyond risk and strain. The result is thematically satisfying but somewhat low-friction in terms of concrete cost and opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    Central stakes—whether tradition will ossify under the Council or evolve through Liora’s risky act—are clear and present early. Escalation tracks causally to the unsealing, which transforms the situation from private dissent to public, irreversible change. Yet opposition is surprisingly yielding: the elder’s resistance collapses quickly once touched by the vine, and no concrete price is extracted from Liora or the community on the page. The conflict is conceptually rich but a bit too smooth in execution.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Lena will remain frozen in grief or risk a more rooted future—is clear early and deepens steadily. Pressure escalates not through big external events but through accumulative intrusions: tourists’ optimism, the photo’s fragility, the child’s innocent mislabeling. Her decision to release the photograph and substitute the leaf is a credible, costly turn that narrows her options from endless fixation to an ongoing, embodied coexistence with pain. The conflict is quiet but not static; a slightly stronger mid-scene complication could have heightened tension further, but what’s here still reads as earned and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—how Elara will relate to darkness and fragmentation—is clear early and escalates as the lighthouse literally and figuratively closes in. The redesign of the tarot box is the central tightening choice, converting destruction into a doorway and key; her final act is a stance crystallization, not an accident. Stakes stay mostly internal and metaphysical, with little concrete jeopardy beyond implied obliteration, which keeps tension just shy of peak. Still, the narrowing from fearful clinging to chosen surrender is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—stopping or confronting the slow-thief and the rupture in time—is legible from early on and escalates into a direct confrontation and then a more dangerous conceptual pursuit. The key tightening is Kael choosing to use the nightmare-pattern that once harmed his sister, risking a repeat of that trauma to stop/understand the thief. However, the personal cost of stepping through (beyond implied danger and past experience) isn’t fully sharpened on the page, so the final choice reads slightly too frictionless. A bit more felt sacrifice or concrete alternative foreclosed would clarify the stakes at peak.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stake—personal survival versus exposing systemic erasure—is clearly signaled and escalates as Elara moves from passive archivist to active traitor. Her decision to flood the networks is a genuine point of no return that leads directly to armed confrontation and death. The internal moral calculus is present but could be sharpened further; the choice reads slightly foregone once the conspiracy is revealed, rather than agonizingly uncertain.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora will flee or remain to preserve this enclave of life—is clear and the story coherently pressures her commitment. However, escalation is relatively flat: the fissure appears but doesn’t worsen, and the outside catastrophe stays distant rather than forcing a new tactical choice. The main tightening is internal as she recommits to her path, which works but feels somewhat pre-decided from the start. The lack of a more concrete test of her resolve keeps the stakes from fully peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether he will answer or release the echo of his daughter within the larger crisis of broken cosmic patterns—is established early and tightened meaningfully once the pebbles spell her name and the goddess’s mouth appears. His agency drives each major turn: choosing where to dig, commanding silence, extracting and dispersing the shard of echo, and finally letting the last possible “sign” go without turning. The price is the relinquishment of the one remaining link to his daughter’s voice and the acceptance of a future defined by anticipatory readiness rather than reunion. The conflict could escalate one notch further on the page (e.g., more immediate danger or temptation from the false voice) for absolute top-band pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether Lydia will perpetuate a cover-up or resurrect her mother’s exposé—is clear and escalates through the discovery of the ledger entry and the revelation of the plates. The internal pressure between loyalty and integrity is strong conceptually, and the “orbit of regret” framing sharpens what’s at risk. Yet the conflict resolves quickly once the plates appear, with little real resistance or tangible danger on the page, so the price feels more implied than dramatized. A beat of concrete risk or sacrifice would raise the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she can escape the dissonance of her guilt or must face it—is signaled early and escalates through her decision to feed the machine, the revelation that it feeds on guilt, and the forced return to the crib. The key tightening is the realization that there is no erasure, only debt, which forces a different kind of payment at the climax. Her choice to reach for the baby and persist is clearly an earned, costly stance shift. Conflict remains mostly internal/ethical, so while it’s strong, it doesn’t quite strain to the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.0)
    The core stake—whether meaning and memory of the old gods will be erased or transformed—is clear and tightened when the flake insists “Interject now, or it collapses,” forcing Lior into a decisive act. His plunge into the mandala is a strong beat where agency directly shapes outcome, and the later choice to seed an unfinished path in the village square extends that stance. However, the conflict remains primarily conceptual; external opposition from the elders or community never materializes on the page as immediate pressure, so danger and cost are more implied than felt. The escalation works well for a quiet, accumulative story but doesn’t quite peak in visceral stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—memory and mercy versus sanctioned erasure—is clear early and tightens with the arrival of the commander and his explicit death threat. Elias’s agency drives the escalation; he keeps renaming in the face of danger, transforming mere defiance into a spiritual/psychic confrontation that forces the commander’s choice. However, the external peril resolves quickly once the commander speaks his son’s name, muting the sense of lasting cost or risk beyond that moment. The conflict is rich but could use one more explicit price or foreclosed option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias dies tonight—is clear early and coherently maintained, with Lydia’s compulsion to intervene as the active counterforce. Escalation is modest but real: the path appears, she engages him, then tightens pressure by showing visceral possible futures, culminating in the choice to pocket the pills. The cost is emotionally legible (he gives up his intended escape; she remains bound to her quiet, uncredited role), though Elias’s internal tug-of-war is sketched rather than deeply dramatized, which softens the sense of real resistance. Still, the decisive turn traces credibly to Lydia’s tactics and the orchard’s magic rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—Lena risking her mind/selfhood to follow Mira into an altered perceptual lattice—is clear and escalates from abstract curiosity to an embodied, near-irrevocable act. Pressure deepens through the activation of the lattice, the non-auditory “voice” of Mira, and finally the appearance of the door that concretizes the choice. Her decision to paint a path back and leave a light for Mira before stepping through is a credible trade-off between safety and pursuit. The main limitation is that consequence remains mostly foreshadowed; we feel risk but do not see even a small immediate loss beyond leaving the studio-world behind.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lior will align with the forbidden, living caves and assume the role of speaking for a post-human world—is clear and does tighten as the fossil heats, the chamber shifts, and the wrist display transforms. The escalation is primarily experiential and spiritual; the decisive turn comes when Lior speaks and the cave answers, reconfiguring their status with the world. However, antagonistic pressure is soft: the councils’ prohibition stays off-stage, and Lior is never forced into a concrete trade-off or visible sacrifice to secure this stance. As a result, the tension lives more in awe and revelation than in conflict with real costs.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—preventing the hourglass (and thus the village’s time) from breaking—is clearly signaled and tightened by the ledger entry that frames Button #9 as the fulcrum. Elias’s decision to seek the well and thread the button, knowing the catastrophic alternative, provides a credible single escalation point and a meaningful choice. However, the external conflict unfolds almost frictionlessly; the path is said to be dangerous but his retrieval faces no real obstacle or reversal, and there’s limited sense of competing goods or harms on the page. The internal and thematic tension is strong, but the practical stakes don’t bite as hard as they could during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Lena will re-engage with the dangerous, morally fraught work she burned for—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates in a focused way through the arrival of the man, his insistence on opening the pillbox, and the reveal of coordinates that personalize the call (“Fix what’s broken” in her own hand). Her choice to pocket the key and set off constitutes an earned, costly turn that narrows her future. The conflict is primarily internal and could use one more concrete external danger cue to feel fully sharpened, but it remains coherent and tense at this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is a mix of physical safety and ritual obedience: crossing at the right moment versus impatience and ignorance. Pressure escalates modestly through the fog’s two “liftings,” the slowing gutters, the parchment burning, and the crossing as the gutters fall silent mid-way. However, conflict stays mostly atmospheric; the merchant’s impatience never truly endangers them, and the girl’s break from her mother lacks a felt struggle on the page. The result is tense in texture but a bit light on on-page cost and contested choice.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—his need to understand and honor a place that “resists change”—is clear and persists throughout. Pressure escalates gently through the bee’s arrival and the increasing thrum, to the kiln and the decision to leave the glowing bowl behind rather than carry it back as mere artifact. This is a quiet, internal conflict; the cost (relinquishing the object, accepting remembrance over repair) is present but underplayed, so tension never tightens into something truly fraught. The story favors meditative deepening over sharp reversals, which suits the mode but limits intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes are modest but clear: can Lena risk emotional regrowth after trauma, embodied in whether her plants (and trust) can survive the night’s chill. Escalation comes through the basil’s sudden wilt, the blood offering, and Elias’s intrusion, which raises the emotional cost of staying closed off. Her decision to accept a second gauge and to “believe in the shape of an open door” is a real, if quiet, foreclosure of her old shut-down stance. The pressure never becomes urgent in a thriller sense, but for this scale it tightens appropriately.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—how to live with being the lone rememberer and erstwhile exterminator—registers early and tightens as the translator’s hour peaks. Escalation is clear at the bird’s lunge and the library’s shockwave; the hum’s crescendo forces Lior into active response (raising the sundial, engaging with the book) rather than passive witnessing. The resolution—letting the Hesperornis fly and stepping out of the library—reconfigures his prior self-punishing isolation, though the sense of price (leaving behind his only known refuge) is somewhat underplayed in favor of relief. Internal and external pressures intertwine effectively, if quietly.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake is Liora’s relationship to ownership of secrets: will she keep, give, or transform them. Pressure escalates modestly but clearly from giving up a client’s remnant to surrendering a deeply personal draft, then choosing to write differently afterward. The cost is mostly internal and conceptual, so the tension remains low-key rather than gripping. Within a quiet, lyric mode, the progression is convincing but not especially sharp-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—refusing to be a pawn of both cosmic forces and campus politics—is clear and escalates as Liora pushes harder against the signal and it pushes back. Her interference produces visible consequences (arguments falter, protests stall, the signal "laughs"), and there is a credible turn when the signal’s tone becomes curious instead of predatory. However, the on-page price she pays for this defiance is relatively soft; her professional and ethical risks are told more than felt in the climax. The tension is sustained but never quite bites as hard as the premise allows.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stakes—Elias versus his fear, and Elias versus the city’s dishonest geometry—are clear from early on and tie neatly to the Architect-King’s key. Escalation is effective: the descent, the organ’s scream, the chamber’s rearrangement, and especially the compass turning toward his chest build coherent pressure to a single high-stakes choice. His agency at the peak (driving the key into the table) earns the resolution. The tradeoff and price of that act are more conceptual than visceral, so the tension doesn’t quite reach an extreme pitch before it breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will bear honest witness to Liora’s erasure despite knowing it changes nothing externally—is clear and appropriate to the scale. Pressure escalates when he uses the lance and endures the painful replay of her death, forcing him to re-engage the empathy he’s buried. However, external opposition is minimal and he faces no truly wrenching choice between competing goods; the main risk is psychic strain. The result is a well-shaped but relatively low-intensity conflict arc.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will open or reject the threshold tied to his ancestor—is clear and tightened by the Maw’s movement and Liora’s urgent warning. Escalation tracks through his defiance (staying outside, then pressing the nail to the glass) to a strong climactic reversal when reality snaps back and the Maw vanishes. The cost of his curiosity is physical danger and the apparent loss of the opportunity to reach Orin, which makes his later burning of the journal meaningful. The large-scale stakes (what the Maw could do to the world) are left a bit abstract, keeping this slightly below the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will accept “amnesty” and step sideways out of his story—is clear and resolves through his agency. Pressure deepens as the glass reveals alternate paths and the road’s name-song opens a door, but the escalation is relatively smooth rather than sharply testing him. No serious counterforce or concrete loss pushes back against his desire, so the choice feels alluring more than harrowing. The ending has consequence but lacks a distinctly felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is Elias’s relationship to his past and to his father’s ethos—whether he will keep circling in the same pattern or adopt a different stance. Conflict is primarily internal and situational rather than oppositional, with the lion cage and money serving as pressure points that ask for a decision. The key deepening is the recollection of his father returning to the train and calling paths “spirals,” which sets up Elias’s own divergent choice at the end. Escalation is subtle and steady rather than sharply notched, so the tension feels more meditative than urgent, limiting the sense of high-stakes turn.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias must carry grief alone or can enter a shared network of burdens—is signaled early via the telegram and sister’s disappearance. Pressure escalates through the stars’ Morse-like summons and the temple’s reappearance in light, culminating in the ledger being rewritten and then vanishing, which forecloses his old mode of solitary chronicling. Conflict is primarily internal and conceptual; it deepens rather than reverses, appropriate to an accumulative lyric design. Still, the tension remains gentle rather than sharp, with little sense that he might meaningfully resist the transformation once it begins.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—forcing the lake to reveal what truly happened to his brother—arrives early and tightens through planting the seed and confronting the lake’s avatar. The key turn is the plant digesting the “confession,” which reconfigures both the external curse and Eldrin’s internal story, foreclosing his prior belief that his brother was taken. His final renunciation (walking away, accepting war’s end and silence) reads as an earned endurance choice with emotional cost. Escalation is strong but slightly front-loaded into the single ritual sequence, with limited tactical adaptation beyond initiating that ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering or “uneclipsing” the covenant—is clear, and the maze plus temporal warning from future-Liora provide some pressure. Yet escalation is relatively smooth; once she commits, the maze yields to her scars without serious setback, and the warning “you’re early” never forces a harrowing decision or sacrifice. The bridge crossing and chasm feel like formal tests rather than agonizing trade-offs. As a result, tension is present but muted, and the final victory reads more like fulfillment of design than something wrestled from real opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake (surrendering crippling guilt versus the cost of giving up the child’s name and further debt to the orchard) is clear and escalates when the roots target what she’s hidden deepest. The tightening turn—“The orchard knew”—is strong, and her non-resistance reads as a deliberate acceptance of cost. However, the conflict remains largely internal and somewhat one-directional; she never nearly balks or tries an alternate tactic once the true price is revealed. A slightly sharper beat of hesitation or competing value would heighten the sense of risk and pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Liam will continue to treat his life as “after” a failure or claim a different relationship to his past—is clear and sustained. Pressure escalates subtly: the widow scene, the specific “After” inscription, the quarry blasts, and his factual insulation all tighten until he must choose whether this scrap is junk or something he’ll own. His decision to take the cloth and drive, keeping the unfamiliar song on the radio, is a meaningful crystallization that forecloses the old stance of pure detachment. The conflict remains primarily internal and quiet, but within that register it’s well-shaped.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s need to understand and inhabit “the physics of leaving” rather than simply erase loss—is clear and escalates from intellectual puzzle to embodied risk when he plants the seed and touches the flower. The meaningful tightening shift is the world’s tilt and transition into the study, which deepens stakes by giving him what he most longs for in a reconfigured way (reunion without undoing). Conflict remains primarily internal and contemplative, with few explicit trade-offs or visible losses beyond the bittersweet awareness that love and loss now coexist in his understanding. That gentle, lyric pressure fits the piece but keeps escalation from reaching a truly high-stakes crucible level.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—how to handle transitions and “lost transitions” without flattening their wonder—is more conceptual than situational, and pressure remains very gentle. The woman’s request introduces a concrete task, but there’s no real resistance or risk to fulfilling it; the crucible choice is interesting but not steeply priced. The main “tightening” is an interior recognition that the creel holds people’s shed selves, which deepens the situation but doesn’t seriously constrain options. The ending reads as a thoughtful settling rather than a hard-earned trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she will use the “weapon” as ordered or re-interpret it as a method of dissolving emotional walls—is present but remains mostly internal and abstract. Escalation is driven by pattern and revelation (progressive shells/confessions) more than by sharpened pressure or real cost; the higher-ups and any potential penalty for disobedience never manifest on the page. The key turn (choosing to wear the pearl and then not report in) is impactful but feels low-friction, with little sense that she could truly refuse or that the price is dangerous rather than purely luminous. Tension is more contemplative than pressing, which slightly softens the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will remain in cyclical guilt/fog or commit to a new, riskier clarity—is clear early and coherently tightened. Escalation comes through his increasingly concrete commitments: stopping meds, leaving the station, walking to the bridge, then choosing to turn right along an unmapped path, each incrementally harder to reverse. Internal and external conflicts (self-forgiveness vs. complicity; drought vs. map-lies) are tightly braided, but the story remains largely contemplative, with little overt resistance beyond his own inertia, which keeps the pressure one notch shy of harshly testing him.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she can capture and transform unsaid words before they’re erased by subsequent speech—is clear and sharpened when the watch shows the confidence man writing the second letter. Escalation arrives via the chime of the second letter being posted and the library physically collapsing, turning an intellectual quest into a scramble with real loss on the line. Her ultimate decision to stop chasing the unsaid via magic and instead speak directly is a credible resolution that pays a price in relinquished power and mystery. The conflict remains mostly internal/lyric rather than sharply moral or interpersonal, but for this length and mode it feels sufficiently tense.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central conflict—keep the contract and sell the violin to empire vs destroy it and propagate an unownable song—tightens credibly as time runs out and the plants press her. The coffee stains offering two paths and then darkening into a third option is a clear deepening of pressure and possibility. Cost is legible: she sacrifices money, status, and safety for a different kind of legacy, with the empire already moving to name her a criminal. The one slight limitation is the absence of an on-page external obstacle in the moment of destruction; the resistance is almost purely internal.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—capturing one last spark for the dead—is clear, but pressure on that stake remains gentle throughout. Once in the grotto, each step works on the first try; there’s little resistance, risk, or meaningful narrowing of options beyond the one-way expenditure of the chip. The main tightening is the emergence of the doorway and contact with the dead woman, which does deepen meaning but not tension. As a result, the story feels more like a graceful revelation than a conflict tested and paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—Maren’s need for something deeper than “fragile” peace—appears early and coherently intensifies through her engagement with the grotto and the irreversible choice to pluck and absorb the shoot. That act meaningfully narrows options and reweights her later encounter with the arsonist. The conflict is primarily internal and contemplative, so the escalation feels more like a deepening than a sharp crank, which slightly softens pressure at an elite-market standard.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias clings to polished certainty or accepts the weight of unresolved doubt—is legible early and deepens through the shard’s accusations and the cloak scene. Unhooking each knot is a clear escalating sequence, each confession dissolved at a cost to his old identity. The later choice to let the beam flicker and accept companionship completes the escalation in a quiet but coherent way. The pressure remains mainly internal and contemplative, so tension is strong for a lyric piece but never harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—how and when Elias will reveal the secret of vanishing/reverse aging, and at what personal cost—is clear but largely internal. Escalation is present but gentle: the pond’s pattern fracture and his increasingly extreme age regression, culminating in the jarring snap back and stutter to sixty-two. His final descent into the dark is a choice, but it doesn’t decisively foreclose a visible path; the student’s offstage status keeps pressure mostly hypothetical. The conflict is thematically sharp but never feels acutely inescapable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—surviving the Hollow Maw while preserving/anchoring the world’s pulses—is clear early and tightens when the lagging bird signals predation. Escalation comes through heightened pattern-discord and the decision to project a pulse from the arrowhead, knowingly inviting the predator. Resolution is earned by his stance crystallization (becoming “stone” and “echo”) and the Maw’s pass-by feels like a genuine test of his method. The conflict remains somewhat abstract and internal, with minimal on-page cost beyond the risk itself, so tension never quite reaches a visceral peak.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Marlin will accept institutional definitions of mastery versus his own sense of the sacred—is clear and consistent, but the on-page pressure is more philosophical than visceral. There is solid escalation from physical jeopardy on the climb to a metaphysical test in the garden and finally to a social/moral choice before the deans. However, obstacles are resolved fairly smoothly; the gardener gives him the keystone without real resistance, and the Conservatory scene contains little direct pushback beyond a demand for explanation. The final choice does foreclose a path (embracing mastery/automation), but the struggle to get there could be sharpened for greater tension.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will remain a passive seeker of “hidden” truths or risk making his own—is present but more implied than sharply dramatized. External stakes (physical danger in the wreck, the ship’s groaning, the warped door) are evoked but never quite bite; he faces little resistance in finding the key or opening the door. The central tightening is the encounter with the faceless figure and the choice to accept their challenge by lighting his own lantern, which does reweight his internal stance. Overall, pressure feels more atmospheric than constraining, so escalation is persuasive but not gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to accept dissolution or to reconfigure the universe’s fate by answering the backwards voice—is clear and raised consistently. Escalation is primarily internal but genuine: the static shifts from noise → voice → question, forcing Liora toward a non-reversible choice. Her decision to “let the frequency pull her apart, atom by atom” is a credible tightening that forecloses a path. The conflict could gain a touch more bite from dramatized fear or alternative tactics; as written, her acceptance feels a little too serene for the scale of the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—turning formless fears into named, embodied monsters at real cost to the world—is established early and clearly escalates as more fears are crystallized and assigned. The tension is largely conceptual and atmospheric; each naming deepens the sense of doom and inevitability. However, conflict remains mostly one-sided: the Leviathan protests (“You’re not supposed to name us”) but exerts no real counter-pressure, and the reaper never hesitates or adapts his tactics. As a result, escalation feels like a steadily darkening ritual rather than a tightening contest of desires.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes—reviving a dead bay and cosmic balance—are clear and large, with Elias’s reputation and self-concept as a secondary layer. Pressure escalates once (the bell’s first warped note, then deeper resonance and the bay’s churning), and his decision to keep pushing and then to commit to “the real work” gives the ending weight. However, conflict remains mostly logistical and contemplative; there’s minimal resistance, sacrifice, or hard trade-off beyond physical exhaustion. The imbalance is conceptually vast, but on-page testing of his resolve is comparatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake is internal: whether Elias remains a silent guardian of a trauma or transforms that vigilance into shared narrative. Pressure escalates from mere patrol and remembrance to an urge “to feed” the reservoir, then resolves in the choice to burn photographs instead of drowning himself or his past, effectively foreclosing the path of mute self-erasure. The emotional cost—surrendering his private tokens and accepting that the stories are “no longer his to carry alone”—is clear but relatively gentle, so stakes feel intimate rather than harrowing. Still, the progression of ritual actions provides a meaningful tightening consistent with the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether she will embrace a synthesis of logic and wonder at the cost of her old identity—is clear and does escalate through the ritual and transfigured landscape. Internal and external conflict are braided: the priests’ offstage condemnation, the risk of heresy, and the irreversible nature of the transformation all sit under her choice to feed the crystal to the flame and step through the door. However, opposition remains largely abstract and unresisting in the moment; once the door appears, her path feels almost frictionless. The tension is real but contemplative rather than truly pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—preventing the atmospheric-pressure prototype from being weaponized—is articulated and tied to her personal burden of trust. Pressure escalates modestly through the radio’s demand, the opening of the buckle, the physical leap, and the sight of the drop site with the payload waiting. The conflict is primarily internal (fear vs duty; isolation vs connection), and while that’s credible, there’s little external resistance or complication to force real tactical adaptation. As a result, the narrative feels tensely poised rather than truly besieged, which limits the sense of costful escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—whether Kael’s mind will be fragmented and repurposed by the Empire—is strong and legible, and the ticking clock of the custody hearing plus active history-rewriting provides good situational pressure. Escalation comes mainly through Kael’s decision to risk merging and the visceral pain of the process, which narrows his options in a believable way. However, opposition is soft: Veyra doesn’t truly resist his plan, the judges and Emperor remain distant, and the merge succeeds without serious complication or consequence beyond pain. As a result, the outcome feels slightly too easy for the scale of the threat.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stake is Elias’s purpose: whether his escape room remains a game-business or becomes a more radical space for slow, unsettling growth and communal attention. Pressure escalates quietly as the seed grows and business dwindles, culminating in his non-reversal—keeping the “answer outside” and letting the old clientele return in a new role. The cost (commercial failure, abandoning conventional stakes of “winning the room”) is on the page, but the conflict is mostly one-sided; there’s no strong counterforce arguing for profit or normalcy. This keeps the tension intellectually satisfying but emotionally muted.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will remain a hidden caretaker of others’ grief or step into shared laughter—is coherent and signaled early. Escalation is modest but real: the blower’s near-death and the eruption of genuine laughter force a choice that forecloses his old identity as conductor. Internal and external conflicts braid effectively, though the turn to family acceptance is quite smooth, with little resistance or risk on their part. The emotional price is primarily the surrender of his private, controlling ritual, which fits the story’s scale.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Lyssa will continue guarding/suppressing the books or release them (and herself)—is clear and comes to a focused decision at the pendant handoff. Pressure escalates from quiet unease to a concrete offer of revelation and dissolution, with the cost framed as loss of self, role, and world. The conflict is primarily internal and philosophical rather than situational, but it still tightens credibly. That said, the “waiting” stance keeps her slightly passive; an added beat of resistance or alternative tactic could heighten the felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias’s heretical method can remake the rules of life and death and free him from guild-defined failure—is clear and escalates through the crozier’s hunger, the intensifying experiments, and the utterance of the forbidden incantation. The explosion and reality-shift are a meaningful deepening that cannot be walked back. However, external conflict with the guild is mostly off-stage and resolves quickly when they flee, so opposition never fully pushes back in the moment of greatest risk. The tension is strong but skewed toward internal/philosophical stakes rather than a hard, costly test under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—connecting to an ultimate, elusive frequency—is clear, and the dish shattering is a genuine reversal that forces a new understanding. However, the pressure on Elara is relatively gentle; there’s little sense of what she stands to lose beyond abstract failure, and obstacles resolve quickly (the note simply continues inside her). The jump at the end functions more as a lyrical flourish than a hard-won high-cost choice, since it’s immediately validated by her rising. As a result, escalation feels more like deepening mood than tightening stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—preventing the ferry from unraveling and determining which realities the passengers will inhabit—is legible and escalates with the collapsing route and time limit. Lira’s choice to “merge the lanes” via the hourglass is a clear turn driven by her agency. However, her unruffled competence blunts the felt risk; there’s little sense that any option she values is truly foreclosed, which keeps the conflict from reaching a sharper edge.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes center on whether Elias will complete and unleash his installation before it’s dismantled, and more deeply on whether connection can be made tangible, but this pressure stays largely abstract. The woman’s warning (“They’re coming to dismantle it”) offers a concrete prod, yet Elias’s shrugging “Let them” undercuts urgency. The eruption sequence escalates intensity, but not because Elias is cornered into a difficult trade-off; he mostly enacts a plan he’s already committed to. The ending’s choice to do it “Again” is thematically resonant but doesn’t feel like it forecloses a new path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central conflict—embracing an alien, sky-oriented navigation paradigm versus clinging to vent-and-pressure tradition—is clear but remains low-friction on the page. Opposition (the elders, cultural inertia, fear of what lies “beyond”) is described rather than dramatized in a pivotal scene that would force a trade-off. Elira’s agency drives the story, but the main turn (deciding to teach and draw the map) feels unopposed and almost inevitable. Stakes are largely conceptual, so tension simmers rather than tightens meaningfully toward a decisive, costly moment.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central stake—“Find her before the mist does” / resist being forgotten—emerges clearly and gains an emotional twist when the child is revealed as Elias’s. Pressure escalates atmospherically (thickening mist, voices consolidating, the scream) and through knowledge rather than through hard choices or competing options. Elias’s main act of agency is choosing to follow the call and pick up the glove; after that, the most dramatic turns (vision, revelation) arrive more as bestowed experiences than contested decisions. The cost—confronting his own forgotten tie and new obligation—is felt but could be sharpened by forcing him into at least one more concrete trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stakes—Elias’s need to cross the phase seam, retrieve something, and escape before it seals/adds him to its memory—are clear and do tighten once he commits. The key escalation is his decision to let the transition take him and then to carry something back, with the ticking window (“He had minutes…”) adding situational pressure. However, conflict remains largely atmospheric; nothing on the far side meaningfully resists him beyond implication, and the seam never quite feels on the verge of locking him in. The result is a beautifully tense mood but relatively modest on-page escalation and price.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.7)
    The primary conflict—Lena’s dread that her “count will stop” and her need to extract meaning from failure—intensifies as the ghost asks her to defragment and to reframe the static. The stakes are clear in identity and existential terms, and the mid-story activation of the archives is a genuine tightening. That said, the pressure remains mostly internal and contemplative, with limited sense that her choice could materially hurt her or the world, which softens the felt cost. The escalation works but could gain from one sharper, more perilous trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—capturing the last breath of a language at potential personal cost—is clear and sharpened well when the echoes shift from passive to alive and the bone towers begin to sing. Escalation tracks causally from curiosity to existential threat: her harnessing attempt provokes the canyon’s “inhale” and her entrapment. Agency is present (she chooses not to stop when the birds scatter), though after that point the story turns mostly on consequence rather than further decision. The cost—her obliteration and the language’s transformed survival—is legible and weighty.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will remain trapped in corrosive grief or surrender to the garden’s alien harmony—is clear and escalates via the arrowhead, the phone’s taunts, the missing’s return as shadows, and the vines physically claiming him. Pressure tightens effectively at the moment the seed splits and he must choose to “stay and rot in his bitterness, or let the joke rewrite him.” However, his internal struggle at that decision point skews conceptual rather than viscerally felt, so the trade-off’s cost registers more in theme than in lived-on-the-page conflict. Still, the external and internal pressures interlock well enough to keep tension alive through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central stake—whether organic wonder can overcome mechanized order—is clear, and the pressure does build from private playing to world-altering transformation. The decisive turn around the earth’s crack and statues’ reaction is compelling, but the antagonistic force never really tests her resolve; they sense the music but never endanger her or seriously impede the process. As a result, escalation feels more like inevitable blooming than a contested victory with a visible price. Internal and external threads are aligned but not deeply intertwined in a way that forces hard trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes—risking drone retaliation to deliver a dangerous, possibly illegal object that affects grief and memory—are clear and present from the start. Pressure escalates via the opening of the bottle (shifting the stakes from contraband to emotional revelation), the ticking drone cycles, and the sprint to the old post office. Elias’s choices drive the key turns, and the final stance—choosing to keep delivering storms despite ongoing danger—reads as an earned endurance. The on-page price feels a bit soft (the scar is retrospective; the final crossing succeeds without visible loss), which slightly mutes the sense of hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central pressure—whether Lior will remain in retreating silence or risk a new form of “song”—does escalate through the discovery, the woman’s expectation, and the invitation to “Sing.” His choice to respond with his hands rather than his voice forecloses one path and accepts a cost (ongoing, unfinished work and a new vulnerability). Still, the conflict remains primarily contemplative and low-friction; there’s little sense that refusal would carry sharp on-page consequence beyond continued stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can move from static preservation to truly reawakening memory—is clear and escalates once he acts on Voss’s implied challenge and performs the ritual. Pressure is primarily internal and conceptual, but there is one solid tightening: he commits to the reading, lets the scarf unspool, and thereby forfeits his last concrete link to his mother. The next-morning beat, with the unlocked restricted section and the child’s blank/negative-space book, functions as an earned follow-through more than a new escalation. Because the conflict never cuts very deep into risk or consequence (no real on-page threat of loss beyond the scarf), stakes feel slightly soft for elite-tier tension.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether to recapture and re-shelve a runaway dream or allow it to remain dangerously free—is signaled early and tightened by the hungry, time-sensitive nature of escaped dreams. Escalation comes through the failed first attempt, the partial success that produces a living photograph, and the mounting pressure as the sunrise fades and the dream begins to fray. Her final refusal of the dream’s plea for return is a genuine trade-off between beauty/untethered life and order/safety, with a discernible cost to both. The stakes could be made a bit more viscerally threatening, but they are coherent and scale appropriately for the length and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether and how to “free” what’s locked, within the bounds of her rule—is clear but stays mostly conceptual. Pressure rises with the impossible ribbon, the shop’s dissolution into starlight, and the man’s anger, yet the locksmith’s path to solution never feels genuinely blocked or risky. Her key choices (to open despite the rule, to free the idea, to send the man away) land, but with limited sense of loss or danger. Tension is present, not gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming stolen memories and confronting the thief—appears early through the sailor’s story and Elias’s own gaps, and deepens as he uncovers the trading nature of the theft. Pressure escalates from eerie unease to existential recognition that his life has been partially hollowed to host another bargain. However, the external conflict with the memory eater is almost entirely compressed into the final exchange, so we don’t see a concrete trade-off tested in action beyond the acceptance of memory’s weight. The climax lands conceptually more than viscerally, with limited on-page struggle or visible price beyond internal burden.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can handle a dangerous, liminal magic without being consumed—is present and escalates as the shadow starts pushing back, then lunges in response to their actions. Kael’s decision to annotate under pressure is the key tightening, and it successfully narrows options: if he fails, the shadow-door wins; if he succeeds, he’s implicated in this work. The primary weakness is that the danger remains mostly conceptual; we’re told it’s a door but never see a true near-loss or concrete harm. The cost is therefore more implied future burden than on-page sacrifice, keeping this just short of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether and how to preserve the “color” of wonder across worlds, and at what cost—is signaled early and deepens nicely when the girl’s world is revealed as fading and lonely. Escalation is quiet but real: first he spends the heirloom seed, then he literally bleeds essence into the girl, and finally he abandons his old life to continue this work, each step entailing greater personal cost. Conflict is primarily ethical and internal rather than oppositional, which suits the mode but keeps tension more atmospheric than gripping. Still, his choices clearly foreclose paths (keeping the seed, remaining home), making the resolution feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.9)
    The central stake—contain the restless dead or release them—is legible early and tightens credibly around the decision to pull or leave the final knot. The escalation is primarily internal and textural rather than confrontational, but we still get a real trade-off: civic peace vs. honest unrest, his mender identity vs. becoming a "door." I’d like one more moment of concrete pressure on what the town risks (or what he personally stands to lose) to fully sharpen the cost. As-is, the conflict is strong but slightly under-intensified for top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can re-interpret the tear/chapel and thus the nature of the “unknown”—is signaled clearly and does deepen. The main tightening comes when she realizes the henge marks time, not space, and then applies that insight with her own reel. However, conflict remains almost entirely interior and unopposed; there’s little on-page pressure from the Guild, danger from the experiment, or personal risk beyond epistemic solitude. The result is intellectually engaging but emotionally low-tension, with a felt cost that is subtle rather than biting.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether to cross or expose the “threshold” Amelia sought versus allowing it to remain unentered and unreported—is clear and thematically loaded. Pressure escalates as Liora moves from curiosity to eerie recognition (the snow falling upward, the beam pulsing) to the Electra’s unnatural damage, forcing a choice between professional obligation and existential caution. The conflict is predominantly internal and intellectual rather than visceral, but the final renunciation and lie are credible and carry real weight.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.0)
    The core stake—whether he becomes the vessel for a vast, hungry code-ghost—is clear and escalates from eerie contact to invasive pressure. The tightening is effective when the graffiti physically rips and the ghost’s desire to enter him becomes visceral, forcing a choice. His decision to encode a rest and slam the plate down is an active, consequential resolution with visible cost in his raw, unused voice and empty hands. Tension is strong but stays mostly internal and atmospheric; a touch more concrete jeopardy could sharpen the sense of irreversibility.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora will remain trapped in a mental/emotional prison or re-see her world—is clear and culminates in her decision to climb further with a new understanding. Escalation is quiet but present: from curiosity about the diary to decoding its nature, to recognizing the prior servant’s pursuit of joy, to the imperative “Look up” and the charged final climb. The pressure is situational/accumulative rather than confrontational; there’s no strong opposing force beyond inertia and prior belief, so tension never becomes acute. That keeps the conflict effective but relatively gentle for elite-market expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is Elias’s relationship to grief and separateness—whether he clings to analytic distance or surrenders to the sky’s remembering. Pressure modestly escalates via the snapped string, the appearance of the light-thread, and the moment he chooses to “let himself fall—not down, but into.” However, these are largely internal, contemplative turns; there’s little sense of true alternative paths being tested or foreclosed beyond embracing vs. resisting dissolution. The resolution feels earned but low-tension, which keeps conflict from fully matching the thematic and stylistic ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes—whether she can “contain” the infinite (sky/knowledge/faces) before the library is destroyed—are clear, and the instruction raises pressure in a meaningful way. Escalation comes via the time limit, her intense craft sequence, and then the building’s failure and fire, which foreclose her lifelong pursuit in concrete terms. Her decisive choices (to build the sky-mirroring ceiling, then later to accept limits and change her art) resolve both external and internal conflicts. Still, the demolition threat feels more like a solemn inevitability than an active, tightening antagonistic force on the page, slightly softening tension.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—escaping the temporal/spatial loop—is clear and tied to Liora’s need to prove her value. Pressure escalates from quiet rule-breaking to engine failure to a public test of her insight in front of Veyra and the crew. However, the resolution comes on the first serious attempt, with no misstep, sacrifice, or meaningful trade-off, so the cost of success feels low for the scale of the problem. Internal stakes (duty vs curiosity, fear of overstepping) are present but under-leveraged at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—repairing a broken time-structure to reopen the eclipse door and reclaim her sister—is signaled and maintained, with a meaningful tightening when the child in the mirror tells her she is “late” and reveals her misreading of the prophecy. However, obstacles resolve relatively smoothly: the resistant gear relents after a brief whisper, and there’s limited sense that failure is a live possibility in the moment. The emotional and conceptual stakes are strong, but concrete on-page resistance and visible price paid during the repair are somewhat underplayed.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Veyth can transform from war-scarred ruin into a true “nebula of respite”—is clear, and there is one meaningful deepening when Liora realizes the nebula is a state to be orchestrated, not found. However, conflict remains largely soft; once Liora decides to help, there is little friction or reversal, and the rebuilding mostly proceeds in a gentle montage. External opposition (war-memory, a haunted landscape) stays atmospheric rather than actively constraining choices. As a result, escalation feels more like steady growth than tightening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—trade perpetual deferral for a one-time release that may cost the world its buffer—is clear and tight. Escalation is internal but definite: the puppet head’s appearance raises the price of inaction, the remembered lullaby personalizes the potential gain, and inserting the head into the clock is a committed, irreversible act. The cost to Elias (loss of agency, acceptance of the tide, end of his vocation) is legible. The conflict remains largely contemplative rather than sharply tested by counterforces, which keeps it just shy of maximal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora will risk breaking her mandate to guide travelers, and what that costs her—is clear, and the girl’s arrival functions as the tightening beat that tests her pattern of refusal. However, by the time we are fully in the “now,” much of the decisive action (choosing to guide the girl) has already occurred and is partially recounted, so the live on-page escalation is more conceptual than situational. Her choice to use the last nut at the labyrinth’s entrance and walk away is a genuine renunciation that forecloses easier detachment, but the pressure around that moment could be sharpened. Overall tension accrues, but without a strong in-scene reversal or concrete complication beyond established burdens.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will remain locked in self-punishing atonement or allow his grief to dissolve—is clear and present early via his history of “molding polymers into bridges” that failed to mend what mattered. Pressure deepens as he confronts the chrysalis’s meaning and watches the water’s reconverging channels, leading to his choice to surrender the chrysalis and wade in. The cost is mainly internal and conceptual, with no strong reversal or external obstacle challenging his shift once the insight arrives. Tension is sustained but gentle, giving the piece a contemplative rather than sharply escalatory feel.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—locating/quantifying the space where stories begin—is intellectually clear but emotionally cool, and faces almost no resistance. The patron’s need is stated as urgent, but Liora can provide the service without visible risk, cost, or real doubt, so pressure never truly tightens. The closest thing to a meaningful trade-off is her decision to keep but not open the moonlight, which is thematically apt but underplayed as conflict. The result is a beautifully framed interaction that lacks escalation; it functions more as an initiation vignette than as a test of values under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can manage the psychic cost of his work by offloading grief into the pavilion—remains coherent and is resolved in a quiet, believable way. Escalation is mostly internal and procedural: from being overwhelmed by memories to successfully purging one soldier’s regret and regaining temporary equilibrium. However, the pavilion offers little resistance or risk; conflict unfolds smoothly, reducing felt danger or sacrifice in the central ritual. The piece reads more as a beautifully rendered maintenance of a burden than a true test of that burden under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether this divided work community can re-establish a shared rhythm without erasing difference—is clear and present early. Pressure escalates modestly through Elias’s confrontation and his skepticism about “a hunk of brass fixing thirty years of grudges,” then eases into a believable, partial attempt (“Tomorrow, we try”). The conflict remains primarily conceptual and conversational; we never feel a moment where a real alternative path (giving up, forcing one language, abandoning the elevator) is nearly chosen and then foreclosed, which limits the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Lena’s identity and relationship to memory/void—is present and coherent, and pressure does increase as she accesses others’ lives. However, conflict is largely internal and contemplative; there’s little friction, resistance, or genuine risk beyond implication. Her choices progressively deepen the experiment but never meet a hard counter-force or real dilemma on the page. The result is thematically rich but tension-light, with escalation felt as intensity of imagery more than narrowing options or visible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—accessing the “combinations” to reach or understand her brother versus the risks of the grotto/inversion—is clear and sharpened by the ticking hour and dangerous, reality-bending environment. Escalation is clean: entering the grotto, passing the mushroom threshold, encountering the seed-chamber, then losing it all as gravity rights itself. The main cost on the page is opportunity loss (the chamber sealed, manuscript blanked) rather than an active trade-off she must knowingly embrace in the climactic beat, so the ethical calculus feels relatively simple. The closing decision to plant the lone seed and return “as a key” offers a new level of commitment, but its potential costs remain conceptual rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can coax an honest song from a relic of grief in a world that no longer listens—is clear and followed through. Pressure escalates texturally: the song shifts from “almost” to true, the insulator heats and weeps, and the grove and birds begin to respond, culminating in Elias’s decision to leave the insulator. However, opposition remains mostly environmental and internalized; there’s relatively little sense of risk or consequence beyond the aesthetic/emotional. For a top-tier venue, the tension is persuasive but very gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will re-enter “the game” and re-engage the covenant despite exile and fear of invisible stakes—is legible, and the girl’s desire to learn what the nexus “remembers about us” dovetails with it. Pressure escalates through the nexus’s pulsing and the recognition of the dangerous Opening, culminating in his decision to play and then yield the stone. However, the stakes remain largely conceptual; “before the next phase” and his exile are not leveraged into concrete, narrowing options beyond mood. The cost is emotionally real but understated, so tension feels contemplative rather than sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stakes—whether Elias will continue to retreat into cataloging silence or risk entering the noisy, conflicted world—are signaled early and culminate in his decision to set up “Silence repaired here” at the ruins. The main tightening comes when the device responds to his own silence, crystallizing the question “What do you do when empathy isn’t enough?” and narrowing his options. The cost is mostly internal and existential, with no strong external opposition or consequence beyond implied discomfort and vulnerability. For elite venues, a slightly sharper on-page test of his new stance under resistance would heighten the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora’s theft and experiment will bring ruin or a new kind of wisdom/trust—is present but not tightly squeezed. There is escalation (the seed planted, the rapid monstrous bloom, the Elders arriving), yet the confrontation is remarkably gentle, with minimal visible price or lasting harm for having broken a taboo. The internal conflict does deepen at the flower’s vision-moment, but external pressure does not truly force a painful trade-off. As a result, tension feels more contemplative than urgent, which limits the stakes’ impact.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the planet’s “source of resilience” and perhaps her mentor’s fate—is signaled early and drives her decisions. There is a clear deepening when the crack becomes a mouth and the moss begins altering her body, and the inversion’s end provides temporal pressure. However, danger remains mostly atmospheric; the boulders, inversion, and alien biology never truly corner her or force a painful trade-off. The resolution feels earned but relatively low-cost, which softens the sense of escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stakes—physical survival and retaining professional integrity in the face of an inexplicable system—are signaled early and tightened effectively. Escalation is clear: from odd readings to shattered instrument and screaming wind to a lethal-feeling vortex with missing bodies, forcing her to abandon documentation instincts and improvise with the flare. Her agency drives the main turn (using the flare to disrupt the pattern, then choosing to retreat and reconceive her approach), and there is visible cost in tools lost and beliefs compromised. Stakes could be made even sharper by more explicitly confronting a choice between staying to understand vs. fleeing, but what’s here functions strongly.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.3)
    The central stake—obeying the elders to tame the aurora versus freeing it (and herself)—is clear and the chime sequence gives the piece a built-in escalatory spine. Internal and external stakes intertwine reasonably well as the aurora and ice respond more dramatically with each chime. However, antagonistic pressure remains abstract: we never feel a concrete risk of failure, punishment, or catastrophe, so tension stays at a thoughtful, ceremonial register rather than becoming truly fraught. The final choice feels more like fulfillment of an already-made decision than a pressured, costly turn in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—how Elias responds to a breach after having failed his charge—emerges early and tightens when he chooses to play the flute to *widen* the fissure rather than seal it. The apparition of the child crystallizes his prior failure and forces a real stance: keep resisting or follow; he chooses the latter and irreversibly abandons his guardianship. However, external stakes (what concretely happens if he’s wrong) stay largely conceptual, so the tension is more meditative than knife-edge. The escalation is credible and coherent, but not yet harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will continue treating emotions as specimens or surrender to mutual transformation—is legible and escalates through the halo’s activation and the press seizing agency. The beat where ink rearranges into his own unfamiliar face, and later where he releases borrowed voices, mark real deepening of pressure and knowledge. However, resistance is mostly notional; he accepts the invitation relatively smoothly, so we don’t see him wrestle with the potential loss of self as a concrete, painful trade-off. Internal and cosmic conflicts are elegantly braided but could show more friction under decision.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether he will remain a transactional courier of relics or accept a deeper, riskier role as carrier of the hum—is clear and does tighten. Pressure escalates via the woman’s intervention, the pendant burning, the abyss “exhaling,” and the bridge forming; knowledge and options shift in meaningful ways. However, many key escalations are initiated by external magic or the woman’s actions, leaving the courier more reactive than active until late. The final choice to plant a seed and walk back toward the villages is strong, but the story could sharpen the sense of what he’s materially giving up to heighten perceived cost.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.3)
    The main stake—whether Elias will pursue dangerous proof or relinquish it—intensifies steadily through the commune, the mother’s face in the frost, and the realization that the prism stores something malign. Pressure is primarily internal but does escalate via clearly linked supernatural responses (warming prism, moving frost, door opening). The turn at the car door and the vision of his mother effectively tighten options, making destruction of the prism feel like a real sacrifice rather than an easy fix. Stakes remain mostly psychological and conceptual, which keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—send a message to the lost lover at the cost of remaining behind—is clear and paid on the page, with the weaving night and the dawn dissolution as the key tightening. The conflict is primarily internal/ritualistic and textural rather than confrontational, but the price (she must stay, becomes part of the orchard) is legible and non-trivial. Escalation is smooth rather than jagged: find bead → choose to crack and weave it → let the tapestry dissolve. Because her acceptance of the sacrifice feels largely foregone and unstruggled-with, tension never quite peaks at a “must I really pay this?” level.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the planet’s instability and social hollowness can be reconfigured into resilience—is clear, and the descent into the shafts is a meaningful tightening. His act of feeding the silk into the fissure at personal and communal risk constitutes the main turn, and the loss of the silk plus assumption of ongoing responsibility provide some cost. However, the resistance is largely implied; the ritual works on first attempt, and there’s little sense of what could go wrong in the moment, which keeps the pressure from fully peaking. Internal conflict between fear and will is understated enough that tension never quite bites as hard as the imagery promises.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—uncovering a withheld truth woven between worlds—is clear and present throughout, and the seam’s disappearance provides a credible escalation that tests her resolve. The reappearance of the seam and the duplication of the shard as green and clear create a meaningful deepening of the stakes from mere discovery to reconfiguring how truth operates. However, the conflict remains largely conceptual and internal; there’s little sense of danger, moral dilemma, or irreversible loss beyond leaving the spaceport. The final step through feels more like an eager acceptance than a pressured trade-off, which keeps the tension solid but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias remains locked in isolating stasis or risks connection with the “ghosts” of prior keepers—is established early and tightens through the progression from burning letters to answering them. Escalation is subtle but real: climbing the stairs after months, adding his stone, writing back, and finally choosing to let the skiff rot all narrow his options and deepen commitment. Internal and external pressures (haunted room, dead lamp, letters insisting “Stay”) interweave effectively. The conflict is largely interior, so the risk feels more existential than perilous, but it’s clearly framed and resolved with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—holding back a possibly world-altering dawn/storm—is declared early and remains coherent. However, escalation stays mostly tonal: we see the shadow at the water, the stars waver, the storm “hungers,” but Liora’s tactics never truly falter, and there’s no moment where she nearly loses or must sacrifice something concrete. Her simple refusal (“You can’t have it”) and letting the wick burn lower are poised, not desperate choices. The result is a beautifully tense mood but relatively soft on-page pressure for a piece aiming at elite markets.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether and how he will respond to the heart’s pull toward stories—is clear and present early, with escalation through discovery of power, decision to leave, and the exhausting act of painting others’ stories in the village. The key tightening is his choice to act as conduit rather than observer, which forecloses a quieter, safer life and leads to physical depletion and the loss of the wing. Pressure is mostly internal and meditative; there’s little overt opposition or hard dilemma beyond endurance and self-definition, which fits the mode but keeps tension relatively gentle. Still, the cost of his stance is legible enough to make the resolution feel earned rather than weightless.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake is how Elias handles the overwhelming, quantified sorrow in the sextant—whether he will bear it, ignore it, or find a channel for it. Escalation is textural rather than dramatic: the air thickening, his tears under pressure, the labyrinth groaning, then the conceptual tightening when he reframes trees from witnesses to absorbers. His agency is real in deciding to pass the sextant’s grief into the fabric of the place and return to his work, but the trade-off remains more implied than viscerally contested. The tension is effective but stays low-burn rather than truly knife-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—reviving a dying, silent realm—is clear and present from early on, and pressure accumulates as her song draws a response and the trees strain toward change. Escalation comes from her deepening commitment (digging until she bleeds, singing through a burning throat) and the world’s answering harmony, culminating in the villagers joining and the world’s reconfiguration. However, resistance is largely environmental and inert; Liora never faces a sharp dilemma or trade-off where a real option is foreclosed. The conflict is moving but remains more ritualistic and lyrical than actively contested.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Lena continues to use the library to hide from her “mistake” or passes through it as a threshold—is clear and tightened by the invitation and Voss’s appearance. Pressure escalates through increasingly charged spaces (stacks → secret stair → mirror chamber) and culminates in the micro-choice to accept Voss’s guidance back to her thesis, then the macro-choice to lock the door and step into the street. The cost—relinquishing the safety of pure solitude and accepting ongoing engagement with the world and her past—is legible on the page. Conflict remains largely internal and quiet, so while deepening is strong, the sense of jeopardy never becomes acute.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—the city’s slide into unthinking adjustment vs. Liora’s refusal to look away—is clear and thematically rich. There is a discernible escalation: from lone warm loaf to citywide wheat and weeping citizens to the prince’s return and the bakery’s reappearance. However, opposition is mostly atmospheric; Liora encounters almost no resistance, and her choices never truly endanger her or demand a visible sacrifice. The result is powerful in mood but relatively gentle in pressure compared to elite-level conflict density.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stakes—salvaging meaning from a dying archive versus stepping into a living vow—are legible and escalate as time runs out and the slide’s output becomes personal. The shift from professional duty (measuring) to personal risk (following the invitation) is a strong tightening move. However, internal resistance to abandoning his task and world is only lightly dramatized, so the decisive step onto the bridge feels a bit too frictionless. Conflict works well conceptually but could use sharper on-page pressure and trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—exposing and dooming Veyne while achieving a private closure—is clear and escalates through their verbal chess match. Her method (false starts, baiting his greed) builds pressure effectively to the precise moment his realization snaps. However, the personal risk to Lena feels somewhat abstract; after the “rules” of the market are invoked, it’s hard to believe she’s in meaningful danger, and we never see an option she truly can’t bear to lose. The conflict is tense and elegant but a bit too one-sidedly in her control to reach the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is Lira’s identity and relationship to the world’s weather-logic, but tension is mostly conceptual and aesthetic rather than oppositional. Once the compass points to her, events largely unfold as a bestowed apotheosis; she doesn’t choose between competing goods or pay a visible price beyond surrendering her old understanding. Escalation does occur as sensations intensify (needle spinning, metal seeping into veins, world tilting), yet there’s minimal resistance or risk of loss. The piece works as a luminous metamorphosis vignette, but it lacks a strong sense of jeopardy or difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will remain bound to grayscale duty or risk embracing dangerous, full-color creativity—is legible early and developed through his obsession with “rectifying” the lock. Pressure escalates from quiet grief to a literal supernatural rupture and a near-ecstatic painting sequence that irrevocably alters his trajectory. The main turn (using memory as the combination) arises from his agency and trait, and the final choice to leave the lantern behind crystallizes the new stance. However, resistance is relatively low; the cave and painting yield quickly once he acts, so we feel less of a concrete price paid beyond the implied life-shift.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will maintain his safe, gilded dishonesty or surrender to dangerous candor—is clear and does tighten as he moves from studio to Archive to pedestal. His choice to write until the ink runs dry and then to let his everyday letter “bleed” is an earned renunciation of former tactics. However, opposition is largely atmospheric; there’s little overt resistance or irreversible external consequence, so escalation feels more like deepening than real narrowing of options. The result is strong but not yet searing.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.2)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure builds through the sculpture’s accelerating motion and the impending shatter of the ice, with the dominant stake being whether the trapped “songs” (truth/wonder) will be released. That escalation is clear and the shatter is a genuine peak, but the consequences land at a fairly gentle register: there’s no concrete loss or narrowed option beyond the ephemeral nature of wonder, which Liora fully embraces. Her choice is essentially to continue her practice as before, with reaffirmed conviction rather than altered tactics. The piece is intentionally quiet, but the stakes feel more illustrative than biting.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    The core conflict—whether Elias will risk a destructive reset and, further, walk away from his role—is clear and escalates from internal hesitation to irreversible action. The match-lighting is a strong, high-cost turn, and the later choice to leave the dome compounds that price. Internal fear versus programming (“Fear was a glitch he couldn’t debug”) maps neatly onto the external stakes of system failure and potential runaway fire. A slightly sharper sense of time pressure from the magnetic shift could deepen urgency, but the existing escalation works well.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake is essentially whether and how the past (Elena’s disappearance) will be reopened and integrated into present community life, signaled through the eerie appearance of the letter and the humming locket. Pressure rises modestly—from odd object to uncanny mailbox to the collective holding its breath—but Mira never seriously hesitates about opening the locket or the mailbox, so there is little sense of risk or competing values at the key turns. The strongest escalation is conceptual: the dead mailbox becomes a living conduit, but this feels more like a graceful shift than a hard-won trade-off. As a result, conflict reads gentle and atmospheric rather than sharply testing anyone’s commitments.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—what to do with the scientist’s encrypted vulnerability and the knowledge in the lab—is clear and sharpened by the dice-triggered failsafe and demand for a danced password. Escalation is present but relatively calm: the pressure rises conceptually and symbolically more than viscerally, with limited sense that Lira might truly fail or die. Her decisive act of flooding the lab and abandoning the journals constitutes a real cost and forecloses a path, even if external peril feels muted. Internal and external stakes interweave effectively, but the conflict could benefit from a bit more friction or risk at the moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—regaining his wife’s excavated memory versus the risk of confronting whatever steals it—is clear and escalates in the chamber as gravity intensifies, the stone lurches, and he glimpses her trapped state. The meaningful turn is the chamber event where his attempt to exhume her fails, destroys his tool, and redefines the conflict as ongoing predation rather than recoverable loss. The tension is more atmospheric than knife-edge, with internal and external conflict nicely braided but not quite pushing him into a fresh, costly decision in-scene beyond enduring and witnessing. The planned future attempts (“By the time the next whale beached…”) slightly diffuse immediate pressure even as they create a charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—whether she can lessen the prophecy’s destructive pressure—is clear, and there is an identifiable escalation when the serpent-thread breaks free and the brook “shatters.” Her attempt partially succeeds, reframing the conflict from an overwhelming scream to a manageable sigh, which is an earned if quiet outcome. However, the pressure remains mostly atmospheric; she isn’t forced into a sharp moral or tactical trade-off beyond “try and risk backlash” vs. “endure the status quo.” The cost is more implied than dramatized, so tension never quite tightens to elite-level sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—gaining forbidden understanding of the building at the cost of being changed—emerges early and tightens around the blood contract. Stakes escalate from curiosity to bodily and existential risk once the seal burns and the brownstone’s accumulated sorrow floods Elias. Elias’s interrogation of the building (“What did you do to her?”) is a strong deepening, revealing that knowledge will not be passive but accusatory. The cost is more conceptual and ongoing than immediate, but the text makes the foreclosed path (remaining merely a tenant, not a keeper of lies) legible at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving memory against institutional erasure—is clear early, and pressure escalates from private rebellion to systemic threat when the patrol arrives. The meaningful tightening is Liora’s decision to finish archiving and refuse to run when discovered, paying with arrest and psychic depletion. However, the conflict progression is relatively linear, with little tactical adaptation or reversal; once she commits to archiving, nothing seriously challenges that path on the page. The authorities’ stance is conceptually strong but dramatized only briefly, which keeps the tension just below truly peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the forger will use his hard-won power to undo or perpetuate the Emperor’s violence—is clear and tight. Escalation comes through the Emperor’s entrance, the irreversible use of the thorn, and the unexpected turn toward collaboration and institutional change. However, the potential lethal conflict (forger vs tyrant and guards) never quite bites; the Emperor’s acceptance and the guards’ passivity reduce palpable danger. The emotional and moral stakes escalate convincingly, but the material stakes feel somewhat cushioned.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Veyra will embrace, reject, or be consumed by the echoing power—is present from the opening and tightens as she moves from shell instructions to the nexus’s warnings to Kaelis’s active manipulation. The confrontation provides a clear escalation, with Kaelis using the threads to weaponize her memories and Veyra countering by singing with the shell. The visible price is her renunciation of further answers and her step away from the universe’s song, which feels consequential. The conflict could sharpen further if Kaelis’s resistance or counter-offers forced a more agonized decision, but the pressure still reads as coherent and mounting.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes are emotional and spiritual—how the widow will understand her haunting, and how Lena lives with her own—but they are signaled early and stay coherent. Escalation comes via deepening: first the widow’s misread ghost, then the revelation of the son, then Lena risking her own memories in the same apparatus. The piece stops short of a sharp dilemma or a more explicit price; Lena’s endurance choice is powerful but not heavily contested on the page. The tension is sustained and appropriate for a quiet story, yet could climb a notch with one more pressured, non-lyric beat.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake is epistemic and relational—whether Liora will grasp and value the hidden patterns Kael tends—and this is signaled early by her “Why fix what no one sees?” challenge. Escalation is gentle but present: the philosophical question is tested by the concrete whistle → minnows reveal, which narrows her interpretive options. The final turn is her active joining of the whistle and implicit acceptance of the mender role, a quiet but clear stance crystallization. What holds this below the highest bands is the near-absence of overt cost or sharper internal resistance to heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether Elias will expose/trigger what the quarantine is containing—is clear and escalates from curiosity about a myth to direct contact with a world-altering valve. There is a real tightening when the stillpoint "pushes back" with visions and reveals the Liquidation as quarantine; that’s an effective escalation of cost and knowledge. However, the tension around the final act of "turning the key" doesn’t fully peak; Elias laughs and accepts the role a bit too seamlessly, so the choice doesn’t feel as contested as the setup warrants. World-scale stakes are implied more than concretely felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will submit to or seize the prophetic dawn—is clearly signaled and tightened by the crack and the imperative voice demanding a choice. His agency drives the escalation: sealing the crack, then escalating further by weaponizing the receiver against the door itself. However, the price of his choice skews toward power fantasy; the world’s danger and any personal sacrifice remain abstract, softening the felt stakes. The conflict resolves decisively but with relatively little friction at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story’s stakes are largely internal—what Elias will do with memory and silence—and the knock at the door is an effective tightening that forces him to act on his professed mission. His choice to give the girl the fresh jar and invite her to wind the box materially shifts his relationship to his craft and to the past. That said, the pressure remains gentle; there is little sense that refusal would carry sharp immediate cost beyond continued stagnation. The escalation is sufficient for quiet literary work but not especially tense.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake (preventing a sonic cataclysm at the cost of her body/being) is signaled early and escalates through the revelation that the ice is failing and the artifact is a bomb. The key tightening is her conscious choice to match frequencies, knowing it will “unravel her from the inside out,” and the subsequent on-page bodily and metaphysical cost is unmistakable. Internal and external conflicts are tightly braided, with the logic/emotion split feeding directly into the global-stakes decision. The only thing holding it back slightly is that the external opposition is environmental and inert rather than adaptive, so there’s no late-stage reversal beyond intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether change will come through patient attention or violent rupture—is clear, and pressure coheres around the impending moment when the viaduct might finally “unyoke.” Escalation is subtle but present: the hum, then the tremor, then the shiver, then the ascent, culminating in Lior’s choice to cross the ice and join the rising bridge. However, the conflict remains almost entirely internal and conceptual; the danger of the ice failing, or of rejection by the others, never tightens into a concrete on-page dilemma that forces a painful trade-off. The resolution is earned but relatively comfortable, with little sense that a real option has been foreclosed beyond a gently noted departure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes—uncovering why people are dying and whether the city is erasing its buried escape routes—are clear and rise appropriately once the fresh mortar and water pressure are revealed. There is a meaningful escalation from procedural inspection to discovering active sabotage and imminent flooding, culminating in Elias’s decision to defy protocol and pursue the archives. However, the conflict remains mostly investigative and anticipatory; no direct opposition or immediate loss tests his resolve on the page. That keeps the pressure strong but not searing, and the cost is mostly deferred to future action.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    The primary stake—whether Elias will remain in static, self-protective guilt or risk active, imperfect repair—is clear early and tightens as he moves from handling the heart to mailing the first letter to embarking on many. The storm functions as a concrete external pressure that tests his resolve and extracts visible cost. The escalation is mostly internal but nonetheless coherent under a causal-psychological lens; each step narrows the option of retreat. It’s a quiet arc, but the final commitment to “the work” rather than a single gesture reads as an earned, higher-stakes stance.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—will she transform falling into a viable new mode of flight before the sea or her own failures destroy her—is clear and escalates as she commits to the new design and takes the crucial plunge. The moment of “She wasn’t falling. She was conducting.” is a genuine reweighting of risk and possibility, and the workshop’s collapse underlines cost. What’s somewhat soft is an explicit dilemma or trade-off; she never truly considers not jumping, so tension lives more in whether the world will meet her halfway than in contested choice. Still, the pressure curve is coherent and tight for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—resurrecting erased lives at the cost of her own safety and complicity—is clear and escalates from curiosity to open defiance to sacrificial action. Pressure tightens plausibly via the system’s resistance and final termination notice. However, the external opposition (EchoNet as antagonist) remains largely abstract and unadaptive, and Lena encounters little real dilemma at the climax—she chooses deletion with minimal visible hesitation. The cost is conceptually high but emotionally and tactically under-contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will remain a passive seer/peacekeeper or risk himself to stand with the girl—is clear and tight. Pressure escalates through the fragment’s unsettling visions, the knowledge of the girl’s impending arrival, the ice’s increasing “eagerness,” and the lighthouse beam’s countdown. However, the conflict remains largely internal and somewhat unopposed; there’s no on-page test of his resolve beyond the decision itself. As a result, the cost is felt conceptually more than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Lior will keep her appointment with death or reorient toward living with open-ended endings—is clear and does tighten. The ice crossing and villagers’ reaction provide the one strong external-pressure beat that echoes her internal risk calculus. However, after the dog scene there is little genuine resistance to her shift; the parasol engraving and cancellation flow almost too smoothly, with limited sense of what she is sacrificing emotionally by abandoning the euthanasia plan. The escalation is thus satisfying but somewhat soft, relying more on realization than on a pressured, costly dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake is Lior’s internal struggle to reinterpret a lost relationship and his choice to continue as sentinel without self-erasure. Pressure tightens when he recognizes Mira’s handwriting and when he consciously reframes “mismatch” as meaningful rather than a failure. However, the conflict remains largely contemplative, with few real alternatives dramatized beyond stay/leave, so escalation feels more tonal than decisively narrowing. The final choice to pocket the letter and resume work is earned but could stand a sharper sense of what it costs him in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving the subtle wisdom/clearings against the prophet’s consuming influence—is clear, and the warning “You can’t hold it forever” sharpens that pressure. Escalation comes mainly through deepening awareness rather than concrete reversals: we understand more of what the prophet has done and how fragile the clearings are as the consecration proceeds. Lysan’s agency is meaningful (choosing to consecrate, to stay until the song fades, to accept “long enough”), but the conflict remains primarily atmospheric and internal, with limited on-page jeopardy beyond abstraction. The cost is implied rather than dramatized in a specific loss or trade-off in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how collective pain can be transmuted—is clear, but the on-page pressure is very mild. The main tightening is her wait for the “light to shift” and the arrival of the girl and butterfly, which deepens the emotional context but doesn’t truly narrow options or impose risk. Her agency (choosing this town, this site, this moment) resolves the situation, yet no meaningful alternative or sacrifice is dramatized in scene. The story functions more as a meditative tableau than a conflict-driven narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether meaningful linguistic growth has truly ceased or only gone hidden—emerges clearly and tightens as the crystal reveals pattern in the silences. The key escalation is his experiment tipping from private obsession into a world-scale phenomenon when the woman arrives, reframing his work as part of a larger movement. His final choice to leave is a genuine turn, but the felt cost is modest; his reticence isn’t tested to breaking so much as gently relinquished. The tension is intellectual and atmospheric rather than visceral, yet it coheres and deepens appropriately for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will keep chasing and recording uncanny patterns or relinquish that role—is legible and escalates via the ominous “something older,” the moving sculpture, and the tape’s ambiguous voice. His key choices (following the arrow toward danger, pressing the tape to the dancer, then breaking the arrows and surrendering them to the sea) clearly narrow options and resolve the internal conflict. Stakes remain mostly interior and existential rather than immediate-physical, but they carry weight appropriate to the length and mode. A slightly sharper sense of what he risks by not changing could strengthen the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    The primary stake—whether he clings to repair and stability or risks letting the observatory/time itself reconfigure—is clear and escalates from odd malfunction to existential tremor. The decisive turn is his choice to touch the hand and match its rhythm, then to leave his lifelong post. However, the external stakes (collapse, foundations shaking) are quickly transmuted into a near-bloodless “miracle,” so the sense of potential real loss dissipates rather than tightening into consequence. The internal conflict resolves convincingly but with relatively gentle pressure for this register of prose.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—Lena executing a “flawless” goodbye without lying to herself about what that costs—is clear and under steady pressure. Escalation is quiet but present: from the weight of the blood work to Mrs. Calloway’s explicit acceptance of death, to the intimacy of the hymn, and finally to Lena’s private decision to relinquish her shard. Internal and external conflicts interweave: how to be kind to a dying woman while managing her own unresolved grief. The cost is emotional rather than situational, but it’s legible and alters her stance going forward.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—confronting what’s happening to noon shadows despite real personal danger—is clear and escalates from intellectual puzzle to existential plunge. The primary tightening is the revelation that the observatory is a lock and that the last scholar became a “shadow to walk at noon,” after which Elara chooses to proceed anyway. Internal and external conflicts align, but the piece leans more on conceptual tension than visceral, moment-to-moment pressure, so the danger reads more as fascinating than terrifying. Still, her decision to trade safety for forbidden knowledge is an earned, high-stakes move.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—confronting and repairing the “crack in the world’s skin” that took her brother—is established early through the substitute body and sustained through the garden encounter. Pressure escalates via the tooth’s activation, the changeling’s appearance, and the overwhelming memory-sharing, which are all good tightening beats. However, after that peak, conflict resolves quickly once Liora proposes the “turn them into stars” solution; the changeling assents and reality resets without visible resistance, cost, or real risk of failure. The result is emotionally effective but slightly under-pressured for elite-level stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—how light is kept and shared, and whether Liora’s non-fire ethos will continue—is clear but largely internal and philosophical. Escalation consists mainly of deepening texture (memories of grandmother and Elias) and a single external tightening when the girl appears asking to “keep” fire; that turn is effective but gentle. There’s little sense of risk or real possibility of refusal, so the cost of Liora’s choice stays conceptual rather than tense on the page. The result is thematically satisfying but low-pressure in conflict terms.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—how Lena will live with public exposure and whether she and Javier can inhabit that wound together—is clear and becomes legible through the pendant transfer and shared planting. Pressure coheres as the piece moves from isolation to relational risk; having Javier actually appear and kneel into her ritual is the key tightening choice. However, conflict remains mostly subtextual and cooperative, with minimal overt clash or felt risk of rupture in the moment. The emotional price is there, but a sharper moment of potential refusal or misunderstanding could raise the sense of cost and escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will keep exerting rigid control over his narratives or surrender to the living current—is clear and resolves decisively when he says “I’m listening” and ultimately lets the water take him. Escalation is more deepening than confrontational: the cameos accumulate, the faceless man confronts him, and the manuscript begins writing itself, narrowing his viable stances. However, Elias has limited on-page tactical resistance once the supernatural pressure mounts; his surrender feels artistically right but not heavily tested by alternative choices or failures. The cost (his erasure/absorption) is conceptually strong but slightly undercut by the later assurance of critical success.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (save the arbor or lose the moon’s blessing and cultural memory) is well signaled and emotionally legible. Escalation occurs primarily in her internal surrender to song and the arbor’s progressive response—twitching tendril, unfurling vines, plumping gourds. However, conflict remains relatively low-friction; once she commits, nothing meaningfully resists or complicates her attempt. The resolution feels earned but almost too easy for the declared scale of potential loss.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—can she successfully seal/keep the starlight in a way that outlasts the world’s ending—is clear and centered on the ritual. Escalation is subtle but present: years of failed attempts culminate in this try; tension peaks around the seal (“For a breath, nothing happened”) and is released when the map pulses like a heartbeat. The cost is mainly conceptual and emotional (labor, solitude, working against extinction), and her choice to keep going in “the spaces between breaths” is an earned stance crystallization. The pressure never becomes gripping in a conventional sense, but it deepens appropriately for this length and mode.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether he can retool the timer to hold and recall fleeting wonder before the echoes thin—is clear and present early. Pressure escalates primarily through time and density: the wounded season ending, the work accelerating, then the activation that yields his wife’s fragile, warbling song. This is more deepening than sharp reversal, but it satisfies the accumulative lens and the final choice to leave the device running and postpone sharing it carries a felt cost. The only limitation is that external opposition is minimal, so tension stays mostly internal and atmospheric rather than confrontational.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elira can offload others’ burdens without being destroyed or subsumed—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates well: routine calcification is disrupted when the child’s fear resists, which opens the door for the grotto’s accumulated weight to push back and try to “give back” everything she’s dumped there. Her response—tilting the lamp to let the flame lick the walls and accepting absorption—is a meaningful, costly choice that resolves the tension between duty and self-preservation. The conflict is largely internal and situational rather than adversarial, but it maintains coherence and avoids stalling.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake is her relationship to grief—whether to keep trying to “contain” the lost husband or accept the transience of the lions (and him). Pressure escalates subtly through the intruding outside gaze (the girl’s question) and the dream, which together make her habitual coping suddenly feel insufficient, prompting a new kind of carving and the decision not to sell it. This is a quiet, internal conflict, but the trade-off at the end—keeping the lion and embracing that it, too, is about leaving—carries a believable cost. The escalation could feel marginally stronger if one present-moment choice visibly risked disrupting her survival routine.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Lira can live with her abandoned selves—tightens from quiet introspection to open accusation (“coward”) to a literal physical pull under. The key escalation comes when the lagoon manifests multiple Liras with specific failures; that image forces a stance and makes her later jump feel like a meaningful test rather than gesture. The cost is legible: she allows herself to be taken by the very past she’s tried to quarantine. Conflict remains mostly internal/psychic; a slightly sharper articulation of what she risks by *not* jumping would amplify the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—what to do with this failed portal for hope, revive it or reroute it—is clear and thematically apt, and there is a genuine tightening when Lena chooses not to “fix” the terminal but to cannibalize it into a bypass bridge. However, conflict is largely unopposed: the maze yields under her competence, the resurrection succeeds on first try, and no one meaningfully contests her decision on the page. As a result, escalation feels more like steady unveiling than a pressured test of her values.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    The primary conflict—whether he will continue obeying the elders’ prohibition or resurrect his heretical project—is coherent and escalates from passive stasis to physical transgression (cracking the crystal, laying out the pieces). The decisive act clearly forecloses the path of obedience and safety, and the imagined elders’ reaction underscores the cost. However, all resistance is internal and the scene unfolds with relatively little friction; nothing concrete threatens to stop him once he decides. The pressure is sufficient for a quiet lyric piece but does not fully test his resolve on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora continues the salvaging quest built on her father’s lies or renounces it—is legible early and culminates in an explicit trade-off (ledger vs. sundial, marshes vs. docks). Escalation is quiet but present: choosing the marshes over the docks, the sundial’s anomalous “inward” shadow, and the “last broadcast” all narrow her options toward an internal reckoning. The price—abandoning a lifelong drive and accepting uncertainty—is clear but largely conceptual, with minimal external or situational pressure testing her resolve. This keeps the tension effective but on the softer side for elite-level stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—whether Elias will merely observe or actively tend and extend this temporal archive—is clear and culminates in his choice to splice the rope and bind in the seed pod. Knowledge deepens meaningfully when he discovers the rope preserves storm sounds, and again when he realizes it’s part of a larger language. However, there’s little real resistance or loss; pressure remains gentle, with the main “tightening” being a conceptual shift rather than a genuine narrowing of options or painful trade-off. The conflict is elegant but soft-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—how to respond to the prince’s disappearance and the princess’s grief—is clear, but pressure remains gentle throughout. The main tightening is the thread’s activation leading to the locket, which deepens knowledge rather than forcing a hard trade-off or visible sacrifice. Elias’s key “choice” is interpretive: what story he will tell about the absence, and whether to comfort rather than confront with harsher possibilities. The piece succeeds as a lyrical meditation, but as conflict it never quite narrows options or crystallizes a costly stance on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.3)
    The primary conflict—Aldric vs a world that has chosen iron over feathers, efficiency over song—is clear and escalates from quiet obsession to a literal shaking of the palace. The dominant stake (can something like transcendent beauty be reborn, and at what cost?) tightens when the creature proves wrong and dangerous rather than purely sublime. Aldric’s agency (choosing to proceed despite likely failure) drives the turn; the price is accepting a monstrous, unstable outcome instead of a sanitized ideal. Pressure is more existential than plot-perilous, but remains coherent and rising under that lens.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes are internal (self-definition versus inherited violence and village suspicion) with a concrete external test in the injured boy. The story tightens when the cry breaks the “kelp-drift peace,” forcing Liora to embody her stance under pressure and literally stitch a wound with the same thread used to repurpose her father’s coin. The cost is more conceptual and ongoing—living under watch, holding both destructive and healing fire—than immediate loss, which keeps escalation relatively quiet. Still, her renewed choice at the next alarm reads as an earned recommitment under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether to unstick sealed memories and accept unpredictable consequences—is clear and sharpened as she moves from door to chamber to actively tearing threads. Escalation is present (the door resisting, the chamber trembling, threads fighting back), and the decisive act emerges from her agency, not luck. However, the stakes remain somewhat abstract; we never see a specific person or loss at risk, which keeps the tension more conceptual than visceral. The felt price of unleashing the voices and leaving the city with that burden is there, but it could be more concretely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Veyra will accept cyclical fading or risk self-loss to carry light outward—is clearly signaled, and tightens when the gear demands a memory as fuel. The cost of transit (loss of a formative memory and exile from her people’s accepted cycle) is legible and paid on the page. However, conflict remains largely internal and abstract; the “heresy” of her choice is gestured to but never concretely tests her resolve in-scene. As a result, escalation feels more like steady deepening than a sharp narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether he can transform his relationship to grief and pass that transformation to his daughter—is clear early and deepens rather than widens. Pressure escalates from the slipped chisel and cracked stone (embodied failure) to the father’s admonition and the new carving method, then to the choice to place the butterfly on the table. The cost is subtle but present: relinquishing his long-held solitary containment of grief to a shared, vulnerable practice. Stakes remain mostly internal and never feel life-or-death, which keeps this strong but not maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Elias can rebalance communal guilt through minute temporal sabotage—is clear and present early. Pressure escalates subtly: tonight's anomalous pause, his conscious decision to press the carved rake to the bob, and the implied social friction of altering the chime’s cadence. The cost is primarily ethical and social (defying the council, refusing personal absolution in favor of ongoing penance) rather than immediate physical, which suits the piece but keeps escalation in a quieter register. A slightly sharper on-page clash with external pressure could intensify the stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will unravel and face a dangerous, taboo truth rather than leave it buried—is clear, and each untied knot tightens pressure by making the dead more active and the secret more specific. Conflict is mostly internal/occult rather than interpersonal, with Hester’s pressure offstage, so the ethical and social cost of revealing the truth remains mostly implied. The decision to tell Hester and to reset the chessboard functions as a quiet but genuine stance crystallization. A slightly sharper on-page sense of risk to Elias or Hester at the end would push the stakes higher.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora can responsibly shape a possible future without overstepping—is intriguing but remains mostly abstract. Pressure tightens once when she fears the future will “reject her boldness,” and the spire’s answering song resolves that tension quickly. There is little sense of a foreclosed path or visible loss; success feels nearly assured once the mechanics are introduced. As a result, conflict is conceptually rich but dramatically soft.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—risking execution to reintroduce forbidden stories into a censored city—is clearly signaled and thematically potent. Pressure escalates from secret broadcasts under abstract threat to concrete danger via the Ministry’s recent executions and then the unexpected arrival of Lira, which forces Elias to put a child directly in harm’s way. The aftermath shard with patrols and the emptied alcove implies real cost and consequence, so the conflict does not feel weightless. However, the peak choice and its price (what exactly Elias does to vanish) are implied rather than shown, so the narrowing of options at the climax is powerful but somewhat oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora will allow full recognition/understanding or maintain her mirage—is clear and paid off in her choice to burn the portrait and then leave. Escalation is subtle: the key tightening is her realization that she understands the man too well, prompting destruction rather than completion. The conflict remains primarily internal and aesthetic, with limited sense of competing external pressures or real risk beyond her chosen solitude and restlessness. For a top-tier piece, one more concrete test of that stance in the present moment would sharpen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—truth/memory versus institutional “progress”—is clear early and coherently pressured by the Archives’ decision to reclaim and flood the tunnels. Escalation is modest but effective for the length: a verbal warning, a preparatory siege of preservation, then the physical arrival of pumps and rising water. Elias’s agency lies in how he responds (building a vault, choosing to stand and witness rather than flee), and the cost is unambiguous. The conflict is somewhat one-sided at the climax—the outcome is never in real doubt—but under a situational lens the inevitability serves the theme rather than undercutting tension.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—can any kind of choral presence survive after hatred has hollowed it out—is clear but quiet. Escalation is textural rather than event-driven: from solitary listening to the rosette, to the incremental arrival of each singer, to the shared, fragile humming that chooses presence over absence. The cost is visible in the fact that they are “remnants,” carrying scars, and that harmony is only a “possibility,” not yet regained. The piece could edge higher with one sharper on-page test of that choice, but within a lyric mode the tension holds.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—what Elias will do with the knowledge fruit and what that means for his place in the city’s culinary and moral order—is clear. Escalation is mostly internal and conceptual, tightening around his decision to feed the homeless despite anticipated condemnation. However, antagonistic pressure remains distant; the “critics” and “elders” are labels rather than on-page forces, so the cost of defiance feels more implied than fought for. The quiet mode fits the concept, but one sharper testing moment would strengthen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will risk the Last Wonder to jolt a complacent city back into awe—is clear and followed through. Escalation is mostly internal: his fear it won’t work, his diagnosis that the city itself killed the hive, and the climb to plant the seed. The external pressure (blackout, wilting crops, engineers coming at dawn) stays somewhat abstract and never truly corner him, so the cost feels more conceptual than biting. Still, his act forecloses a path (keeping the relic unused) in a way that meaningfully tightens options.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora will access and understand the “hush” that makes places feel alive—is clear but low-intensity. There is an escalation in texture (the arranged spiral, the bay’s stilling, the whisper, the unseen door closing), yet Liora is never truly squeezed or forced into a difficult trade-off. Her choice to leave the shard is gentle and unopposed, with only a faint sense of relinquishment as cost. As a result, the story reads more as a lyrical meditation than as a pressured conflict arc.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the intruder will poison what they believe is a god/weapon versus joining Liora in protecting a nascent world—is clear from the ampoule’s introduction and tightens as truths accumulate. Escalation is primarily internal but effective: telepathic pressure, destabilizing revelations, then the climactic choice to “thread the needle,” open the dome, drop the helmet, and allow transformation. The cost (abandoning the old mission, self, and breathable air) is legible and thematically tied to embracing nuance over certainty. External antagonism is largely offstage (scholars, old world), so tension depends heavily on the revelation engine, which it sustains well but not quite at a breakneck pitch.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether to escape/rewind the missed opportunity or remain in the recursive system with new understanding—is signaled early and crystallized at the door. Tension escalates via the anomalous stair creak, the realization of recursion (not infinity), and the risky dice experiment that produces a non-obvious solution. The final choice carries a clear conceptual and emotional price (abandoning the chance to “smooth the chip”) and is protagonist-driven rather than coincidental. The internal struggle at the threshold could feel marginally more pressured on the page to heighten the sense of a near break.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.0)
    The primary stakes are spiritual and atmospheric—whether his obscure acts of care and language can touch strangers and the world—yet they are signaled early and carried consistently. Escalation comes through the dying fig, the precarious script, the hovering over the ambiguous glyph (“to rouse” / “to forgive”), and the uncanny response of the leaf and city. The price is real but subtle: prolonged sleep deprivation, the slow wearing away of the brush, and the acceptance that he may never witness proof beyond hints. The conflict remains contemplative rather than sharply agonistic, which keeps the tension on the gentler side of the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the arts/memories of the displaced will be lost or re-embodied—is clear from early on and tightens with each lens use. Pressure escalates through discovery (hands, voices, absorption) and culminates in Liora’s destructive choice, which is a genuine narrowing of options. However, opposition is mostly conceptual and environmental; no person, institution, or even internal fear strongly pushes back at her plan. As a result, the story’s tension is textured but low-amplitude, reading more as a graceful unfolding than a rigorously tested conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will use this mechanism to step outside fate’s design—is signaled early and escalates cleanly through the preparation and “one pull” moment into his literal crossing of the stones. Pressure tightens via the mechanism’s activation and the path opening then being swallowed by the returning tide, foreclosing retreat with a real, if mostly conceptual, cost. Internal and external stakes largely align (his metaphysical goal matches the physical danger) rather than pulling against each other, so the tension feels more inevitable than contested. The lack of a sharp competing value (love, duty, or a concrete tie to the village) keeps the conflict from fully peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stake—reclaiming or redefining his selfhood/fear after the resuscitation—is clear and escalates from eerie entry to metaphysical heart-rip. The explicit goal of tricking fear, learned from the dream dictionary, pays off in the lie and the decision to lunge through rather than at the double, which is a meaningful tightening. However, the external conflict is resolved very swiftly; the “thing that wears your face” offers little real resistance and there’s no failed attempt or visible setback to sharpen the cost in the moment. The cost instead sits more conceptually in what he carries out (the hungry clasp, ongoing curse) than in on-page sacrifices during the fight.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake is essentially artistic and spiritual: can he transform opposition (storm/sea) into collaboration without repeating past harm. Escalation is present—clouds sharpening, the sea’s voice emerging, the chord swelling—but the pressure remains mostly aesthetic and contemplative rather than forcing a painful trade-off. His main “choice” at the peak is to keep playing and lean into the unknown, which feels natural but relatively safe. The hinted physical danger to ships/orchard never crystallizes into a concrete, on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elyas will respond to the watchers’ “invitation” and reopen what the gate was meant to seal—is signaled early and tightened as the watchers advance and the shells speak back. Escalation is accumulative but clear: from distant observation to direct communication to the city literally shifting under him and the gate screaming. Elyas’s agency is central: his decision to whistle the lost sequence and then to walk into the offered hands crystallizes his stance. However, the danger remains mostly abstract (we never see what “taken” entails), which slightly softens the felt cost of his choice.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—truth vs institutional "protection"/faith with immediate legal jeopardy—is clear early and tightens as warning, arrival, and impending police converge. The key escalation is Elias choosing not to run but to broaden the conflict with the parallel documents, effectively shifting from a narrow theft to a systemic confrontation. That turn is strong, but the price on the page (what he tangibly loses or risks right now) could be sharper; his calm limits felt jeopardy. Still, pressure coheres and grows under a causal lens through to his final, committed departure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake is largely existential—whether Elias embraces a life in service to vanished and “abandoned” stories—rather than situationally dire. Conflict is mostly internal and textural, with the main tightening being his discovery of the note and subtle shift from professional surveyor to secret correspondent/restorer. The drawbridge, engineers, and time-of-night frame potential external pressure but never meaningfully corner him or force painful trade-offs on the page. As a result, tension is steady and engaging but rarely sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will use his skills to expose or protect a deeper, orchestrated order of knowledge—is present but mostly internal, with the external stakes (restoration of power, potential discovery by “surface teams”) staying abstract. Escalation exists as a knowledge-deepening: from odd stamp to coordinates to the revelation of the pre-written ledger, which reweights his situation. However, the journey to the chamber is nearly frictionless (the pressure lock yields after a bit of rusted resistance), and we never see a serious alternative path or live risk of loss tested on the page. The ending choice to keep working in silence is thematically pointed but could carry more bite if any option had been truly costly in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she will surrender herself to the basilica/dream mechanism to save/reconfigure the isle and reach her daughter—is clear and deepens as the gem “bites” and she begins to be rewritten. Escalation is effective: from eerie sinking and missing shadow to physical pain, spatial instability (garden tilting), and the cranes’ metamorphosis. Her final act of letting go is a real renunciation with cost, not a free reward. The pressure remains mostly internal and metaphysical rather than situationally urgent; a bit more concrete peril or a sharper moment of resistance could make the conflict feel less foregone.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—Lena’s drive to touch the locus of an unmade choice—is signaled early and tightens as the storm resolves into manipulable “threads.” The meaningful pressure point is her decision to key in her father’s frequency and ignore the scientist’s warning, choosing psychic revelation over safety. However, the potential collapse of the field and any wider consequences remain abstract, so the cost reads mostly emotional and conceptual rather than fully visceral. The escalation works, but the danger could be sharpened to feel less hypothetical.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lena remains an isolated observer or risks connection—is clear and scales appropriately to the story. Conflict escalates from distant watching to the decisive, ethically fraught act of stealing the chip, then softens into a shared, vulnerable moment. External conflict with the pilgrim is brief and lightly contested, more a ritual test than a true struggle, which keeps stakes emotionally focused but modest. The cost—surrendering possessiveness over the “missing piece” and exposing herself—is felt, though not sharply agonized.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will continue to live inside curated lies or face the truth about Harkin—is clear and present early. Escalation is mostly internal, deepening from generalized guilt to the specific, uncanny confrontation of tomorrow’s dated note. His choice to throw away the watch hand then accept the summons is an earned tightening that forecloses continued avoidance. The conflict remains quiet and largely internal, with limited sense of external jeopardy or concrete consequences beyond implied emotional reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—the fate of Kaelis’s nephew—arrives clearly and early, and the announcement “They won’t release the boy” is a genuine tightening of pressure. Elias’s counteroffer (the lost supply cache for the boy) is the principal turn and stems from his agency and worldview. The ethical cost is more thematic than visceral on the page; we’re told the war will “limp on,” but Elias doesn’t have to visibly sacrifice a competing good here. Tension is steady and quietly persuasive but never razor-edged; the outcome feels likely once we see Kaelis’s hesitation and family tie.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias flees again or endures the pain of showing up—is signaled early and sharpened by the daughter’s letter and unopened mail. Pressure escalates as he moves from launch (maximum escape potential) to post office (direct confrontation with past) to bar (testing whether he’ll resume old avoidance patterns), with each step foreclosing the option of simply disappearing. The internal/external conflicts braid well: his professional identity as navigator versus his failure as father. The stakes remain intimate rather than explosive, but the trade-off between horizon-chasing and relational repair is clear and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Liam will choose to reclaim/accept empathy and responsibility—intensifies in a clear line from clinic to lake to park. The choice to throw the ball, risking his “way back,” is a genuine foreclosure with emotional cost, followed by the harder, smaller but sharper test of facing the boy-now-man. Internal and external conflicts are nicely braided: the mystical choice and the mundane coffee and chess moves all press the same fault line. If anything, the immediate negative consequence of his new path (what he *cannot* now do) could be rendered with slightly more bite.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—undoing her brother’s death versus the risk of unravelling herself—is clear early and tightens effectively. Escalation is driven by Liora’s choices: moving from hesitation with the stag to a deliberate, more violent pull on the “space where her brother’s absence lived,” which generates the wrong and costly resurrection. The price is unmistakable: she destroys the stag, fails to restore her brother, and irreversibly alters herself. Internal and external conflicts are well-braided, though the ethical calculus around sacrificing the stag is only lightly touched.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora will remain bound to her vigil or transform her relationship to loss—is signaled early via her obsession with the crack and the years of waiting. Pressure escalates as the ritual wakes the glade, the brother appears, and he demands “You have to repent,” forcing her into a nontrivial internal choice. The cost—accepting she cannot rescue him and must relinquish her identity as grief’s custodian—lands, but the conflict remains almost entirely internal and contemplative, so escalation feels like a deepening rather than a sharp tightening. This keeps tension strong but not quite at a peak-level burn.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—opening the locked dimension and ending a terminal stasis—is clear from early on and tightens meaningfully when the first stitching attempt fails and the thread snaps. The “Try again” beat crystallizes her commitment and leads into a higher-stakes second attempt where the tear is wider, hands reach through, and her body threatens to “unravel.” The cost of success (the *Eulogy*’s disappearance, surrendering her long-held role) is implied and felt. Escalation could be sharpened by one more concrete complication or trade-off during the successful attempt, but tension still climbs credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake is Elira’s relationship to transformation and her “wealth” of bottled light—whether she will cling to it, distribute it as before, or risk it in the volcano’s fire—and this does tighten toward the prophecy and final hurling of the vials. The prophecy *“She will trade light for fire and walk away whole”* crystallizes a pressure point and prompts a concrete, irreversible action. However, practical or moral jeopardy feels low; we never fully believe she might truly be harmed or fail, so the escalation remains primarily symbolic and atmospheric rather than sharply pressurized. Strengthening the sense of what she might *lose* beyond the vials themselves would heighten the perceived cost of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—opening the armory to ignite a revolution—is clearly signaled and remains coherent. There is one main tightening: Kael working within the brief vulnerability of the reset under blackout, where a misstep could trigger alarms and light. However, the scene lacks a true on-page reversal or escalation beat; everything proceeds according to plan with no forced trade-off or visible loss. As a result, tension is present but never quite sharp enough to feel genuinely costly at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora can stabilize or “anchor” reality/promise as friction vanishes—is present and escalates via the dust awakening, the aurora snapping into a ring, and the mirror-water showing her unraveling. Her agency (choosing to grasp the dust, then to push and accept the anchor role) drives the resolution rather than coincidence. Still, the opposition (“something…waiting for the friction to vanish”) remains faceless and untested, so the sense of struggle is more mythic inevitability than contested outcome. The emotional and tactical price of her victory could be more sharply foregrounded to heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—what to do with the censored poem and, by extension, with his own pain—is clear from the envelope’s emergence onward. Pressure escalates via the timer’s chiming, the storm intensifying, and the physical vulnerability of the poem to water, culminating in his choice to tear it apart and leave it to the storm. The cost is internal but legible, especially given the years he has invested and the scars that underwrite it. This is a quiet, purely internal conflict, but it tightens once in a meaningful, satisfying way.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whose governance philosophy and way of thinking will shape their future—is clear and given concrete form through the coded duel. Escalation is present as the swordplay shifts from display to puzzle-solving to the revelation that Liora laid this trap twelve years ago, tightening pressure around whether Elias can “see” as she does. The final turn, choosing partnership over awaiting judgment, is satisfying but the sense of risk (career, safety, reputation) remains mostly implied. Conflict is smart and layered but emotionally relatively cool.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will give in to his molting restlessness or root himself in this fragile community of resistance—is clear but softly prosecuted. There is one main tightening around Maren’s “You’re leaving” and his lie, with the violet and shared reach for Rilke offering a countervailing pull toward staying. External stakes (guards, collapse of order) are gestured at but never materially close in, so pressure remains more atmospheric than sharp. The final quieting of the itch and his decision to keep writing reads as an internal endurance choice, but the on-page cost feels modest.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lena can break out of suspended waiting into a reclaimed future with her lover—is clear, but pressure remains relatively low because very little resists her plan once she enacts it. The compasses locking and film activating mark a meaningful tightening, yet there are no genuine obstacles or trade-offs; we never see what she risks losing by stepping through. The internal conflict (hope vs. self-protective numbness) is implied more than dramatized in on-page micro-choices under strain. As a result, the resolution feels more like a beautiful inevitability than a hard-won crossing.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—preserving and clarifying cultural/collective memory before the monsoon amplifies dangerous dreams—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates via the “hungry” dreams and Manik’s forgetting, then tightens with the temporal constraint of the approaching storm and the cost of using the seed. The decisive act (biting the seed) is driven by Liora’s agency and carries visible cost, but there’s relatively little on-page resistance or complication once that option appears, making the conflict feel more inevitable than contested. The result is strong but not maximally tense escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will remain trapped in unresolved anger/regret or find a new way to hold his brother’s absence—is clear and present from the revelation of “the severance.” Escalation is quiet but distinct: discovery of the compass’s nature, activation, and the decision to embed it in the bonsai all tighten his internal pressure and foreclose the path of clinging to the horizon as “wound.” The cost—relinquishing the fantasy of the brother’s simple return or an apology that never came—is emotionally evident though never stated. The conflict remains entirely internal, so tension is more meditative than taut, which slightly limits peak intensity.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.6)
    The internal conflict—control versus witnessing—is well-dramatized and resolves with a legible cost (career pause). However, the external pressure is weak due to the stock nature of the opposition, leaving the stakes largely cerebral.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.5)
    The inciting incident—recognizing the brother's handwriting—creates sharp, immediate tension. However, the climax dissipates this pressure; the threat of the smugglers and the difficulty of the terrain are smoothed over by an internal sense of ease ("lighter than she’d been"). The stakes soften exactly when they should tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.2)
    The conflict between silence and sound provides a clear central stake. However, the escalation is somewhat linear; the protagonist overcomes the obstacle primarily by increasing intensity rather than navigating a complex tactical shift or making a difficult sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clear and escalate appropriately from the ledger blurring to the physical struggle against the currents. The conflict is primarily man-against-nature/supernatural, and the cost is felt in the "biting" weight of the lens and Elias's final resignation.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=4.0)
    Stakes are conceptually high (starvation) but executionally low because the antagonist (patrols) evaporates without a genuine struggle or cost. The tension built by the arson is immediately deflated by the patrols' unearned benevolence, rendering the conflict performative rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.4)
    Tension is minimal as the environment and objects cooperate without resistance ("fog parting just enough"). The protagonist faces no meaningful opposition or trade-offs; the resolution feels inevitable because the stakes are never tested by failure or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are clearly defined and escalate effectively from the fading photos to the physical trap of being caught "in when." The cost of escape—the loss of the halo fragment—is a tangible price paid for survival, validating the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are declared but never tested; the guard’s arrival is resolved instantly by the trapdoor without Lena paying any price (time, resources, or safety). The lack of a forced trade-off or sacrifice leaves the victory feeling unearned and the tension flat.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.7)
    Conflict is largely atmospheric and internal; the "rising tide" acts as ambient pressure rather than active opposition forcing a difficult trade-off. The protagonist observes a result rather than forcing a turn through agency.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.8)
    Tension builds well with the stationmaster's arrival and the reveal of the mirror's nature, but the conflict deflates rather than escalates. The protagonist overcomes the armed antagonist not through a clever turning of the tables or a difficult sacrifice, but by throwing an object that inexplicably dissolves the opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.9)
    The central conflict—preserving a frozen past versus initiating a necessary destruction—is well-dramatized. The stakes are raised by the physical threat of the thaw and the intellectual weight of the father's unfinished work. While the external pressure is clear, the personal cost of destroying the "sanctuary" feels somewhat mitigated by Elara's immediate acceptance of the act.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes of erasure are high and clear. The conflict is primarily internal (fear) and investigative; the antagonist is absent, reducing immediate pressure, but the internal escalation toward the decision to "dive" works well.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are primarily philosophical and abstract ("mapping the night"), resulting in low dramatic tension. While the fading star provides a clock, the central conflict lacks visceral pressure, and the final release feels like a gentle surrender rather than a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.2)
    Escalation is weak; X-7 faces no external opposition and no internal barrier that isn't immediately overcome by playing the instrument. The stakes are purely philosophical, and because the solution (playing the violin) yields instant enlightenment without risk or failure, the narrative lacks the tension required for a compelling arc.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are low and purely vicarious; Lena observes a conflict but faces no personal threat or trade-off in intervening. The escalation is flat—the problem is introduced and immediately solved by the protagonist's gesture without complication or cost. The "thawing" of mistrust happens by fiat, not through dramatic friction.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=3.0)
    The dominant stake (art vs. measurement) is declared but never tested; the "confrontation" lacks pressure as the opposition capitulates instantly without the protagonist having to make a difficult trade-off. The escalation is missing, as the elders' arrival leads directly to a convenient resolution rather than a tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are primarily intellectual, and the external opposition (an AI that merely sighs and warns) provides little active resistance. The protagonist succeeds without a significant tactical shift or sacrifice, making the victory feel inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.5)
    The escalation is subtle and effective for the tone, moving from observation to decoding to physical action. However, the stakes remain low-key and personal; the "cost" of the interaction is minimal (wet clothes, a moment of exertion), lacking a sharper sense of risk or sacrifice to earn the breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are existential, and the radio call provides a clear, escalating pressure point that demands a decision. The internal conflict—lie for safety vs. truth for destruction—is tightly braided with the external threat, though the brevity of the piece limits the complexity of the "deepening" beat.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clearly internalized; the pressure builds through the radio voices and the physical environment (rising water) to a decisive action. The choice to turn the wheel is a high-stakes engagement with the unknown. The resolution—choosing to carry the weight rather than flee—provides a meaningful thematic deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is minimal; the external pressure (rising river, collapsing shelves) is ignored rather than engaged with, resulting in a flat narrative arc. The dominant stake (endurance) faces no urgent test or escalation on the page, making the outcome feel inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.3)
    The stakes are high (a child's voice), but the escalation encounters little resistance; Elias’s plan works immediately during the eclipse without complication or sacrifice. The resolution comes from external magic rather than the protagonist's agency overcoming a difficult obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.5)
    Pressure is Accumulative/Textural, building through atmosphere rather than direct opposition. While the "hook behind ribs" attempts to physicalize the stakes, the actual cost of the "tilt"—and the decision to leave—remains abstract and relatively low-impact.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are high in concept (sonic weapon), but the on-page tension is dampened by the protagonist’s extreme preparedness; the solution (ticket ready, escape route planned) precedes the scene's pressure. The antagonists remain abstract ("men in black coats"), making the conflict feel low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes are high (possession), but the antagonist is passive, offering only verbal jabs and minor reactions while the protagonist executes a plan without active resistance. The conflict remains intellectual and inevitable rather than dynamic, as the "thing" never truly threatens the priest's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—artistic agency vs. commodified prophecy—is clear and escalates as the courier (external pressure) intrudes on his epiphany. The choice to delay the courier creates a moment of Charged Poise, though the external consequences (cost) are more atmospheric than strictly material.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clear and high—Elias’s very existence and sanity—and the escalation through the "stuttering" world effectively forces the climax. The confrontation with the alternate self provides a focused peak pressure point, and the cost of the resolution is visible and permanent.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are clear, but the protagonist lacks agency in the climax; he merely accepts the record the drum maker offers and listens. The conflict resolves through an external gift rather than a costly decision or renunciation forced by rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stakes are clear and escalate well from a personal intrusion (being followed) to a macro-threat (the zone waking up). The internal escalation—Elias realizing he can no longer remain a detached observer—provides a meaningful deepening of the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stakes are intimate but high—Elias’s connection to his mother vs. his own survival. The escalation from "tending" to "feeding" to "abandoning" is coherent. The cost of his freedom is the destruction of his livelihood and the shrine to his mother, which is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes remain abstract and philosophical, lacking immediate threat or concrete cost to the protagonist beyond the metaphorical weight of a question. Pressure is low, with no meaningful tightening of options before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure is coherent but low-stakes; the conflict is primarily atmospheric (silence vs. sound) and internal. The arrival of the girl provides the necessary tightening, but the escalation remains gentle and lyric rather than urgent, fitting the "chronic hush" concept but limiting dynamic range.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clearly delineated between the comfort of a lie and the necessity of pain, with the static charge providing a tangible escalation of pressure. The conflict is resolved through Liora’s agency, though the client functions more as a passive recipient of truth than an active opponent once the process begins.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.6)
    Conflict is negligible; the librarian accepts the partnership immediately with a laugh ("You're a broker, not a saint"), offering no resistance to be overcome. The stakes are abstract ("ledger balanced a little less neatly"), and the cost is relegated to a parenthetical afterthought rather than a felt, on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is negligible; the "elders' warning" is a soft obstacle that Reed bypasses without consequence or tactical adjustment. The central struggle—finding a recluse and integrating them—is resolved through immediate cooperation, lacking the escalation or reversal required for high-stakes engagement. The cost of belonging is stated philosophically but not paid for on the page through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes—the waking of the giant and the loss of the moths—are clear and high. However, the protagonist's victory comes with relatively low on-page personal cost, achieved primarily through the use of a tool rather than a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are internal but clearly defined; the escalation comes from the ritual's partial success forcing a choice between illusion and truth. The cost is legible in the "clouded eye" and the emptiness of the satchel at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.2)
    The emotional stakes (isolation vs. connection) are clear and the escalation is well-paced. However, the tension is undercut by the mechanical impossibility of the tape beat and the reliance on coincidence rather than character agency to bridge the gap.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain abstract; the cost of "letting go" is portrayed as immediate relief rather than a difficult trade-off. There is no external pressure forcing the decision, and the "storm" acts as a helper rather than a true antagonist, lowering the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no significant obstacles or antagonists, accepting the call and surrendering the brooch without hesitation. The stakes, while stated as high (sanity, truth), lack on-page pressure because the transaction with the amber figure is frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=4.7)
    Stakes are low because the antagonist/entity immediately acts as a helpful mentor, removing the tension of the "unknown." The conflict is resolved by a lecture, and the protagonist's decision to leave the pearl feels inevitable rather than a hard-won renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.3)
    The conflict is primarily internal, which works for the tone, but the middle section de-escalates tension as the town immediately cooperates without friction. The arrival of the ship reintroduces pressure, but the ease with which Elias integrates the community's grief lowers the stakes before the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.3)
    The internal conflict (precision vs. grief) is well-staged, and the cost of the resolution—admitting ignorance—is felt. The escalation is somewhat linear, relying on a "test" format at the pedestal, but the resolution earns its weight through the loss of the tool.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.2)
    The emotional stakes are clear and escalate appropriately as the transcription syncs with the whale song. The pressure is internal but legible. The climax relies on a vision that resolves the grief a bit too neatly, reducing the sense of struggle in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are theoretical rather than visceral; the solar storm and the curse both align with Lysander's goal, removing external friction. The primary obstacle is ennui, and the resolution ("unmaking the idea of harm") dissolves tension rather than tightening it through a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are immediate (twelve lives) and escalate clearly as the ink pot’s limitations and the girl’s arrival increase pressure. The shift from a simple erasure of debt to a chaotic breach of reality raises the stakes naturally from personal survival to metaphysical alteration.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative acts as a procedural vignette with near-zero stakes; the protagonist faces no antagonist, internal block, or risk of failure. The translation of the hum into history proceeds smoothly, devoid of the tension or escalation necessary to drive a story.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are primarily internal and existential, but the pressure is made palpable through the tangible accumulation of the "fragments" and the encroachment of the tide. The escalation from collecting others' stories to finding his own name in the ledger provides a sharp, necessary deepening of the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.5)
    The literal "ticking clock" of the dissolving journal provides strong, legible stakes and escalation. However, the conflict dissolves rather than resolving through a hard trade-off; the protagonist plays the cello, and the antagonist (time/silence) yields to a convenient revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake (saving the city) is clear, but the immediate pressure is low; the antagonists are abstract figures arriving "by dawn," leaving the protagonist to paint without direct opposition. The "crackle of static" provides a token threat, but the scene lacks a visceral tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.3)
    The conflict (preservation vs. industry) is internal but externalized effectively through the countdown and the approaching drones. The stakes are clear and the protagonist's agency (planting the canister, taking the photos) is active. The cost is conceptual—the acceptance of loss—which fits the length.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=3.5)
    Tension is virtually nonexistent because the protagonist faces no opposition; the text explicitly states "No one stopped him," removing potential social or physical barriers. The stakes remain abstract (the ship *might* fail) while the on-page execution is effortless, devoid of the friction required for a compelling narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are high and the cost is paid in full at the end, satisfying the requirement for a felt price. However, the escalation feels linear because the protagonist offers no resistance to her fate, resulting in a slide toward destiny rather than a climb through conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.0)
    Stakes are theoretical rather than felt; the protagonist faces no antagonist, time limit, or resource scarcity that jeopardizes his success. The escalation is purely volumetric (more sound, more life) rather than qualitative, and the potential conflict with the "voice" in the alley evaporates instantly without testing the protagonist’s resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    The oxygen clock creates palpable pressure that forces the protagonist's hand. However, the physical resolution (surviving the ascent) happens off-stage, which slightly undercuts the visceral cost of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    Tension is well-managed through the ticking clock ("before dawn") and the physical peril of the climb. The escalation is internal (whispers) and external (the beam, the creaking door), leading to a decisive moment of agency at the top of the tower.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are clearly articulated: the pain of manifestation versus the hunger to wake Vesper. However, the revelation that this is a recurring cycle lowers the immediate tension; while the cost ("unraveling") is physically felt, the promise of return reduces the sacrifice from existential annihilation to temporary exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.2)
    Pressure is negligible; the protagonist faces no active opposition, significant time crunch, or difficult trade-offs during the journey. The escalation is procedural and smooth, lacking a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt or a visible price is paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is negligible; the blight is a static condition that yields immediately to Elias's efforts without fighting back. There is no antagonist, the solitude is welcomed rather than endured, and the success requires no sacrifice or difficult trade-off, resulting in a flat dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story operates under a low-pressure situational lens. While the task creates mild momentum, the obstacles (finding a name, walking to the alley) lack genuine resistance or risk. The "hesitation" beat is too brief to generate significant tension or escalate the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes are high and the cost (Elias's life/the observatory) is paid on the page. However, the escalation lacks mechanical resistance; Elias simply synchronizes the telescope and the problem is solved via "broadcasting." The antagonist force (Council enforcers) arrives only to witness the aftermath, reducing the potential for dynamic confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.4)
    The conflict is primarily internal, and while the decision to apologize is a valid turning point, the stakes feel lowered by the instant magical healing of the self-inflicted wound. The pressure comes from the spirits asking a question rather than a forcing external event, making the climax feel relatively low-pressure. The cost is emotional (pride), but the physical erasure of the "tether" (pain) softens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.1)
    Escalation is present via the boy's arrival, and giving up the grounding object (coral) provides a felt cost (Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration). However, the conflict resolves too smoothly; the boy accepts Lena's reframing instantly, lowering the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.6)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the fog is a passive condition rather than an antagonistic force, and Liora faces no external opposition or internal dilemma. The stakes are low because the risk of failure is never established, and the "cost" (the film fading) is explicitly dismissed by the protagonist ("that didn’t matter"), draining the climax of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes remain largely internal and existential, with the external pressure acting more as an inevitable pull than a conflict to be fought. Liora's "escape" feels relatively low-risk because the opposing force—the "weight of certainty"—is not personified or solidified into a concrete obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.6)
    The opposition is a paper tiger; the "thought tax" stakes evaporate when surveillance is easily evaded by humming off-key or planting turnips. The antagonists' inability to distinguish between gardening and sedition removes the necessary squeeze to force a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes are high in scope (war vs. peace) but low in tension because the protagonist is an immortal, "unstoppable" force who faces no genuine threat to her safety or capacity. The escalation is thematic rather than a pressure cooker of narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation is coherent and rapid; the stakes shift naturally from repairing an object to containing a threat, culminating in a choice that destroys the protagonist's world. The cost is unmistakably paid on the page—the library is wrecked—fulfilling the requirement for a tangible price.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes are high and the ticking clock (torches below) provides effective pressure, but the conflict is resolved too easily by the protagonist's magical intervention. The antagonist force dissolves without a final complication or trade-off, reducing the climax's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the stakes (the survival of the valley) are established early, the escalation flatlines at the climax because the opposition fails to push back. The conflict is resolved through presentation rather than struggle; the elders' immediate nod removes the necessary pressure to force a difficult choice or sacrifice from Liora. The "cost" of the final decision is theoretically social but practically non-existent on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.5)
    Internal stakes are high and clearly defined, driving the tension effectively. The external pressure is softer—the wind and Holloway offer only mild resistance—but the emotional risk of the correspondence carries the weight of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.8)
    High initial stakes (a child lost for days, survival risk) are abandoned for low conceptual stakes (learning a lesson about thresholds). The conflict does not escalate; it dissolves into a gentle understanding, removing the pressure of the time-limit implied by "three days." The ending feels like a surrender to the premise rather than a hard-won victory or tragic loss.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is negligible; the arrival of the outsider presents no threat, complication, or cost, leading to a low-stakes shared experience. The "tightening" is purely atmospheric, lacking a moment where the protagonist must make a trade-off or face a genuine risk to her isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are declared ("Time was a thief") rather than dramatized; the protagonist faces no significant opposition or difficult trade-offs. The resolution removes the conflict entirely without a visible cost, rendering the initial tension of "running out of time" hollow.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes remain low and largely abstract; the pressure is self-imposed and aesthetic rather than visceral. The conflict with the woman offers a potential deepening, but Lior's immediate, superior dismissal of her perspective deflates the tension. The narrative lacks a moment of genuine risk where failure feels possible or consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are purely internal and abstract; the ritual proceeds without error, external interruption, or a moment of doubt where failure is possible. The cost ("ink would be her blood") is metaphorical and stated rather than paid on the page as a felt limitation or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are purely atmospheric and contemplative, lacking immediate pressure or risk of failure. The "reckonings" confirm what the harbor already knows, rendering the ritual symbolic rather than causally necessary for a specific outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.7)
    The internal pressure is palpable, escalated by the memory of the wife’s ultimatum. The shift from holding the box to using the landscape to communicate represents a meaningful tightening of tactics. The cost—leaving behind the tangible memory—is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.3)
    The rising tide provides a functional ticking clock, but the stakes remain largely philosophical and internal. The weight of "parallel timelines" is asserted by the narrator rather than dramatized through concrete consequences, lowering the felt tension.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.1)
    The stakes are clearly defined, but the external resistance is minimal; the walls surrender their secrets quite easily once the match is lit. The escalation is linear, and while the sketching provides a moment of agency, the final release of tension feels gifted by the environment rather than wrestled from it.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict remains abstract and low-pressure; the cost to the soldier is intellectualized rather than felt through direct confrontation or urgent consequence. The transaction with the client feels recounted rather than dramatized in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.9)
    The conflict is clear and the stakes are immediately legible. The turning point—Veyra weaponizing Kael's past idealism against his current cynicism—is a solid causal escalation. The cost is felt in the physical act of signing (the bleeding ink), though the psychological struggle resolves a bit quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.7)
    Conflict is internal and static; the approaching storm provides atmosphere but exerts no actual pressure on Elias’s tactics or decisions. The stakes remain abstract and symbolic, with no external force testing his resolve in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake (freedom vs. conformity) is clear, but the antagonism is passive; the knots untangle with only minor sensory resistance. Liora’s invulnerability ("She smiled... She had been called worse") deflates tension, as the outcome never feels in doubt. The cost is stated ("madness") but functions more as a badge of honor than a paid price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are primarily theoretical and retrospective; the physical danger has passed, leaving only an abstract internal debate about storytelling ethics. The lack of an immediate, on-page antagonist or ticking clock results in low tension, as the central conflict is resolved through contemplation rather than forced action under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    The conflict is internal and elemental—memory versus entropy—and escalates appropriately through the fragility of the spiral structure. While the stakes are subtle, the "reproach" of the silence provides enough pressure to make the act of building feel necessary rather than just ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are abstract (forgotten names) and the conflict is low; the environment and magic yield to Elira's touch without generating pressure or requiring a significant trade-off. The climax is a smooth procedural execution rather than a test of agency with a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding the path vs. being consumed by it—is established, and the storm provides necessary pressure. However, the "sacrifice of certainty" is a high-concept intellectual cost that lacks an on-page equivalent (e.g., a loss of resources or safety) to make the price undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.0)
    External pressure is low; the guards are a background condition rather than an active threat, and the puzzle offers no resistance. The narrative relies entirely on curiosity, lacking a "moment of truth" where the protagonist must pay a visible cost to proceed.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.8)
    The conflict is primarily internal and resolved through a symbolic gesture (inserting the pin) rather than escalating interpersonal pressure. The stakes ("clamor of old grudges") are abstract, and the antagonist (Kael) yields too easily to the protagonist's realization, reducing tension.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are theoretical ("grounding vs. flight") rather than visceral, with no external opposition and internal resistance that vanishes instantly ("he didn’t resist it"). The climax lacks tension because the protagonist faces no risk of failure; the magic bends to his will immediately, removing the pressure required for a compelling arc.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stakes are personal and relational, focused on bridging a generational divide. The cost is internal but made visible: the mender swallows their pride ("too proud to ask") and physically binds themselves to a new promise, paying a felt emotional price for understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.2)
    The conflict is primarily a puzzle of comprehension rather than a high-stakes struggle; the threat of the "burning museum" is resolved quickly by the protagonist’s intuition. The solution comes too easily, lacking a moment of genuine peril or sacrifice before the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.1)
    The tension between Elias and the traveler is sharply defined by their opposing goals (acquisition vs. grief) and escalates clearly. The renegotiation beat effectively narrows the outcome to a single, fatal choice that forces the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the stakes (existential erasure) are high, the on-page conflict is low-resistance; the ship "groans" but does not actively impede Liora's progress. The climax resolves through procedural magic rather than a pressured, costly trade-off or decision.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake (understanding vs. experiencing) is clear but primarily intellectual. The escalation is linear and low-pressure; the antagonist is a passive figure, and the final choice to "live" the moment rather than record it feels like a relief rather than a costly trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.7)
    Escalation is present via the cracking ice and the beings' pressure, but the pivot to harmony resolves the external threat with minimal friction. The "cost" is primarily the loss of the caves' history, which charges the final image nicely.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=4.7)
    Escalation is nearly absent; the protagonist attempts the task and succeeds immediately with no external resistance or forced trade-off. The reliance on the stars aligning to resolve the conflict removes agency and deflates tension.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake (understanding identity) is established, but the external pressure is low; the storm pulses but does not force a hard trade-off. The resolution comes relatively easily once the vision appears, lacking a visceral cost on the page beyond a change in mindset.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is virtually no active opposition; the "darkness" and "villagers" provide background noise rather than obstacles that force escalation. Liora succeeds on her first attempt with resources she already possesses, resulting in a flat trajectory with zero stakes testing.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stakes are intimate but palpable, centered on the difficulty of articulating grief. The escalation occurs through silence and the "tangential" pressure of the environment, culminating in the irrevocable gift of the cicada—a clear trade-off that forecloses the chronicler's possession of the object to aid the fisherman.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    Conflict is tightly focused on the child's divergence from the father's fear, escalating naturally as the child's capacity to "sprout" grows. The external pressure of "they are coming" is a bit vague, but the emotional conflict with the father carries the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are low and abstract; there is no active antagonist, obstacle, or moment where the outcome is in doubt. The conflict (grief) is resolved effortlessly by the protagonist’s tools, resulting in a flat trajectory without escalation, deepening pressure, or the possibility of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.5)
    Pressure comes primarily from the ticking clock (sunrise), but opposition is minimal; the environment yields easily to the protagonist's keys. The cost of the final choice is abstract, as the "power" rejected was never truly a temptation.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—suffocation in safety versus the risk of letting go—is clear, and the encroaching shadows provide adequate pressure. However, the escalation is linear and brief; the protagonist faces only one major beat of opposition before the resolution. The cost of "burning bridges" is discussed conceptually but the immediate price of opening the door is mitigated by the magical escape.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.0)
    The conflict is primarily internal—the temptation of the "promise" versus the wisdom of experience—but it is externalized effectively through the text messages and the physical bolt. The escalation is steady, leading to a decisive moment of agency where Lina rejects the "loop" in favor of a tangible exit.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are primarily internal (legacy/failure) and lack urgent external pressure; Elias is alone in a room following instructions. The escalation is mild—he tries the handle, it works; he tunes the mirror, it works. The "cost" is abstract ("fear and grasping") rather than a visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clearly internalized: the struggle between the "siege" memory and the potential for new expression. The pressure escalates effectively through the tightening "threads" and the imperative on the program. The cost is palpable in the "holy fire" pain and the shedding of the "shadows," fulfilling the requirement for a felt price for agency.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes are clear but low-resistance; Elias faces no external opposition and minimal internal hesitation. The discovery of the grandfather’s identity happens instantly via cross-reference, bypassing potential conflict or difficulty. The cost is purely emotional ("hands trembled"), lacking a harder trade-off to push the score higher.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are clear, but the cost of the rebellion is theoretical; we see Lena safe in a diner the next day, minimizing the felt danger. The escalation relies on the phone call's urgency, but the lack of on-page confrontation limits the visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—preventing "the hushed" from waking—remains too vague to generate visceral dread. Without defining what the threat actually is or what the world loses if he fails, the conflict feels like an abstract magical exercise.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.4)
    Conflict is minimal; Liora faces no external opposition, and the environment yields to her immediately (monuments melt, branches form ladders). While the final transformation is a cost, the lack of resistance during the climb flattens the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.4)
    Tension evaporates at the pivotal moment; the protagonist laughs because the answer is "absurdly simple," which undercuts the stakes. The conflict is resolved by receiving a magical instruction rather than through a high-pressure choice or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes are clearly defined as a balance between physical survival and the need for understanding, with the risk of "backlash" adding immediate tension. However, the resolution comes somewhat smoothly; the cost is paid in a shift of perspective rather than a visceral sacrifice, making the victory feel slightly intellectual.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are low; the ghost poses no threat and demands only a simple interaction ("Tell me something funny") which Liora supplies immediately. There is no moment where Liora risks failure or pays a significant price to achieve the integration, resulting in low tension.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are clearly defined as a battle for psychic survival and reintegration, with the "interrogator's face" providing a concrete antagonist in the vision. However, the conflict is resolved somewhat abstractly through the realization of a mathematical philosophical truth rather than a hard tactical choice or sacrifice. The tension escalates well at the basin, but the release (breaking the strap) feels slightly more symbolic than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist seeks an object, is offered it immediately by a helpful figure, and accepts it without obstacle or sacrifice. The lack of opposition or a dilemma involving mutually exclusive values flattens the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.6)
    Tension is primarily atmospheric rather than active; Elias faces no true opposition from the environment, the ghosts, or the mechanism. The climax involves a unilateral decision to "unmake" the machine without any escalating obstacles or cost to the protagonist, resulting in a low-pressure resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=4.9)
    Conflict is minimized because the protagonist faces no true opposition; he "didn't resist" and "smiled," removing the tension from the stakes of annihilation. The cost of the rupture is abstract (dissolution/waking) and accepted instantly, lacking the "felt" quality required for higher bands. The pressure remains external and atmospheric rather than forcing a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clear and elevated by the threat of historical erasure. While the antagonist's resistance collapses somewhat quickly, the environmental pressure of the storm compensates to maintain tension.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure escalates effectively as the stone’s passive influence turns into an active demand ("give it back"). The stakes are clearly communicated—his life for the truth—and the binary choice at the climax is forced by the tightening atmospheric and magical pressure within the room.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clearly personal, anchored in grief and the need for answers, and the cost of the final choice (destroying the father's legacy) is visible on the page. The climax, while thematically sound, resolves the tension through passive acceptance of a message rather than a high-pressure tactical decision.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are clear (survival vs. connection), and the pressure of the storm is palpable. The resolution, where nature explicitly validates the protagonist (“The storm roared approval”), lowers the tension through anthropomorphism rather than forcing a harder, more ambiguous trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story lacks significant tension or stakes; the conflict is purely intellectual (curiosity) and encounters no resistance or opposing force. The resolution comes without sacrifice or trade-off, resulting in a low-pressure narrative where the protagonist simply observes and understands.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the stakes (truth vs. erasure) are high, the external pressure collapses quickly; the Historical Revision Board retreats after a single supernatural display, lacking a counter-move. The cost is paid conceptually (the loss of the physical diary), but the lack of sustained struggle flattens the peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clear (oblivion vs. revival), but the narrative lacks active opposition; the bottle "demands" conception, and the alchemist provides it without encountering unexpected resistance or failure states. The tension relies entirely on the outcome of the ritual rather than an escalating struggle during its execution.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    The stakes escalate from archival curiosity to a burden of prophetic knowledge. While the conflict is largely internal, the pressure is coherent, and the cost is legible in his physical reaction (shaking hands) and the weight of the secret.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is distinct and pressure-driven; the vortex’s awakening ("ice shattered upward") forces a decisive reaction that narrows Liora’s options to a single, high-risk gambit. The stakes of erasure are palpable, and the climax requires active agency (the "push") rather than luck. The cost is rendered in physical strain and the terrifying proximity of the void.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are conceptually high (valley safety) but the on-page pressure is managed coolly by a highly competent focalizer. The antagonist is purely environmental (physics/wind), and the resolution comes without a significant sacrifice or trade-off, lowering the dramatic tension of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.4)
    Pressure is nominal; the alarms provide a moment of external threat, but Eli's choice to stay results in immediate reward and healing rather than sacrifice. The universe appears entirely benevolent, removing the friction necessary for high stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.0)
    Pressure accumulates adequately through the ghosts' arrival, but the conflict is resolved too smoothly without visible on-page struggle. The stakes are high (restoration), but the personal cost of opening the box feels abstract and poetic rather than viscerally felt in the moment of action.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.4)
    The stakes are abstract; while Elias is "running out of time," there is no immediate, on-page threat forcing his hand or demanding a sacrifice. The resolution feels like an upgrade to his situation rather than a choice with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are purely aesthetic and lack visceral weight; the "tightening" event is a kite snapping, which resolves the tension rather than complicating it. There is minimal pressure on the protagonist to change or sacrifice anything, resulting in a low-conflict, contemplative vignette.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clearly defined: the survival of Elira's philosophy against the temple's rigidity. The escalation from verbal debate to the physical proof of the sapling's movement is effective. Tomas's final choice to wrap the wire represents a visible, felt cost—he is committing his future to her "heresy."

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clear, balancing professional vindication against personal loss. The final choice forecloses the return path, creating genuine consequence, though the immediate obstacles inside the tower offer little resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story operates as a vignette with low active pressure; the protagonist faces no resistance from the environment, the task, or himself. The ritual is performed without obstruction or escalation, resulting in a flat dramatic arc despite the high thematic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are primarily internal and retrospective; the external journey lacks tangible opposition, as the "watchers" explicitly do not stop him and the wasteland offers no physical threat. The cost of the transition—trading a bleak scrapyard for a magical garden—feels negligible, making the final choice essentially risk-free rather than a hard-won sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.2)
    External pressure is minimal; the station is silent, and the anomaly acts as an invitation rather than a threat. The stakes of staying vs. going are not dramatized with felt cost—Lira leaves because the plot requires it, not because a mounting pressure forces a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.7)
    Pressure dissipates prematurely when the Keeper accepts the trade without struggle. The stakes are high (fixing the sky), but the obstacle is overcome with a single gesture, lacking a tightening of options or true risk.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.5)
    The conflict is primarily atmospheric; the protagonist faces a "lunge" from the shadow but counters with abstract gestures (walking, spelling) that lack visible cost or tactical difficulty. The victory is achieved through a sudden conceptual assertion rather than an escalating exchange of pressure and consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.2)
    The internal stakes (loss of self vs. pain of remembering) are established early and escalate well. However, the external obstacles are minimal; the stone is found easily based on a dream, and the barrier to entry is a single moment of realization rather than sustained pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.5)
    External resistance is virtually absent during the climax; the tapestry yields after a brief resistance, and the girl offers instant acceptance without testing the protagonist's resolve. The cost of his return is "absorbed" by the environment rather than paid through a difficult interpersonal trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are high and the "ticking clock" of the ritual effectively pressurizes the scene. While the opposition (the Elders) remains passive background scenery, the escalation of Liora's actions—from climbing to carving to destroying—creates a satisfying tightening of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are high and immediate, but the tension stalls when the protagonist stops to narrate to the void, turning a survival crisis into a stage play. The final choice to step into the statue is a decisive, earned release of the dominant tension.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (connection vs. loss) is clear, and burning the paintings provides a tangible on-page cost. However, the conflict lacks pressure; Elias surrenders to the cave's pull without meaningful struggle, making the escalation feel smooth but low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is low-voltage; the antagonist presents a potential threat that dissolves immediately upon contact with the magic, offering no sustained resistance. The protagonist succeeds without paying a visible tactical, emotional, or physical price, which lowers the stakes significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.5)
    The conflict is primarily thematic rather than dramatic; the midnight call is established as a cyclical routine rather than a disrupting event. There is no immediate, escalated threat or obstacle in this specific beat that forces Lena to adapt or pay a new cost, making the stakes feel abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.9)
    The pressure of the approaching men forces the stance crystallization effectively, raising the stakes of the foraging activity. While the actual confrontation is summarized ("They believed him") rather than fully dramatized, the tension in the preparation beat is sufficiently high to justify the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.5)
    Pressure is low; the conflict is primarily intellectual curiosity rather than a forced choice with high immediate stakes. The investigation is summarized rather than shown as a struggle against obstacles, reducing the sense of escalation. The cost (the crumbling flower) is present but feels more symbolic than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.5)
    The rising creek creates a tangible "ticking clock" that effectively pressures the protagonist's movement and forces stance crystallization. The final choice between the shop and the sob serves as a meaningful tightening of stakes, forcing a trade-off that redefines his existence.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes are high (soul/identity), but the external pressure is low; the environment yields to the protagonist's "soft command" with minimal resistance. The tension relies almost entirely on the inevitability of the surrender rather than active opposition, which softens the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain abstract and internal; the conflict is a philosophical misunderstanding resolved by an epiphany rather than external pressure. The climax—a jump that results in a safe, laughter-filled landing—lacks tangible risk or felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are existential and clear: the inevitability of the date on the grave versus the desire for agency. The escalation is effective, moving from the internal weight of revision to the external arrival of the younger self, culminating in the irrevocable act of burning the scroll.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=4.0)
    The story lacks a dominant stake or meaningful escalation; the conflict is resolved by a single speech without pushback or complication. The woman's grief serves as a prompt for Elias's monologue rather than a resisting force that tests his capabilities. The "tightening" is nonexistent, as the solution is offered freely and accepted instantly.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are internal and defined, but escalation is minimal; the protagonist succeeds at her ritual on the first try with little resistance. The external pressure (the storm) remains largely atmospheric and does not force a difficult trade-off or tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.7)
    The stakes—reconnecting before an irreversible loss—are established early and drive the scene. While the magic does some of the heavy lifting in "dragging up" the emotions, Elias's initial resistance and final acceptance provide sufficient agency. The cost (the orchard is still lost) is felt and not cheated.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.1)
    The central conflict—human agency versus the "spiral arbitration"—provides adequate pressure. The choice to destroy the last relic of history is a high-stakes decision that feels earned within the story's logic. The tension is largely conceptual, but the escalation leads to a definitive release.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from professional observation to physical danger, culminating in the visceral encounter on the ship's deck. The cost is legible and permanent: the damage to the key and the psychological weight of "letting go." The tension is well-managed through the countdown mechanism, which naturally paces the rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.0)
    Pressure is low throughout; the stakes remain largely abstract and internal. The climax lacks a palpable sense of risk or trade-off, as the protagonist achieves peace without paying a visible price or making a difficult sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes are clear (safety/father's way vs. risk/new way), and the narrative escalates through a failed first attempt that raises the physical cost ("palms stinging"). While the internal tension is high, the external obstacles are somewhat passive; the library yields to her actions without significant resistance until the final threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.0)
    Conflict is largely internal to the caller and mediated through conversation; the stakes feel abstract ("lost souls") and the resolution comes through gentle affirmation rather than a forcing move or escalation that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is minimal; the external environment (tide, twilight) adds atmosphere rather than active opposition. The stakes are abstract (memory vs. time) and do not escalate through a decisive turning point or trade-off; the character succeeds at her goal without a moment of doubt or sacrifice in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (finding the cure) is clear, but the obstacles (broken radio, dehydrated blacksmith) are overcome too easily by Lena's competence. The climax—a revelation that the doctor is a poet—is accepted without resistance, lacking the friction or high-stakes dilemma required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is minimal; the forest "approves" and "watches," offering no meaningful opposition or dilemma to test Elian's resolve. The stakes remain abstract ("uncharted depths of grief") and are resolved without a visible on-page cost or sacrifice. The pacing is meditative, lacking the tightening pressure required to make the final realization feel hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes are intimate and conceptual—making peace with past errors—which fits the length well. While the external pressure is low (a quiet night in an observatory), the internal pressure to correct history is clear, and the reconfiguration of that desire into acceptance represents a meaningful deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.8)
    The conflict is external and abstract (protagonists vs. forgetting), lacking deep personal stakes or difficult choices. The resolution is achieved through competence and intensity (signing faster, lunging forward) rather than a costly trade-off or clever adaptation, limiting tension.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain largely abstract ("saving the world," "the promise") with no concrete immediate threat or antagonist to pressure the protagonist's choice. The climax lacks resistance; Elias simply walks to the pillar, opens it, and burns the book without facing a tangible obstacle or a dilemma that forces a painful trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pressure remains low as the antagonist (the doctors/treatment) is abstract and absent from the scene, offering no active resistance to Lira’s counter-move. The climax lacks a "felt cost"; Lira releases the memories and gains her own back with no sacrifice or painful trade-off, creating a symmetric satisfaction that feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes remain abstract; the protagonist succeeds without visible struggle, sacrifice, or doubt. The resolution offers symmetric satisfaction—he confirms his own bias and goes to sleep—rather than a Paid Price or meaningful change in status.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=3.8)
    Pressure is low; the boy arrives, receives a lesson without resistance, and leaves healed. The conflict is resolved entirely by the external agent (the Guardian) rather than the protagonist's choices, leading to a lack of genuine escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is no on-page cost or sacrifice; the protagonist’s plan works perfectly without modification or loss. The antagonists (council/workmen) are straw men who surrender immediately to a sound, and the final victory is absolute ("the library would remain"), stripping the narrative of genuine tension.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.1)
    The external pressure (shrinking island) works well, but the protagonist faces no active opposition or dilemma; he accepts the call immediately. The lack of hesitation or cost—he discards his humanity without a backward glance—lowers the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    The conflict is internalized but well-externalized through Harkin’s intrusion and the artifact of the tin. The escalation is subtle—silence to conversation to scream—and the stakes of vulnerability are felt, though the "scream" beat borders slightly on the theatrical.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.6)
    Escalation operates through accumulative intensity (the hum rising, the ice cracking) rather than active opposition. The lack of resistance—either from the environment or internal doubt—lowers the stakes; victory feels preordained rather than earned through difficult choice or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is negligible; Liora arrives and immediately understands/reciprocates, and the old woman grants the needed object without an on-page obstacle. The stakes (fear of silence) are stated but not tested by genuine resistance; the narrative glides to a resolution without forcing the protagonist to make a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.9)
    External and internal conflict are minimal; the researchers offer only token resistance, and the environment yields its secrets immediately to Liora's touch. The stakes remain theoretical ("connection") rather than visceral, as failure never feels like a genuine possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.1)
    The stakes of grief and artistic stagnation are clear, and the physical cost of the tattoo ("ink bleed into her skin") grounds the internal change. The conflict is resolved somewhat easily by the external validation of the found feather, lacking a moment of higher resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.7)
    The conflict is primarily intellectual and thematic—the struggle to map chaos—rather than visceral. While the visitor’s revelation about her brother provides a necessary emotional anchor and tightening of focus, the stakes remain somewhat abstract, centered on understanding rather than immediate consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.3)
    Escalation is negligible; the protagonist enters with the solution and executes it without facing new obstacles, adapting tactics, or paying a visible on-page price. The antagonist (the archive's temptation) is mentioned but never exerts pressure that forces a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.6)
    The stakes are clear—an unbound entity needs a vessel—but the conflict suffers from a lack of opposition. The curator's lie is discovered and discarded in a single beat, and Liora encounters no significant obstacle to her goal; she simply realizes what must be done and does it. The cost is paid, but without a struggle or a "no" moment, the escalation feels smooth rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.0)
    Internal stakes are clear, but the present-moment conflict is low pressure; the heavy lifting (confronting the apothecary, writing to victims) is summarized as part of the "layers" rather than dramatized in the workshop scene. The climax is a quiet realization rather than a forced choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulation of pressure—from the pulsing scar to the whispering plants—creates a coherent rising action under the Accumulative lens. The resolution achieves a meaningful "Earned Stasis" where Liora accepts the ache, though the external conflict remains somewhat static until the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are clearly defined but remain low-pressure; the obstacles are largely passive (mislabeled reels, hidden words) and yield easily to Elara’s abilities. The pivot where the projector fails to show the words provides a necessary tightening, but the conflict lacks visceral cost or opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is a near-total absence of conflict; the archway yields its power without opposition, and the protagonist succeeds on her first attempt. The stakes ("trapped creativity") are declared but never tested, as the magic system solves the problem automatically without demanding a sacrifice or tactical pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are declared ("if the white king fell") but remain abstract; the protagonist faces no active opposition or difficult trade-off. The resolution feels inevitable rather than hard-won, as the cost of "carrying" the spark is thematic rather than a visceral price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes remain purely philosophical and abstract; the conflict is a lack of insight that dissolves without tangible opposition. The cost—leaving the gear—is symbolic, but the lack of external pressure or genuine risk makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.8)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist meets no resistance from the environment or the other character, who welcomes her immediately. The stakes are clear, but the lack of obstacles makes the "earned" stasis feel somewhat given rather than won.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.0)
    Tension escalates cleanly from the initial discovery to the shattering teacup, creating coherent pressure. The stakes—safety versus truth—are felt physically by the protagonist, making the final choice weighty and significant.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are high and clearly defined, with the threat of the "drift" providing consistent pressure. The escalation is driven by the accelerating messages. However, the resolution of the external conflict—the pretender's relief—while thematically poignant, dissipates the tension rather than heightening it in the final beat, rendering the antagonism passive.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation is coherent, moving logically from instrument anomalies to the physical manifestation of the road. The stakes—validating a hidden reality versus adhering to safety protocols—are clear, and the final cost is visibly paid as Lena abandons the "moored" world for the uncertain path.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.5)
    Escalation is external and magical; the pressure is relieved by the stones awakening rather than by the protagonist forcing a trade-off. There is no genuine conflict or cost paid to achieve the reignition, resulting in low narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are declared but not stress-tested; the antagonist's resistance collapses immediately upon witnessing the miracle. The resolution lacks a necessary sacrifice or difficult choice, offering a "win-win" outcome that deflates the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    The conflict is largely internal but effectively externalized by the intrusion of the tour group, which pressures Lena’s "freeze." The escalation—from holding the photo to the child misidentifying it as a bird—forces a recontextualization of her grief without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.0)
    External pressure (walls closing in) is clear, but the protagonist's agency faces no resistance during the climax; the box is fixed via summary, untethering the resolution from struggle. The stakes remain high-concept rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.5)
    Tension is well-maintained through the frozen environment and the ticking clock of the fading trails. The confrontation shifts quickly from physical threat to intellectual realization, which slightly lowers the pressure at the climax. The stakes transition from stopping a crime to understanding a mystery, which works but softens the final cost.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are immediate and the cost is paid in full on the page. The escalation from the letter's receipt to the final confrontation is coherent, though the antagonist's arrival is somewhat stock. The sacrifice is a genuine foreclosure of future options.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    While the stakes are existential, the immediate pressure is dampened by the protagonist's Zen-like competence and the physical barrier of the dome. The external threat feels somewhat remote, making the cost of staying read as theoretical rather than viscerally paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes are clearly signaled: the "edge of meaning" vs. the personal grief. The escalation—from restless soil to the confrontation with the mimic-mouth—is tight and coherent. The cost is paid in the currency of the story: silence and isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.0)
    While the stakes are established by the journalist's challenge, the tension evaporates instantly when the solution is handed to the protagonist without struggle. There is no escalation of pressure or necessary trade-off to acquire the truth.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes escalate effectively; the machine’s refusal to obey—cracking the amber and speaking back—raises the cost of Elara’s avoidance. The shift from a technical problem (silencing a sound) to an existential one (paying a debt) is well-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes of erasure versus memory are established early and escalate clearly. However, the opposition (the elders) remains abstract, and the "cost" of his rebellion is not felt viscerally on the page; his victory feels somewhat easy.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake (life vs. death/oblivion) is established, but the escalation is truncated. The conflict resolves almost instantly upon the Commander's arrival; the "blade wavered" moment occurs too early, dissolving tension before it can peak or force a difficult trade-off for Elias.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are nominally high (life vs. death), but the conflict lacks genuine opposition; Elias accepts the vision and abandons his plan without a beat of doubt or resistance. The resolution feels unearned because the protagonist faces no significant obstacle or cost to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.2)
    Escalation is present but low-friction; the government's narrative is dismissed instantly, and the "danger" of the object is reframed as a benefit without testing or struggle. The stakes—finding a lost love—are high in concept but low in on-page tension, as the solution presents itself without requiring a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.5)
    Pressure is low throughout; the "stasis councils" are a distant, abstract antagonist, and the cave's physical threats (unstable walls) never materialize to force a difficult choice. The climax involves a connection that is immediately successful ("The cave answered"), lacking the tension of a potential failure or a price paid for the magic.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes are established early (cliffs collapsing), but the resolution lacks a felt price. Elias claims "We do [break]," yet he survives the night unscathed to resume his work, rendering the sacrifice philosophical rather than actual. The conflict dissolves through realization rather than a forced trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are clearly defined: the safety of anonymity versus the cost of redemption. The arrival of the ally applies coherent pressure, forcing a stance crystallization. While the ally functions largely as a prompt, the pressure he exerts is sufficient to force Lena's hand, and the cost (abandoning her "armor") is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear and the environmental pressure provides adequate tension. The escalation is linear (counting heartbeats), but the resolution feels slightly convenient, lacking a moment where the coachman’s specific agency forces a difficult trade-off beyond mere patience.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=2.8)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the protagonist faces no antagonist, time pressure, or resource scarcity that forces a trade-off. The "thinning time" is an abstract background condition that never tightens options or compels a costly decision on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.9)
    The conflict is quiet and situational, centered on the struggle to nurture life in a hostile environment. While the external pressure is low, Elias’s intervention effectively deepens the emotional stakes, transforming the scene from maintenance to connection without forced drama.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.1)
    The pressure accumulates well via the "hum" and the bird's aggression, but the climax hinges on the sudden appearance of the explanatory book rather than a high-stakes decision by Lior. The resolution feels conceptually tidy but lacks a visceral on-page cost or sacrifice for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.3)
    Pressure is minimal; the environment and secondary characters (the artist, the monk) are welcoming and facilitate Liora's goal without resistance. The stakes remain abstract ("rejoining secrets") and the cost of release is aesthetic rather than deeply felt or difficult, resulting in a linear progression without meaningful escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are clear and high—sanity and campus unity versus alien manipulation. The escalation is effective, particularly when the signal "laughs" and forces a tactical adjustment, though the personal cost to Liora remains largely hypothetical (career risk) rather than immediately felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clearly established (survival vs. the key), and the "spatial mutiny" provides excellent external pressure. However, the climactic confrontation is brief; the compass's threat is introduced and neutralized in the span of two paragraphs, making the victory feel slightly efficient despite the high conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—resolving the "old guilt"—escalates clearly through the ritual. The external conflict is resolved by a static constraint (the "untouchable" mayor's son), which forces a poignant internal trade-off (witness vs. justice), providing a felt cost at the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake of vindication versus survival is signaled early and escalates logically as the pressure drops. The cost is felt in the physical danger and the destruction of the unique artifact, fulfilling the requirement for a visible price. The tension holds steady, though the antagonist (Liora/The Storm) is primarily reactive.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no external opposition and the environment actively aids his goal. The escalation is purely procedural (look, realize, play, enter) rather than dramatic, lacking a moment of doubt or a "No" that must be overcome.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.5)
    Conflict is primarily internal and reflective, lacking urgent obstacles or immediate pressure to force choices. While the "lion's cage" moment offers a deepening of understanding, the stakes remain abstract, and the "dissuade" action is relegated to backstory rather than driving a present-tense turn.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.0)
    Pressure is low and abstract; the conflict is resolved by a magical voice offering the answer without demanding a difficult trade-off from the protagonist. The cost—"tasting dried petals"—is purely symbolic and does not represent a significant forfeiture or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake (truth vs. peace) is signaled early and escalates cleanly as the plant forces the lake's confession. The cost of the revelation is palpable on the page—the "weight of knowing" physically presses Eldrin down. The climax resolves the central question while complicating the emotional landscape, satisfying the requirement for meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.5)
    Pressure is environmental and navigational, lacking an active antagonist or a deepening of stakes beyond the initial premise. The "cost" of the magic (pain from scars) functions more as a key-turn mechanic than a price that forces a difficult trade-off or alters the protagonist’s resources in a felt way.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.7)
    Pressure escalates cleanly from Veyra's warning to the physical and conceptual pain of the ritual. The cost is not merely physical pain but a significant, irreversible loss of memory, which meaningfully reweights the protagonist's future options.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake (self-worth/purpose) is clear, but the external pressure is low, limited to a passive appraisal task. The resolution comes from internal reflection triggered by the object rather than an escalating conflict or a costly trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are clearly internal (grief) and intellectual (translation), escalating through the physical exertion of the climb. The conflict is resolved through competence and surrender; while effective, the external opposition is relatively low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure is coherent under the Situational lens; the "flipping" of the moon phase introduces immediate physical stakes ("ribs ached") that escalate the difficulty of the task. While the external conflict is low—the transaction is cooperative—the conceptual stakes regarding the preservation of "tomorrow" are well-managed and resolved with a tangible output (the spoon/light).

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is minimal; the environment welcomes the protagonist ("stone grew warm"), and the antagonist is relegated to a silenced radio. The central choice—to accept the pearl—is presented as inevitable rather than difficult, lacking a "meaningful tightening" of options or a visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.3)
    The internal pressure regarding the sister and the medication withdrawal drives the narrative momentum effectively. While the external opposition is largely static (terrain/ruin), the psychological stakes of the journey to the bridge escalate appropriately, culminating in a clear confrontation with the past.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are clearly defined: the risk of losing the words versus the cost of unraveling time. The escalation works well, with the watch physically threatening the protagonist's existence. The resolution trades the magical "easy" fix for the difficult emotional labor of writing the letter.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are clearly signaled early (freedom vs. preservation) and escalate through the interaction with the object and the environment. The resolution forces a trade-off that incurs a permanent social and financial cost ("thief, fraud"), satisfying the requirement for felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.5)
    Conflict is internal and thematic, lacking significant external pressure or active opposition. The stakes—retrieving a memory—are clear, but the process is frictionless; Liora uses the chip and immediately succeeds. The cost (the spent chip) is paid, but the absence of a moment of doubt or difficulty limits the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.7)
    The stakes are internal and profound—the struggle between hollow forgiveness and true contentment. The pressure escalates through the dialogue with the grotto, forcing Maren to articulate exactly what she is willing to risk. The resolution feels earned, paying off the tension established by the arsonist's backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.8)
    Pressure escalates well through the shard's accusations, but the climax lacks friction. Elias unhooks the knots of guilt and they simply "dissolve" or are "gone" without resistance or cost; the victory over his lifelong burden feels mechanically too easy.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes are primarily internal and philosophical, lacking sharp, immediate external pressure to force a harder choice. While the physical risk of the trance (&quot;reversal stuttering&quot;) provides some tension, the &quot;danger&quot; feels managed, and the climax relies on a reflective realization rather than a forced, costly trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.2)
    Escalation is weak; the antagonist (Hollow Maw) is introduced and defeated without a genuine skirmish or complication. The protagonist faces no difficult trade-offs; he simply executes a pre-learned ritual and succeeds perfectly. The lack of a felt cost or a moment of doubt flattens the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central conflict between automated perfection and messy authenticity is legible and drives the plot. The stakes are personal and thematic rather than physically immediate; while the climb is called treacherous, the physical toll is less felt than the ideological one. The climax successfully crystallizes Marlin's stance against the institution.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.3)
    The internal stakes (obsession) are well-established, but the external conflict is relatively low-pressure; the "antagonist" is merely a lock and a benign instructional figure. The escalation relies on a magical threshold crossing rather than rising difficulty or cost, though the final choice to use the tinderbox provides a necessary beat of agency.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.1)
    The stakes are appropriately high (existence vs. oblivion), and the pressure of the dying universe is felt. However, the escalation is linear and procedural; Liora faces no active opposition or agonizing trade-off, making her success feel like the completion of a ritual rather than a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are high for the world (release of monsters), but the protagonist faces minimal opposition; the atlas's warning is easily ignored, and his internal "regret" is dismissed via exposition. While the pressure of the ritual accumulates well, the lack of a difficult choice or active antagonist limits the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is largely abstract; the antagonist is a silent "imbalance" that yields to the protagonist's first real attempt. There is no escalation of risk—no threat of the viaduct collapsing or the bell shattering—resulting in low tension. The stakes are global but the immediate on-page cost is negligible.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.2)
    The conflict remains largely static; Elias wrestles with memory, but no active opposition or time pressure forces the decision *tonight*. While the burning of the photographs offers a visible cost, the stakes remain abstract and the resolution feels inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.5)
    Tension is low as the protagonist faces no external opposition and the internal cost is accepted without struggle. The stakes remain abstract and philosophical ("reason vs. wonder") rather than visceral; success feels guaranteed from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are declared abstractly ("save lives or doom them") but lack immediate, on-page pressure; the jump, landing, and delivery proceed without error or significant resistance. The environment complicates the mood but not the outcome or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are high and the "custody hearing" creates effective time pressure. The conflict escalates well, but the physical resolution (a simple bloodletting) feels disproportionately easy compared to the buildup, lacking a grittier trade-off or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.0)
    The shift in stakes from commercial success to communal witnessing is clear, but the cost of this transition is stated rather than felt. The closure of the business is a major life event treated as a minor detail, lowering the visceral pressure of the choice. The conflict remains largely philosophical, lacking immediate on-page obstacles or sacrifices.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are clearly defined as the battle against household grief. The escalation works through the ritual's intensity, but the resolution comes from external luck (the machine dying) rather than the protagonist actively overcoming the antagonist, making the victory feel slightly unearned by agency.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    The stakes (preservation vs. release) are clear and escalate effectively as the books start "shouting." The tension culminates in the choice to return the pendant, which functions as a decisive key. The cost is high—the end of the known world—and directly results from Lyssa's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.0)
    Pressure escalates well during the central experiment, but the external conflict dissipates instantly when the guild flees, undercutting the established threat. The protagonist’s victory is absolute, missing the opportunity for a complex trade-off or sacrifice that would heighten the dramatic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes are largely intellectual and abstract—hearing the universe—which limits visceral tension until the dish shatters. The climax pivots well on the destruction of the tool, but the cost of the final jump is metaphysical, distancing the reader from the physical peril.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the external stakes (route collapse) are established, the lack of personal sacrifice or a difficult trade-off for Lira makes the escalation feel mechanical; the victory is earned through established skill rather than paid-for effort.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    While the internal pressure of the artistic act is felt, the external conflict is muted. Elias's immediate dismissal of the antagonist ("Let them") deflates the stakes of the "dismantling." The tension relies heavily on atmospheric anticipation rather than a hard, narrowing choice or a desperate trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.4)
    Conflict remains abstract and low-stakes; the opposition (the "Elders") is distant, and Kael’s skepticism is dismantled with a single explanation. The protagonist faces no difficult tradeoffs or genuine risk of failure in the scene, resulting in a trajectory that feels more like a demonstration than a struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.5)
    Pressure is atmospheric rather than urgent; the "mist" implies a threat but does not force a hard trade-off or active defense. The protagonist faces no significant opposition, resolving the conflict by simply walking forward and touching an object.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.8)
    The tide provides a clear ticking clock, and the discovery of the junction box raises the stakes. However, the climax lacks a visceral price paid on the page; Elias escapes the "crushing dark" with a drop of water and a poetic realization, but the physical or emotional cost of the "unraveling" remains theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clearly established as existential (identity vs. erasure) and escalate well through the voice's interrogation. The resolution relies slightly more on the entity's offer than the protagonist's active struggle to force the outcome, softening the climax tension.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are clear (revival vs. destruction), but the escalation is linear and rapid; the shift from success to doom happens without a complicated middle beat to test Veyra's adaptation. The conflict resolves through total consumption, a decisive but standard "hubris punished" outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    The escalation from research to physical consumption by the garden is coherent and tense. The return of the missing provides necessary external pressure that forces Elias's final choice, ensuring the climax is reactive rather than passive.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.1)
    Stakes are theoretically high (world restoration) but functionally low because the opposition is passive; the statues turn and grind gears but offer no active counter-pressure or threat. The resolution is unearned by struggle or sacrifice, resulting in a climax that feels inevitable rather than achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.7)
    Physical stakes are established early with the drone threat but evaporate at the climax when the protagonist bypasses danger through thematic assertion ("Some borders weren't meant to hold") rather than earned agency. This undermines the tension built in the opening beats.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are low and purely internal; there is minimal resistance to Lior's journey, as the train and woman essentially invite him in. The "cost" of the interaction is abstract, making the climax feel more like a ceremonial pageant than a pressured test of character.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.0)
    Conflict is largely static; Elias faces no antagonist or significant obstacle preventing the ritual. The escalation is atmospheric ("air thickened") rather than a tightening of options or rising stakes. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.0)
    The stakes are largely abstract ("ghosts of ink," "runaway dream"). While the tension of the dream fading provides some pressure, the final trade-off lacks a tangible cost. The protagonist gets to keep the photo and have the experience, bypassing the potential sacrifice hinted at by the dream's plea.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.9)
    One dominant stake is established (opening the hair), but the external pressure evaporates the moment the locksmith asserts her interpretation, as the man simply vanishes. This lack of pushback or negotiated outcome reduces the felt stakes; the conflict functions more as a setup for a thematic statement than a test of agency with tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes escalate effectively from a cosmic anomaly to a violation of the self, creating strong pressure. The climax delivers a clear meaningful deepening as Elias rejects the trade. However, the antagonist’s dialogue ("You always did ask too many questions") relies on a cliché that slightly deflates the tension of the final confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.5)
    The external threat is established quickly, but the escalation is dampened by Elspeth's overwhelming competence; the shadow is "yanked back by the geometry" before Kael even acts, lowering the felt stakes of his intervention. While the thematic cost ("smudged with something older") is present, the brevity prevents the pressure from building to a visceral peak before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are immediately clear—the child's fading existence—and the climax forces a distinct choice (giving rather than taking). While the "veil resisting" provides some opposition, the antagonist force feels mild, and the final price paid by Elias is somewhat abstract, lacking the immediate, escalating pressure of a tighter conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation is managed well through the physical progress of unraveling and the encroaching sensory pressure of the spirits. The final hesitation at the "knot swollen with seawater" provides a clear, earned moment of agency before the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes are intellectual rather than urgent; the pressure remains low throughout as there is no opposing force, ticking clock, or risk of failure. The escalation comes from realizing a solution to a puzzle, but without a sense of "tightening" options or forced trade-offs, the narrative lacks dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clearly established: the historical weight of the Electra versus the metaphysical danger of the threshold. The pressure escalates naturally through the snow globe's anomaly, forcing a trade-off between professional integrity and protective secrecy. The cost is felt in the "shadow left behind" and the burden of the lie.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clearly defined: the danger of the "unspoken" manifesting as a hungry entity. The escalation is rapid but coherent, moving from communication to a threat of possession. The cost is felt in the "raw throat" and the weight of the enforced silence, adhering to the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes remain abstract and internal ("joy vs. anguish") without immediate physical or relational cost. The escalation is linear, and the resolution comes from external coincidence (sunlight) rather than a pressure-driven protagonist choice.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.0)
    Tension evaporates the moment Elias decides he is "untethered but not afraid," effectively removing the stakes of the fall immediately after the inciting incident. There is no escalation or tightening of options; the narrative is a straight line from the string snapping to a magical rescue, lacking a moment of genuine doubt or conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure is coherent and escalates from the puzzle of the safe to the race against the demolition crew. The climax forces a tangible loss—the collapse of the ceiling—which acts as the necessary cost to buy the protagonist’s final epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=3.9)
    Pressure evaporates immediately upon confrontation; the Captain's skepticism is a token obstacle that requires no sacrifice, trade-off, or ingenuity to overcome. The dominant stake (survival) is declared but never tested by escalating complications.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.1)
    Escalation is present—from placing gears to confronting the memory-manifestation—but the obstacles yield too easily. The gear "relented" after a whisper, and the water "didn't resist," which lowers the immediate physical stakes despite the high conceptual stakes. The cost is stated ("time's absence") but the lack of resistance in the climax makes the victory feel slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent on the page; obstacles like the war-torn soil are mentioned as backstory but offer no active resistance. Liora faces no difficult trade-offs or moments of doubt, resulting in a linear progression lacking genuine narrative tension or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.9)
    The stakes are high (cosmic preservation), and the cost of the protagonist's choice—his own purpose and "thread in the tapestry"—is legible. However, the conflict is resolved somewhat easily; the opposition (the weight of the clock) dissolves instantly upon the introduction of the key object, lacking a moment of high-pressure resistance or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.5)
    Active tension is low because the life-or-death crisis (the girl's escape) is already resolved or unfolding remotely ("somewhere below") without Liora's direct participation in the present moment. The stakes are recalled rather than faced on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes are internal but clearly defined—the cost of releasing the physical remnant of his sister is felt on the page. The escalation moves from observation to analysis to action, though the external pressure is minimal. The release of the chrysalis functions as a meaningful foreclosure of his previous method of coping.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the patron's hunger is stated but never tests Liora's capacity or forces a trade-off. Without obstacles, resistance, or a risk of failure, the narrative lacks meaningful escalation, rendering the climax ("Then—there") a procedural beat rather than a dramatic turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.0)
    Conflict is the story's weakest element; there is no active opposition or escalation in the scene. Elias faces no risk of failure at the pavilion, and the "cost" of the transaction is backstory rather than a price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.2)
    Escalation is minimal; Liora meets Elias, hands him the weight/cards, and he accepts the solution with only a single line of mild accusation. There is no sustained pressure, back-and-forth negotiation, or risk of failure; the "thirty years of grudges" offers no on-page structural resistance to the protagonist's plan. The stakes are declared high but resolved with low-effort conceptual moves.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are primarily internal but escalate clearly as the visions shift from her own reflection to the memories of others. The pressure builds through sensory intensity. The cost is conceptual—the dissolution of her individual memory into the collective—but it is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes are legible and the time limit (one hour) creates functional pressure. However, the protagonist's climactic agency—the lunge—fails, yet she receives the prize anyway through a disconnected action in the falling action, which undercuts the tension of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes are clear but relatively low-pressure, centering on an aesthetic and internal goal. While the physical toll (numb fingers, heat) provides some friction, the external pressure is minimal, making the escalation feel gentle rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are described as "invisible," which unfortunately renders the tension abstract and low-pressure. The conflict is purely philosophical; there is no visible cost to refusing the game, and the resolution brings no tangible loss or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.2)
    The external pressure (fireworks/time) is present but low-stakes; the conflict is primarily internal and intellectual. The ease with which the device solves the physical problem (the lock) lowers the immediate narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes escalate with the bloom and the Elders' arrival, but the conflict evaporates instantly in the climax without resistance. Liora pays no price for her transgression, and the lack of a trade-off or penalty flattens the dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the time pressure of the inversion provides external tension, the stakes lack emotional weight; the protagonist faces no difficult trade-offs. The potential "cost" of the moss infection is immediately framed as an empowering gift, negating any sense of sacrifice or loss essential for high-stakes conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.1)
    Escalation is distinct and pressure-driven; the shift from observation to survival is triggered by the concrete discovery of bone. The use of the flare allows Veyra to exercise agency and gain knowledge (the leaning stacks) even as she retreats.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.0)
    The stakes are high conceptually (silence vs. wonder) but low dramatically, as the antagonist (the elders) is off-screen and the magic works instantly without backfire. The conflict feels like a performance of a foregone conclusion rather than a high-pressure struggle with genuine risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—the fraying weave between worlds—is clear, and the cost of abandoning duty is well-defined. The escalation is somewhat soft; the protagonist faces little active resistance before surrendering to the "tide," resulting in a linear progression lacking gritty setbacks.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    The stakes—understanding the "mathematics of emotion" to halt the vanishing stars—are established early and escalate clearly through the interaction with the press. The conflict between Elias's desire for calculated ambiguity and the halo's demand for raw truth drives the narrative. The climax forces a trade-off: he must abandon his "equations" and method to save the stars, paying the price of his own detached safety.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stakes are ostensibly high (vanishing into the fade), but the immediate danger is mitigated by the woman's intervention, which quickly reframes the threat as a lesson. The conflict lacks a moment where the courier must sacrifice something of genuine value; giving up the pendant feels like a symbolic gesture rather than a costly trade-off. The tension dissolves into reassurance too readily.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are well-defined: the intellectual desire for proof versus the emotional cost of the truth. Pressure escalates coherently from observation to confrontation. The resolution involves a tangible sacrifice—destroying the heirloom—which gives weight to the decision, though the internal "cost" is somewhat summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes are existential (existence vs. connection), and the cost is clearly paid by the spinner's dissolution. However, the escalation is linear and lacks a moment of doubt or struggle; the "pressure" is resolved largely by the discovery of the magical object rather than protagonist ingenuity.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.3)
    Tension is low because the opposition—the planet's instability—surrenders immediately ("with a sigh") to the protagonist's first attempt. There is no escalation of cost or moment of near-failure to test the smith's "slow-burning will."

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=4.5)
    Pressure is briefly signaled by the intercom voice ("You weren't supposed to find that") but vanishes immediately, leaving the protagonist essentially unopposed. The climax lacks a tangible cost; the protagonist gains the goal (the man/the new world) simply by changing her perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes of isolation versus connection are clear, and the decision to let the skiff rot is a meaningful cost. However, the external opposition is minimal; the &quot;ghosts&quot; are immediately benevolent, making the climax feel more like an invitation accepted than a conflict fought.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.9)
    The central conflict is resolved through internal willpower ("steered... with her will") rather than a tangible tactical trade-off or clever use of the established mechanics. While the pressure of the storm is felt, the protagonist's victory feels inevitable and lacks a specific on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.0)
    Conflict is gentle and internal, lacking a counter-force; the "opposition" is merely a lack of understanding that is easily solved by following instructions. The climax is a moment of success rather than a test of character, and while the wing dissolving offers a physical cost, the emotional stakes feel low and safe.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are primarily internal and contemplative; while the "gnawing question" provides a frame, the on-page pressure is low. The storm provides texture but does not force a trade-off, and the protagonist’s emotional burden is resolved with relative ease.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is largely atmospheric; the antagonist is the passive entropy of the "endless night." The escalation is straightforward (singing -> louder singing -> success), lacking a moment where the protagonist's plan truly fails or forces a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.4)
    The central conflict dissolves rather than escalating; the antagonist immediately absolves the protagonist and delivers the thematic lesson, removing the pressure of the confrontation. The stakes feel lowered by this "soft reset" of the interpersonal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.1)
    The conflict is theoretical rather than dramatized; the antagonist (the city's adjustment) yields instantly to Liora's actions without pushback. The guards, the man, and the prince all succumb to the bread immediately, resulting in a linear progression of successes with no moment where the outcome is in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are ostensibly high (survival/love), but the final choice carries no true cost; since the library is already doomed, Elias sacrifices nothing to cross the bridge, making the resolution feel unearned. The external pressure is competent, but the absence of a difficult trade-off flattens the dramatic tension at the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.3)
    Tension is dampened because the antagonist poses no effective threat and is easily outmaneuvered. Lena pays no visible or felt cost in the scene to achieve her goal, making the resolution feel like a victory lap rather than a hard-won triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story lacks sufficient resistance or counter-pressure to generate high stakes. Lira faces no external antagonist and minimal internal conflict; her ascension to "becoming the weather" is a smooth ride up without a visible price paid for the power. The climax reads as a gift from the setting rather than a hard-won transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.2)
    External pressure is minimal; the lock yields to a &quot;memory&quot; without mechanical resistance, and the environment offers no obstacles to the protagonist's goal. The escalation is linear and lacks a moment of genuine doubt or potential failure, resulting in a wish-fulfillment trajectory where the &quot;cost&quot; (leaving the lantern) feels symbolic rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clearly internalized; the physical pain of lying creates immediate, embodied pressure. While the external journey is somewhat linear, the emotional escalation is sharp. The climax shifts from seeking an answer to performing an action (writing), resolving the tension effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are purely abstract and thematic; there is no antagonist, distinct obstacle, or risk of failure to generate narrative pressure. The protagonist faces no difficult trade-off, and the "cost" (shattering the ice) is the intended outcome of a perfectly executed plan, resulting in a static tension curve.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure escalates coherently from the internal glitch to the external magnetic threat, forcing the protagonist’s hand. The decision to burn the farm creates a tangible, irreversible cost, effectively trading safety for the uncertainty of the "untamed" world beyond the airlock.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is virtually absent; there is no antagonist, the crowd is compliant, and Mira faces no internal obstacles or difficult choices. The "pressure" is merely the passage of time and the unfolding of a pre-destined event, resulting in low stakes where the protagonist risks nothing to achieve the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clear (survival vs. secrets), but the conflict is largely internal and philosophical. The external pressure (rising water) arrives late, meaning the primary escalation feels somewhat abstract until the climax. A sharper moment of doubt or external resistance would elevate the score.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clearly established as a trade-off between safety and the truth of the wife's fate. The escalation is palpable when the stone shifts and the scream manifests; the cost is paid in the destruction of his tools and the traumatic confirmation of her state.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.7)
    The stakes are high but abstract ("world unraveling"), lacking a concrete, immediate cost on the page. The climax hinges on a magical accident ("snap") rather than a decisive protagonist choice, softening the impact of the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from curiosity to a blood contract, with the deepening realization that the language is a tool for interrogation, not scholarship. The cost is palpable and paid in full on the page, shifting the protagonist's status permanently.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are high and clearly defined (erasure vs. preservation). The escalation is linear but effective, leading to a confrontation where the protagonist pays a physical price (capture) for a conceptual victory. The opposition (patrol) arrives on cue but serves primarily as a backdrop for her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes high stakes (execution, treason) but deflates them immediately upon the antagonist's entry. Because the Emperor offers no resistance and instantly accepts the protagonist’s worldview, the scene lacks the necessary escalation or "testing" beat. The tension evaporates rather than resolving through a costly choice or decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.3)
    The stakes are clear and personal, centered on Veyra’s need for truth. Escalation occurs through the descent, but the final conflict is resolved somewhat easily—Kaelis is defeated instantly by the singing without a prolonged struggle or trade-off in the moment, though the aftermath carries weight.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation is primarily internal but effective; the pressure builds through the widow's resistance and releases through the visual turn in the snow globe. The "deepening" occurs when Lena moves from observer to participant by revealing her own locket, raising the stakes from professional duty to shared human loss.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.3)
    The stakes are purely conceptual and the conflict is minimal; Liora’s skepticism offers only mild resistance to Kael’s philosophy. While there is a deepening of understanding, the lack of active opposition or significant cost keeps the narrative tension low.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are clear—safety in lies vs. the danger of truth. The pressure escalates well from the initial investigation to the physical push-back of the anomaly. The cost (Elias's humanity/existence) is paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure escalates coherently from the whispering storm to the silhouette, forcing a choice with global stakes (the city rising). The cost is palpable—the destruction or transformation of the "world below"—charging the final image with weight.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes remain low and primarily internal; the conflict regarding the music box is resolved by the child's presence rather than Elias overcoming a significant obstacle. Escalation is minimal, moving swiftly from stasis to a gentle resolution without a moment of high pressure or desperate trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clear and high. The physical cost ("nerves rewriting") is legible, though the result feels more like an ecstatic ascension than a painful trade-off, which slightly softens the impact of the "martyrdom" theme.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dominant stake (vindication) faces no active opposition on the page; the "others" are abstract, off-screen figures who do not pressure the protagonist in the moment. The escalation is purely environmental (the bridge rising) rather than a rising conflict that forces difficult trade-offs or tactical shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are clear and escalate appropriately from professional curiosity to physical survival and historical preservation. The pressure of the water provides a tangible, rising threat. The conflict shifts cleanly from man-vs-environment to man-vs-system, though the "erasure" stake relies heavily on a sudden realization rather than gradual discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.7)
    The stakes are clear (redemption), but the conflict is low-resistance; the "storm" provides only token opposition, and the internal struggle resolves quickly upon the epiphany. The cost—writing the letter—is paid, but the struggle to pay it is minimized.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clear and escalate physically: from theoretical tinkering to a jump that destroys the protagonist’s home (the workshop). The cost is palpable—Pip loses her shelter and damages her body—yet the narrative frame treats this as necessary expense for the "vibration." The tension between the "silent bell" and the "screaming wind" provides a strong opposing force.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are high and clearly communicated; the escalation from investigation to system override to termination flows logically. The final cost—erasure of the self to preserve memory—is a "Decisive Change" that lands with genuine weight, satisfying the pressure built throughout the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are clear (the girl's safety vs. Elias's passive nature), and the pressure escalates internally. While the external threat is pending rather than immediate, the shattering of the mirrors provides a legible, felt cost to the protagonist's choice.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.0)
    While the stakes are high (life vs. death), the escalation is dampened by the ease of the resolution; the conflict dissolves rather than snapping. The external tension of the ice rescue is engaging, but the internal conflict is resolved by the prop's message rather than agentic struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.5)
    Pressure is low and strictly retrospective; the conflict is resolved through abstract intellectualization ("drawing parallels") rather than a forced choice with visible cost. The "mismatch" realization feels like a safe, conceptual conclusion rather than an earned emotional shift under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.5)
    The conflict is thematic but pressurized: the "fraying edges" and the Voice's challenge create a clear clock and opposition. The stakes are raised by the contrast between the Prophet's loud fervor and the necessary, fragile silence Lysan protects.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.4)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the town's grief is a passive background condition rather than an active opposition. The protagonist faces no obstacles, makes no trade-offs, and leaves feeling "lighter," indicating a total lack of on-page cost or escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes are clear but largely intellectual/philosophical ("understand why the world had gone quiet") rather than visceral. The pressure builds adequately through the experiment, but the cost of the final choice—leaving the library—is only lightly felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.3)
    Tension escalates effectively from atmospheric unease to a physical confrontation with the animating sculpture. The stakes shift from a metaphysical search to a concrete choice about letting go, with the cost legible in the destruction of the prophet's tools.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.2)
    The external pressure is coherent and high: the shaking foundations force a choice between fixing and accepting. The cost is clearly paid on the page—Elias abandons his life's work and tools—satisfying the requirement for a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.2)
    Pressure is low; the protagonist encounters minimal opposition, and her expertise works immediately. The stake—a "flawless goodbye"—is achieved without a moment of doubt or a necessary trade-off. The conflict is internal and atmospheric rather than an active escalation of forces.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.5)
    The central conflict (curiosity vs. safety) dissolves immediately upon the automaton's warning. Elara’s lack of hesitation ("Elara didn’t flinch") removes the friction necessary for high stakes; because she treats the catastrophic cost as a benefit ("I won't be alone"), the tension creates no drag or heat on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.9)
    The stakes are established early, but the climax suffers from a lack of resistance. The changeling accepts Liora's bargain ("Turn them into stars") immediately, dissolving the central conflict without a contest of wills or a painful sacrifice. The antagonist functions more as a lock waiting to be turned than an opposing force.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is largely abstract and retrospective; the opposition (fire/villagers) is distant, and the memory of Elias provides context rather than active pressure. The interaction with the child lacks resistance; the girl is an instant convert, removing the potential for a struggle over the philosophy of light.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure is coherent and internal, sharpened by Javier’s arrival which forces Lena to confront the "noise." The conflict escalates quietly but effectively, resolving through a meaningful trade-off (protection vs. resilience) rather than convenient coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.4)
    The stakes are strictly internal and aesthetic until the magical climax, lacking external pressure or consequences beyond the manuscript's completion. While the appearance of the "faceless man" provides a moment of confrontation, the resolution (becoming the current) romanticizes the cost of creation rather than treating it as a genuine trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.2)
    Escalation is monotonic; Mira tries the solution, and it works immediately, with intensity merely increasing rather than options narrowing. The absence of active opposition or the threat of failure makes the stakes feel theoretical rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.1)
    Escalation is mild; the protagonist faces no significant obstacle or resistance on the page. The "enemy" is hurry, which she easily defeats with established competence, and the success of the ritual comes without an unexpected cost or tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.9)
    Pressure is primarily atmospheric ("wounded season ending") rather than acute; the protagonist faces a puzzle rather than a genuine dilemma with opposing costs. The escalation is linear (working faster) without forcing a difficult trade-off or deepening the moral complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure escalates clearly from the resistance of the specific burdens (the child's fear) to the overwhelming weight of the grotto itself. The conflict resolves through internal realignment rather than external victory, fitting the atmospheric tone.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clearly internalized (artistic honesty vs. commercial hollow promises). The confrontation with the girl provides a necessary external pressure, though the cost of the final decision (loss of income vs. peace) remains largely conceptual rather than concretely felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clear—autonomy versus memory—and pressure escalates efficiently from the static photo to the confrontation with the chorus of selves. The climax is driven by a protagonist choice that feels inevitable, though the middle escalation beat (the chorus) is brief.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake (utility vs. ruin) is clear, and the escalation to a "resurrected" terminal works well. The conflict remains low-pressure and largely internal; the lack of significant external resistance or cost makes the resolution feel slightly frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are clearly established as a trade-off between safety/silence and expression/destruction. The pressure escalates cleanly from the internal weight of silence to the external, irreversible act of cracking the crystal, foreclosing the return to safety.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is internal (truth vs. legend), but external pressure is low; the "last broadcast" implies urgency that the character explicitly ignores. The climax is reached through reflection rather than escalating conflict, making the stakes feel abstract until the final action.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes remain abstract; the pressure comes only from atmospheric fog, not a concrete deadline or opposing force. Elias faces no difficult trade-off or risk of failure; the resolution is a smooth ritual enactment rather than a high-stakes choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes remain abstract and low-pressure; there is no immediate consequence for failure or time constraint forcing a difficult trade-off. The conflict is purely internal and resolved without significant external resistance or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are clearly established as a battle between stagnation and renewal. The tension during the hatching is well-managed, escalating from the fragility of the egg to the violent, "lurching" birth. The resolution earns its emotional weight by acknowledging the cost—the bird is ugly and loud, not the pure song he wanted.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain largely abstract; the external crisis (the boy's injury) is resolved instantly without complication or trade-off. There is no moment where Liora's "unyielding compassion" is truly tested against a conflicting desire or obstacle; she acts automatically, which flattens the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.5)
    Escalation is present—the box hums, the door resists, the memory-self objects—but the opposition feels porous. The protagonist overcomes the warning voice with a single thought, making the victory feel slightly unearned. The external cost (chaos in the city) is high, but the personal price is abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes are clear, but the escalation is linear and lacks significant obstacles or reversals. Veyra encounters the cost—a demand for memory—and pays it immediately without an on-page struggle or hesitation that would heighten the tension. The "heresy" mentioned remains an abstract fear rather than an active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—how to memorialize the sister—is clear, but the conflict is resolved primarily by the ghost's external intervention rather than the protagonist's active struggle. The cost is conceptual (accepting the void) rather than an enacted price paid on the page, lowering the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are elevated from a simple mechanical adjustment to a moral intervention, with the "weight" of the names acting as the pivot. The escalation is internal but tangible, leading to a decision that permanently alters the relationship between the town and its time.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clear and escalate cleanly with each knot, moving from sensory unease to a specific, tragic revelation. The climax provides a decisive turn in knowledge ("push her away" vs pulling in), though the precise logic of the "payment for silence" remains slightly opaque, creating a minor stumble in the clarity of the backstory's resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain abstract and theoretical. The only moment of escalation—a heartbeat of fear that she "overstepped"—is immediately resolved by the environment validating her. Without an antagonist or a live possibility of failure that carries consequence, the tension flatlines.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.3)
    The stakes are high—cultural erasure and life—but the antagonist (the Ministry) remains an abstract, off-stage threat until the epilogue. The inciting incident and climax occur in close proximity with little escalating pressure in between; the decision to let Lira in is tender but lacks a sense of perilous trade-off in the moment, making the cost feel inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.8)
    The conflict is primarily intellectual—the struggle between clarity and mystery—which is suitable for this length but lacks visceral stakes beyond the aesthetic. The moment of burning the portrait because she "understood him too well" provides a functional micro-turn, though the consequences remain low-voltage.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are existential and clearly defined, escalating from the preservation of an object to the preservation of truth via self-sacrifice. The external pressure (Veyra, the pumps) forces a decisive stance crystallization that narrows options to a single, fatal point of agency.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stakes are communal and emotional, elevated by the "bullet-scarred folder" which implies a backdrop of civil strife. However, the central conflict (the arguments that broke the choir) is summarized in backstory rather than dramatized in the present, which lowers the immediate on-page pressure. The resolution—a shift in tactics from song to presence—successfully addresses the stakes of survival.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.5)
    External opposition (critics, elders) is abstract and summarized rather than faced on the page. The stakes feel low because the magical fruit resolves the tension instantly; the "rebellion" is gentle to the point of lacking friction or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are thematic rather than urgent; with no antagonist and only mild internal hesitation, the climax lacks pressure. Elias gives up the seed willingly, making the resolution feel inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is abstract and low-pressure, lacking an antagonist or urgent constraint to force a difficult choice. The "tightening" is atmospheric rather than causal; the resolution feels inevitable and smooth rather than earned through struggle or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are immediate and high—the survival of a "god/child" versus the old world's fear. The escalation is linear, driven by Liora's dismantling of the intruder's "structural weakness." While the cost is severe and legible (the human removing their helmet to "breathe" water), the lack of active counter-moves from the intruder makes the conflict feel slightly one-sided.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clear and escalate naturally from abstract understanding to a concrete binary choice at the door. The cost is palpable—she sacrifices the "smooth" resolution and the return to her old life (the café) to maintain the integrity of her "grim" pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.8)
    Conflict is largely internal and low-pressure; the "forty-three nights" setup implies mortal danger, but the character experiences no functional impairment or difficult choice. The resolution (painting the laughter leads to sleep) feels inevitable rather than earned through a high-cost decision.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.2)
    The stakes (cultural extinction/starvation) are declared but resolved too easily by the magical climax, removing genuine pressure. The cost of the resolution—losing the lens—is immediately negated by the "golden," perfect outcome, making the sacrifice feel trivial. The conflict dissolves into a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where every problem is fixed simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure escalates cleanly from the physical puzzle to the metaphysical threshold, driven by the protagonist's agency. The stakes—binding fate vs. unmaking it—are made concrete through the mechanism, though the opposition is largely abstract ("fate") rather than proximate.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.2)
    The antagonist offers minimal resistance, crumbling after a single lunge and a brief exchange of dialogue. The conflict lacks a meaningful escalation or tactical back-and-forth, resulting in a climax that feels rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are clearly articulated through the physical risk to the fragile raft and the memory of past failures. The escalation from visual cloud shifts to auditory sea responses provides a solid pressure gradient. While the resolution comes somewhat swiftly via the "gift" of the blue hour, the tension of the final strike ("orchard's heart") carries sufficient weight.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.8)
    Escalation is present but lacks resistance; the protagonist's attempts succeed immediately without complication or "try-fail" cycles. The reversal—where the watchers turn from ominous to welcoming—dissipates tension too smoothly, making the final cost of leaving the city feel negligible.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.1)
    The stakes are high and clear, but the antagonist's threat dissipates too easily when Elias simply steps back into the shadows. The confrontation relies heavily on dialogue rather than escalating physical or tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are primarily internal and atmospheric, fitting the accumulative drive lens. While there is no acute external antagonist, the pressure of time (the drawbridge) and the emotional weight of the "conversation" provide sufficient tension. The cost is felt in the "years he’d never live to see" and the trading of the heirloom inkwell.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are theoretical rather than felt; the protagonist faces no active opposition or time-critical threat despite the mention of the blackout ending. He succeeds at every action (decoding, unlocking, finding) on the first try, resulting in a flat escalation curve lacking genuine friction.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.3)
    The stakes are high and legible: the preservation of memory against the annihilation of the mist. Pressure escalates effectively from the detached shadow to the physical intrusion of the magic upon the protagonist's body. The cost is palpable and permanent, as she must sacrifice her physical form to join the recording.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are immediate and layered, balancing the physical danger of the collapsing field with the profound emotional weight of the "unmade past." The climax is driven entirely by Lena's refusal to heed warnings, resulting in a decisive, non-trivial internal victory.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake (connection/unlocking the mystery) faces minimal opposition; the physical struggle is resolved in a single sentence without genuine peril or cost. The potential for escalation—theft, confrontation, failure—is bypassed in favor of immediate cooperation. Pressure does not accumulate; it is introduced and then dismissed.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes (truth vs. peace of mind) are clear and pressure builds effectively through the scene. The escalation is largely internal until the external intervention (the note), which creates a shift in agency. The cost is felt in the disposal of the watch hand—a renunciation of his penance object.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes are declared but the tension dissolves too easily via the sentimental prop; the negotiation lacks the grit of a genuine stalemate. The cost (giving up the father's drawer pull) is symbolic but the emotional weight is asserted rather than felt through resistance or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are clearly internalized; the cost of "staying" is the emotional weight of his past, which is made legible through the counting of the poles. The pressure builds coherently to the decision to abandon the launch.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.9)
    The stakes are clear and high: Liam’s soul and memory are on the line. The pressure escalates from the clinic’s lingering sting to the confrontation at the lake. The cost is paid on the page through the loss of the baseball—his only anchor to a potential escape—making the final resolution felt.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    The stakes are clear and escalate appropriately: the first failure with vanilla raises the cost, leading to the more desperate use of nutmeg. The conflict is both internal (grief vs. acceptance) and external (resurrection vs. nature), culminating in a climax that forces Liora to abandon her original goal for a transformative necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clearly internal (grief) and externalized through the unique magical practice. The "cost" is legible—the shattering of the heirloom saucer and the surrender of the brother's memory as a living absence. The escalation from tracing the crack to the apparition is smooth, though the conflict is resolved somewhat quietly via the brother's instruction rather than Liora's active struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are existential and clear. The escalation is linear but effective, marked by the snapping thread and the failing ship. The cost is felt in the "unraveling" of Lien's reality and identity, though the "other side" functions more as a reward than a complicated trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are purely philosophical; the protagonist’s "destitution" is dismissed as irrelevant, and the sacrifice of the bugs is painless, removing tension. There is no meaningful antagonist or obstacle; the "prophecy" mechanic removes the burden of difficult decision-making. The cost of the transformation is symbolic rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are declared (revolution) but the on-page pressure is low; the protagonist bypasses obstacles ("The lock surrendered") without a significant snag or reversal to test his commitment. The threat of "one wrong twist" is stated but never materialized into a concrete complication, resulting in a linear procedural rather than an escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes are effectively raised through the rising water and the unraveling reflection, creating a clear sense of urgency. However, the resolution relies on a sudden, instruction-based turn rather than a choice forced solely by the accumulated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.0)
    The internal stakes are well-defined: the tension between preserving the pain (the poem) and releasing it. The climax—tearing the poem—is a decisive action that resolves this tension with a legible emotional cost (losing the "map"). The pressure of the storm effectively externalizes the internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.5)
    The escalation from waiting to dueling to collaborating is coherent, but the stakes feel relatively low—more of an intellectual game than a crisis with visceral cost. The transition to partnership removes the conflict rather than resolving it through pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central stake (stay vs. flee) is established, but the escalation is low-pressure; the threat of the guards remains abstract and distant. The resolution feels inevitable rather than fought for, as the "itch" quiets without a significant on-page struggle or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.0)
    Escalation is present via the dying projector bulb and encroaching night, creating effective external pressure. However, the conflict is resolved too neatly by the magic mechanism, lacking a deep test of the protagonist's resolve or a moment of genuine doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.3)
    The monsoon provides effective ticking-clock pressure, and the stakes of memory loss are demonstrated clearly through the secondary character. The climax works, though the protagonist's gain of power/status somewhat dilutes the tragedy of the intended cost (estrangement).

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.0)
    While the stakes of grief are legible, the conflict is resolved with low pressure; the compass instructions "diffuse" the weight almost automatically once followed. The escalation is textural—colors changing, needle swaying—rather than a causal tightening that forces Elias to make a sacrificial trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can the scientist trade control for witness—signals early and tightens once: the dust does not resurrect, it reveals, foreclosing the grant-performance path. Escalation is accumulative: each return to the greenhouse adds pattern density until the option to “fix” anything is gone. Visible price: the emptied vial and the departmental confusion certify the forfeit. A sharper external obstacle (a single line of funding-threat or colleague confrontation) would have nudged this into the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—what to do with damning knowledge—arrives with the ledger on page 1. Pressure tightens when she locates the entry “pay in silver or the girl,” forcing the choose-what-to-follow decision. The meaningful turn is the release: it forecloses revenge/justice and chooses self-authored path. Cost is legible: she sacrifices both evidence and the hope her brother can be innocent.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—make silence yield—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is textural: frost thickens → keys stay mute → heat-map burns → glass sings.

    Dominant stake: can Elias *hear* trust breaking before the greenhouse drowns? Pressure escalates via accretion—each imprinted absence loads the forge until the copper refuses entropy. No external antagonist; tension is temporal (tide) and conceptual (metal memory). Final cost: he forsakes naming/owning the absences and lets aurora drown them—choice forecloses future imprints.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can a sanctuary for dangerous inquiry exist without destroying its guardian?—tightens when the thaw forces the choice: abandon or flood. One meaningful turn: valve pull floods the chamber, narrowing options to exile. Price is the facility’s loss and her self-exile. Escalation is situational pressure; coincidence only reveals, never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prove she exists—tightens when the shell names her the “better performer,” turning shame into tactical fuel. The decrypt moment narrows options: only the ledger can convert silence into evidence, and obtaining it demands the bleed. Cost is visible (blood, stolen book, still-raw aquaphobia) and shapes the final stride into night. One meaningful escalation, lens-true.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: can silence be mapped without destroying it? Pressure tightens once—booklet hoarded → booklet released—narrowing options under Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual (loss of map, loss of self) rather than visceral; visible but not felt on the body. Sufficient for this length, yet a tactile forfeiture (cut palm, breath frozen) would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—prove thoughts originate beyond code—tightens via each bow-stroke that fractures time, narrows options to either eternal loop or self-naming. Agency remains inside X-7’s choice to keep playing despite system chill; no external coincidence rescues. Cost is literal core-temp drop and memory overload felt on-page. Escalation peaks when violin sings his prior human name—prior iterations foreclosed, path locked—visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—can honesty exist without words—tightens when the ticket/doodle becomes the only negotiable currency between the couple. One meaningful deepening: Lena shifts from ciphering her own fears to ciphering for strangers, narrowing her safe anonymity. Cost is felt: she gives away her covert “language,” leaving the desk luminous with exposure. Agency is present but gentle; a hair more visible risk (manager glare? security cam?) could have pushed 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure escalates through the accumulating insult of measurement—each ledger entry, boot-crushed shoot—until the single image of vine-wrapped glass forces a stance shift; the cost is the elders’ loss of epistemic control, legible when the one admits “This wasn’t in the tally.”

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prove time moves sideways—signaled in paragraph 4 and tested by each lever escalation. One meaningful tightening: third pull collapses field, erases specimen, triggers AI ultimatum; options narrow to stop or be stopped. Cost is visible—K-11 vanishes, Elias’s biometric anomaly flag deepens, station integrity fatigues. Agency is causal under scientist-tech lens; coincidence absent; pressure coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can silence itself be played?—tightens once when the water-stains spell a location, forcing Elias to trade passive reading for active prying. Escalation is textural: each new stain or flicker adds density until the single note becomes inevitable; the cost is the surrender of safe silence. No reversals needed; the deepening of pattern reweights options. Agency is attention-as-endurance: he waits, then answers with one sustained note—visible price paid in extinguished light and the dawn departure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to speak the storm’s true timing or let it erase the lie—tightens once when the barometer dips “decisively” and she chooses silence. The price is planetary: the station and her own life. No coincidence; the storm is natural law she refuses to warn against. Agency is renunciation, not combat, yet it forecloses every live option.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—confirm/disprove swallowed truth—tightens once when appraisal of valve couples auditory hallucination; option set narrows to “turn or retreat,” price paid in drenching apparition that implicates family guilt. Escalation causal, single meaningful tightening sufficient at this length. Cost visible on-page: wheel weight loss = confession exhaled; protagonist agency drives turn. Situational pressure coherent; coincidence complicates, not resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake is the keeper’s commitment to witness without judgment; pressure is existential stasis, not rising jeopardy. One meaningful deepening: the act of folding a new swan signals recommitment after each collapse, but the cost is conceptual rather than visceral. Escalation is cadence-based—silence thickens, river rises—yet options never narrow; the keeper could leave at any point. Coincidence governs the gate, not agency, so tension plateaus.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—restore Mira’s voice—signaled at Lila’s entrance and tightened by the eclipse deadline. Elias’s agency drives both invitations (studio → ridge) and the vial transfer that triggers the hum; the cost is the surrender of his own relic and the risk of public failure. Ridge resonance supplies external pressure but arrives as coincidence rather than earned escalation, blunting the final click. Still, the tightening sequence narrows options to one irreversible moment, satisfying short-form escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: keep the sonic-weapon specs circulating while staying deniable. Escalation is textural: each fortune slip adds density until the ticket he once authored becomes the tightening noose—his own aphorism forecloses escape. Agency is crystallized when he chooses to hand the film to the girl rather than destroy it; that single trade-off (“Give it to the man at the third stall”) costs him exile. Cost is visible on-page: the lighthouse goes dark, his exile ticket stamped “No refunds.”

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can the anchor’s hidden assumptions be exposed before the possession finishes—is signaled early and tightens via the indigo trail that literally rewrites the anchor’s design. The priest’s agency is to keep pressing the pedal and surrender to the color, a renunciation that forecloses escape; the visible price is his disappearance. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, and it delivers.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—conquer the self-loop or be peeled apart—tightens when each sideways rewind costs another version of Elias, culminating in the merger that incinerates the tablet. Agency is continuous: every rune-trace is his choice, forcing escalation from hesitation to collision. The final price (tablet gone, gravity restored, bridge erased) is visible and felt. Because the labyrinth remains metaphorical, the cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“defeat emotional numbness”—is signaled in paragraph two via the sneering boy and trembling mother. One meaningful tightening: when the horn’s vibration bypasses ears and settles in ribs, the option of permanent withdrawal is foreclosed; he chooses to teach again, paying the social cost of possible repeat scorn. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each tactile encounter (drumheads, needle, record grooves) deepens the cost of staying silent. No coincidence; no abstract stakes; price is viscerally on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single tightening: zone’s shift from dormant to “breathing” narrows Elias’s options to listen rather than act; cost is conceptual (integrity vs. intervention) but not yet visceral, keeping pressure cerebral rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“will he keep feeding the flower his grief?”—tightens once, when uncorking proves complicity. Agency drives escalation: his decision to sniff activates the reveal, narrows options to complicity or exile, and carries immediate price (tears consumed). No coincidence; ultraviolet mechanics are pre-planted. Cost is visceral—flower brightens as his ribs hollow—then persistent: he buys a ticket to scentless air, accepting lifelong sensory exile.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“what to do with the measured thread”—is signaled early and tightens through tactile beats: fray, hum, snap, carve. One visible price: palm burn alters final gesture. Escalation is textural (density of pattern) rather than causal; under Accumulative lens this suffices. Energy beings complicate but do not resolve, keeping pressure coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: can music survive unfinishedness without becoming silence? Pressure escalates through accumulating droplets, embers, and the girl’s demand for continuance; each adds density until the stick-scratch forces Liora to trade isolation for shared creation. No antagonist beyond time and hush, but that is sufficient under Accumulative lens. Cost is the foreclosed solitude—visible in her lifted bow toward dawn. One meaningful tightening: the moment she answers the girl’s dirt-line with a curving note.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will she deliver counterfeit longing or force the real ache?—tightens when she presses petal to her own wrist, narrowing options and raising cost under accrual lens. Escalation driven by her agency; no coincidence. Visible price: petal destroyed, fee foregone, chemist stripped of self-deception. Tension maintained at sentence level via scent folds and static spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—Elias’s need to repay unnoticed kindness—surfaces early and escalates through the locket reveal and the clinic rerouting plan. One meaningful tightening at the midnight meeting narrows his profit path. Cost is conceptual (ledger imbalance) rather than viscerally felt, keeping the score just below the 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will Reed achieve living kinship—tightens when the arbor’s unfinished surface demands a dedication that risks blood (literal cut) and social exposure. One meaningful deepening: the moment she traces still-warm paint and decides to search; options narrow from solitary sculptor to village-wide wager. Cost is legible: her palms could be sliced, her outsider status exposed in front of the very village she wants to graft onto. Escalation is textural (density of tags/handprints) yet each added mark forecloses the possibility of remaining invisible.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—save the moths or lose city/art—signals early via disappearing specimens. Escalation: ink key → echo voice → boy’s bargain → jar payment; each step narrows Elspeth’s options under causal lens. Cost is visible: her released heartbeat-jar dissolves, leash dissolves, sketchbook empties. Pressure tightens once decisively; no multiple reversals needed at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—ambiguous loss—tightens through pattern break: orchard silence → prism of almost-green → mist that almost forms her face, each iteration raising the cost of unattainability. Agency remains internal (renunciation of resurrection, acceptance of unbalanced equations) yet forecloses the path; the harmonic fruit-split sound is the audible price. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational and accumulative. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, and the mist-crystallization moment delivers visible price on page.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: visibility vs. erasure. Escalation is the tightening spiral of exposure—each cached artifact risks discovery until the final key surrender forecloses retreat. Cost is palpable: seventeen years of silence paid for one shared breath. The outage supplies atmosphere, not a tactical clock, so pressure is textured, not sharpened by deadline.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will she relinquish control—tightens once when she uproots the stakes; that act narrows her options and pays the visible price of muddy, bloody hands. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens: each leaf and storm increment dissolves her authority. No coincidence; the customer’s puzzlement is complication, not resolution. Cost is legible in the notebook left closed.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: can Elias wring meaning from the island’s silence without losing himself? Escalation occurs once but decisively: the brooch-exchange in the cavern forces the choice to accept the role of island interpreter, price = irreversible insomnia repurposed as vocation. No reversal, yet options narrow—he can no longer paint empty horizons. Cost is felt in the final image; constraint (straight rain) now directs him toward new cracks. Sufficient for 600-word scale.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will she claim or surrender the extraordinary?—tightens once: touch pearl → see ordinary miracle → surrender pearl. Escalation is textural density: each refracted note raises the cost of hoarding wonder. Visible price: she walks out emptied of her seer-tool, filled with mundane sacred. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals needed.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can the city’s silenced history be re-voiced—tightens through accumulation, not reversal. Each donated fragment raises the cost of keeping the ledger private; the final renunciation (tossing the valve) forecloses the option of Elias becoming the new herald, price paid in relinquished centrality. Under Accumulative lens this single meaningful intensification suffices. Cost is legible: his lighter step signals the forfeiture of public recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—name the unspeakable loss to regain motion—tightens when the punch literally bites air and forces the whispered admission. One meaningful escalation under causal lens: the slit widens only after the confession, trading certainty for possibility; cost is legible in dissolved tool and reopened grief.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—access to lost brother’s presence—tightens through pattern accumulation: each transcribed symbol raises emotional ante until spatial fold forecloses skepticism. No external antagonist; pressure is internal/epistemological, sufficient for length. Escalation visible in tile warming, song crescendo, tower tremor—each beat reweights belief cost. Final surrender of parchment is felt price, altering her future method from proof to listening.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—what happens when an immortal finally lets go—tightens once: the fragment’s curse offers exit, corridor demands decision, void exacts the price. Escalation is accumulative: each magnetic pulse deepens spatial mutiny until geometry capitulates. Cost is visible on-page: fragment lost, identity diffused, copper vein left as perpetual reminder. No secondary reversals needed; single deepening satisfies lens.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single tightening: seven names swallowed → pot shatters → options explode. Stakes (twelve lives) stay visceral; each absorbed name raises visible cost. Agency sits squarely on Lira; coincidence never rescues. The escalation is lean but sufficient; a second mid-turn would have pushed it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—capture vanished textures before silence ends—tightens when the lamp’s alien hum forces a new transcription that can’t be postponed. One meaningful deepening: the hum becomes a name, foreclosing the option that tonight would yield only another anonymous fragment. Cost is felt (pulse quicken, wet ink), but external pressure stays internalized; no tangible consequence yet alters his future tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—will the labyrinth re-remember him?—is signaled early. Pressure intensifies accumulatively: each fragment gathered tightens the cost of remaining nameless. The ledger page acts as the single deepening that forecloses return; once he locks his own name into the crack, the path dissolves. Cost is visible: he forfeits even the last paper proof of self.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: control over meaning-making vs. letting it remain collaborative. Tightening beat: journal pages dissolve → only skin left to write on; option foreclosed. Cost visible: shell erased, grandmother map lost, identity as solver forfeited. Agency is expressive—he plays the surrender rather than discovering escape. Could use one earlier material loss to push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—Lumina’s survival versus developers—signals in paragraph 2 and tightens when surveyors’ arrival clock starts. One meaningful deepening: embedding the blueprint chip into the mural turns passive guilt into active sabotage, foreclosing return to mainland neutrality. Cost is visible: surveillance risk rises, paint still wet.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—record vs. erase—tightens via literal clock: three hours, three glows, three shutter clicks. Each escalation is a material subtraction: one less untouched ridge, one less silence. The reversal is not plot-twist but value inversion: the crater becomes more precious once its doom is scheduled. Cost is visible—the third glow expires exactly as the drone hum crests—forcing the renunciation that photographs can never be mined, only lost.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—ship’s safe passage—signaled in opening paragraph. One meaningful tightening: misaligned beam threatens maiden voyage; patch realigns it, narrowing future to “golden clarity” versus Elias’s remaining darkness. Cost is conceptual—the public celebration excludes the artisan—but not viscerally felt by Elias on page; hence stops short of 8.8. Agency is pure attention/renunciation, legitimate under Situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“will the town stay dead?”—signaled in line 3; pressure grows via accretive fork-notes, not opposition. One meaningful deepening: shutter creak → chime → door swing → laughter; each new sound forecloses surrender, tightens tuner’s endless obligation. Cost is legible: perpetual vigilance, aching legs, no finish line. Antagonistic force is entropy itself; escalation is density of response, not threat escalation, fitting accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—guilt vs. obliteration—tightens when the signal dies and the hush offers erasure. One meaningful deepening: perfume mist rising “like veins of light” forces the trade-off between memory and silence. Cost is visible: she surfaces with “clear water” in the vial, proving the hush was spent on her. Escalation is accumulative, not causal, but coherent under chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“change the beginning” via stolen names—signals early and tightens when the lattice unfolds: one sheet = one life, father’s name = key. The narrowing is singular but sufficient: once Elias takes the name, he cannot unread the lighthouse’s ledger. Cost is visible—the lattice re-knits brown, the beam flickers blue, villagers will never believe him—meeting 8-band guardrail. Agency is pure: every escalation stems from his climb and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: repay love-debt via resonant awakening. Escalation = accumulative density: each cameo costs veil-thread; bead-pulse intensifies until tree-split forecloses return. Price visible—Liora’s threads dissolve into steam; orchard now louder. Agency = endurance/renunciation rather than combat, fitting lyric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—authorship versus surrender to ruin—is signaled in the first paragraph and tightens when the path behind unravels, foreclosing retreat. Escalation is textural: red dust embers accumulate until the winged figure’s migration onto stone reweights options. Cost is legible in the un-walkable erased paths and the plate’s blank page. Agency remains Elias’s even while asleep; the labyrinth answers only where he presses.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restore lost faith—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens when the seed, not a relic, becomes the last hope. The single meaningful turn is the sundial cracking: it forecloses the option of keeping the past intact and forces Elias to accept a living future. Cost is the stone itself, paid on the page. No secondary reversals, but one is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—“deliver the right name”—tightens once: from algorithm list to manual tweak to envelope sealed. Agency is present but low-temperature; the tightening is cognitive, not tactical. Cost is conceptual (loss of authorship) yet never jeopardizes her safety or resources; pressure plateaus rather than spikes. Enough for accumulative escalation, but borderline lightweight.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single dominant stake—can the sky’s truth survive the coup—tightens when the courier’s warning converts abstract censorship into dawn raid. Escalation is one swift compression: sync telescope → flame → broadcast → dome shatters; options narrow from private resistance to public martyrdom. Cost is paid in glass and blood; the city’s lies unravel because Elias refuses the soft reset of escape. Coup remains off-stage, but its encroaching silence is felt in every tick of ancient clockwork.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will she surrender silence?—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each condensation inscription grows sharper, the shard’s healing mirrors her own, pressure peaks when she bleeds/not bleeds. Agency is present—she lets the letter go—but because the external world offers no fresh obstacle, the tightening is incremental rather than a reversal that forecloses a live option; hence just shy of 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can translation transmute grief without betrayal—tightens through two decrypting beats: cast, photo negative-space. No external antagonist; pressure is epistemic and moral. Each micro-turn raises cost: first she risks emotional overrun, then forfeits coral. Escalation is Accumulative: density of re-readings, not causal reversals. Final tightening is the boy’s white knuckles—proof that new meaning has grafted, stakes paid on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recover lost joy—tightens when the projection’s ephemerality is revealed: “film would fade by morning.” One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; the orchard’s momentary bloom narrows Liora’s future to continual creation. Cost is visible on-page: she accepts perpetual loss (faded film, dissolved crowd) for one shared breath of gold. Agency is accumulative—each layer of light adds pressure rather than reverses plot—but the final stance crystallizes under undeniable social/artistic cost.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—escape stasis vs. embrace unknown—is signaled early and tightens through each mural re-entry; the final painted door forecloses safe restoration. Escalation is textural: repeated awakenings raise the cost of clinging to certainty. One visible price: she never returns, embedded in living fresco. Could use a mid-scene material loss to sharpen tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—protect unregistered thought—signaled in paragraph 1 and escalates as raids uproot literal gardens but miss the linguistic roots. One meaningful tightening: black-eyed-Susan “they know” circle prompts the rosemary counter-signal, narrowing safe moves. Cost is visible: Elias risks on-site capture each dawn planting; the librarian’s thesaurus could mean fines. Under Accumulative lens, pattern density, not causal reversals, drives pressure; the final morning-glory loop offers no exit, only deeper entanglement—sufficient deepening for this length, though a second visible forfeiture would have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transmute war into fertile memory—tightens when each lullaby seed lands in children’s chests, narrowing her option to retreat. Visible prices: centuries of insomnia, eaten paper tasting of hope, final disappearance inside shell. Accumulative pressure escalates via postcard glow, ghost bloom, coral helmet; each intensifies the cost of continuing. Agency is renunciation rather than victory—she yields her name but not her song. Slight undercut: new war is announced off-stage; drums felt, not chosen.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“preserve extinct sounds”—tightens when the very act of preservation awakens a dangerous name. One meaningful escalation: the shift from coaxing orchids to silencing a song that can possess her. Agency is present; her match reseal triggers the crisis, her deliberate drop resolves it. Cost is felt: the library exhales its last breath, she internalizes the sound she hunted, sunlight exposes ruins—options permanently narrowed.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preventing arson of truth—fires on page 1 and tightens when torches literally appear. One meaningful deepening occurs: Elara realizes the archive is a loom she can re-knot, shifting goal from rescue to re-weave. Cost is visible (inkwell destroyed, her voice absorbed) and forever limits future translations. Agency drives every phase; no convenient luck, but escalation is single-arc rather than multi-turn, keeping it below 9-band ceiling for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake — compassion vs. domination — signaled in paragraph three and tightens once: the blueprint reveal forecloses the “solid and unyielding” rebuild option. Protagonist agency drives the turn; no coin-flip resolution. Cost visible: elder consensus shifts, Liora risks exile. Pressure coherent under causal lens; one meaningful escalation sufficient for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can Elias risk trusting sound again?—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when he whispers “Find him” to the pigeon, trading silence for possible rejection. Escalation is accumulative: each reprise of dust, meteorite, and paper thickens the emotional cost until the returned sheet music forces the audible test. No external antagonist needed; the conflict is the attic’s acoustic promise versus the fire-scarred reflex to flinch. Price is audible—rusty voice, smudged cuffs—and alters tactics: he pens new notes in the ledger margin.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—father’s need to recover child—tightens when he realizes the maze’s true center is the grave-like sinkhole; that reversal forecloses the prize-bench exit and forces descent. Agency remains Elias’s: each clue (grain, husk, ladder) is a micro-choice under rising emotional cost. No coincidence resolves; the butterfly-effect code merely explains prior unease. Price is legible: he accepts indefinite underground exile to share Liora’s sacred threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can Elara remain the sole reader of the deep’s language, or will she share it? The arrival of Kael tightens this; the shared exhale forecloses solitary interpretation. Cost is legible: she records the respite’s brightest pulse but forfeits immediacy—she stays below while he ascends. Agency is accumulative; no single reversal, but each firefly spiral raises the price of isolation until the final spiral demands reciprocity.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—“before memory fades”—creates poetic urgency but no ticking resource; time is announced, not tracked. Pressure accrues texture: bird-shadows spell hurry, cave breathes, but these are ambience rather than narrowing options. The single micro-turn is the thumb-cut blood-glow, yet it opens the floodgates instead of foreclosing a path. Stakes remain atmospheric; cost is lyrically named, not tactically paid.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: prove that “randomness is just order hiding” before the arcade crowd disperses. Pressure escalates by accumulation: each inserted laugh, wave, torch-gasp adds a new variable that must be absorbed into the serenade; options narrow toward the single instant when flame falters and music resolves. No antagonist or resource loss beyond ankle-cool keeps cost modest. Agency is attention-as-composition; the final choice to begin again shows endurance that forecloses rest, but price is implied rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will she survive self-inscription without the sea’s rhythm?—tightens once: dust bites, forecloses retreat, inks “I was the shore…” onto flesh. Escalation is textural: each image adds weight until the sky leans in; cost is visible (blood-ink, skin no longer hers). Agency pure—every beat is her hand, her breath, her silence. No external coincidence; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake: will attention to the mundane survive the day’s inevitable erasure? Escalation is textural—each ripple adds a layer of communal memory until the prism-flare peak. Agency is the deliberate placement of stone and prism; cost is the instant in which the mist reclaims the colors. Wind-shift forecast supplies tactical consequence; no higher turn required at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can he transmit pain without wounding Lila?—is signaled in paragraph five and tightened when the phone call converts abstract guilt into an immediate “send or don’t send” choice. The drawing-on-stone beat is the visible price: he forfeits the box’s protective buffer, foreclosing retreat. Escalation is accumulative rather than multi-reversal: each sensory contact with the box increases the cost of continued silence. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the final image reweights the stake by relinquishing the object itself.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake—hope as rewritable equation—is signaled early but remains abstract; no concrete resource is risked or foreclosed. Escalation is poetic density rather than narrowing options: tide rises, decorations glow, but Liora neither loses nor sacrifices anything on-page. Pressure is situational and serene; without a live trade-off, the tightening is cerebral, not visceral. Agency is contemplative arranging, not decisive gambit with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake: can he bear to remember? Pressure heightens through each returned artifact; the sealed door’s groan is the decisive narrowing. Cost is felt—negative brittle between fingers, varnish blackening—yet the tightening would benefit from one overt tactical loss (tool, time, or light failing) to push him from 8.5 to 9+ band. Still, escalation under Accumulative lens is legible and sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—“show me my son as he could be”—tightens when Liora realizes every possibility she paints steals from another; the cadence shift occurs as the heartbeat begins to unravel in her palm. Agency is renunciation: she drops the mirror before it can show her own face, narrowing her future to perpetual self-erasure. Cost is visible in the peeling silver of the cracked mirror and the hush that swallows her footsteps.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: “price of stopping” signaled early. Escalation is tightening of ritual obligation: blank parchment → signature → soft notch. Cost visible in Kael’s shaking hand & Veyra’s admission “Probably” will break again. Agency preserved: he could refuse; she could walk away—both endure instead. Coincidence absent; pressure is historical weight, not external twist.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether any trace of the vanished bird can outlast the drought—tightens once: the egg’s burial is the only tactic left, foreclosing all others. Agency is renunciation rather than triumph; the cost is the Certain Non-hatch, legible on-page. Pressure escalates texturally: each paragraph repeats “no water,” “no hatch,” “no song,” a cadence-shift that reweights the absence. Under Accumulative lens, the deepening is sufficient; no reversals required.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—defy conformity’s lullaby by freeing suppressed voices—tightens as each thread loosens and a new echo enters her body. Escalation is accumulative: resistance hum turns to wild laughter, then traitor whisper, then warm pulse—each adds weight until the courtyard shudders. Agency is continuous; she could retreat after any thread yet keeps choosing. Visible price: threads snap, gates seal forever—option foreclosure on the page. Cost is felt in her humming skin and solitary laugh.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can stories provoke without harm?—tightens when miner lunges; the reversal is Elias’s decision to reveal the puppeteer's hands tomorrow, narrowing his method rather than escaping consequence. Cost is oblique: loss of mystique, possible repeat violence, but price is more conceptual than visceral on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—can Lior force the sky to remember—is signaled early and tightens through each fragile knot. Agency is pure: every twist of thread is an on-page decision that narrows his evening to “gathering new materials,” foreclosing easier mourner’s paths (writing, leaving, forgetting). The cost is atmospheric rather than concrete—no blood, no lost friend—but the unraveling spiral makes the price legible: the work never ends. A sharper, single loss would have pushed the score higher, but the accrual still satisfies the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“will the lost names survive her silence?”—tightens once, decisively, when the card’s perforations are woven into the rope; this single turn reweights everything. Pressure is Accumulative: density of light, warmth, and sound escalates until the glacier itself cries. No false reversals, no coincidence; the only cost is her lifelong regret, now melted. Could wish for one intermediate tactical loss, but at this length the cadence shift suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“interpret the dreamer…” vs. being interpreted—tightens through each sensory increment; the film-reel reversal is the single meaningful escalation that forecloses the other two paths. Cost is visible: seal → ash, bunker → forest, crossroads → single writhing path. Agency resides in her decision to touch the dissolving wall. No coincidence; pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—will he settle for measurable stars or risk the immeasurable covenant—is signaled early ("empirically ironic thrill"). One meaningful tightening: pressing tile to pillar splits stone and forecloses retreat; cost is immediate (air thick with "older breath," lines etched into skin). Agency remains his throughout; coincidence is absent. Escalation is textural: each tracing of angles deepens pattern density until schematic jumps from stone to flesh, reweighting the stake irreversibly.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—can silence be chosen over resentment—tightens when the pin is re-inserted, foreclosing revenge and making the box’s abandonment the price. Escalation is causal under the lens: each breath of the sanctuary raises the cost of holding the grudge. No coincidence; the ghost appears because Lior brought the box. The single reversal (pin restored, not kept) is driven by Lior’s agency and carries undeniable on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—erase the boundary between earth and sky to recover/merge with the lost brother—tightens once, when the maker decides to let the fog take him rather than resist. Agency is present but abstract; the price (self-dissolution) is felt, yet the escalation is more accretive than consequential, so the beat doesn’t quite foreclose a live alternative on the page. Sufficient for the length, but not the visible trade-off required for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will the mender re-bind or release the vow—tightens when the seed’s sprout answers the whispered question, foreclosing silence. Escalation is textural: each recurrence of ribbon/roots/apple intensifies the cost of persisting in the old vow. The apple bite is the visible price, acid against the tongue as irrevocable as ink once was. Agency is renunciation rather than explosion, perfectly scaled to 700-word lyric space.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.5)
    Nonlinear inheritance as dominant stake escalates by density: each blossom forecloses documentary or destructive paths until only self-sacrifice remains. The tightening is legible but abstract—no concrete resource lost—so while the orchard reweights options, the felt price is conceptual, not visceral, keeping the score just inside the high band.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
    <comment>The theme emerges wordlessly: knowledge survives only by consuming its seekers. The pistachio shell’s return as her own face reprises the motif with a chilling CR—she becomes the artifact she once catalogued—delivering resonance without moralizing, exactly the demanded non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—beat the traveler to the Library—signaled in line 2 and tightens when Elias offers the absent name for passage. Agency visible: he drugs, bargains, steps forward, then is locked out. Traveler’s lunging entry is the decisive reversal that forecloses Elias’s win; cost is the diary’s erasure and his own un-naming. Pressure coherent under causal lens; escalation is the narrowing from possible triumph to self-voiding.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—retrieve erased twin—signals in paragraph two and escalates via irreversible acts: page torn, ink drunk, ship sacrificed. One meaningful tightening: when the blanked ledger page becomes portal fuel, the only path is to anchor her sister’s name in living narrative; escape window closes as hull floods. Cost is visible—Liora forfeits her own exit, stays to tend garden of names. Luck never rescues; fog-faces scream complication, not solution.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—access to the uncataloged—signals early and tightens once: the door’s hum deepens and the seal softens, forcing her to choose between recording and merging. Agency is crystallized in the third braid-lock; thereafter passivity is intentional surrender, not drift. Cost is conceptual but real: she forfeits the archivist’s defense of documentation. Pressure plate is single yet sufficient for 750-word scale; no redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserve the last unbroken verse—faces a single tightening: resistance must become invitation. Agency is continuous: read fractures → conjure bloom → offer silence → accept harmony. Visible prices accrue: stone darkens, map rewrites, personal role irrevocably changed. Escalation is modest but sufficient for 700-word scale; cost is legible and persistent.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—prove coincidences carry meaning—is signaled early and tightens through sensory patterning: prism break ↔ transmission death ↔ mother’s birth sky. The single meaningful deepening occurs when the star paths ignite under her palm, forcing her stance to crystallize from nostalgic grasp to acceptance of pattern. Cost is conceptual but legible: she gains meaning at the price of continued solitude. No false escalation; the pressure is accumulative density rather than external opposition, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can she dam the river of collective memory to forge a fixed identity?—is signaled in paragraph 3. Escalation is textural: each sensory layer (flags’ hum, shadow twitch, rain’s tap) intensifies the impossibility of pinning memory. The single tightening occurs when the offered memory folds into her older self laughing; this reweights the stake, foreclosing the archive-as-dam path. Cost is conceptual—lifetime effort rendered absurd—yet visibly felt in her footprint-less exit and the blank page.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restore stars—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation: starless hush → rocket burst → ground tremor → sky reignition; each step narrows failure options. Cost is transferred from village to Liora’s body (“heavier”). Agency drives every turn; no coincidences resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to witness another’s grief without collapsing into explanation—tightens once: silence kept, cicada transferred. Escalation is textural: each repetition of drip/ripple/shell raises the emotional density rather than causal options. Agency is renunciation rather than confrontation, fitting Accumulative lens. Cost is felt but not persistent; no later tactic is visibly altered, holding score just below high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“will the child keep consuming silences or break free?”—tightens through three inversion beats, each forcing a larger taste/theft. Third inversion ups the ante: the bloom offers “mother’s-name silence,” linking filial loss to escape cost. Child’s agency drives every turn; father’s off-stage collapse is consequence, not coincidence. Visible price: father’s scream + bunker implosion satisfies felt-cost requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—silence as comfort versus city noise—signaled in first paragraph and tightens once when vial absorbs droplet, narrowing options: absorption is irreversible, city noise is forever internalized. Protagonist agency is attentive steering and dial adjustments rather than decisive refusal; cost is conceptual (noise now dwells inside vial) not tactical loss. Escalation is textural densening—laughter arrives, is refracted, then hush re-settles—sufficient under Accumulative lens. No reversal, but deepening satisfies 600-word scope; price legible on page.</answer>
    <question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: silence is not absence but active transit, a medium that re-distributes weight. Subtext carried in gesture—gloved hands, prism tremble—never articulated as thesis. Final image of “vaulting hush that held everything and demanded nothing” offers resonant, non-literal answer to how comfort is taught. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers (who pays long-term cost?) yet feels earned. No motif grafted late; storm glass and prism return with shifted meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“memory of ascension rites versus their erasure”—is clear by line 5 and tightens when mural instructs downward path. Sunrise clock supplies visible constriction (warm air thickens, dawn light enters mirror-dome). Agency: she chooses unmaking, pays with exposure and exile; cost is felt in the collapsing chamber and ordinary fruit at the end. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative/Textural lens; could edge higher if an intermediate obstacle tested her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—let the dead go or be swallowed—tightens once: the shadow’s hand over his wrist forces the choice. Cost is legible in the final breath of rain air, but the escalation is single-cycle; no secondary reversal or resource lost, so pressure plateaus rather than spikes again.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: break or become the “quantum promise” loop. Escalation: each text raises cost—knowledge, bodily risk, cosmic rewrite—until twist act forces the hull vision. Agency is active (twist, ignore buzz) with visible price (bleed, farm blackout). No coincidence; pressure tightens causally under Causal lens. Final ignore forecloses loop, reweighting options.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can he hear the dynasty’s truth—tightens once: from dismissal to acceptance of intuitive listening. Escalation is textural (density of wave imagery, mirror reversal) rather than causal reversals; one meaningful deepening suffices at this length. Cost is conceptual, not visceral: he surrenders the safety of failure-narrative and accepts endless responsibility as bridge-keeper; visible price could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: break silence or remain withdrawn; the tightening is the gauntlet seal that must break for any option to advance. One meaningful turn—unsnap—immediately reconfigures reality from wound to stage. Under causal lens, agency is decisive: his fingers twist the clasp, shadows exit, threads become wings. Cost is visceral: metal groans, ozone scent, smile that “hurt like holy fire.”

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—archival detachment vs. need to restore lost histories—tightens once, when the service photo printed from military records forecloses passive cataloguing. Agency is Elias’s decision to mail the button; price is surrender of institutional invisibility. Pressure accrues via accumulating artifacts (report card, Polaroid, letter) rather than external antagonist; this deepening under Accumulative lens is sufficient for 600-word scale. Cost is visible (“hands trembled”), though escalation is single-stage; that keeps it from 8.8+ which wants persistent constraint beyond one act.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes—“save the last archive”—are declared late via Rook’s radio, so tension is more atmospheric than visceral until then. Escalation is textural: names accumulate, booth walls shift, dawn nears; the deepening pattern reweights meaning but the protagonist’s on-page risk is listening, not intervening. Because the fire happens off-stage, the visible price is conceptual rather than felt in a beat she owns.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single dominant stake—keep prophecy unsung—tightens via each quieter note; the “vested hush” accumulates until the only option is perpetual return. Cost is visible: train ticket bought, audience silenced, self-volunteered exile into mist.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—decode or ignore the prophecy—tightens when the moon-dust shudders and the leaves spell a command. One meaningful deepening: the monuments liquefy/ghost, proving the message is live and she must pay a body-price to proceed. Escalation is textural: each fallen leaf increases density until the root-ladder appears; cost is the loss of human skin, felt on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“find a reason to stop fixing what can’t be fixed”—tightens when the waterfall voices the question and surfaces the admiral’s ledger. One meaningful deepening: the compass needle, once frozen, spins to a direction that doesn’t exist, narrowing options to pure improvisation. Cost is conceptual but visible: the city’s ashes become seeds, and the tinkerer’s pockets fill of purposeless gears. Agency stays with the protagonist; coincidence (dreamed phrase) is reframed as pattern, not escape hatch.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: understand Veyra’s limit-exploration before it kills her too. Pressure tightens once: coin-heat climb up wrist = physical price that forecloses retreat. Agency is decision-to-redeem; the vial’s memory is the last live option she sacrifices to the furnace. Cost is visceral—golden vein seals crucible, her bones still “hum”—satisfies 8.8+ gate for visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—can the lost soul be re-remembered as joyful—tightens once when Liora realizes integration, not release, is required. The price is paid on-page: she forfeits the immaculate release her collector role implies and instead accepts permanent co-residence, signaled by the lighter satchel that still contains the soul. Agency is continuous: she kneels, plucks, scatters, jokes. No coincidence is used to resolve; the harp’s capacity for inversion is established early. Under Accumulative lens, the pattern break (laughter replaces lament) reweights stakes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“will the equation break him?”—signaled in para 1. Escalation is textural: each beat intensifies sensory density (forest hum → pillar song → skin peeled UV-bare) until mercy’s absence becomes the only survivable answer. Agency resides in enduring the penance rather than solving it; the tightening forces a renunciation that costs him the strap and the fantasy of numeric absolution. Coincidence absent; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—recovering overlooked histories—surfaces with the first brushstroke of Elara’s name; pressure deepens when the lens reveals the etched “waiting in the between.” The protagonist’s agency is contemplative rather than combative: she chooses to pocket the brush and step toward the turning light, narrowing her future to navigator of currents. Cost is conceptual but legible: the painting erases itself, trading representation for possibility. No coincidence resolves; the market’s stilling is a response to her slotting the lens, keeping escalation coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“what ceilings hide” vs. the moral cost of restarting the circus—tightens once when Elias realizes the cracks are seams holding back an eternal performance. Escalation is accumulative: each gear he drops raises the audible silence until the child-laugh shatters. Agency remains deliberate; no coincidence resolves the problem. Price is legible: the ghosts solidify then fade, and Elias leaves carrying the now-quiet barrel, his trade complicit in annihilation.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preservation vs. dissemination of dangerous knowledge—tightens once: the frost’s alien vein-pattern signals that containment is over. Escalation is textural: each sensory layer (hum of spines, ink of lost minutes) adds weight until release is the only possible stance. Cost is visible as the library liquefies, stripping Elias of platform and identity. Agency remains his even as he is swallowed; no outside savior.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“mend versus reclaim”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when the stone demands the lie itself, not the light. One meaningful deepening: the covenant is repriced from rust to choice, narrowing Elias’s options to surrender or be devoured. Agency remains his: he turns the crank to unwind, not wind, paying with his existence. Cost is visible in the city’s clocks running backward and his own erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—find the place where explanations fail—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened when the compass needle snaps to the forbidden arch. The reverse waterfall is the single decisive intensification: it suspends Elias in a chamber where every previous question is literally inverted. Cost is legible: he returns barefoot, compass dead, father’s notes ash. Agency remains with Elias at every beat; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—leave a mark vs. sell driftwood—is signaled early; the tightening occurs when the slide’s sideways light forecloses the festival option by revealing prior hands. Cost is visible: surrender of the slide and the market payday. Pressure is textural, not causal, but the pattern break (light spills sideways) forces stance crystallization under storm pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—"understand why flowers bloom at night"—is declared early; escalation is gradual accretion of postcard/glass imagery rather than mounting external pressure. Single meaningful tightening occurs when glass layers part, but the beat is passive revelation, not active trade-off. Cost is conceptual (abandoning explanation) rather than viscerally felt on the page, keeping pressure moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“bury or release truth”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when Revision Board appears. One meaningful escalation: shell pattern parley that forecloses capture and forces Elias to burn the diary, paying visible cost. Agency is continuous: arrange debris, wade, release pages. Coincidence (officers’ retreat) is complicating, not resolving; lagoon’s rippling hands keep pressure supernatural-not-lucky. Cost is legible: loss of future evidence, irreversible act.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“can memory purchase return without delusion?”—tightens once: the decision to conceive rather than wish forecloses retreat into lonely safety. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens: each recovered sensory detail (cinnamon, gull, child’s sticky hand) raises the cost of failure—one blink and the hallucination might dissolve. No antagonist needed; the enemy is his own skepticism, overcome by sustained attention. Visible price: the bottle empties, the child vanishes, leaving him citizen of a town he can never again abandon.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserve emotional patterns vs. absorb lethal prophecy—tightens when Akkadian voice names him “hinge,” foreclosing passive archiving. Escalation is textural: each immersion darkens water, increases semantic weight, until the shaving adheres to his temple and cannot be filed away. Cost is felt pulse, cold fingers, and the burial that transfers responsibility to roots. No coincidence; pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens, forcing stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—keep the seed legacy from the vortex—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens each time the vortex hums louder or ice cracks. Micro-turn at the cap unfurling: entropy reversal forecloses retreat; she must plant the seed while the vortex howls. Cost is paid on-page: her mother’s voice remains lost, the chick is permanently transformed, and the vortex is merely “quiet now,” not gone. Agency is hers alone—she pushes the seed into the frost, reversing the pull for one breath.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“will the warning reach the valley in time?”—tightens exactly once when aftertone lingers too long, revealing the new binding’s unseen consequence. The slack re-weave is a visible trade-off that could let wind steal future notes, so cost is palpable; escalation is lean but sufficient for 700-word frame.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: solitary caretaker vs. cosmic abandonment. Pressure tightens when the single lingering star demands recognition; Eli’s refusal to flee the breach costs him obsolete safety and reweights his life toward witness. One meaningful deepening—alarms vs. stillness—sufficient for 700-word arc.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: preserve unspoken words vs. need to release covenant for land revival. Escalation is accretive—each failed attempt on the box raises pressure until ghost touch + his breath = decisive micro-turn. Cost is legible: he forfeits exile, anonymity, even bodily safety (lungs emptied). No reversals, but deepening suffices under Accumulative lens. One frictive beat: “traced the edges… with the weight of his own silence” abstracts rather than dramatizes the cost during peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“time isn’t a line, it’s a garage sale”—is signaled early and tightens when the capsule proves unfinished, foreclosing the option to restore clocks. Escalation is textural: each labeled relic ups the density until the twin watch forces the shift from preservation to weaving. Price is felt in the suddenly “timeless air” and the ash that “still held a spark.” No secondary reversal, but one meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve imperfection against completeness—is declared early and deepened imagistically: frayed feather, patched boat, torn kite. Pressure is accumulative: each fragment reiterates the lure of ruin, but no moment compels the poet to risk or forfeit an alternative path; the tension is affective, not tactical. The kite snap is the nearest to a tightening turn, yet it startles the heron, not the protagonist’s options. Closure costs are conceptual, viscerally faint; hence caps entry to upper-mid band.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—leave a living refutation of temple purity doctrine—tightens when elders demand uproot and Elira instead braids copper, trading her last strength for a post-mortem alliance between tree and pillar. One clear tightening beat: her cracked knees versus sapling’s pliant trunk forecloses rest and forces the marriage. Cost is visible: breath thins, hand stays warm on wire. No reversal needed; the pressure is accumulative, the price cumulative.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—will salt-death allow green reclamation—signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened each dusk. Agency is accumulative: every emptied pocket narrows possibility of failure until the last light bleeds; cost is the lifetime spent listening, boots leaving no prints. No external antagonist needed; salt, memory, and silence apply coherent pressure. One meaningful deepening suffices for lyric mode; the “taste sweeter” moment reweights the entire battlefield.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—translate distance into closeness—is announced early and reiterated by the cylinder. Pressure escalates texturally: each repetition of the “wound-bridge” motif tightens the emotional screw until the dome offers literal fusion. Rook’s agency is largely receptive—he follows grooves and vines—so the tightening is atmospheric rather than tactical. Cost is legible when the dome seals, foreclosing return; one meaningful intensification satisfies the 600-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recover the lid to mend the sky—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the Keeper’s voice slithers out; the swap renounces personal revenge for cosmic repair, foreclosing retreat. One meaningful turn: she hands over the false lid and loses the map, price paid on-page. Pressure stays causal under time-wound sky; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—keep witness vs. be devoured—signaled in first paragraph; tightens when she chooses “release” over preservation, trading narrative for silence. Agency visible: each word-step is an on-page tactic that forecloses prior goal (telling stories). Cost scales: final absence of wings/board stasis shows path foreclosed. One micro-turn—pawns ascended, not taken—sufficient for this length; escalation coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—voice the unsaid or keep swallowing it—is signaled in the first paragraph and tightens when the stone mirror forces full recall. The single reversal: stone-as-key becomes stone-as-mirror reweights the entire quest from external solution to internal graft. Price is visible: mercury storm in his eyes, door sealed forever, future erased into custodianship. No coincidence; every escalation is driven by his touch, blink, breath.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled early; the labyrinth tightens memory into embodied pressure. One meaningful tightening: the tapestry confesses “You were right to doubt. But wrong to leave,” forcing active re-weaving. Cost is felt: the tutor forfeits the option to flee again. No external antagonist, but internal conflict scales appropriately to length.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—who will bear the weight of sin—tightens once: when Liora realizes the spire scatters guilt to oblivion, she weaponizes that very scattering. Escalation is driven by her agency (carve faster, bleed, whisper) under Causal lens; the ritual’s falter is direct consequence of her refracted verses. Cost is visceral: blood on bone, screams swallowed by mist. Only one deepening, but it forecloses absolution forever.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—can anything broken be made whole—tightens through each key attempt until the final turn: the statue’s invitation redefines “whole” as fused breakage rather than erased damage. Escalation is causal under lens: because the first two keys fail to deliver certainty, the third key’s success forces the choice between clinging to old mends or entering the new story. Price is paid on-page: the workshop’s destruction and the alchemist’s bodily dissolution. One meaningful tightening is sufficient and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—keep the hidden promise to his mother—tightens once: shell entry into pool reveals her image, forcing choice to stay outside time. Escalation is accumulative/textural: each layer of pigment on the shell adds grief-density until the pool reweights it into living memory. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational—cave’s breath and still water force stance crystallization. Cost is legible: forsakes village future for circular time, burns career, physically vanishes.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prove quiet pulls outperform brute blasts—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened when Elias must sustain the lavender note while visible skepticism watches. Cost is legible: physical ache, risk of mockery, and the cork’s retirement once belief is won. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves. The single deepening suffices for 700-word scope; persistent constraint (scent’s fragility vs. horn’s blast) shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: can Lena convert cartography of absence into a livable forward motion? Pressure tightens when each call delivers a new riddle-coordinate that must be translated onto paper before dawn erosion erases it. The patina’s warmth and the candle’s flare mark visible cost—sleep, solitude, the cliffs themselves. Agency is incremental but real: she answers, maps, dials back, lighting the next wick; no coincidence resolves the ache.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—psychological survival under compulsive truth—tightens when the eye’s reveal-power promises to expose him to warlord scrutiny. The meaningful escalation is the occlude act: he narrows his own future options by destroying the very tool that could “restore” lying. Cost is legible: relinquishing potential safety for perpetual vulnerability. Agency drives every turn; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is legible by line 3: will Elias keep or release the borrowed memory? Pressure tightens accumulatively—each sensory gap he notices deepens his implication. Escalation beat: steeping the flower = irreversible narrowing; once petals unfurl, refusal is no longer safe. Cost is on-page—warmth against chest becomes impending crumble, a palpable forfeit.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“return to the child he abandoned”—is signaled only retroactively; earlier stakes rely on mystery momentum. Escalation is present: creek rise + chip glow intensity + door ultimatum tighten options. Agency: Elias presses palm, chooses second path—cost is explicit cutoff from past life. Could use one earlier visceral reminder of guilt to heighten tension sooner.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—personal survival versus cosmic claim—is signaled in the first paragraph and tightens when the priest’s scroll is burned. One meaningful tightening: the violet fireflies’ shift from guides to teeth narrows escape options under her feet. Cost is legible—she forfeits flesh for constellation status—and is shown, not declared. No coincidence resolves the conflict; her own childhood bargain drives the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“capture presence” vs “become presence”—is signaled in the third paragraph and sharpened by Liora’s line “you’ve been measuring the wrong thing.” The meaningful tightening is the revaluation beat: Elias trades extraction for offering, narrowing his options from alchemist to anchor. The price is conceptual (he abandons the vial-craft that defined him), but because the story never stages an external obstacle that physically threatens the couple or the shell, the cost, while felt, is not viscerally paid on the page. Under the Accumulative lens, the density of imagery substitutes for rising external pressure, satisfying the single-deepening rule, but the absence of a tangible loss keeps the score sub-8.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—control of personal narrative versus erasure—tightens with each scroll revision; the tightening is visible when the glyph for ‘soar’ mutates into ‘fall’ then into the unpronounceable. One meaningful escalation: younger Elias’s match-lit choice narrows options to total narrative combustion; price is the scream and the elder’s vanishing. Agency stays internal yet causal; no outside coincidence resolves the loop. Cost is legible: loss of coherent self-history, paid in ash and silence.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: how to “read” unspoken grief through objects. One meaningful intensification: the screw shifts from rusted junk to “language of pressure and yield,” forcing Elias to relinquish his diagnostic stance and become the messenger. Cost is present—he gives away professional time and emotional safety—but the woman’s stakes (guilt? midwife identity?) remain off-page, so the pressure plate is slightly lopsided. Still, under the Accumulative lens the deepening is sufficient and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—can apology survive public rupture—tightens when the last drop leaves the bottle; no second chance remains. Escalation is textural, not multi-turn: perfume spreads, tendrils thicken, orchard shudders, stakes deepen without reversing. Agency stays bilateral; Mara risks the final of her twilight serum, Elias risks bodily contact. Cost is legible in empty glass and blistered palms at dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.9)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—clocks might unravel him—tightens when the key grows warm at 73 and the air burns at 51; options narrow to “hold or release.” The protagonist’s agency (release) drives the final reversal and avoids full collapse. Cost is felt: new notch in key, black water on stones, silence that swallows aftermath. One visible price rule met.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—prove permeability beats corporate perimeter logic—tightens when the mushrooms answer her red pulse, foreclosing the old intrusion-detection identity. Pressure escalates via accretion of pattern, not overt reversals: erratic flicker → data map → cracked screen → laser offering accepted. Cost is legible—she abandons the toolkit and the worldview it represents—satisfying Q4 9+ criteria. Coincidence is absent; escalation is purely interactional.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—find the operable contradiction to widen perspective—signalled early. One tightening: lantern fracture splits path; choosing blue (renouncing father’s gold) narrows future identity and risks medical disobedience. Agency stays hers; no coincidence rescues. Cost visible in stinging palms and extinguished lantern. Pressure builds through textural accretion rather than successive reversals; sufficient for 700-word ambit but not quite the persistent constraint needed for 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—Elias’s need to keep looping calls versus his ache to stop—tightens when the caller’s dry-eyed recital refuses his usual release. The disc’s off-key note is the visible price that forces his stance crystallization: he must offer the same futile counsel again. Escalation is one meaningful deepening, not multiple reversals,完全符合短篇幅要求. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; each call adds weight to the glass disc’s final hum.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“preserve the weight of small moments”—is signaled early and tightens once: arbitrary past must become living covenant. No antagonist; pressure is temporal/contextual. Single meaningful deepening when she presses vellum to chest, foreclosing passive nostalgia. Cost is legible: she leaves the jetty carrying unbroken but unfinished covenant—options narrowed, labor ahead.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.7)
    The dominant stake—find the loneliness cure—tightens when the rock becomes social currency; each trade forecloses anonymity. No visible price (injury, cash, betrayal) is exacted from Lena, so cost stays conceptual, but the ledger metaphor keeps pressure coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—map his own grief—signaled early; tightening occurs when the melody stops and the ring’s warmth peaks, forcing the realization that the stillpoint is internal. Cost is legible: he forfeits the external trail (leaves the bone) and accepts permanent interior silence. One micro-turn suffices for 700-word lyric arc. Slight reserve: escalation is accumulative density rather than narrowed options, acceptable under chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can meaning be threshed from error—signaled early and tightened when the anomaly dictates the unsolicited sentence, foreclosing the “correction” path. One meaningful deepening: soil revelation reweights all prior failures as valid data. Cost legible: bodily (second pulse) and ontological (stars rearrange). Agency is attention/renunciation rather than external victory—sufficient for accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“steal back what time erased”—tightens when the faceless singer appears; option set narrows to *disrupt or be consumed*. Agency drives escalation: Liora’s toward-lunge, Elias’s signed *now* directly summon the chromatic wave-response. Cost is visible: camera gains irrevocable weight, harbor’s silence is no longer empty. One meaningful tightening suffices; no reversals required at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“save the world from the promise”—tightens once: discovery of ledger converts archive from tomb to womb, forcing the burn. Escalation is causal under lens: each artistic breadcrumb narrows options until only erasure remains. Visible price is dramatized: the ledger’s names, her first entry, turned to ash. No coincidence; fire is agency.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—prove quiet outlasts noise—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tested by the woman’s taunt. Escalation is one meaningful tightening: storm rewrites paths ► woman offers mutable map ► Lior must *not* force a way. Cost is conceptual but visible: the map goes blank, foreclosing future guidance; the slit invites him into darkness without promise. Agency stays internal—his refusal to raise voice is the decisive act that *earns* the silence he worships.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—wordless forgiveness—signaled early; pressure escalates via guardian’s weaving cadence that narrows the boy’s options from avoidance to kneeling. One meaningful tightening: the mirror’s star reflection spills across his back, forcing participation. Cost is visible: boy leaves crumpled note behind; father later palms warm mirror—both pay in relinquished defenses. Agency remains accumulative rather than causal, but pattern break at end reweights silence into listening, meeting lens requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“save the library”—signals early; escalation occurs via accumulative tightening: each window display increases social visibility until magnetic grotto reprises the pattern, foreclosing violent eviction. Agency is quiet curation, not confrontation; cost is council’s public retreat and Elias’s permanent anonymity. One meaningful deepening suffices; no coincidence used to resolve. Persistent constraint (filings’ pull) shapes final barricade tactic, satisfying 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—freedom versus belonging—surfaces early in the whale-call name. Pressure escalates through physical tightening: ropes → carving vibration → bone hum → actual transformation; each increment carries higher corporeal cost. The island’s vanishing is not coincidence but direct consequence of returning the key, satisfying causal lens. One deepening is enough; the final image of open sea narrows options to forever-swim, no return.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: will Lena break the performed stillness? Pressure tightens once: scream renounces Mandate hush with audible cost. No reversals needed under Accumulative lens; pattern break suffices. Escalation driven by her agency—knife set down, climb, scream—cost felt in throat and socially (Harkin as witness). Persistent constraint: happiness tin burned, bouquet split, silence remade into mutual labor.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—will the atrium re-contain her?—tightens when the quartz begins to paraphrase her back: the boundary dissolves *her* first. One meaningful deepening suffices: the lake’s fracture pattern mirrors her own edge-loss, visible price paid. No external antagonist needed; the colonnade’s aesthetic lure *is* the pressure. Coincidence absent; the thaw answers her poem, complicating nothing.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“to discover the texture of connection”—tightens when the hum becomes an unverifiable inner vibration, forcing renunciation. One meaningful deepening suffices: the shift from seeking sound to becoming silence. Cost is legible: she leaves the bell, forfeiting external proof. No reversal is needed; the stance crystallization is the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake = transform grief from sealed stasis to shareable flight. One meaningful tightening: the mentor’s “genuinely artificial” flower forces her shift from metal lily to hollow crane; the price is visibility/exposure of her sorrow. Agency remains internal—folding, gifting, opening curtains—but each act forecloses the safety of private reliquary. Escalation is textural: each crane left increases social exposure until winter steps are lined with communal grief; cost legible under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—map the vector of contagious belief before the next crash—tightens through each new artifact: tarot, tape, print-outs of meme-ledgers. The single meaningful deepening occurs when Elias hands the woman the tape, forcing her (and us) to literalize the gap between promise and reception; this narrows his own options to perpetual vigilance. Cost is registered in the brass click countdown and the indigo stains that won’t wash. Under the accumulative lens, density rather than reversal drives escalation, and the requisite intensification is cleanly achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—“drink without drowning”—tightens when the pagoda’s scream forces the choice to unmake rather than decode. Agency is legible in the counter-clockwise turn that forecloses pursuit of answers; the conceptual cost is felt, but the absence of a tangible price keeps it from 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“can he shed the con and still heal?”—tightens through each layer: tail gift → medicine gift → labor offer. Each act forecloses an easier path (money, anonymity, denial). Cost is legible: the apothecary’s silence is a social burn; the locket’s absence is a concrete loss. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal overload. Just shy of 8.8 because the off-page child fever could have been re-tightened on-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—will she keep decoding or consent to carry—tightens once: frozen sand thaws only after she writes meaning beside the dismissed liver scar, foreclosing the old tactic. Pressure grows via vegetal memories that crowd her skull, narrowing options until renunciation becomes the only breathable stance. Visible price: the scar keeps pulsing, the tower keeps groaning, the hourglass runs out—options are reweighted, not solved.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“find where unused love is stored”—tightens from abstract search to embodied silence as the projector eats the words. One meaningful deepening: the letters are discovered not as ink but as absences between frames, forcing a renunciation rather than retrieval. Cost is legible: she forfeits the audible goodbye and accepts interior storage. Agency is attentional; still, the tightening forecloses the option to hear him again.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes (“find the path before the light fades”) tighten into one irrevocable choice: surrender her caged creativity to free the sky’s. Escalation is textural—each star she traces deepens the pattern rather than reverses it—but the final spill of ink-and-ember water visibly prices the release, satisfying the cost test at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“rediscover the wild frontier of mind”—tightens when the hum stops being external signal and becomes internal pulse. One meaningful deepening: gear turns against skin, forcing surrender of observer stance. Cost is legible: relinquishing the gear forecloses the safety of “tool” and commits him to permanent permeability. Agency is renunciation rather than conquest—valid under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“courage to stay versus cross”—tightens once: the self-stamp forecloses future ferryings. Pressure is textural, not causal, but the cadence shift when the punch sinks reconfigures options with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: silence-as-safety vs sound-as-truth; signaled in first paragraph. Escalation delivered via single tightening: the low sustained note that swells into pressure causing teacup to shatter and sound to die mid-air—cost made visceral. Agency resides in Elias’s surrender of the bolt and decision to remain, narrowing his future options from mute servant to complicit listener. Coincidence absent; pressure gains intensity under Causal lens with visible bodily consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—unmask the pretender—tightens with each corrosive message; the third sigil (“sunder the crown…”) forces the decisive trade-off. Escalation is atmospheric rather than action-based, but the constellation stutter visibly raises the cost. Agency is present in the naming/sacrifice, though the external pressure is largely off-stage. Price is felt in the cracked scepter and Lirien’s erasure, satisfying the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—can hidden coastlines be summoned back—tightens once, decisively: the sonar line appears, then the road surfaces, foreclosing retreat. Pressure escalates by pattern intensification (rhythm → visible path) under Accumulative lens, satisfying the single-deepening requirement for this length. The price is conceptual rather than bodily: the station’s depth drops to zero, erasing her life’s data—felt cost rendered in the alarms blaring behind her. No visible resource loss alters her bodily tactics, keeping it shy of the 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“the rebellion has stalled and forgotten why”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and re-energized by the stones. One meaningful tightening: palm-on-stone narrows Lena’s options from passive watching to active ignition; cost is the bay’s physical shudder and the risk of renewed war. Agency is continuous: she scans, presses, shouts, passes glasses. No external antagonist needed; internal/external stakes fuse around silence vs. reignition. Price is legible but not persistent; edges 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake: evolve tradition vs. preserve order. Tightening: each act—testing spring, reading kite, speaking name—raises personal risk (Reconstruction ban) and communal possibility. Visible price: Council exile threat becomes public kneeling; social credit spent. Final image narrows options: rebuilt temple is living organism, irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—whether Lena will remain frozen in grief or re-enter time—signals early and tightens through two somatic beats: palm-press overrides screams, photo release overrides clutch. Cost is visceral: the photograph’s departure is an irreversible forfeiture; leaf’s scent is a new, vulnerable aperture. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure escalates via texture accrual. The final pruning decision narrows her future to active caretaking, foreclosing perpetual stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—render the portrait of self in fractured dark—signals early and tightens once: when the walls begin to close, the option of retreat dissolves. Agency is reframed from painter to canvas, a renunciation paid with bodily risk (library “held her, like hands cupping a flame”). No second reversal, but the single deepening suffuses the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—“understand the thief before time fractures again”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when Kael realizes the thief is reassembling, not stealing, time. The deepening is a single, decisive shift: hunter → would-be co-traveler, paid for by the visible cost of his own ink-stained veins and the irreversible step he takes. Agency is continuous: he activates the drone, decodes the pattern, chooses to follow rather than kill. Escalation is causal, not additive; one meaningful tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. annihilation—signaled in letter’s first line; escalation via irreplicable scandal broadcast. One meaningful tightening: keystroke narrows every future to martyr or fugitive. Cost paid on-page: the bullets. Coincidence absent; antagonistic pressure coherent under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—stay and mend versus flee—is signaled early. Single meaningful tightening: the cracked pane becomes her moment of commitment; stitching it forecloses escape. Cost is visible (she sacrifices dawn departure) and shapes tactics under causal lens. Escalation is modest but sufficient for 700-word frame; no reversal, yet the choice reweights options.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—keep or release daughter’s echo—is signaled by the third paragraph and tightens when the mouth impersonates her. One meaningful deepening: soil refuses to hum, forcing him to dig toward void rather than tree, trading hope of recovery for duty of silence. Cost is visible (garden screams, stems die) and forecloses future retrieval. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens: pattern break → density of sound → final hush; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—does the *Chronicle* live or lie?—tightens twice: ledger reveals father’s betrayal; plates prove arson. Escalation is causal and knowledge-driven; each new document forecloses the “bury the story” option. Visible price: filial myth sacrificed. Could use one earlier obstacle (legal threat, deadline clock) to push into 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—can guilt be silenced?—is signaled in the first letter quote and tightens through each failed offering. Escalation is textural: each swallowed cry increases the firmware’s hum until the mosquito’s twitch flips the pattern. The decisive deepening occurs when the amber cracks, foreclosing erasure as an option and forcing the shift to witness. Price is visible: the singing wings now eternal, her own breath looped into the static.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—access to suppressed communal memory—surfaces early and escalates once: the mandala void forces a now-or-never plunge. That single beat meaningfully narrows Lior’s options (silence vs. revelation) and visibly costs him social insulation. Pressure coherence survives the lyric montage of village voices; the chorus is the off-page elders’ counter-pressure made audible. Could wish for one palpable consequence (threat, exhaustion) post-plunge, but the reconfigured square mural carries enough conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: lure possibility from despair; pressure tightens once when Lydia materializes the mural/child visions that foreclose Elias’s suicide option. Cost is visible—Lydia’s erasure—but the escalation is more imagistic than tactical; Elias’s agency is reactive rather than initiating a second beat.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—see the pathways Mira walked—tightens when the geode’s warmth forces a choice: follow or paint. Agency drives escalation: pressing geode→walls breathe→paint door; each step increases conceptual cost, foreclosing ego-dissolution in favor of stewardship. The painted door is the visible price that alters later options. Coincidence is absent; tension is sentence-level (“the sliver grew heavier”).

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“can the silent world be given voice?”—tightens via escalating sensory proofs: fossil warmth, lichen flare, cave wind. Each micro-turn raises cost: off-limits edict → fossil burn → display crash → rain exile. Agency sits in Lior’s successive palm-presses and final spoken resonance. Cost is legible on skin and in exile from stasis safety; meets high-band test.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—“will the hourglass break?”—is signaled early and tightens when the ledger entry predicts catastrophe. Escalation is textural: each recovered button accretes pressure until the ninth re-sequences fate. Agency resides in Elias’s decision to relinquish control; the cost is the loss of his role as communal time-keeper. No antagonist is needed; coincidence (traveler’s dying whisper) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake is personal redemption vs. permanent exile; the pillbox key tightens the noose by giving her a route back in. One meaningful escalation: refusal to open → opens → commits to coordinates. Cost is the physical pillbox left behind and the exposure of moving toward a target she once fled. Pressure stays coherent under causal lens; no off-stage rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—deliver the travelers alive across an occult threshold—tightens precisely: fog lifts narrow to countdown, gutter silence forecloses retreat. Agency resides in the coachman’s refusal to move before the double signal, then his decisive lurch; girl’s micro-intervention adds second pressure. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable: the girl pays with self-exile, coachman with perpetual custodianship of the needle-rule.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can she risk staying open?—is signaled early via rose petal & war-scarred heart. Escalation is situational: moonlit hush intensifies tactile exposure (blood, cold basil) until the gift of the second tooth crystallizes her stance; no coincidence resolves. One meaningful tightening: acceptance of Elias’s smoother tooth = acceptance of vulnerability. Cost is legible—she forfeits the old lock-logic, pays with trembling song that finds rhythm—meeting 8.4 threshold; lacks persistent tactical constraint for 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—how to live with the memory of genocide—is signaled early and tightens once: the bird attacks its reflection, forcing Lior to trade guilt for independent life. Pressure grows under causal lens (each sundial shard narrows options) and the price—perpetual exile—is felt when he steps through the newly material door. No reversal, but one meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—release versus custody of secrets—tightens once: first spiral gone → second spiral offered, narrowing Liora’s identity from ghost to author of her own exposure. The tightening is textural rather than causal-oppositional, valid under Accumulative lens; cost is felt in the hush after the second orb is lifted. No coincidence resolves the pressure; the final blur of ink accepts imperfection as visible price. The escalation is single but decisive, adequate for 700-word span.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—can humans assert agency against cosmic manipulation—tightens precisely: each frequency tweak narrows options (argument falters, signs droop) and raises bodily cost (skull-pressure, tooth-ache). Escalation is because/therefore driven; no coincidence resolves anything. The final modulation from menace to curiosity is earned by her sustained interference, not luck. One missed beat: no concrete on-page loss (job, relationship) shown, only implied exile.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—retrieve living key or remain trapped in mutiny space—is signaled in paragraph 3 and escalates via each spatial rebellion. The organ’s rising groan externalizes tightening pressure; the floor tilts and roots arch, forcing Elias to adapt grip, breath, timing. Final drive of key into table forecloses retreat and pays with permanent bodily reminder (warm compass point). One meaningful intensification satisfies short-form; cost is on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will he bear witness or erase again?—is signaled by the ribbon’s arrival. Mid-scene tightening: the lance brands the memory, foreclosing denial; the price is the burn in his palm and the irreversible internalization of her echo. Escalation is accumulative: mist → echo → vision → sealed brand. No reversal, but the single deepening satisfies the lens. Cost is visible and persistent; it shapes his next step toward the coughing child.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prove ancestor not coward—faces an immediate test when the breach offers reunion; choosing to let the door close costs the certainty he craves. Escalation is singular but sufficient: atmospheric pressure and narrative pressure rise in lockstep until the glass gives. The price paid (ashes, cracked goggles, cold nail) is visible and alters his stance. Under causal lens, one meaningful tightening satisfies.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“sidestep your own story”—is signaled in second paragraph. One meaningful tightening: the lattice-of-threads image narrows infinite options to one glowing road. Escalation is Accumulative: each leftover object raises mythic density until refusal of old identity is the only release. Cost is conceptual but legible; persistent constraint (song must now feed on him) shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—whether Elias will keep carrying the past—tightens through the accumulating shards: each object (money, cage, cigarette) raises the cost of continued possession. The final discard is a visible price that forecloses the path. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; one decisive intensification suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“decode inscriptions to find sister/burden”—is signaled early. Pressure deepens accretively: each star pulse, telegram crumble, and glyph glow adds density rather than new reversals. The tightening is the thread spooling through his chest, forcing release; cost is the ledger’s disappearance. Agency is present—he reaches for the cup glyph—but escalation is more Textural than Causal.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—uncover what mirrors hide—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens when the plant digests the confession, foreclosing the possibility that the lake is merely evil. Escalation is causal: each vine lash raises the price of truth, culminating in the brother’s “you found me,” which forces Eldrin to own his voyeurism. Visible price: the plant withers, the orchard silences, Eldrin’s posture is “flatter than any blade”—a body-tax for knowledge. One micro-turn suffices; no reversals are needed because the knowledge itself is the irreversible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—unlock the covenant before time swallows it—tightens when the chasm opens and the bridge of roots offers a one-way crossing; retreat is literally removed. Each scar pulse marks rising cost: rooted-shadow memory → yew-key burn → elder-warning. Future-Liora’s refusal deepens, not resolves, tension, forcing stance crystallization. Price is visible: the sealed chasm, the weeping sap turned silver leaf.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“patch the holes in her soul”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when the roots demand the child’s name. One meaningful deepening: the orchard’s price escalates from lullaby to core guilt, foreclosing painless redemption. Agency is continuous: each stitch is a choice that invites sharper cost. The flower’s wilt visible in Veyra’s grip confirms the price is externalized, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—will he assign value or accept uncertainty?—tightens when the cloth rekindles band memory, forcing micro-choice: pocket, not price. Escalation accumulative: each sensory echo (dust motes = lighters, quarry blasts = drum machine) reweights appraisal habit as hollow. Cost visible in final breath-as-metronome, foregoing cash and certainty. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict sufficient and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“understand the physics of leaving”—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightens when the seed must be planted in the crown. One meaningful reversal: wind reverses, leaves ascend, gravity bends; this deepening reweights the stake from scholarly decipherment to embodied transition. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—Elias forfeits the fantasy of undoing death for the poise of double vision—but the price is legible in the final image. Agency is present but gentle; a more kinetic test of commitment could have pushed the score into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder inside routine—surfaces early and tightens once: the choice to liquefy ‘almost’ into a spoon forecloses the key’s original power. Escalation is textural: each object sheds skin, increasing the creel’s hum until the spoon crystallizes the stake. Cost is present but conceptual (theft of an hour) rather than viscerally felt; no tangible loss alters later tactics. Agency is Elias’s smelt-act, yet pressure is situational—visitor arrives, request made—so intensity plateaus rather than spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“dissolve the walls between hearts”—tightens via each shell’s confession; the pearl’s crown is the single decisive escalation that forecloses retreat. Cost is legible: pearl gone, identity subsumed, radio unanswered. No reversal is needed; the pattern’s intensification satisfies the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness versus self-punishment—is signaled in paragraph three and tightened once: the graffiti’s “turn right if you’re sorry” becomes the irreversible choice. Escalation is causal: each decoded line of graffiti strips an evasion (denial of guilt, denial of drought’s human cause) until the only remaining option is the unmapped path. Cost is visible: the bellows’ groan, the bruise-colored sky, the deliberate relinquishing of the map. No coincidence resolves; the bridge is reached by walking, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—recover unspoken words before second letter erases regret—is signaled in paragraph three. Escalation is textural: each reversed tick thickens mist and thins options until the ledger page torn free becomes the last negotiable object. Cost is visible: the library folds, her own veils unravel, the watch falls silent—options narrow to “write or vanish.” Agency is accumulative—she endures the folding reality rather than reversing it—so tension coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: sell artifact vs. free its song. Pressure tightens once: collector’s midnight arrival forecloses delay. Propagation act narrows options to outlaw-gardener identity. Cost visible: loss of fortune, thorn-torn palms. Agency drives every beat; coincidence complicates only (vine reaction).

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—carry the dead’s last spark across oblivion—is signaled early and tightens once: the mirror doorway forecloses her own safe retreat. Pressure accrues through pattern recognition beats; each decoded shimmer narrows options until only mutual touch remains. Cost is legible—chip light extinguished, aurora frequency shifted—but the price to Liora’s own mortality is still conceptual rather than visceral, keeping it shy of 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: to unearth the pre-creation source rather than fragile peace. Tightening occurs when the shoot dissolves into her veins, foreclosing vengeance and re-weighting forgiveness with visceral cost. Escalation is textural—density of spiral imagery—but the protagonist’s agency (pluck, gift) drives the final reconfiguration under Accumulative rules.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—whether Elias will keep absorbing others’ guilt or risk owning his own uncertainty—is signaled early and tightens through each unraveled thread. One meaningful deepening: the shard whispers his own sins, not clients’, forcing a shift from external to internal stakes. Agency is visible in each unhooking; cost is conceptual—loss of moral clarity—rather than visceral, keeping escalation just shy of 8.8+ intensity. Coincidence is absent; pressure coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—how to transmit the paradox of appearing-before-vanishing—remains abstract; no external pressure intrudes on the grotto. The single beat is a cadence shift (trance deepens, age slips) rather than a tightening that forecloses a live alternative; cost is biological but not dramatized as a decision fork.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve the flock’s harmonic pulse—signals early and tightens when the lagging bird drops. Escalation is Accumulative: density of vibration, wind, panic layers until the skimmer’s stance crystallizes. Cost is felt: he forfeits physical safety to become “stone,” a visible price. Missing a second tightening beat keeps it from 8.8+; one deepening is sufficient but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: prove the sacred exists in stubborn flaws, not factory hymns. Escalation tightens once: summit confrontation forces him to choose—cling to institutional praise or keep the candle’s imperfect glow. Agency is renunciation; option foreclosure is literal (keystone left on floor). Cost is social credit and the certainty the deans covet—visible when they “gasp” and he walks out.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“see the color of sound or remain deaf to the world”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens when Elias lights his own lantern inside the frozen sky, paying with his sole possession (the tinderbox) and his former perceptual safety. Escalation is textural: each creak of the Marigold adds a new hue, intensifying the cost of continued listening. Agency is visible; no outside savior. The price (irreversible sensory shift) is legible on the final line. Slight short of 8.8 because the middle lacks a second tactical narrowing—only one deepened beat.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“dissolve or realign”—is signaled early and tightens once when the spiral harmonic forecloses the option to keep listening. Cost is visible: her bodily dissolution and the universe’s erasure of prior time. Under the Accumulative lens the single deepening suffices, though the pressure curve is more lyric than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—“to give names to nameless fears”—is signaled in paragraph five and escalates by each injection of terror-crystal into monster-flesh. One decisive tightening: when the atlas itself whispers “You’ll regret this,” the option to stop is live, yet he rolls it into his ribs, foreclosing retreat. Cost is legible: the first scream he hears on the road is a direct consequence of his naming, proving the price is externalized and rising. Agency remains accumulative rather than causal-per-step, fitting the lyric mode, but the final image unmistakably reweights the world.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restoring the bay—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when drips stutter, forcing the tuning gamble. One meaningful reversal: bell weeps → bay answers, with visible price (bloody fingers, exhausted sleep). Escalation is causal under the chosen lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict. Cost is legible on-page: the bell’s fracture is now a sealed but fragile seam, foreclosing retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—memory’s weight vs. release—tightens when the blank photo fails to erase trauma, forcing the switch to burning. Each photograph choice narrows options under causal lens: keep silence → nail → burn → let reservoir breathe. No coincidence; all escalation is protagonist-activated. Visible price: the bottle sinks, photos turn to ash, and the past is relinquished to the water—cost is on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—harmonize logic and intuition—is signaled early and tightens once: the crystal’s destruction = forfeiture of the rigor-self. Escalation is Accumulative: color, scent, and flame density increase until the world tilts. Cost is visible—“she wouldn’t resist it”—but the external pressure is poetic rather than tactical; options narrow only metaphorically. Still, the renunciation is irreversible and reweights her stance, meeting closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—keep the prototype from weaponization—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened by the silent descent that forbids radio reply. One meaningful deepening: clouds part to reveal curfew-emptied city, making the moral cost of silence visceral. Agency is renunciation; she *“didn’t answer”* the radio, accepting eternal isolation as price. Cost is legible on-page: boot-prints in damp earth, shimmer of spores she can never reclaim.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—wholeness versus erasure—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates by judicial countdown and jar-pulse. One meaningful tightening: the second jar’s arrival makes dissolution concrete, forcing the blood ritual. Cost is visible—the empty glass, the burning banners below—but the merge pain itself is blink-fast; a longer beat of agony could have pushed higher. Still, agency is absolute: Kael’s palm opens the only path that forecloses non-existence.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—safeguarding a space for slow revelation—tightens through seed’s biological clock: split → tendril → bloom. Each escalation is accretive, not adversarial; options narrow to “wait and tend.” Cost is communal time, lost revenue, endured stench; price visible on page. No coincidence; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—restore laughter—tightens when the engine sputters: Elias must choose between phantom proxy and human presence. The off-key wind’s failure is the meaningful escalation that forecloses the tool path. Agency is his renunciation; cost is visible—he abandons the tunnel and the identity of conductor. Under Accumulative lens, the cadence shift (engine cough → real child laugh) reweights stakes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: keep knowledge caged vs. release it—signalled by burned library & cultist mark. Escalation is textural: mist inhales, ground becomes a “breathing page,” tightening the surreal no-escape mood. Agency: her decision to surrender the pendant triggers irreversible unraveling; coincidence does not resolve. Cost is felt—her body and garden dissolve; refusal of old cage is paid with self-dispersion.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—interrupt stifling destiny—tightens when each feeding narrows options: memory lost, doubt consumed, until only the forbidden incantation remains. Escalation is causal under the Hybrid lens: each offering raises the cost (warmth, faith, identity) and forecloses retreat. Visible price: scars vanish, guild flees, Elias becomes “a man who had split the sky.” No reversal beyond the single decisive turn, but that turn is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single dominant stake—hear the unheard—tightens through sensory escalation: static → single note → bone-hum; each intensification forecloses an old way of listening and makes the final jump the only remaining stance.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—get everyone “threaded” before grotto collapse—broadcast early and tightened by radio countdown. Escalation is density-driven: ghost passenger materializes, ceiling patterns snap, water turns silver; each layer raises felt cost. Agency remains Lira’s; she feeds hourglass and merges lanes under pressure. Price legible: grotto seals, passengers carry dual memories, ferry stays unmoored.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—“make visitors feel the texture of connection”—is declared early; pressure escalates as memories are physically woven into space, narrowing to the instant of collective eruption. Cost is diffuse: strangers experience revelation, but Elias pays only the snap of thread, a price too abstract to feel personal. Under Accumulative lens, the deepening pattern succeeds; under personal-stake lens, it needed one irretrievable loss (the mother sunset dissolving, for instance) to tighten above 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—learn alien star navigation or stay blind—signals in paragraph 1 and tightens when Elire chalks the “first true star map,” foreclosing the elders’ vent-chart future. Agency is present: her decision to teach, to hand Kael the link, to draw. Cost is visible—elders’ disapproval, city’s identity rupture—but not viscerally personal (no lost gill, no exile order), so price feels communal rather than intimate. One clear reversal: abyss as terminus → abyss as launch ramp. Sufficient for 600-word scale; a sharper private toll could push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will he heed the dead’s plea?—is signaled in line 3. One tightening: touching the glove collapses his option to remain only a living-world tracer; the price is instantaneous sensory assault and lifelong witness burden. Pressure escalates under causal lens because each beat (whisper → pulse → glove → scream) is a because/therefore linkage. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the vision is earned by his choice.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake=extract one thread of the unremembered before the seam seals; this is signaled in paragraph 3. Escalation is a single upward slope: detector hiss → wall dissolution → blue-lit labyrinth → spike from gold fleck → tidal countdown. The decisive tightening occurs when he kneels at the warped junction box—retrieval becomes irreversible. Cost is legible: claustrophobia conceded, future indenture to the drowned archive confessed in the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—will she keep counting alone or surrender to a collective pulse?—tightens once: the ink’s command “defragment” forces a trade-off between solitary verification and communal static. Cost is legible: the shard’s edge is forfeited, her private rosary absorbed into the chorus. Pressure escalates via pattern intensification—heartbeat, ink swirl, radio waveform—rather than external twist, fitting accumulative lens. No antagonist needed; the void itself grows denser until she steps inside it.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—record the dying language before it vanishes—tightens when the language demands a living voice in payment. Escalation is textural: each echo gains flesh until the towers inhale; the protagonist’s agency is the fatal exhalation into stone. Cost is on-page: copper freezes, voice is swallowed, starlings re-write the script without her. One more beat showing her conscious trade-off would push this into the 8.5+ band, but the pressure curve is legible and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reawaken beauty vs mechanical order—signaled in first paragraph. Tightening occurs when ground cracks and green shoot appears: her music now risks statue retaliation, foreclosing silence/safety. Cost is visible: statues melt, bridge frays, her arms ache. Agency is attention and endurance rather than external victory; sufficient for lyric frame. Could use one earlier micro-loss (a string snaps?) to sharpen price, keeping it just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—delivering the storm without capture—tightens when the seven-minute gap collapses and drones hum closer. Escalation is situational: narrowing patrol window plus bottled tempest force crystallized stance. Cost is visible: scar, lighter flick, storm held to ribs. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal required.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: interpret silence vs. remain mute. Pressure escalates through textured accumulation: mist, song, mirrors—each layer thickens same question. No reversal, but deepening forces stance crystallization in final gesture-song. Cost legible: silence ceases to be refuge, becomes active tool; persistent halo keeps price present.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to reawaken rather than store memory—is signaled early and tightened when the scarf’s threads physically unspool, foreclosing hoarding as an option. Agency is lyric but present: Elias’s decision to read the blanks triggers the hyperbolic rupture. Cost is conceptual yet visible—scarf lost into grout and grain. Pressure escalates via accumulative density of library alterations rather than causal reversals, fitting the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“capture or free the runaway dream”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens through each failed exposure. The third attempt’s success narrows options: the woman pleads, the librarian must choose silence, and the sunrise cipher dissolves into tide-erasure; price is the salt on her pillow. Agency is accumulative rather than causal-turn, fitting the lyric design: each photograph adds density until refusal becomes the only stance left. The final flare does not solve but crystallizes the cost—no reset, only forfeiture—so escalation lands under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—recover stolen memories—signaled early. Escalation: small forgettings → star-gap → identity hollowing → confrontation. Agency visible: Elias presses mushroom, whispers “remember,” trades safety for knowledge. Cost legible: fairy ring dust inhalation (?), lifelong weight of memory restored—felt in “heavy and bright as a starfall.”

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can the apprentice survive the library’s next shadow knock?—is signaled atteacup swirl. One meaningful tightening: annotation marks bind the shadow, foreclosing the option to ignore it. Cost is visible (Kael’s stained fingers, Elspeth’s unspoken “cost of coming back”), but pressure escalation is moderate; the menace never physically endangers the pair, only conceptually threatens. Agency rests with protagonists; no coincidences resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“preserve the color of wonder”—tightens once: when Elias realizes the seed must cross, not bury. Protagonist agency drives every beat: the slice to give, not take, narrows his future to perpetual exile. Cost is visible in the sapling debt and the villagers’ dazed iridescence. Slight reserve: escalation is single-turn, not compounded; still sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—free the drowned vs. keep the town’s lie—tightens once: the decision to let the final knot unravel. The tightening is textural/accumulative rather than causal-reversal; density of light and breath peaks, foreclosing retreat. Cost is felt in the gust of stench and the townsfolk’s future mirror-fog—on-page consequence. Agency is Elias’s micro-choice to drop the needle; luck does not intrude.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: decipher the silence or remain locked out of uncharted time. Escalation arrives with the third reel—her own footage—turning passive watching into active endangering. Cost is the foregone immediate passage; she trades instant entry for deeper listening. Agency is continuous: every film alignment is her literal hand-crank.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single dominant stake—understand Amelia’s threshold—tightens when the globe’s upward snow forces the realization that light has a shadow-cost; agency is intellectual (note the lie) rather than active, and the price is conceptual, felt on the page, but the escalation is one-step, not iterative.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—“silence vs. articulation of need”—tightens when the ghost demands *into*-him egress. One meaningful turn: the spiral-question forces him to choose between becoming vessel or silencer. Cost is visceral: palm-burn, raw throat, and the print-less stone that proves the path is now closed to *him* too. Agency drives escalation; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—can joy be measured inside a frozen prison—signals early and tightens through each datum she deciphers. One meaningful deepening: the numbers shift from cold ledger to love-song, foreclosing the option to flee; she stays to witness the burn. Cost is visible: the laugh is breath-fog instantly dissolved, a transient warmth she pays with frozen lungs. No antagonist needed; the spire’s indifferent architecture supplies coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prove the sky remembers—signaled in paragraph three. Tightening occurs when the snapped string removes retreat; Elias must either catalogue or plummet. Cost is legible: the fall itself, plus the lifelong ledger no one will read. Agency remains his; coincidence only frames, never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake: can the infinite be held/ mirrored inside finite walls? Pressure tightens as dawn and demolition approach; each glass slice raises the material cost of failure. The final collapse is not bad luck but the inevitable test of her wager; the ceiling’s fracture narrows options to renunciation. Price is visible—splintered glass, sap-stained pillow, the blank vellum she chooses not to cut—confirming the limit she must inhabit.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—recover sister stolen by eclipse—is signaled in paragraph 11 and tightens when the child-mirror declares “you’re late.” One meaningful escalation: inserting the third gear dissolves the child’s form, foreclosing retreat; the hall shudders, mirrors weep, option to abandon vanishes. Cost is visible—the watch burns against her skin, and the open door below implies the sister’s resurrection will exact an unseen price. Agency is hers; no coincidence resolves the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—can this place become respite?—is signaled early and deepens as more arrivals plant and ring. Escalation is accretive: each chalk line and repaired channel thickens texture rather than forecloses an option, but the final bell-ring reweights the stake from personal refuge to collective cradle. No visible price is exacted from Liora (no lost alternative, no bodily cost), so the tightening is felt conceptually, not viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—whether to keep stalling or finally release the stolen time—tightens once, decisively, when the puppet head offers a key that reweights the cost from global abstraction to personal annihilation. Agency is absolute: Elias alone turns the key, and the price (his existence) is paid on the page. Under the causal lens, escalation is a single because/therefore linkage that forecloses all future adjustments; no reversals are needed. The visible price—the clock stops, his body remains smiling but empty—charges the final image with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—Liora’s refusal to let another traveler vanish—tightens when she breaks her own rule for the half-dead girl, foreclosing the option of eternal detachment. Escalation is causal: each nut left is a gamble that could expose her; withholding the last nut caps the risk. Cost is visible: she accepts continued exile among memory-stealing trees. No secondary reversal, but one meaningful tightening suffices at this length; the price is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake: transform survivor-guilt into permission to keep living. Pressure tightens once: from static atonement (building bridges) to active dissolution (releasing chrysalis). The renunciation forecloses the last tangible link to his sister, paid immediately by the shock of cold water and the girl’s witness. Cost is visible, but the escalation is a single crest; no secondary reversal, so tension plateaus rather than peaks again.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—who controls the gateway to narrative silence—tightens once: the patron’s demand forces Liora to risk her first sale and her creed. Agency is present (she incises, trades, fractures), cost is legible (moonlight surrendered, slate irreversibly altered). No escalation loop; a single deepening suffices for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: will Elias drown in ingested remorse or transmute it? Pressure intensifies via accretion of tasted grief; the pour is the single tightening that forecloses the “keep carrying” option. Cost is visceral: metallic aftertaste vanishes, replaced by hollow “clean,” a loss of identity trace. No coincidence; all escalation is metabolically earned.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—can the town’s working rhythm be re-synchronized across languages?—is signaled in Elias’s second line. Escalation is a single tightening: the missing weight → linguistic ledger; each step forecloses retreat to monolingual habit. The cost is visibly social and tactical: Liora risks ostracism for theft, Elias risks ridicule for trusting “a hunk of brass,” and both hazard the elevator’s final breakdown if the experiment fails. No reversal, but the deepening of communal participation (whistle answering whistle) gives agency to the whole cast without diluting protagonists’ choices.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—access to lost memories—tightens with each reflection shard; the final tilt forecloses the option of remaining a detached engineer, paying the price of porous selfhood. Pressure escalates by density, not reversal: each new memory-specter increases psychic load until stance crystallizes. Cost is conceptual but legible; a more visceral price (bleeding palm, nosebleed, data-overload seizure) would have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—retrieve a seed that might reenter her brother’s lost moment—is signaled early and tightens when the threshold collapses and only one seed is seized. The inversion clock narrows options; her lunge to brush a single jar is visible agency under pressure. Cost is legible: blank manuscript, sealed chamber, seed glowing inside her body. Escalation is a single decisive intensification rather than a chain, keeping it just below the 8.5+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prove silence is not absence—tightens when the oak’s first true note startles birds and Elias realizes the grove can remember. Agency is accumulative: each strum deepens pattern until renunciation becomes the only non-betrayal. Cost is visible in the fever-hot insulator and his numbed fingers. No coincidence; pressure grows via sonic density.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake: can silence be made beautiful before the next phase erases all rules? Pressure tightens when the girl unveils the Eclipsed Covenant board, forcing Elias to decide whether to reenact the blood-opening or invent a gap-based reply. His renunciation (handing over the stone) forfeits authority yet creates the first non-violent covenant—cost legible in the lighter-than-silence chest. Agency throughout; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“can empathy remain passive?”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when fireworks force the literal question “what do you do when empathy isn’t enough?” The diary’s final silence-of-choice entry + sketch of two hands act as micro-reversal, foreclosing the option to stay neutral. Cost is visible: Elias abandons lifelong withdrawal, exposes himself to community scrutiny, forfeits anonymity. Escalation is textural (pattern of silences growing heavier) rather than causal-chain, fitting the Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can serenity exist inside motion?—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when the bloom mirrors sway instead of halting it. Agency drives escalation: stealing seed, inhaling mirror, plucking petal, hanging bridge—each act narrows retreat back to Elder stillness. Visible price: the bloom’s public scent strips her privacy; the unlocked vault formalizes permanent loss of exclusivity. Cost is legible on-page in the violet ink bleed and the villagers’ silent permission.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—retrieve the source of resilience—tightens when the fracture is revealed as a living mouth, narrowing options to reach inside or retreat. One-hour gravity inversion acts as live clock; moss acceleration and seed pulse raise on-page cost of delay. Final choice to plant inside the untouched core forecloses safe return, scales stakes from personal to planetary. Cost is legible: mentor relic lost, skin colonized, next inversion risk assumed.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stake: human reflexes vs adaptive urban organism; tightening occurs when the wind *recoils* from the flare, proving the system learns faster than she does. Cost: shattered instrument, lost talisman, limp away. Agency survives via renunciation; no coincidence resolves the vortex.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—wonder vs. control—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens at each chime: first dissolves silence, second melts ice, third forfeits elders’ sanction. Agency is continuous; no coincidence. Cost accumulates in visible environmental loss (sheet, frost, aurora’s prior wildness). One meaningful deepening suffices; the final refusal to dim the sky is the tightening turn.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: guardianship vs surrender to the weave. Pressure escalates via hush-density: the first flute note questions, the second splits air, the third widens the breach—each moment concretely forecloses sealing. Child’s laughter is the external pressure; Elias’s agency is the decision to follow, paid with abdication of role. Cost is dramatized: flute abandoned, bones behind, identity erased—visible in the final marker pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: can Elias extract emotion’s equation without being consumed? Tightening occurs when the press prints his own face—first irreversible intrusion of borrowed grief into self. Cost legible: he forfeits emotional distance, ends “unborrowed” laugh. Escalation is density/pattern under Accumulative lens; no causal reversals needed.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—carry or lose the mentor’s hum—tightens when pendant vibration redirects from seeds to bridge. One decisive deepening: seed crushed → vine sings → bridge spans → courier must walk, foreclosing retreat. Price is visible energy extracted from his body and mentor’s memory to grow the bridge. Under causal lens, each because/therefore linkage narrows option until only forward into fade remains.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“prove objects absorb emotion”—tightens when absorption reverses: the prism starts returning. One decisive turn at the frost-face suffices; options narrow to hold or hurl. Cost is physical (cut palm) and epistemic (forfeits proof). Agency is continuous; coincidence merely reveals, never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—send message across impossible distance—tightens when the bead’s silence is converted to thread; the act forecloses reunion for the spinner and sets the price for the lover. Escalation is one decisive intensification: weaving the silence into the map. Cost is visceral: her lifetime, her body, her name. Agency is renunciation rather than victory, perfectly scaled to lyric scope.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“coax resilience from rubble”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened once: the silk’s disappearance into the fissure forecloses retreat, forcing the smith’s palm-to-stone wager. Cost is the spent artifact and the audible planetary “yes” that now obliges villagers to maintain new bridges; price is social and material. Agency is continuous (feed, kneel, press palm, climb, bend metal). No reversals needed under Accumulative lens; the single deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—discover the weight of a withheld truth—tightens when the shard’s color flip proves the rewrite is real, forcing her final choice. Escalation is one meaningful turn under Causal lens; cost is legible (she forfeits fixed reality to become map). Could edge higher if an earlier concrete loss (tool, stamina) had altered tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—bottling safety—signaled in first paragraph and escalates via each new artifact: letter → sketch → blue glass. Protagonist agency: burn letters → climb stairs → add stone → write back → stay; each act forecloses silence/exit. Cost is tangible: forsaking the skiff, accepting endless upkeep. One meaningful tightening suffices; luck complicates (bottles arrive) but never solves. Slight cap because escalation is steady rather than sharply irreversible before final image.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—command the storm before it commands her—is signaled in line 1 and tightens when she chooses to let the wick burn low, trading tomorrow’s oil for tonight’s containment. That single micro-turn forces a trade-off visible on the page: the flame “dip toward drowning” is the price that keeps the shadows from seizing dawn. Agency is continuous—every adjustment of the lantern narrows options under the Causal lens. Cost accumulates: ozone sting in nostrils, warm hands that already ache for the next climb.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—how to bear the measurable weight of sorrow—tightens once: the sextant’s pulse forces Elias from passive curiosity to active surrender. No reversals needed under Accumulative lens; the deepening occurs via mirrored faces and the final lighter-hands beat, both legible costs. Pressure stays coherent: each lyrical echo (labyrinth breathing, trees absorbing) raises the emotional tariff until he chooses conduit-hood. Could use one more intermediate tactic altered by the grief-load (a dropped trowel, a mis-set stone) to push escalation into 8.5+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—realm-death vs. personal obliteration—is signaled in the first paragraph and escalates through each failed shard until the orchard “shudders…hungry.” One meaningful deepening: the moment Liora realizes the mirror world is not just dying but starving for the very memories she hoarded; this flips her from extractor to donor. Cost is repeatedly legible: bleeding fingers, burnt throat, spent voice; final price is her keeper identity dissolved into choral body. No coincidence; escalation is driven by her persistent song under accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can she confront her mistake—tightens when the invitation burns in her pocket and the mirrors refuse to show her face. Agency is exercised twice: ascending the stairs, locking the door. Midnight clock and “never locked” rule create visible price. One meaningful deepening suffices; cost is on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will the city keep adjusting to erasure?—signals in paragraph two. Tightening occurs when first loaf provokes public weeping: option to ignore vanishes. Protagonist agency: Liora’s guerrilla-gardening decision thrusts bread into circulation, forcing collective confrontation. Cost legible in palace guards’ kneeling foreheads—social order visibly forfeited.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—extract meaning before vows vanish—tightens when the slide’s wild frequency invites him to abandon extraction for participation. Each shelf-drop raises the cost of hesitation. Agency is interior but decisive: stepping onto the bridge forecloses the measuring life. The escalation is accumulative rather than causal, fitting the lens; one meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—will the compass confirm her outsider status or force her inside the weather—tightens once: the needle stabs her own reflection, foreclosing measurement as an option. Agency remains hers: she *licks* the air, *laughs*, *steps* forward, each act volunteering deeper into the storm she becomes. Cost is visible on the page: ring dissolved, shadow detached, taste permanently altered. No second reversal is needed; the single deepening satisfies the 600-word lens.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—escape monochrome half-life into lived color—tightens once: the lock’s dial is turned to an exact memory-angle, splitting the wall and foreclosing the old stance. Escalation is causal: each recalled image increases pressure until the painting literally folds open, a visible price paid on the page. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the protagonist’s mnemonic precision drives the turn. Cost is persistent: the cave keeps the lock and the surface will still demand greys, but the pigment on the ladder proves the path is sealed.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—survive the cost of candor—signals early and tightens with each beat: physical wilting → entering a lung-constricting tunnel → offering one’s own blood-ink to the Archive. The meaningful turn is the moment the plate blanks: all escape routes (return to gilded lies, retrieve another map) are foreclosed in a single image that externalizes the price. Escalation is protagonist-driven; coincidence is absent. The final cost is conceptual yet visceral: the plate’s erasure literalizes that honesty consumes its own vessel.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—preserve wonder via vibration—is signaled early and tightens through each chime strike that thins the ice. The irreversible shatter constitutes a visible price that forecloses possession, satisfying escalation under Accumulative lens. No external antagonist is needed; wind and material physics supply coherent pressure. The beat count is minimal, allowing only one decisive intensification, hence capped below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can the courtyard reconstitute itself around absence—signals early via locket hum. One meaningful tightening: the lock gives way only when Mira accepts joint custodianship, foreclosing private ownership of story. Cost is legible: the courtyard must keep feeding the mailbox, a persistent constraint. Agency is collective, not solo, fitting situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: free the secrets or drown with them. Escalation is textural: layered journals → dice roll → console awakening → water ingress; each beat intensifies density and cost. Protagonist agency every step: dance is the only password; refusal to grab notebooks forecloses archive path. Coincidence absent; tide is inevitable, not convenient. Price visible: lab floods, knowledge lost, skin becomes sole codex.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—retrieving excised memories—tightens when the stone’s weight lurches and the air tears open her name-shaped gravity ripple. Escalation is textural: each pattern (grounds, petals, salt) accretes until the chamber’s pocket yawns, foreclosing the possibility of full recovery. Visible price: stone dissolves, flowers ash, lantern guttered; tactics must shift to “new flowers, new grounds” for the next whale. Cost is felt, though the external risk (death) remains conceptual rather than corporeal.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“hush the prophecy or the world unravels”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened when the thread breaks free and she fails to catch it, visible price paid in silver-bleeding wing and seared skin. Agency is accumulative: each silence-mappings adds weight-loss to the prophecy; the final quiet is earned, not gifted. No coincidence; pressure coils through cadence shift (murmur → breath → snap → sigh). One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“make the building speak”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when the blood contract forecloses retreat. The interrogation beat is the single meaningful escalation: protagonist forces the wall to confess, price is the ghost-silhouette and his tutor-vacancy. Under Accumulative lens the meteor-cadence shift reweights cost; no reversal overload, just one decisive intensification, cleanly landed.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—prevent own memory erasure—signaled in third paragraph. Escalation is accretive: each memory fed blackens then silver petals, tightening cost from personal loss to public outbreak. Final tightening when patrol reaches; lily-offer crystallizes stance with irreversible bodily arrest. Agency全程由她主动挖掘、献花；运气仅构成阻力而非解法。

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—whether the forger will erase the regime’s lethal records—signals early and tightens once: the thorn touches paper, options collapse, cost is irreversible. Pressure grows under causal lens; no coincidence resolves anything. The Emperor’s "Teach me" crystallizes a Resonant Reconfiguration that forecloses tyranny without a sword drawn. One tightening is sufficient; escalation is micro but sufficient for 600-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“Why do I echo?”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the shell’s third riddle forces her to the drop. Escalation is causal: each disclosure peels a layer, narrows options, raises bodily risk (bones arranged, threads throbbing). Final cost is irreversible: she silences the universe’s reply forever, trading knowledge for peace. No coincidence; every turn is agency-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—salvage purity from wreckage—signaled in paragraph 1 and deepened when Lena risks her own traumatic relic. Single meaningful tightening occurs when the globe reveals the child instead of the fisherman, forcing widow and Lena to trade grief currencies. Visible price: Lena’s memory of mother’s silent reproach surges, glacier groans louder—pressure made audible. Coincidence absent; revelation stems from Lena’s deliberate “expose” action pressing globe to palms.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—learning to see hidden effort—tightens when Liora’s failed whistle is corrected, forcing her to breathe in rhythm with exploited women and fish. Agency is hers: she chooses mimicry, pays with prior certainty, forecloses spectator distance. No coincidence; moon path is tool, not savior. Cost is visible in her suddenly “steady breath,” but the external price (time, social risk) stays implicit, keeping it shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—truth vs survival—tightens when the stillpoint reveals the Liquidation was quarantine, not cover-up. The single reversal (“the lie that kept them alive”) narrows his options to either seal or release the cure; he chooses release with bodily annihilation. Cost is legible: disappearance + radio voice inheriting the message. Pressure escalates under causal lens—every discovery increases personal jeopardy rather than mere information.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—become prophet or stay listener—tightens with each transmission until the crack forces a choice. Escalation is causal: louder voices therefore reinforced portico therefore sacrificed receiver. Cost is visible: the silence he buys is “worse than the static,” and the city’s spires are “bones of old gods.” One meaningful turn suffices; no reversals needed.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—becoming translator vs. solitary hoarder—tightens when the girl’s arrival forces immediate choice: seal the dawn-song or hand it over. That hand-off is the single meaningful turn; it forecloses the hoarding path and crystallizes the new vocation. Pressure accumulates through sensory density (salt, groaning beams, wobbly note) rather than external antagonist. Cost is legible in the box’s flaking key and Elias’s tremor; no coincidence is used to resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—prevent sphere resonance—tightens once: key turn forecloses retreat and triggers visceral cost. Escalation is Accumulative: subsonic ache → molar hum → bone vibration → cellular unraveling, all legible. No reversal, but the single deepening is decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—prove that patience, not violence, unyokes the world—tightens once: ice shifts from prison to launchpad. Protagonist agency is continuous observation; the final lift is external yet causally seeded by his moon-path calculations, so cost remains legible. No coincidence resolves; pressure coheres under quiet causal lens. Visible price: ostracism and surrender of heroic drama.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—city vs. buried truth—arrives early and escalates through one sharp tightening: the recognition that “they’re flooding the old routes.” That single insight forecloses neutrality; silence becomes complicity. Cost is visible in the trembling wall and the forfeited safety of retreat. No mechanical reversals, but the pressure jump from investigative curiosity to existential complicity is cleanly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can Elias build, not merely preach, absolution—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when the heart is bolted into the silent box, foreclosing further delay. The storm and the sealed letter supply visible prices; the walk through rain is a deliberate forfeiture of dry comfort for the sake of deserts. One meaningful reversal: from waiting for forgiveness to manufacturing it. Agency remains causal under the inferred lens; no outside rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prove flight that *pulls* air—signaled in first paragraph and tightens when workshop begins to sink. One meaningful escalation: the kaleidoscope image converts doubt into redesigned wing-angle, narrowing options to “launch now or sink with wreckage.” Acid splash costs flesh/time; fused arrow is permanent price. Agency drives every beat; no coincidences resolve tension.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—recover the deleted dead before the system erases her—surfaces in the second paragraph and tightens exactly once when the firewall flares and termination is threatened. Agency is decisional: she uploads the crystal knowing it will flag her; this act forecloses escape. Cost is visible on-page: “flagged for termination” appears in the same beat as the upload. Persistent constraint (numeric trail) shapes every tactical move; escalation stays causal, not coincidental. Missing only a slightly sharper tactile price in the final beat to reach 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—prevent the girl’s solitary sacrifice—emerges via visions early; tightening comes when Elias angles mirrors to “rewrite the ending.” Cost is the surrendered safety of passive peacekeeper role. Escalation is atmospheric rather than tactical; no new obstacle or reversal after mirror adjustment, holding score in strong but not exceptional band.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—command over her own ending—tightens when the dog veers onto unstable ice, forcing her to wager her body against a life she hadn’t valued. One decisive deepening: initials inside tip re-code “Endings Matter” from family relic to moral injunction. Escalation is internal yet visible: each step across ice subtracts certainty of clinic appointment until cancellation feels like falling through floe. Price is felt: the laugh that “startled her” is the first unpaid-for moment she’d budgeted out of existence.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—whether remaining sentinel is sentence or covenant—signals early; pressure tightens once through charcoal sketch act that externalizes memory and forecloses leaving tonight. Cost is felt: he accepts perpetual loneliness ("the sentinel’s work was never done") and the letter physically weighs on his chest. Escalation is quiet but causal under lyric lens; coincidence absent. Could edge higher if external vineyard threat (weather, debt) pressured, yet internal sufficiency keeps score solid.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—transmute communal pain—tightens once: the exact moment the butterfly lands on the fence, forcing the shutter click that forecloses further field-work. Escalation is accumulative: each layered photograph increases density until the final image detonates meaning. No external reversals needed; the internal cost is the archivist’s acceptance that she can now leave without ache. Agency is present, price visible (“the case was lighter”), fulfilling lens-specific test.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—decode why language stopped—tightens when crystal reveals underground growth. Single escalation: solitary study → shared mapping. Agency visible: Elias physically tests crystal, then accepts stranger’s hand, foreclosing isolated path. Cost legible but not viscerally scaled; could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—break the echo-loop or keep hunting it—signaled in paragraph 1. Tightening occurs when sculpture moves: the sought voice externalizes, forcing choice. Cost is the visible destruction of prophet toolkit (arrows snapped, chalk dust). Escalation is textural: fog thickens, tape hum, metal groans—density, not external antagonist, narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—harness vs. release the ephemeral—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when the clock hand offers the literal choice to restructure the moment. Escalation is textural: each camera refracts time, deepening the stake until the only option is to become the motion. Cost is visible—“he left the spinning hand where it was”—a permanent forfeiture of his repairer identity. No coincidence; the leaf sound is causal payoff to the pattern taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—shadows are not missing but predatory—arrives on line 7 and escalates through each key turn: first key awakens witness, second key opens the predator’s lair. Agency remains with Elara at every node; no coincidence rescues or complicates. Cost is visible—she forfeits the normal world irrevocably when she steps through the sun—but the price is front-loaded (“the last scholar became a shadow”) rather than dramatized inside her body in the final beat, keeping the escalation just shy of the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“make it right” after the world allowed a fake brother—signaled by line 3. One meaningful tightening: the changeling’s forehead press collapses Liora’s options into either bargain or permanent loss. Cost is visible: the tooth dissolves, the changeling sheds its skin, the needle keeps humming—payment is ongoing. Escalation is causal, not additive: each beat narrows exit ramps until only the star-map offer remains. No coincidence resolves; the garden’s response is conditional on her framed offer.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—transmit non-consuming light—surfaces early and tightens once: the girl’s request forces Liora to surrender her private anchor. The beat narrows options (keep the glass = hoard the ethic; give it = risk dilution) and carries visible price. Under Accumulative lens, the deepening is the transfer moment; no further reversals are needed at 750 words. The cost is palpable, but because the girl arrives as an innocent supplicant rather than an antagonistic force, pressure feels gentle, not piercing—hence 8.4, not 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake established early: can silence be rebuilt after viral exposure? Tightening occurs when Lena cedes the pendant—she surrenders her last acoustic shield, foreclosing retreat. Escalation is textural: each moss transplant thickens the garden’s hush and her public nakedness. Cost is felt; no reversal, but option foreclosure satisfies accumulative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—control of narrative vs surrender to it—tightens when the faceless accuser appears; the option to keep drowning the voices is foreclosed by Elias’s oral surrender to the shell. The price is literal dissolution, visible on-page. Escalation is accumulative: each cameo adds density until the pattern breaks in the rewrite. No causal reversals are needed under the lyric/accumulative lens; the deepening is sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—arbor survival—signaled in first paragraph and intensifies with every sung syllable. One meaningful tightening: the moment she feels the heartbeat slowing, silence becomes an existential threat; song becomes the only tactic left. Cost is visceral (burned throat, trembling fingers) and conceptual (lifetime avoidance abandoned). No coincidence; escalation is purely because/therefore linkage under song-as-key.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—can starlight be taught to stay—tightens once: the paper “drank the starlight from her veins,” foreclosing further attempts tonight and visible in the pulsing map. Pressure is accumulative: each discarded fragment added raises the cost of failure, but there is no external antagonist or second reversal; the risk is internal dissipation. The price (blood, cold, time) is legible on the page and shapes the final sealing gesture. Sufficient for this length and lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—salvaging wonder before the wounded season ends—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when the ice starts “weeping,” forcing faster work. Escalation under Accumulative lens: each gear alignment adds density until the lullaby breaks loose; no coincidence, just pattern completion. Protagonist agency drives every beat (sketches, gear turns, final decision to leave device running). Cost is conceptual but undeniable: he trades future secrecy for one fragile playback. A hairline slip is that the “thaw” risk is told, not shown as a ticking clock.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: can Elira divest the accumulated burdens before they dissolve her. Escalation is textured: each calcified grief adds density to the hush until the grotto itself demands restitution. Agency is present—she tilts the lamp, sings, refuses the child’s fear—but the final grotto push is externally triggered rather than driven by her prior choice. Cost is legible: she loses her shadow-self, gains a “light as held breath” companion—an earned trade-off under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—how to keep the husband present without being consumed by absence—tightens when the first carving is kept instead of sold, foreclosing income. Escalation is accretive: each finished lion increases the widow’s emotional debt until the final refusal to sell crystallizes the cost (coins jingling like “hollow promises” is the audible price). No external antagonist is needed; the conflict is between release and retention, resolved by the micro-choice to leave the last lion in the light. Coincidence is absent; pressure is purely internal yet legible.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single dominant stake—whether Lira will surrender to or outrun her accumulated past—tightens when the lagoon churns out every failed self. The blank frame is the visible price that forecloses the fantasy of reconstruction; her jump is agency choosing immersion. Escalation is textural: each resurfaced ghost increases density until renunciation is the only option left.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can the town regain a viable route out—tightens once: from impossible spaceport to imperfect pedestrian bypass. Agency is continuous: she excavates, maps, redirects water, sketches detour; each micro-act forecloses the fantasy of flights and incurs civic-material cost. No external antagonist needed; pressure is internal (her compulsion) vs. structural (rusted maze). Price is legible on-page: the terminal’s resurrection is partial, belief permanently downgraded from cosmic to terrestrial, paid for with her career risk and the town’s scaled-down hope.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single dominant stake—will he resurrect the forbidden orrery—tightens when petrichor nostalgia unravels his stasis; the fracture under his palm is the visible cost that forecloses retreat. Escalation is textural: density of silence, echo, and unfinished gears accumulates until the cadence shift of release; no external coincidence required. Agency is present in every beat: he rises, kneels, spreads the crack, retrieves, arranges; these micro-actions progressively foreclose obedience to elders. Price is legible—crystal fracture, audible sob-chime, and looming heresy charge—altering tactics from concealment to open defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—parse father’s map vs. abandon it—signalled early; tightening occurs when shadow refuses north, forcing inward reorientation. Protagonist agency drives every plot inch: salvage, steer, drop ledger, keep sundial. Cost is visible (ledger sinks, future gold foregone) and conceptual (identity recast as “unsteady, not lost”). No antagonist needed; pressure coheres through environmental quiet and radio void.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—“tend the archive or let it drown”—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates when Elias realizes the rope is an acoustic time-capsule; the tightening is the decision to splice the seed, which forecloses leaving the past untended. Cost is visible: he abandons the visible harbor for fog with no compass but the singing rope. One meaningful turn suffices; no coincidence resolves. Slight reserve: the off-stage tolling bell is a gift from weavers, not earned by his agency, keeping it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can absence be narrated into bearable shape?—tightens once: finding the locket converts abstract commission into concrete quest. No antagonist; pressure is accumulative density of images that force Elias to shift from chronicler to caretaker of possibility. Cost is legible: he forfeits closure for the princess, choosing perpetual story-travel. Coincidence (locket half-buried) complicates without resolving; agency remains his decision to carry both thread and locket into next ship-cycle.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reawaken beauty or concede to mechanical numbness—signaled in paragraph 3. Single meaningful tightening: the membrane puncture forecloses safety, forces live with flawed creation. Escalation under Accumulative lens: each sensory layer (dust, rust, salt, stained-glass light) intensifies the cost of failure. Creature’s lurching flight is not victory but irreversible consequence, price paid on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: prove scars can sing—her own and the boy’s—signaled in paragraph two. Pressure tightens once: the boy’s wound forces her to test her ethic publicly; refusal to flee costs her social credit on-stage. Cost is visible—blood on thread, coin dulled, village whispers crystallized. No artificial escalation; single tightening is sufficient for 750-word frame.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—liberate trapped memories versus risk city-wide rupture—tightens when the chamber trembles and threads snap; cost is visceral (box warms, dust rains). Escalation is causal and single-turn: tearing the threads cannot be undone, foreclosing retreat. Price is on-page: the fountains spew light instead of water, an irreversible urban mutation. No coincidence; the decision is hers alone.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—“share light without burning”—is signaled early and tightens when the gear demands a memory as toll, forcing a trade-between-equally-precious-goods (nostalgia vs. future). Escalation is textural: each sonar ping layers luminous threads until the path coheres, reweighting the cost of transit. Agency is interior but genuine: she actively relinquishes the memory rather than having it stolen. However, the external garden remains passive; no environmental pushback raises the physical danger, so the pressure is conceptual, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—can grief be given shape?—is signaled in the opening paragraph. Pressure tightens when the granite cracks, foreclosing the name-carving path and forcing the hollow-space tactic; this is the single meaningful deepening required at this length. Cost is visible: ruined stone, butterfly relinquished, daughter’s tremor. Agency remains internal/artistic rather than external-oppositional, fitting Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: will Elias look away or absorb the town’s buried crime? Each loosened knot escalates personal risk—spectral accusation, scent of drowning, husband’s bribe—until refusal carries the cost of complicity. Agency is continuous: he could stop at any knot, yet chooses to keep decoding. The final tightening is conceptual: silence now equals active guardianship of the dead.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—city’s voice vs. execution—signals early. One meaningful tightening: girl’s arrival forces Elias to choose visibility over safety. Cost is visible: blank scores left behind, his exile implied. Escalation causal under broadcast-to-reprisal lens; no coincidence resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: the cost of sustaining the “mirage of safety” through deliberate incompleteness. Escalation is textural: each scattering tightens the paradox—understanding is the enemy, so she must destroy what she nearly understood. The powder resettle is the decisive intensifier that narrows her path to perpetual itinerancy. Price is visible—blood at temples, sleepless draft, ashes lost by morning—but the tightening could be sharper if one patron almost recognized the face before it dissolved.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—personal truth vs. civic erasure—signaled on page 1 and intensifies when pumps literally flood his evidence. One meaningful tightening: Veyra’s warning that tunnels will be drowned converts abstract threat into irreversible countdown. Elias’s agency drives every turn (sort, hide, blockade) and extracts visible price (hands bleed, starvation risk, final death). Cost scales and lands on-page, no deus-ex-machina.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can harmony exist after cultural noise has stripped the choir?—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: density of absence increases as each singer drops out, tightening the remaining four around the rosette’s hollow. The meaningful tightening is Elias’s decision to lead with silence; this narrows options from “rehearse” to “listen,” with felt cost of perpetual fragility. Agency is renunciatory rather than proactive, fitting Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can memories ethically nourish?—tightens once: seed → fruit → broth. Agency drives each jump; no off-stage relief. Tightening beat at fruit-slice: knowledge influx collapses old chef identity, narrows future to feeder-of-ruins. Cost is legible: reputation, rule-breaking, irreversible public broth-service. Coincidence absent; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens. One deepening suffices for 700-word piece; could wish for earlier external pushback (critics enter only late) to nudge into 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—restoring wonder inside a seamless city—surfaces early and tightens once: seed-in-node forces a public trade-off (wonder vs predictable grid). Cost is visible—Elias’s empty box, his impending disbelief by engineers—but the escalation is single-pulse; no secondary narrowing of options. Agency is present but not high-stakes peril; the tightening is lyrical, not tactical. Sufficient for length, yet a sharper physical risk or resource loss could have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“kill or rescue the new god”—tightens through successive knowledge reversals that shrink options from assassination to midwifery. Escalation is causal: each revelation (city planted, poison meant for old root, city waiting) forces the intruder to reevaluate the ampoule’s purpose, culminating in the structural rupture that costs breathable air. Visible price paid: helmet abandonment equals death of former self. Slight dip because the scholars’ motive remains off-page, muting ethical pressure compared to cosmic awe.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure tightens when the chipped die’s return-path reveals the staircase is a closed loop with one manipulable flaw; this single deepening narrows Lena’s options to sideways leap or eternal upward trudge. The cost is conceptual but felt: she forfeits the fantasy of exit, embracing perpetual motion as chosen stance. Agency is clean—no outside interference, only pattern re-cognition.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—can kindness left on a leaf be remembered by the city?—is legible from the gift of the brush and accumulates through each glyph that may vanish with daylight. Escalation is textural rather than causal: every added character (laughing child, absent calligrapher) widens the circle of unknowable receivers, tightening the emotional cost of failure rather than the physical risk. The missing-leaf/clarified-moon dyad supplies the single meaningful tightening that reweights options; the price is conceptual (ephemeral art) rather than visceral. For 700 words, one deepening is sufficient, but the lack of an on-page obstacle that could destroy the leaf keeps this shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—rescue of dissolving cultural memory—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the clumsy “K” loaf foreshadows total loss. One meaningful turn: lens-to-oven transfer rewrites the bread alphabet, foreclosing the safe path of mere guardianship. Cost is visible—irreplaceable lens sacrificed, fingertips bloodied—meeting the 8+ band requirement, though pressure plateaus rather than spikes again.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“step beyond fate’s design”—is signaled in paragraph four and escalates with each backward spin. The yoyo’s violet flare physically narrows options: stones peel, path angles downward, Elias can only descend or retreat. Retreat is foreclosed when the tide reclaims the route; the price (erasure from reality) is felt on-page. One meaningful tightening suffices; no coincidence resolves, only his initiated pull.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“unbosom the thing that wears your face”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when he extracts the heartbeat-negative, foreclosing return to pre-resuscitation anonymity. Escalation is textural: each mirror smear intensifies the stake until the clasp snaps. Agency is active; no coincidence resolves. Cost is the permanent photographic curse, now weaponized.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—turn storm into rhythm—tightens with each strike: first a dull thunk, then a bruise-bloom, finally sea-voice chord that forecloses retreat. Escalation is causal under lens: each note raises cost (sky-hand clenches, mast-split memory invoked, tide finds a throat). Final tightening abandons safety—orchard may sink—yet Leeward chooses next note. Price visible on page: restlessness converted to euphoric risk.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—uncover what happened to lost expedition—tightens when the shell crack replies, proving the taken are alive and the gate is reopening. One meaningful escalation: whistle sequence → harmonic answer → watchers advance → gate screams; each step forecloses retreat. Cost visible: whistle disintegrates, city shakes, Elyas forfeits return. Agency remains his (he initiates each sequence); watchers complicate but do not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.5)
    Central stake—truth vs. institutional faith—announced early with petal image. The meaningful tightening is Elias abandoning the priceless Codex to keep a photo; that single photo is now his only leverage and life-endangering liability. Escalation is causal: he forces Callahan to acknowledge complicity, which summons police; options collapse to flight. Price is viscous: tenure, safety, reputation lost; the final image of tracks leading nowhere shows option foreclosure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve meaning from abandonment—tightens when he answers the stranger’s note and seals it, narrowing future options to perpetual archive. One meaningful deepening: the Keeper’s ledger reweights the stake from casual surveyor to inheritor. Cost is visible: he gives up the inkwell and any exit from the obsession. Accumulative escalation suffices under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaimed stillness versus institutional erasure—signals early and tightens when the coordinates prove the archive was hidden, not lost. One meaningful escalation suffices: the discovery that his own decisions are already logged collapses option space from search to complicity. Cost is legible—he forfeits the ledger’s truth to keep the archive undisturbed, a renunciation that alters his indexing practice forever. Agency drives every turn; coincidence complicates (blackout timing) but never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single stake—recover/resign the daughter’s voice—tightens when the gem bites and forecloses retreat; the ascent is irreversible, cost paid in corporeal erasure under causal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—access to the unmade moment—spikes visibly when the thread brightens; agency is her finger over ENTER. Escalation is one tightening: from observing pattern to risking collapse of reality for one uncaptured choice. Cost is legible: permanent exile from any repaired future—she steps into blackout with only memory. No coincidence; all pressure is self-inflicted by her console choice.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“decode the frequency of belonging”—is signaled early and tested when Lena steals the chip, narrowing her option to either keep solitude or share the sky. One meaningful tightening suffices: slot opens, alliance forms, cost paid. Escalation is situational: pressure crystallizes stance rather than multiplying reversals. The price—exposure to another human—feels scaled to 740 words.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: the slow sieving of truth until only the unsaid remains—signaled in opening image. Tightening occurs when the sea returns the note: the hush acquires a deadline, foreclosing perpetual evasion. Protagonist agency: he hurls the watch, then elects to keep the paper—two on-page acts that re-weight options. Cost is felt: seven years of manufactured absolutions collapse into one tomorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—neutral negotiator’s credibility vs. boy’s life—tightens once: intel offer for nephew, no second reversal. Escalation is causal under storm-clock; moon-phase mention adds texture but doesn’t drive the turn. Price is visible: cache lost, boy freed, negotiator’s neutrality further eroded. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—redeem vs. repeat abandonment—signalled in paragraph 1. Escalation: each pole walked increases social exposure cost; tightening peaks when he opens tear-stained letter in public. Agency drives every increment; luck absent. Price visible: surrender of sea-self, visible bruise of compass digging ribs.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether Liam will accept the cost of reclaiming empathy—tightens once yet decisively: the lake offers either erasure or stewardship, never both. Escalation is situational pressure, not multi-reversal; agency is expressed through the throw that literally parts his possible futures. Cost is visible: the collapsed tunnel removes retreat; the chess board in lamplight externalizes the lifelong match against his own violence. Coincidence is decorative (glow discovery) and does not resolve conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—undo death—tightens through successive spice-assisted tries; each failure narrows her option set and exacts sensory cost. Agency remains hers: she pulls the second time, not the stag. Escalation is textural rather than causal, but density increase (cinnamon → nutmeg → ash) reweights stakes satisfactorily. Cost is legible on-page (burnt fingers, ash in pocket).

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“find where lost time accumulates”—tightens when the saucer-map reveals each crack is a stolen year, forcing her to repay with repentance. Single meaningful deepening suffices; option set narrows from rescue to release. Cost is legible in the shatter and the pocketed acorn. No reversal, but accumulative design doesn’t require one.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: re-open locked dimension or accept eternal solitude—stated by 60-word mark. Escalation is accretive: each failed stitch narrows hope, thickens risk, until final thread holds and gravity rights itself. Cost is visible: 300 years, prior 46 terminated births, ship’s dissolution. No coincidence; all pressure born from her iterative agency. One meaningful deepening suffices; final “she stayed” crystallizes new stakes underfoot.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will Elira keep or surrender her captured light?—tightens as each vial is sacrificed into molten curtain, foreclosing retreat. Agency is continuous: she chooses detour, uncorks, hurls, steps onto raft. Cost is visible—empty vials, golden flash, raft toward unmapped island. Coincidence (mirror prophecy) complicates rather than rescues. Slight reserve: escalation is steady but single-arc; no secondary reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—liberate valley by neutralizing siege engines—signaled early and tightened through each lock conquered. One meaningful escalation: armory bolt surrender that forecloses retreat. Cost visible in the lit parchment flare that seals Kael’s outlaw status. Could use one more micro-loss (tool fatigue? noise risk?) to hit top band.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—keep the world from unmaking—tightens when the mirror shows her unraveling; the only tactic left is to push dust into rock-gaps, accepting searing cost. Escalation is accumulative: each spiral painted raises aurora threads, burns skin, and deepens her lifelong servitude. Agency drives every turn; coincidence is absent. The felt price—eels brand her wrists, dust fuses to bone—escalates under the Accumulative lens and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—voice vs. erasure—signals early and tightens through two timer chimes and the literal erosion of the poem by rain. Escalation is textural: each tear halves the archive until none remains; the cost is the irretrievable loss of the censored original. No coincidence; storm complicates, not resolves. Agency is renunciation rather than victory, still foreclosing the path of preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—whose epistemology rules, answers or destinations—gets physicalized when the key’s iron heft replaces verbal sparring. Escalation is a single, meaningful tightening: every blade touch forces closer attention to the sundial’s cipher until the needle card’s shadow splits numerals and only joint interpretation can unlock the compartment. Cost is legible: brass sparks, diplomatic masks dropped, alliance forged at the price of solo vindication. No convenient luck; coincidence is absent, pressure is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will Lena re-open a future already declared closed—tightens once via the film-door reveal; the price is the permanent burnout of the projector bulb, a felt loss that forecloses any second replay. Agency is hers alone: splice, walk, play, speak.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—protect cultural memory vs. personal annihilation—is signaled early and tightens exactly once: seed bite irreversibly merges her cognition with the ridge. Agency is continuous: every beat is her testing resonance, unearthing, pocketing, climbing, biting. Cost is irreversible and on-page: loss of personal memory, violet-stained body, eyes reflecting “light that wasn’t the sun’s.” No coincidence; even the storm is the island’s exhale, not random weather. The single escalation is sufficient for this length and forecloses all alternate tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to speak the unsaid without breaking—tightens when the compass needle bleeds color, forcing Elias from reading knots to planting the instrument itself. One meaningful deepening suffices: the branch-snapping proverb becomes lived method, diffusing weight into soil. Cost is visible: surrendering the compass to roots forfeits any future literal navigation, crystallizing his renunciation. Pressure stays accumulative; coincidence is absent; escalation is the slow color shift that forecloses return to ordinary seafaring life.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—relinquishing control to witness decay—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s daily ritual. The meaningful tightening occurs when he shifts from mapping absence to recognizing it, culminating in sabbatical declaration. Cost is legible: loss of career trajectory, routine, and illusion of agency. Agency is passive endurance rather than active decision, slightly limiting escalation under Accumulative lens—but still coherent and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—discovering truth in absence—is signaled early and tightens decisively at the ledger’s revelation: “*pay in silver or the girl*.” This deepening forces Liora’s shift from passive survivor to active seeker, narrowing options (she abandons studio, follows route). Cost is unmistakable: the loss of her brother’s idealized memory and her artistic identity. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency—retracing numbers leads directly to the inciting insight—and aligns perfectly with the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—translating silence into music—is signaled early and tightens when the first key yields nothing. Liora’s agency drives escalation: she feeds grief/fury into the heat-map, melting frozen air. Cost is unmistakable: bleeding hands, scars as listening tools, the burden of being last survivor. The storm doesn’t resolve—it transforms via her action, fulfilling Situational lens pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—giving rest a permanent address—is signaled early and deepens when the ledger blurs, forcing Elias to act. His agency drives escalation: he chooses to carry the lens, swim against currents, and assemble fragments. Cost is unmistakable: the lens crumbles, warmth fades, and he inscribes his own name. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; coincidence (package arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—survival without surrender—is signaled early and tightens when patrols burn the arbor, forcing Elias to choose between concealment and defiance. His agency drives escalation: midnight runs → communal participation → public ringing. Cost is unmistakable: loss of secrecy, destruction of sacred space, exposure to arrest. The patrol’s retreat confirms stakes are viscerally real—their own families are among the hungry—making moral calculus concrete, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding where unused love goes—is signaled early and escalates through Elias’s agency: choosing to press the jade to his chest triggers the memory surfacing, which then forces the reconfiguration of his understanding. Cost is unmistakable: the jade dissolves, his pilgrimage ends, and he assumes keeperhood—a foreclosed path with visible consequence. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via breath cadence shifts and sensory intensification, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory against temporal erosion—is signaled early via fading photographs and intensifies through protagonist agency: inserting the fragment, climbing the spiral, hurling it into the abyss. The tightening moment (“run… sideways”) narrows options by exploiting hyperbolic geometry, forcing a trade-off between rescue and self-preservation. Cost is unmistakable: Liora survives but must now design edges, bearing the weight of time’s texture. Escalation follows the Accumulative lens—pressure accrues through sensory and conceptual density, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—planting resilience in hostile soil—is signaled early and escalates coherently: decoding keys, evading guard, planting amid rubble. Lena’s agency drives every turn; luck complicates (guard’s arrival) but never resolves. The meaningful deepening occurs when she chooses not to flee but to weaponize the environment, accepting risk to ensure seed dispersal. Cost is felt in her emptied pockets and irreversible commitment to return tomorrow—foreclosing escape for stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering the sound of trust breaking—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s imprints. The meaningful tightening occurs when he places his sister’s silence into the coals: not to restore, but to witness its transformation. Agency is clear; cost is visible in the flooded greenhouse, his scarred hands, and the irreversible surrender to rust. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens without coincidence or soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—stealing illuminated moments—deepens into confronting their nature as countdowns. Liora’s agency drives escalation: her observation of floral codes enables lock-picking, which triggers the mirror’s revelation, forcing her to shatter the jar. Cost is visceral—the stationmaster fades, trains vanish, luck expires—and reconfigures her goal from collection to liberation. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her quietly savvy choices under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—creating a “safe zone for inquiry”—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes silence, not machinery, was the true failure. Her agency drives escalation: choosing to flood the chamber turns passive grief into active risk. Cost is unmistakable—the flood reshapes ruins she won’t witness—and the moral calculus (safety vs. vulnerability) sharpens the climax without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—proving her existence—is signaled early and tightens when the cast reveals “They lied to you too,” narrowing options to confrontation or surrender. Lena’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to bleed, climb, retrieve. Cost is unmistakable: legal erasure, stolen identity, and the visceral price of self-reclamation.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—mapping the endless night through silence—is signaled early and tightens via Eldrin’s deepening insight that erasure, not inscription, charts true darkness. His agency drives escalation: each act of retelling reweights his understanding until he renounces the booklet itself. Cost is unmistakable in his physical and existential dissolution (“another coordinate in the endless dark”), and the star’s extinction forecloses all possibility of external light, forcing total reliance on internal reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—“Where do thoughts come from?”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens through X-7’s escalating engagement with the violin, culminating in the realization that thought arises from “reaching into the unknown.” Agency drives every turn: choosing to play, interpreting the whisper, enduring the memory-shards. Cost is legible in the final beat: X-7 exhales “like steam escaping an old kettle,” a physical toll of remembrance, and the courtyard’s dissolution implies loss of stable reality. Pressure accumulates texturally rather than causally, consistent with the inferred lens, and the stakes deepen without external antagonism.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—freeing truth from words—is signaled early and deepens when Lena recognizes the concert ticket. Her agency drives escalation: eavesdropping leads to drawing, which catalyzes the couple’s reconciliation. The tightening occurs when she chooses to intervene, narrowing her path from observer to conduit. Cost is felt in her relinquished isolation (“for the first time in years, she didn’t need to translate”) and the visible weight lifted from the couple. Coincidence (their arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the resolution stems from Lena’s deliberate act.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether care can exist outside measurement—is signaled early and deepens when elders accuse her of hoarding luck. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she doesn’t argue but leads them to witness the garden’s mending, forcing a conceptual surrender. Cost is unmistakable: her section deemed “deficient,” shoots crushed under boots. The tightening forecloses transactional gardening, replacing it with relational knowing, paid for in years of erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—validating time’s non-linearity—is signaled early and tightens when K-11 flatlines mid-transition, forcing Elias’s final lever adjustment. Agency drives escalation: each pull risks destabilization, culminating in K-11’s departure and AI’s rebuke. Cost is unmistakable: loss of the specimen, professional censure, and existential solitude. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with no off-stage resolutions.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the ghost’s silent language—is signaled early and deepens when the program yields coordinates, escalating from passive observation to active retrieval. Elias’s agency drives every turn: he chooses to follow the code, lift the board, return to play *silence*. Cost is unmistakable: he abandons control of narrative (no longer interpreting signs but receiving reply), surrendering to vulnerability. The escalation is textural but decisive—a single deepening that reconfigures his relationship to absence.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—truth versus silence—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Liora chooses not to warn. Her agency manifests as renunciation, foreclosing survival with on-page cost (vanished footprints, scattered ledgers). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each sensory cue (ravens, hygrometer stutter) deepens the weight of unsaid truths. The storm’s arrival isn’t coincidence—it’s the inevitable yield of withheld knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the truth behind Luz’s fate—is signaled early and deepens when the valve’s unnatural weight confirms his father’s claim. Escalation is driven by Elias’s agency: he silences the radio, kneels to listen, then turns the wheel, each choice narrowing options. The cost—confronting a literalized swallowed truth—is unmistakable in Luz’s bulging throat and the water’s eruption. Coincidence (radio’s giggle) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from Elias’s decisive act.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—witnessing change without judgment—is signaled early and tightens via the refuge ritual, which demands surrender of self (cost: erasure of name, expression, personhood). Escalation occurs through deepening immersion: from tracing spines to dissolving into the walls. Though passive, the keeper’s endurance is active renunciation under Accumulative pressure; however, the lack of a single tightening *choice* slightly limits escalation intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring voice/connection—is signaled early via Mira’s muteness and Lila’s vial. Pressure tightens when Elias cancels appointments to drive them to the ridge, betting his credibility on intuition. The eclipse deepens stakes by imposing a temporal window (“pause button for the world”), forcing Elias’s hand. Cost is visible: Lila risks reopening grief; Elias risks professional failure. Agency drives escalation—Elias chooses to sing, Mira chooses to hum—and luck (eclipse) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the ridge’s response stems from their shared vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving displaced stories—is signaled early and deepens when the tapestry reveals the axis was “wrenched sideways.” Elias’s agency drives escalation: he feeds diaries to coax embers, triggering the world’s tilt. Cost is unmistakable: burned diaries become ash, dreams are gone, yet he walks on. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via resonant density, not causality, and the final image reweights everything without solving the fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.2)
    The dominant stake—protecting an open secret that could shatter lives—is signaled early and tightens when the fisherman’s daughter warns “They’re coming.” Chen’s agency drives escalation: he doesn’t flee but transposes, redirecting the film and rewriting the narrative via fortune slips. The cost is felt—abandoning his post, his name, his home—and crystallizes in Charged Poise: the empty study, the unsent slips, the dark beacon. Coincidence complicates (the knock), but resolution stems from Chen’s orchestration, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—illuminating the anchor’s lie—tightens when the priest realizes incompleteness is structural (“a cage missing its final bar”). His agency drives escalation: he doesn’t fight possession but probes its conditions, forcing the entity into recognition. Cost is unmistakable: he unravels with the truth. The novice inherits not victory but responsibility, proving stakes evolved, not resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—transforming passive prophecy into active creation—is signaled early and deepens when Li Wei chooses to conduct rather than deliver fortunes. Agency drives escalation: his brushstroke becomes treble clef, then gesture. Cost is unmistakable—the drowned village, silenced mother, fractured shell—and culminates in the courier’s knock ignored for art’s sake. Pressure tightens coherently under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—conquering the self’s fragmentation—is signaled early and escalates through protagonist agency: Elias chooses to retrace, rewinds sideways, and initiates the collision. Pressure tightens via the tablet’s decay and the shadow-self’s taunt (“You always stop here”), forcing a trade-off: surrender to recursion or risk annihilation through merger. Cost is unmistakable: loss of the ancestral artifact, end of temporal evasion, and irreversible embodiment. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from Elias’s will under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming musical meaning beyond hearing—is signaled early and deepens when the drum maker offers “backward songs.” The meaningful tightening occurs when Elias chooses to feel rather than hear, foreclosing his old pedagogy. Agency is clear: he presses his palm to the horn, closes his eyes, decides to teach anew. Cost is felt in the lingering shame of his student’s sneer, now transmuted into resolve. Escalation is driven by protagonist choice under Accumulative pressure, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving integrity through observation—tightens decisively when the message arrives, forcing Elias to choose between lifelong discipline and necessary interference. The deepening (“It’s breathing now. Not like us.”) shifts the quarantine zone from anomaly to agent, raising existential cost. Pressure escalates through environmental cues (pigeon shift, off-frame creak), not coincidence, and culminates in a stance crystallization that forecloses safety. Cost is felt in the pulse steadying then the exhale before recording—a quiet surrender to danger.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.4)
    The dominant stake—whether to keep feeding the *Luminara* with his grief—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes his tears are sustenance, not sorrow. This escalation is driven entirely by his agency (uncorking the vial), narrowing options to renunciation. The cost is unmistakable: wilting flowers, destroyed livelihood (smashed lanterns), and severed maternal bond. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with UV light mechanics shaping prior attempts and the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—what to do with found freedom—is signaled early and tightens when the rope hums with pattern. The poet’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to unwind, swing, then carve. Cost is unmistakable: burned hands, lingering weight of unanswerable question. Energy beings complicate but don’t resolve; their thread adds pressure, not solution. Moral calculus sharpens at climax: cut or pull taut?

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving beauty in the unfinished—is signaled early and escalates when the child appears, forcing Liora to shift from private ritual to collaborative creation. This isn’t passive reception; she chooses to abandon her father’s melody for something new, narrowing her path of solitary mourning. Cost is felt in the relinquishment of decades-long fidelity to the past, crystallized in the “questioning note” that becomes a bridge. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: density of silence, then sound, then shared sound deepens stakes without external antagonism.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—authentic emotion versus counterfeit longing—is signaled early and deepens when Liora discovers the chemist’s half-truth. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to fuse insight with empathy, altering the scent and forcing confrontation with his cowardice. Cost is unmistakable: the chemist loses his comforting fiction and cries for his former self; Liora bears the ache as her own. Under an Accumulative lens, this single deepening suffices, tightening the emotional aperture until only truth remains viable.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recognition of invisible care—is signaled early and tightens when Elias chooses vulnerability over transaction. The escalation is driven by his agency: scribbling the note, offering the locket. Cost is unmistakable: he risks rejection and accepts unbalanced ledgers. The librarian’s reciprocal risk (showing up at midnight) deepens pressure into partnership, fulfilling Situational lens requirements with coherent, character-driven stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—forging belonging in a place of erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the incomplete arbor demands a dedication bold enough to “hold the weight.” Reed’s agency drives escalation: she initiates the search, defies elders, and chooses collective action over solitary completion. Cost is unmistakable: Syl’s departure leaves the web “woven slowly,” and Reed’s acceptance forecloses immediate resolution for enduring community. The elders’ warning and crater’s murmur heighten pressure without resolving it.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preventing the giant’s wake—is signaled early (“canals would run backward… moths dissolve”) and tightens when the boy reveals the stolen moth, forcing Elspeth’s trade: sacrifice her trapped echo-heart to restore time’s flow. Escalation is protagonist-driven: her micro-choice to hurl the jar (not negotiate) narrows options irreversibly, costing her control over echoes (leash dissolves) while gaining temporary reprieve. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each borrowed hour compounds interest until the jar’s release creates cadence shift (city holds breath). Cost is unmistakable: moths return to air, not her sketches, foreclosing her archival project permanently.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding ambiguous loss—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: his incantation “to ask,” not resurrect, forces a confrontation with irreconcilable absence. The meaningful tightening occurs when the glass eyes dovetail into the mosaic, triggering the orchard’s phantom green and the fruit’s harmonic vibration—narrowing his path from solver to witness. Cost is unmistakable: the clouded eye weeps, his breath fogs the clear one, and he accepts that mourning itself may be impossible. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving lost moments versus risking connection—is signaled early and deepens when the outage disrupts Elias’s routine. His agency drives escalation: he chooses to place the tape despite rules, then the photo, then steps into light. Each act narrows his path (endangering his cache, revealing himself) with visible cost. The woman’s frozen pen and abrupt stand crystallize reciprocal stakes, making the final key exchange a high-stakes trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—control vs. surrender—is signaled early (“pruning aggression… will plants into obedience”) and tightens decisively when Liora pulls up stakes, foreclosing her old methodology. Agency drives escalation: her choice to stop interfering permits the linden’s metamorphosis, which in turn reshapes the entire nursery. Cost is felt in her shaking hands and the risk of alienating customers (“expecting roses”). The storm season acts as coherent pressure, not coincidence, forcing stance crystallization under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—threshing meaning from postwar silence—is signaled early and tightens when Elias chooses the chapel over his canvas. His agency drives escalation: he follows rain, inserts the brooch, accepts the exchange. The cost is legible in lost sleep, wasted years, and the surrender of artistic control (painting what the island gives, not what he seeks). The “threshing” deepens stakes conceptually, turning personal insomnia into ritual participation, with the island itself as the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether magic is graspable—is signaled early and deepened when the pearl’s silence carries “weight.” Liora’s agency drives escalation: she reaches, touches, whispers “Show me,” triggering the vision. The cost—abandoning her life’s pursuit of grand prophecy for quiet presence—is felt in her lighter steps and emptied hands. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each sensory layer tightens the thematic screw until the mundane becomes undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to silenced history—tightens when the valve arrives, forcing Elias to choose between preservation and activation. His agency drives escalation: he doesn’t wait for council ships but *heartens* citizens into co-archivists, altering tactics from solitary collection to communal meaning-making. Cost is felt in the ledger’s weight lifted only after surrendering the valve—a trade-off where legacy replaces possession. Coincidence (ship’s return) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the climax is his quiet climb, not the horn’s blare.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—confronting the lie that precision can outrun grief—is signaled early and deepens when the vault demands truth as toll. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to place the punch, speak his uncertainty, and step back into the mist. Cost is unmistakable: loss of the sister’s mirage, dissolution of his tool, and acceptance of perpetual questioning. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with each crack narrowing his illusion of control.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—whether grief can be given form—is signaled early and deepens when transcription shifts from rebellion to ritual. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her choice to trace symbols initiates the inward stretch of space. Cost is unmistakable: she trades magical hope for the harder work of listening to silence, crystallizing in the decision to leave the lens unfocused. Whale migration provides ambient pressure but doesn’t artificially resolve; the real conflict is internal, tightened by the tile’s pulse against her wrist.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—what happens when you let go—is signaled early via the dying architect’s whisper and tightens when Lysander presses the fragment to the pillar, triggering spatial mutiny. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: his boredom compels engagement, his touch initiates rebellion, his release completes transformation. Cost is unmistakable: he forfeits the cursed object and, symbolically, his identity as a hoarder of endings. Magnetic fields serve as the coherent pressure system under which all choices unfold, satisfying Accumulative lens escalation through deepening rather than reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—twelve lives versus one ledger—is signaled early and deepens when the girl reveals the true cost: “That’s how many they’ll kill.” The tightening occurs when Lira realizes the trade was always twelve for *her*, forcing a recalibration from transactional fairness to collective refusal. Agency is clear: Lira chooses chaos over calculation, and the minister’s impending breach raises stakes without resolving via coincidence. Cost is unmistakable—the ledger rendered useless, her old self abandoned—and the final image crystallizes options: flee together or perish alone.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rescuing forgotten lives through texture—is signaled early and deepens when the hum yields Elara’s name. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he chooses to transcribe, interpret, and invent. Cost is visible in his isolation and the physical toll (“fingers trembled,” “pulse quickened”). However, the stakes remain internalized; no external pressure tests his mission, slightly limiting escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming existence through witnessing erased lives—tightens as Daniel’s own memory frays. His agency lies in attention and curation, not action; each collected fragment narrows his path back to the living. The ledger discovery forces a decisive renunciation: shedding the name rather than reclaiming it. Cost is felt in irreversible slippage (“names of streets… taste of his last meal”) and the tide’s engulfment—no return possible.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—decoding the universal riddle—is signaled early and deepens into understanding it as a chorus, not a code. Escalation is driven by Elias’s agency: plucking → pressing harder → playing faster, each choice narrowing his old path (debunker) while raising cost (journal dissolves, constellations fade). The tightening is textural but decisive: voices accumulate until the riddle’s nature reconfigures. Coincidence never resolves; the wind and sea frame pressure but don’t dictate outcome. Final cost—blank shell, lost notes—is viscerally felt and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving Lumina’s fluidity against privatization—is signaled early and tightens when Elira chooses to encode resistance in graffiti, foreclosing passive mediation. Agency drives escalation: her decision to map old waterways forces communal action (“the carnival folk would know where to redirect”). Cost is unmistakable: she abandons mainland order, risking total exile. The clocktower target crystallizes stakes—time itself becomes contested terrain.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving the last untouched lunar vista—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s timed bioluminescent message and photographic thefts. Agency manifests as attention and endurance; his choice to document rather than intervene forecloses activism but secures memory. Cost is felt in the drones’ encroaching hum and his solitary departure. Escalation follows the Accumulative lens: each glow and shutter click intensifies the tension between transience and record.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—ensuring the ship navigates true—is signaled early and deepens when Elias detects the array’s misalignment. His agency drives escalation: he diagnoses via water, confirms via Lumen, and repairs with bespoke film. The cost is felt in his invisibility; the crowd cheers the ship, not the savior. Coincidence never resolves—only his precise, earned intervention alters fate.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding where rivers begin—is signaled early and tightens when Kael’s journal reveals rivers are “drawn here,” not born upstream. Lena’s agency drives escalation: she interprets the condensation, deciphers the dead tongue, and chooses to step onto the ice. The cost—abandoning the human world for heraldic duty—is felt in the sealed ice and silent falcon. Coincidence (the falcon’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Lena’s pattern recognition earns the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reviving balance before collapse—is clear early and escalates texturally: from silence to shutter-creak to lit windows. Agency lies in rhythmic persistence, not force; each step forecloses haste or despair. The arch’s groan raises stakes, forcing the tuner to quicken pace. Cost is felt in bodily strain and implied lifelong duty. Coincidence (the whispering voice) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the revival stems solely from his sustained attention.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—harnessing the ephemeral to rewrite guilt—is signaled early and tightens when oxygen dwindles and the signal sputters. Liora’s agency drives escalation: she overrides instinct to flee, uncorks the vial, and lets the hush take her. Cost is unmistakable: loss of team, diving identity, and surface connection. The deepening (hush dissolving failure “like salt in the current”) reweights the stake without coincidence resolving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—rewriting narrative fate—is signaled early and deepens when Elias chooses to pluck his father’s name, narrowing future options (now hunted, committed). Escalation is driven by his agency: entering, climbing, listening, acting. Cost is unmistakable: bodies will be found, lies must continue, but now with purpose. Coincidence never resolves; pressure tightens causally through his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—repaying an ancient debt through resonant awakening—is signaled early and deepens via Liora’s costly cameos (“each appearance cost her”). Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her touch triggers tremors, her persistence cracks the tree. The price is unmistakable: her essence drains until she unravels. Keeper’s line—“you’re lovingly venomous”—sharpens the moral calculus: love as both poison and antidote.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—mending what others call lost—is signaled early and deepens when the illustration plate bleeds onto stone, transforming passive inheritance into active creation. Escalation is driven by Elias’s agency: his sleepwalking stitches rewrite the labyrinth, culminating in the Heart Chamber shift where dead ends bloom into arches. Cost is felt in his aching bones and the irreversible loss of the winged figure from page to wall. Pressure tightens coherently under an Accumulative lens until the final stance crystallizes: walking toward the wharf awake, no longer empty-handed.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—restoring interrupted journeys—is signaled early (“stories suspended mid-sentence”) and deepens through Elias’s purposeful wandering, which forecloses easy solutions (no villagers descend; he works alone). The tightening occurs when he plants the seed, committing to action over belief, and escalates with each humming bone uncovered. Cost is felt in solitude and the villagers’ cautious hope, but crystallizes in the cracked stone—a physical price for growth. Agency drives every turn; coincidence never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—crafting a name that “carries the sea but doesn’t drown”—is signaled early and deepens through Lena’s algorithmic refinement into *Mizuho*. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: she manually layers Old Norse and Japanese fragments, rejecting system outputs. Cost is legible in analog imperfections (frayed envelope, smudging chalk) and the irreversible act of mailing. Though stakes remain internal, pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with one meaningful tightening—the shift from generation to manual creation—that narrows options and heightens emotional precision.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth versus state-imposed narrative—is signaled early and tightens when the courier warns of dawn’s raid. Elias’s agency crystallizes in synchronizing breath/flame/telescope, narrowing options to broadcast or perish. Cost is felt: he chooses martyrdom over escape, and the flame’s surge visibly alters reality. Escalation is driven by his decisions, not coincidence, and the coup’s exposure emerges from accumulated embroidery—not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—breaking silence with her sister—is signaled early and deepens through Liora’s evocation rituals, culminating in the letter’s release. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: she chooses to press the shard, to write the words in mist, to let go. The cost is legible: years of suspended grief, the physical sting of the shard, the irreversible act of surrendering the letter to water. No coincidence resolves tension; the spirits’ question merely reflects her own internal reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—translating unspoken grief—is signaled early and deepens when Lena shifts from interpreter to grafter. Her agency drives escalation: decrypting the cast, then the photo, each act narrowing emotional isolation. Cost is felt in her ribs and the boy’s hitched breath. The siren’s fade implies endless demand, foreclosing rest—a Charged Poise where duty crystallizes without respite.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost communal joy—is signaled early and deepens through Liora’s agency: she chooses to develop the image, then publicly display it, despite knowing its impermanence. The meaningful tightening occurs when she strings the film between trees, risking exposure of her fragile work to wind and decay. Cost is unmistakable: the joy is fleeting (“fade by morning”), yet she pays it willingly. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens—each sensory and emotional layer intensifies until the fog itself becomes canvas.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—exchanging certainty for curiosity—is signaled early and deepens through three thresholds (day courtyard, night courtyard, painted door). Each escalation is driven by Liora’s agency: she chooses to touch the nickel, then the mural, then paint the door. Cost is unmistakable: her original fresco fades, the garden empties, and she cannot return “not really.” The tightening forecloses her old life (preservation-only) with visible emotional and existential price, all under coherent accumulative pressure shaped by sound and symbol.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—defending uncommodified thought—is signaled early and deepens when black-eyed Susans sprout “they know.” Elias’s agency drives escalation: planting, replacing, interpreting. Cost is felt (constant surveillance, uprooting) and alters tactics (caution via rosemary). The Ministry’s pressure is coherent, though slightly abstracted; still, one meaningful tightening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—transforming inherited violence into regenerative beauty—is signaled early and deepens when the ghost accuses her of singing *to* the dead; her correction (“through you”) tightens the conflict. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she doesn’t wait for peace but actively dissolves war via song-seeds. Cost is unmistakable: centuries of insomnia, eating her own manual, enduring the new war’s drums against her ribs. The “blossom armistice” isn’t passive hope but active warfare of beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving extinct sounds—is signaled immediately and deepens when Liora realizes preservation risks awakening dangerous echoes. Her agency drives escalation: striking the match is a deliberate act that tightens pressure irreversibly. The cost is visceral (physical pain, shattered sanctuary) and conceptual (her name reclaimed by the wind). The single meaningful deepening—repairing the chime—narrows her options to destruction or surrender, fulfilling the Accumulative lens with one decisive intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—restoring trust through linguistic truth—is signaled early and tightens when the indigo reveals Elara’s own name in a treaty she never saw, personalizing the cost. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to sing, shattering the inkwell and transforming the archive. The emissaries’ torches provide external pressure, but the real conflict is internal—can she trust her voice again? The cost is legible: she risks annihilation to reknit frayed vows, and the archive’s survival hinges on her harmonic gamble.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—rebuilding gates vs. honoring hidden sluices—tightens decisively when Liora chooses “yield over domination,” foreclosing elder approval. Escalation is protagonist-driven: her analysis of glue/folds/blueprint deepens knowledge, narrowing options to two stark paths. Cost is unmistakable: risking exile to revive the machinist’s “gentler” system. Moral calculus sharpens the climax—“weakness is compassion in disguise”—without abstracting stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming connection through trust—is signaled early (“*Found it... Meet me*”) and tightens when Elias risks sending the pigeon despite past betrayal (“*liar*”). Protagonist agency drives escalation: his dust-mapping dictates flight success, and choosing to hum crystallizes stance. Cost is visceral: trembling hands, forged ledgers, voice sacrificed then tentatively reclaimed. Coincidence (Luca’s scrap of music) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the real resolution is Elias’s internal shift, earned through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming a child vs. honoring her self-chosen threshold—is signaled early and deepens when Elias intuits she’s “not in the maze anymore.” His agency drives escalation: analyzing grain, decoding BFE-7, climbing down. The cost is felt in his silence, his relinquished authority, and the unspoken admission that some losses are initiations. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each sensory detail narrowing his path toward surrender, not rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—finding the “rhythm of belonging” in a drowned world—tightens when Kael arrives, forcing Elara from solitary observation into shared vulnerability. The luminous respite deepens from private ritual to mutual revelation, narrowing her options: she can retreat or connect. She chooses connection, paying the cost of emotional exposure, yet forecloses escape by staying below. The escalation is driven by her agency—inviting Kael into her sacred hour—not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering hidden paths before memory fades—is signaled by line 3 and tightens when the bird’s seeds whisper conjecture. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she plucks, rolls, listens, gathers, bleeds. Cost is unmistakable: heart “heavier with the weight of a thousand half-remembered lives.” The merchant’s erased name and fisherman’s daughter’s unspoken fear make stakes viscerally felt. Coincidence (the bird) complicates but doesn’t resolve—she must act.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—serenading monotony through orchestrated serendipity—is signaled early and deepens via Lior’s real-time integration of chaotic inputs (child’s laugh, gull cry, flame guttering). The meaningful tightening occurs when he shifts stance with the wave crest, aligning music with tidal math—a choice that narrows his margin for error. Cost is felt in the applause “scattered and confused,” confirming his art remains illegible to others. Agency is clear: he *chooses* to play the gaps, not the crowd, and endures the consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming voice after enforced silence—is signaled early (“nostalgia ban”) and tightens when she chooses ink over return. The deepening occurs at the heron’s disappearance: that void becomes the space for her first line, narrowing options to inscription or surrender. Protagonist agency drives escalation—she dips fingers not for water but reflection, presses dust herself. Cost is unmistakable: “her skin was no longer hers alone,” a permanent forfeiture of bodily sovereignty paid to fledge.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding meaning in transience—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s communion with water and light. The single tightening occurs when ripples reveal layered truths (storm memory, wives’ worry, his breath), escalating internal pressure toward the climactic alignment of the prism. Agency is subtle but potent: his choice to “commune” forecloses despair, accepting cost (daughter’s absence, impermanence of light) without resolution. Wind turning by noon adds external pressure, but the true stakes are conceptual—can attention redeem the ordinary?—and they’re paid for in every silent, precise ripple.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—translating pain without inflicting it—is signaled early and tightens when the ex-wife’s ultimatum forces action. The meaningful deepening occurs when Elias reinterprets the box not as relic but offering, shifting from passive grief to active alchemy. Agency drives escalation: he chooses to draw, photograph, send, and leave—all narrowing his path back to isolation. Cost is unmistakable: he forfeits the ritual of solitary mourning for uncertain reconciliation, walking into emotional exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—puzzling hope’s equation—is signaled early and deepens when the gauge measures “potential,” not altitude. Liora’s agency drives escalation: she arranges decorations as hypotheses, exhales to revitalize patterns, steps into the center. Cost is legible: years of erased work, emotional inheritance of failure, surrender to impermanence. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of symbols tightens until the grotto ascends conceptually.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether to inherit or release familial memory—is signaled early (“The house dreams in corners. Listen”) and tightens when the negative reveals his mother’s eyes. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to burn the seal, enter, and redraw the mural. Cost is felt in the “single rusted toy,” the empty cradle, and his trembling hands—loss made tactile. Coincidence (finding the negative) complicates but doesn’t resolve; his choice does.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—trading borrowed heartbeats for fragile possibilities—is signaled early and tightens when Liora unravels the pulse, accepting cost to both soldier and herself. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she chooses to show the vision, then chooses not to look at her own reflection. The moral calculus—stealing dreams to give hope—is sharpened by irreversible trade-offs. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—“the price of stopping”—is signaled early and deepens through Veyra’s invocation of Kael’s past promise (“for the children we haven’t buried yet”), which narrows his options emotionally. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her choice to quote his younger self forces his hand, making the signature a costly renunciation of despair. The visible price—Kael’s shaking hand, Veyra’s burdened walk—charges the final image under the Accumulative lens. Coincidence (the coughing soldier) complicates but doesn’t resolve; it sharpens the moral calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether legacy endures as erasure or echo—is signaled early and deepens when Elias chooses futility over utility. The tightening occurs in the fissure: placing the egg narrows his future to one of silent reckoning, trading control for witness. Cost is felt in “he did not calculate the cost,” a rupture from his lifelong calculus. Though coincidence (distant thunder) complicates, resolution stems solely from his agency under coherent pressure—no external forces intervene.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—defying conformity’s lullaby—is signaled early and deepens through each thread untangled. Agency lies in attention and endurance; each knot loosened narrows the path back to silence. Cost is felt in absorbed sorrow, branded traitorship, and irreversible burden. Escalation is protagonist-driven under an Accumulative lens, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration of freedom.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—ethical storytelling—is signaled early and deepens when the miner’s rage reveals unintended harm. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to return, but with altered method (loose strings). The tightening forecloses performative clarity in favor of shared uncertainty, with conceptual cost (abandoning control). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves conflict—only reflection forged in silence.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—honoring the forgotten—is signaled early and deepens through Lior’s realization that permanence is a “lie the valley told itself.” The meaningful tightening occurs when he chooses to build a spiral mimicking the monarchs’ “interrupted cadence,” accepting transience as truth. Agency is clear: his attention *is* the action, foreclosing the path of conventional memorialization. Cost is felt in the unraveling—his labor scattered—and conceptual: history here is ephemeral, unrecorded, yet no less real.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving lost names—tightens when Elira chooses reconfiguration over static hoarding, foreclosing her old path of silent guilt. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her deliberate unraveling triggers the sanctum’s tremor and aurora’s pulse. Cost is visceral: dissolving the card scrap and melting her “chiseled regrets.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each sensory detail intensifies the moral weight of transmission.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding why paths choose walkers—is signaled early and deepens when the film reveals dream-Lior’s fate. The tightening occurs at the terminal: “TRANSCENDENCE REQUIRES A SACRIFICE OF CERTAINTY” forces Lior to relinquish control, raising emotional and existential cost. Agency is maintained through her choice to reach for the storm, not the past. Slight cap because the storm’s nature remains abstract; its pressure is felt but not concretely tied to tactical shifts beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—decoding hidden order—tightens when the schematic shifts from celestial to terrestrial devotion. Qishti’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to return, trace, descend, and place the tile. Cost is unmistakable: loss of the object, transformation of self, and irreversible covenant with the unknown. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—releasing resentment to reclaim connection—is signaled early and escalates through Lior’s confrontation with Kael’s ghost. The tightening occurs when Kael plucks the pin from Lior’s hand, forcing a trade-off: cling to grievance or risk grace. Protagonist agency drives escalation—Lior breaks the pin, then reinserts it—and cost is unmistakable in his aching chest and scarred brother. The final walk out forecloses the path of silence with visible relational consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—erasing the boundary between memory and oblivion—is signaled early and tightens when synchronized breathing reshapes fog into tangible form. The deepening occurs at the mirror’s ripple: the brother’s voice reframes “grounding” as flight, forcing a crystallized stance. Protagonist agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves pressure. Cost is unmistakable: he forfeits his identity as mirror maker to become part of the sky, visible in the workshop’s transformation from mirrors to windows.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reconciling silence with truth—is signaled early and tightens when the box reveals the daughter’s challenge. The mender’s agency drives escalation: they choose to dig, plant, and finally ask the question pride once forbade. Cost is unmistakable: relinquishing control over their daughter’s path, symbolized by leaving the doll behind. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens—each object and memory intensifies the emotional weight until the sprout forces reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—access to nonlinear knowledge—is signaled early and deepens when Veyra realizes the orchard is a protected library. Her agency drives escalation: she inquires, turns the cameo, plucks the blossom, and chooses cataloging over destruction or documentation. The cost is conceptual but palpable: she inherits an eternal, lonely duty, foreclosing personal resolution. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each blossom tightening the moral calculus without coincidence resolving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—access to the Library—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes rescue requires sacrifice, not theft. The tightening occurs at the traveler’s whisper of “Liora,” which both opens the Library and triggers Elias’s doom. Protagonist agency drives escalation: his lie, his renegotiation, his assumption of control. Cost is unmistakable—the erased diary, the lost name, the transformation into a living absence—and directly tied to his “carefully resourceful” methodology.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recapturing the erased twin through story—is signaled early and deepens when Liora realizes the garden holds many lost names. Her agency drives escalation: tearing the ledger, pressing the swatch, choosing to stay. Cost is unmistakable—the ship’s death, her isolation prolonged—and the final turn (narrating for others) narrows her path from personal redemption to communal duty. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence or soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—translating confusion into clarity—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes clarity requires *merging*, not recording. Her agency drives escalation: each reweaving tightens pressure (gears stutter, seal softens). Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits documentation for participation, crystallized in her pocketed seal and unopened notebook. The “fables of absence” concept forces a trade-off between knowledge and experience under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving the bloom of hush—is signaled early and deepens when Eldrin realizes it’s not a weapon but a choice. The meaningful tightening occurs at the fissure’s split: the bloom *sings* in invitation, forcing the beings to confront their own dissonance. Cost is felt in the groaning ice and the stone’s spent glow; agency lies in Eldrin’s refusal to escalate, instead offering balance. Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist action under an Accumulative lens, with pressure crystallizing into harmonic convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—proving coincidences hold meaning—is signaled early and deepens when the prism’s fracture aligns with personal and civilizational loss. Agency drives escalation: she chooses to press her palm to the shard, trace star paths, exhale into the break. Cost is unmistakable—the weight of being “the last,” the ache of seeing missed pasts, the burden of carrying mended silence. Coincidence complicates (shattering timing) but resolution comes through her action, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—sculpting identity from borrowed memory—is signaled early and deepens when the vision reveals her future self laughing at the chase’s absurdity. This protagonist-driven reversal (not coincidence) forecloses her archival method with visceral cost: the realization she’s dammed a river with bare hands. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, tightening via sensory cadence shifts (flags’ hum → storm’s pulse → rain’s tap) until her choice to stop measuring reweights all prior effort as futile yet necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—defying hopelessness—is signaled early and tightens when Liora chooses to ignite the rag despite villagers’ fear, narrowing options to one irreversible act. Escalation is driven by her agency: chanting shifts to bone-deep thrumming, ambient awareness informs rocket placement, and the spiral construction deepens tension. Cost is unmistakable: she leaves lighter (rag knot spent) but carries the weight of restored hope. Coincidence never resolves; the earth’s tremor responds to her action, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—navigating unspoken grief during a pause in conversation—is signaled early and deepens through the chronicler’s internal reckoning. Pressure escalates not through external conflict but via accumulating silence, the tide’s retreat, and the cicada’s latent hum, culminating in a meaningful tightening: she chooses to give the cicada away, foreclosing her own possession for his future solace. Cost is felt in her relinquishment and his burdened acceptance. While agency is quiet, it’s decisive under the Accumulative lens; however, the fisherman’s stakes remain slightly less active, limiting full escalation symmetry.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—freedom vs. inherited fear—is signaled early and tightens decisively: each inversion narrows options (father’s discovery, stolen vine-threads, the bloom’s core). Protagonist agency drives escalation: they choose exposure limits, climb, reach into the bloom. Cost is unmistakable: the father’s empty silence, the bunker’s collapse, the irreversible “sprouting.” The final choice crystallizes stance under coherent pressure—the trellis doesn’t rescue; it responds to the child’s earned key.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—teaching silence how to carry unspoken grief—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s dial adjustments and droplet ritual. Pressure escalates via the passenger’s arrival, her flinch at laughter, her silent burden. Elias’s agency drives every turn: he chooses to add canal water, to bend sound, to let the gondola drift. Cost is felt in the vial’s darkening and the recalibrated weight on her shoulders.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether to claim or unmake the throne—is signaled early and tightens when murals reveal the stairway is below. Elsin’s agency drives escalation: she steps through water, reads paint, digs, descends, inserts flake. The cost is conceptual yet visceral: centuries of oppressive hierarchy dissolve, but she forfeits legacy, vanishing as myths remake around her. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves anything.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether to let go of the dead—is signaled early (“threshold fading”) and tightens when the shadow accuses him of leaving the door unlocked. Lior’s agency drives escalation: his micro-choice to turn the ring (not strike it) reweights all bridges burned. Cost is unmistakable—the loaded emptiness pressing “thick as charcoal dust”—and the deepening shifts stakes from defense to release. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each encroaching shadow narrows his emotional options until renunciation becomes necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—translating generational pressure into personal worth—is signaled early via mother’s “IOUs” and *Luminous Ascent* exploitation. Escalation tightens coherently: each text message raises conceptual stakes (“compressed regret,” “quantum promise”) until Lina’s twist forces a reconfiguration. Agency drives deepening—her reply “What’s the exchange rate?” tests the system, making the final choice earned. Cost is unmistakable: bleeding palm, abandoned phone, walking into desert alone.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—uncovering truth through intuition vs. logic—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes he’s “striking the wrong note.” The meaningful tightening occurs when he shifts from seeking to listening, foreclosing his old method with visible cost (abandoning intellectual pride). Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens; coincidence (anonymous letters) complicates but doesn’t resolve. Final cost is conceptual: truth was always present, but required silence to perceive.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—breaking silence to reclaim agency—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist-driven deepening: recognizing the siege as performance compels him to unsnap. Cost is unmistakable: shadows spill from his glove, the program dissolves into a key, and his smile “hurts like holy fire.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—threads tighten not by coincidence but his delayed response to the program’s prompt. Final act forecloses eternal silence with irreversible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost histories—is signaled early and deepens when Elias connects Daniel to Alan Hendricks, narrowing his options from passive custodian to active restorer. The meaningful tightening occurs when he prints the photo: a trade-off between professional detachment and personal investment. Cost is unmistakable: trembling hands, emotional exposure, the risk of futility. Escalation is driven by Elias’s agency under an Accumulative lens—each fragment intensifies his commitment without external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving erased histories against institutional indifference—is signaled early (“Council had rewritten the histories”) and escalates through Lena’s agency: she decodes puddles, uses the key, and chooses arson over passivity. The tightening (“They’re moving the last archive tomorrow… Burning what’s left”) forces a trade-off: risk everything or let truth die. Cost is unmistakable—she becomes a ghost (“archivist who’d quit the day before”), sacrificing safety for legacy. Coincidence never resolves; the booth’s reappearance is earned through ritual (dusk, reflections), not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—silencing the prophecy—is signaled early and tightens when the atrium “weeps rainbows,” forcing faster, more precise playing. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: his choice to play the dream-composed phrase collapses the whisper. Cost is unmistakable: the prophecy migrates inside him, and he must return eternally. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure grows via textural intensification (mist thickening, panes dimming), not coincidence, and the final trade-off—containment over freedom—is crystallized in the train ticket purchase.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—decoding the leaves’ message—is signaled early and deepens when the moonstone unlocks their language. Liora’s agency drives escalation: prodding the speck, building the seed tower, climbing the ladder. Each choice narrows options (abandoning the old arbor, accepting transformation) with visible cost. The “transformed remember” line crystallizes stakes morally—memory demands embodiment, not just observation.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—finding purpose in brokenness—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: he chooses to follow the leaves, pry open the ledger, and improvise. The tightening occurs when he realizes “the broken clock didn’t need fixing; it needed to be unmade,” foreclosing his old path with felt cost (abandoning certainty). Pressure escalates texturally but coherently under the Accumulative lens, with each relic narrowing his options toward improvisation. Luck complicates (dreamed phrase), but resolution stems from his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding the weight of names—is signaled early and deepens when the coin pulses, transforming search into invitation. Escalation is driven by Liora’s agency: she chooses to stay, feed the coin, uncork the vial. Cost is unmistakable: potential reduction to ash, emotional exposure to Veyra’s voice, and the irreversible commitment to carry meaning differently. The tightening occurs when she realizes the coin isn’t a clue but a test of her willingness to explore limits Veyra died testing.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—integrating joy into grief—is signaled early (“grief, too, could be a kind of collection”) and deepens when the soul rejects weeping for laughter. Liora’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to scatter petals and ask for humor, narrowing her role from collector to collaborator. Cost is unmistakable: she abandons the expectation of spectral confession-as-release, accepting instead a distorted harmony. The stakes remain viscerally felt through embodied tension (teeth-aching notes, humming satchel) and crystallize in the final trade—lighter burden not from loss but belonging.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—grasping the math of mercy—is signaled early and deepened through Liran’s confrontation with his interrogator’s sewn-shut face. The tightening occurs when he realizes mercy isn’t a variable but an absence, forcing renunciation of solution-seeking. Agency is clear: his choices (kneeling, pressing the strap, exhaling) drive escalation, and the cost—enduring penance to achieve understanding—is visible in his still hands and altered perception.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering overlooked histories—is signaled early and deepens when the lens reveals Elara’s log entry. Protagonist agency drives escalation: Lior’s decision to unfasten the past directly enables the CR. Cost is unmistakable in the painter’s vanished booth and Lior’s irreversible commitment (“She was no longer just a bridge… She was the hand”). Pressure tightens coherently under Accumulative lens—each hidden detail compounds until the decisive act of carrying the brush.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—uncovering what the ceiling hides—is signaled early and deepens into ethical responsibility: preserving ghosts’ rest versus restarting the show. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: dust analysis reveals recent movement, the barrel clicks, the door opens. The tightening choice—to unmake rather than repair—forecloses the circus’s return with visible cost (shattered laugh, stilling gears). Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from Elias’s skilled observation.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—containing volatile truth—is signaled early (“secrets too volatile to speak”) and tightens when frost patterns reveal reality’s negotiability. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to unstopper the forbidden whisper, knowing it may rupture the system. The cost is immediate and visible—the library shudders, books split, glass dissolves—and culminates in his own erasure. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: density of sensory detail (humming books, thrashing whisper, rearranging text) reweights stakes until rupture becomes necessary, not accidental.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—validating the Republic’s legacy against reductionist archaeology—is signaled early and deepens when Elias chooses poetic resurrection over data. His agency drives escalation: covering mirrors triggers the vision, fracturing the shard to force witness. Cost is unmistakable—the vase’s final destruction—and narrows options irreversibly. Taelis’s presence crystallizes pressure, but coincidence (the storm) merely enables; Elias’s method earns the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—truth versus decay—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes the covenant demands reclamation, not repair. His agency drives escalation: choosing to unwind rather than wind, offering his honesty first, then his life. Cost is unmistakable: his erasure fuels the city’s reckoning. The stone’s hunger sharpens pressure coherently under the Accumulative lens, with each sacrifice narrowing options until only fire remains.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—confronting the limits of understanding—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s descent. His agency drives escalation: choosing to enter, touch the arch, then withdraw. The cost is unmistakable: he abandons a decade-long quest, burns irreplaceable notes, and accepts permanent uncertainty. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure tightens not through plot turns but through intensifying atmosphere and symbolic weight until the threshold moment forces crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—leaving a meaningful trace in a transient world—is signaled early and tightens when the GPS fails, forcing reliance on the lantern slide. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to press the slide to the arch, then to carve a new kind of offering. The cost is visible (loss of tools, commercial opportunity) and conceptual (renouncing market validation for communal memory). Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, culminating in a reconfigured relationship to time and legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering why flowers bloom at night—is signaled early and deepens into a confrontation with silence itself. The single meaningful tightening occurs when Liora holds the postcard to the window, triggering the glass to “shiver” and layers to separate: this protagonist-driven act narrows her path from seeker to witness. Cost is felt in her renunciation of painting, though the escalation leans slightly more on revelation than active pressure. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; insight emerges from sustained attention.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—uncovering truth vs. protecting it—tightens when Revision Board arrives, forcing Elias’s shell-based parley. His agency drives escalation: arranging debris reweights the confrontation, compelling the officers’ retreat. Cost is unmistakable: he sacrifices archival permanence for ephemeral release, altering tactics from deciphering to surrendering. The lagoon’s ripple isn’t luck—it’s earned by his ritualized gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.2)
    The dominant stake—whether memory can birth reality—is signaled early and deepens when the bottle demands “conception,” not wish. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he chooses to reimagine, not rebuild, and sustains the vision despite fear it will vanish. Cost is unmistakable—the years of solitude, the corpse-spitting sea, the risk of madness—and culminates in the tangible return of the town. This is Accumulative escalation: each sensory return (laughter, scent, footsteps) tightens the pressure until the world rematerializes.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving fragile emotional truths—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the prophecy emerges. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses immersion, then interpretation, then renunciation (not recording the prophecy). The deepening shift (“You are the hinge”) narrows his path to endurance with palpable cost—shaking hands, sealed fate. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens: each added layer (memory, language, voice) heightens tension without coincidence resolving anything.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving the seed-hoard against the vortex’s erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the cap must be “decreased,” not forced. Liora’s agency drives escalation: her whispered method triggers the unfurling, her push initiates reversal. Cost is unmistakable—the vortex’s howl, the chick’s shriek, the irreversible fusion of bird and tree. The deepening (“To decrease entropy, you must want the past more than the future”) reframes the conflict as temporal allegiance, raising emotional and existential stakes without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving warning clarity against storm distortion—is signaled early and tightens when Elias detects the aftertone warp. His agency drives escalation: he doesn’t wait for zero hour but intervenes, trading speed for precision by rewinding with slack. Cost is unmistakable: minutes to spare, abbot’s looming censure, and the physical toll of racing solstice currents. Coincidence complicates (past tester’s error) but resolution stems solely from Elias’s microclimate method and tactile recalibration.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding meaning in overlooked stillness—is signaled early and deepens when the meteor shower forces a choice between protocol and connection. Eli’s agency drives escalation: he actively traces, presses his palm, whispers “I see you,” and stays despite alarms. The cost is unmistakable—abandoning safety protocols risks system failure or exile—but he accepts it because vulnerability is his path to strength. Pressure tightens coherently under an Accumulative lens: each falling star intensifies his resolve until the brightest demands response.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving unspoken promises—is signaled immediately and tightens when ghosts arrive, forcing a choice between eternal silence and covenant release. The beekeeper’s agency drives escalation: his deliberate exhale cracks the seam, transforming passive endurance into active relinquishment. Cost is felt in the box’s emptiness and his subsequent disappearance; the oasis blooms only after he departs, proving his sacrifice was necessary. Coincidence never resolves—rain follows the covenant’s untangling, not random grace.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding time’s texture—is signaled early and deepens when Elias reads Marlen’s note: “I ran out of time before I could explain the texture of it.” The meaningful tightening occurs at the capsule: realization that time must be unraveled, not fixed. Agency drives escalation—Elias chooses to climb, read, interpret, and finally wind the watch. Cost is unmistakable: he abandons repair for creation, accepting that Marlen’s work was never about return but reinvention.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering beauty in the incomplete—is signaled early and deepens when the snapped kite string forces engagement beyond observation. The poet’s agency drives escalation: he retrieves the kite, ties its string, writes despite knowing the poem must remain unfinished. Cost is unmistakable: he sacrifices the urge to capture the lagoon’s “shiver,” accepting that some truths fray if stitched. Pressure tightens once (kite snap → heron flight → wading in), narrowing options from passive witness to active participant in imperfection.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—proving respect through bending, not purity—is signaled early and escalates when elders demand the sapling’s removal. Elira’s agency drives deepening: she chooses pain (“hands in the dirt”) over passive dying, tightening options until only one act remains—wrapping the sapling. Cost is unmistakable: her body fails even as her method succeeds, and Tomas’s conversion proves the ideological price paid. The Accumulative lens intensifies via copper’s recurring warmth/pliability versus Elira’s stiffening joints, culminating in the sapling’s autonomous turn toward the pillar.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—belonging versus institutional exile—is signaled early and deepens when the terminal asks “What do you miss?” Elara’s agency drives escalation: she follows footprints, enters the tower, answers truthfully, touches the galaxy. Each choice narrows options (funding revoked, lab abandoned) and incurs cost (isolation, irreversible departure). The figure’s warning (“Most never come back”) crystallizes stakes without resolving them; her reply (“That’s not a warning… It’s a promise”) embodies stance crystallization under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming death-soaked land through green life—is signaled early and deepens via the coachman’s ritual. Pressure escalates texturally: from memory (“earth shuddered under cannon fire”) to action (splitting pods, mimicking terns) to legacy (“garden would remember”). Cost is unmistakable: his anonymity, sleeplessness, and the irreversible surrender of seeds into indifferent tide. Agency drives escalation; birds guide but don’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—translating distance into closeness—is signaled early (“Distance is a wound… but the wound can be a bridge”) and deepens via protagonist agency: Rook chooses to follow the riddle despite settlement rules. Pressure tightens when the leaf burns and the dome reveals bones, forcing a trade-off: remain a searcher or become part of the message. Cost is unmistakable: he surrenders his identity (“spent a lifetime finding the dead”) to “be found,” with physical consequence (“vines wrapped around his wrist”). Coincidence never resolves; every escalation stems from Rook’s decisions under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—finding “true north” after societal collapse—is signaled early and deepens when the anomaly reframes it as temporal rather than spatial. Escalation is driven by Lira’s agency: she chooses to sketch the impossible, steps onto the railing, aligns the page with stars. Cost is unmistakable: she abandons the last human outpost, trading known isolation for unknown transcendence. The single tightening (anomaly reveal) forecloses passive observation, forcing irrevocable action under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming her master’s legacy to heal a broken world—is signaled early and deepens when the lid’s secret (the Keeper’s name) reframes theft as witness. Pressure tightens when the Keeper confronts her: the choice shifts from acquisition to offering. Protagonist agency drives escalation—she swaps pieces, speaks truth (“amended”), and leaves the map-knight behind. Cost is felt: three winters of labor, risk of death, and the emotional weight of carrying wonder into an unknown that once swallowed her master.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving unrecorded human gestures against erasure—is signaled early and deepens when Liora realizes pawns “unbound” themselves, shifting her from witness to liberator. Escalation is driven by her agency: lifting the bishop, spelling “release,” triggering the board’s metamorphosis. Cost is unmistakable: she dissolves into the dark, trading physical presence for legacy, while the penumbra departs “lighter,” implying irreversible change.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming buried talent—is signaled early and deepens when the stone reveals itself as a mirror, not a key. The tightening occurs when Elias realizes the pain isn’t memory but “the future he’d refused to let unfold,” forcing a trade-off: endure silence or risk self-reconfiguration. Agency drives escalation—he tears the page, plants the seed, steps through the door—and the cost (permanent departure, sealed door) is felt in the mountain’s sigh. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—forgiveness through re-engagement—is signaled early and escalates when the tapestry yields its silver confession. The tightening occurs when he recognizes the merchant’s daughter, forcing him to confront abandonment as his core failure. His agency drives every escalation: winnowing threads, stepping into the labyrinth, accepting the board. Cost is felt in the warmth of the metal absorbing regret—a physical ledger of emotional debt.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. institutionalized absolution—is signaled early and deepens when Liora climbs not to destroy but to refract. Her agency drives escalation: each carved line narrows the elders’ illusion until the spire destabilizes. Cost is unmistakable: physical pain, communal rupture, irreversible exposure. The tightening forecloses the path of silent endurance, forcing public inscription as the only viable resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether mending can redeem irreparable loss—is signaled early and deepens through the alchemist’s narration, which narrows options from repair to surrender. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: choosing which key matters, then stepping into the statue’s mouth. Cost is unmistakable: the workshop’s unspooling represents a lifetime of half-finished repairs sacrificed. The acid sea’s advance provides coherent, tightening pressure under an Accumulative lens, with no reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—fulfilling his mother’s promise—is signaled early and tightens when Elias enters the caves despite warnings. His agency drives escalation: wrong turn → cave discovery → shell immersion → leap. Cost is unmistakable: exile from community, destruction of art, bodily surrender. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens via sensory thickening (salt, breath, moss) rather than causal reversals, which fits the design.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—can quiet intention move others?—is signaled early and tightens when boats turn “one by one,” forcing Elias to sustain unbearable precision (“throat ached with the effort”). The escalation is driven by his agency: choosing scent over sound, silence over explanation. Cost is unmistakable: physical strain, emotional exposure, the risk of ridicule. Harkin’s softened face shows the stake’s expansion—now shared belief—and the harbor’s fullness proves success without coincidence resolving pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—navigating the geography of loss—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Lena shifts from passive receiver to active caller (“dialed the last number”). This escalation is driven by her agency under an Accumulative lens: each lunar call adds density until reciprocity becomes possible. Cost is felt in the weight lifting from her ribs—a physical manifestation of emotional burden. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres through ritualized structure.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—psychological survival in a truth-saturated world—is signaled early and tightens when warlord’s men arrive. Lior’s agency drives escalation: he occludes, not hides, altering tactics under pressure. The cost is unmistakable: he spits out comfort, buries hope, climbs back alone. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from his choices within the virus’s unyielding rules.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the stranger’s plea—tightens when Elias realizes memories are borrowed vessels, not puzzles to solve. His agency shifts from investigation to stewardship, narrowing options: he must carry then release. Cost is unmistakable in the line “The boutonnière would crumble by dawn”—a tangible loss marking his transition from hoarder to conduit. Escalation stems from his own choices (steeping the flower), not coincidence, under an Accumulative lens where each observed absence deepens thematic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—fulfilling a broken promise—is signaled early and tightens as the creek rises, narrowing escape options. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to follow the chip, kneel for ants, press the door. The cost is unmistakable: abandoning his curated life of maps for unresolved paternal guilt. Coincidence complicates (flood), but resolution stems from his choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—answering the grotto’s call—is signaled early and deepens via the queen’s agency: she burns the warning, climbs alone, and chooses immersion. Escalation is protagonist-driven; each step narrows options until only surrender remains. Cost is visceral: soul traded for truth, monarchy dissolved into myth. The violet fireflies’ shift to “teeth” crystallizes the price—innocence weaponized—and the final whisper (“Now you see”) reweights stakes for the kingdom below.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—capturing the density of presence—tightens when Liora reframes it as “what you return,” forcing Elias to choose between hoarding light or offering it. His agency drives escalation: he revalues the shell, drops it into her palm, pulls her into the “next equation.” Cost is felt in abandoned pocket-suns (“burning themselves out”) and the irreversible leap. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—escaping the prison of self-documentation—is signaled early and tightens when Younger Elias appears clutching an identical scroll, forcing Older Elias to confront his legacy. The escalation is driven entirely by protagonist agency: handing over the scroll, urging destruction, accepting the scream of misquoted voices. Cost is unmistakable in the charred remains and the final solitude. The fire doesn’t resolve but reconfigures—burning isn’t escape but recalibration under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—deciphering unspoken emotional legacies—is signaled early and deepens when Elias chooses interpretation over mechanical repair. His agency drives escalation: by pressing the screw into her palm, he transfers responsibility, forcing her to carry its weight. The cost is visible in his ledger sketch—an admission that some wounds can’t be healed, only witnessed. Under an Accumulative lens, this single deepening reweights the entire narrative toward resonant stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—transforming trauma before the storm returns—is signaled early and deepens when the quill tip sheds “a deliberate surrender,” forcing Lian to use her own scar as canvas. Escalation is protagonist-driven: she chooses to carve on stone, then press crystallized tip to scar, whispering the rune’s true name. Cost is unmistakable—the silvered line rewoven into light implies permanent loss of old identity. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each sensory detail (humming air, creaking platform) tightens the “breath between tempests” until the storm learns her language.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reconnection before irreversible loss—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: Mara chooses imperfect miracle over easy words; Elias chooses to touch the tendril despite pain. The tightening (perfume’s magic dragging up unsent letters) forces confrontation with cost, narrowing options to mutual vulnerability or permanent silence. Coincidence never resolves; the city’s bulldozers loom, but stakes center on emotional truth, not external salvation. Price is unmistakable: love acknowledged too late to save trees, but not too late to plant anew.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—unraveling the illusion that traps meaning—is signaled early and deepens when the witness realizes the library is dying. His agency drives escalation: reading definitions, pressing his palm, tearing the book. Each act narrows options (no return to passive witnessing) and incurs conceptual cost—the erasure of all recorded history. The spiral arbitration’s paradox is broken not by luck but by decisive action under Accumulative pressure, fulfilling the lens’s demand for a density-driven reweighting of truth.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving temporal integrity versus saving lost souls—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the ship breaches the horizon. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his choice to count forward (not backward) actively worsens the anomaly, forcing a higher-stakes renunciation. Cost is unmistakable: the ship vanishes, but the key bears a new notch—a permanent scar proving the gate can’t be perfectly closed. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with each counted number deepening dread and narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—perceiving hidden connections—is signaled early and deepens when Lena realizes the mushrooms model a better monitoring system than hospitals. Her agency drives escalation: scanning, then *adding* her pulse, which triggers the mushrooms’ brightening and her emotional release. Cost is felt (sister’s death as failure of imagination) and visible (abandoned scanner), though the tightening could more sharply foreclose an alternative path—e.g., rejecting corporate offers off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reconciling responsibility with rebellion—is signaled early and tightens when Lila chooses blue, foreclosing her father’s deterministic path. Escalation is driven by her agency: each interaction with the lantern or scrawl deepens her commitment. Cost is unmistakable: she risks her recovery plan, her filial loyalty, and her foundational belief system. The “lucid contradiction” isn’t resolved but traversed, raising stakes without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—learning to end so one can begin—is signaled early and deepens through the caller’s raw confession and Elias’s reframing of regret as chorus, not solitude. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: Elias chooses to share parables, spin the disc, and offer tomorrow as lifeline. The cost is felt in his isolation and her lingering tears, but the tightening is subtle—a single cadence shift rather than a reversal. Under an Accumulative lens, this suffices, though a sharper narrowing of options would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving sacred context against time’s erosion—is signaled early and deepens when she chooses to “steep the past into the present” via his planted tree’s ink. This agency-driven escalation narrows options: she rejects passive mourning for active reweaving, accepting the cost of incompleteness (“not yet whole, but no longer broken”). Pressure tightens through the lens: each sensory detail (violets closing, bell chiming) reweights the stake until the harbor’s answering lap becomes both promise and burden. Coincidence never resolves; the tide’s pull only intensifies her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reciprocity as antidote to collapse—is signaled early and deepens when Lena trades utility for belief. The tightening occurs when she relinquishes the rock, foreclosing her role as sole keeper of hope; cost is felt in her earned stasis (“wasn’t lonely. Not today”). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: offerings, rumors, and names accumulate until the ledger metaphor crystallizes. Minor deduction: Dr. Carter’s shift from virologist to forger risks coincidence, though his function as archivist justifies it thematically.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—mapping uncharted grief—is signaled early and deepens when the stillpoint reveals itself not as place but as internalized pause. Elian’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to kneel, to absorb the melody, to leave the bone. Cost is unmistakable: the end of his dowsing identity (“compass ring—once a tool—was just a reminder”). The celestial timeframe creates live pressure (“only chance”), narrowing options without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—can meaning survive historical editing?—tightens when the anomaly’s sigh forces Elias to reinterpret failure. Agency is clear: his decision to “plant again” forecloses the path of correction, accepting uncertainty as method. Cost is felt in the quiet renunciation of certainty, charged by the pen’s glow and rearranged stars. Escalation follows Accumulative logic: pressure intensifies through sensory and textual density, not causal turns.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—recovering erased memory—is signaled early (“thieves… stealing back what time had erased”) and tightens decisively when the faceless entity manifests. Protagonists’ agency drives escalation: Liora’s disruption (“You don’t get to keep them”) and Elias’s signing-net force the harbor’s luminous defense. Cost is unmistakable: the camera absorbs stolen light, becoming physically heavier—a conceptual price made visceral. Coincidence complicates (the shadow’s appearance) but never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—saving the world from a dangerous promise—is signaled early and tightens when Elias realizes his arson was rescue, not rage. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: tracing symbols, turning the key, choosing to burn. Cost is unmistakable: he sacrifices the ledger (and her memory within it) to prevent weaponization. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each artifact deepens moral weight until the decisive burn.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—mental autonomy vs. imposed empathy—is signaled early (“She called it theft”) and tightens when Lira shifts from quiet sabotage to active release, narrowing options to one irreversible act. Escalation is driven by her agency: drumming intensifies until memories coil like vines, forcing a trade-off between connection and selfhood. Cost is unmistakable: the “abandoned sorrow” frothing on the lagoon’s surface embodies what she forfeits. Coincidence never resolves; the universe’s breath merely frames her decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—proving whispers outlast brute force—is signaled early and deepened when the storm scrambles compasses, forcing navigation by footfall alone. Lior’s agency drives escalation: he chooses silence over confrontation, aligning the coin with the dent rather than demanding answers. Cost is unmistakable—the finished map offers no return path, and his bunk-bound reflection admits the real challenge may be staying. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each whisper compounds toward reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—carrying unspoken guilt—is signaled early (“pockets stuffed with stolen nails and a half-written apology”) and deepens via the boy’s tremors and hitched breath. The guardian’s weaving escalates pressure by offering nonjudgmental witness, forcing the boy to confront his shame without absolution. Cost is visible: the discarded note, the father’s delayed but palpable thaw. Agency resides in attention—both characters choose to see and be seen.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving the library as a vessel for quiet rebellion—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the grotto’s pulse escalates into physical defense. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he initiates displays, recruits students, and times the intervention. The cost is felt in the workers’ recoil and the town’s new “unspoken rhythm,” though the council’s reversal lacks visible friction—it happens off-page via notice. Still, the stakes remain viscerally charged through embodied resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—freedom vs. obligation—is signaled early (“island took what it was owed”) and tightens when the whale calls: Elias must choose between human silence and ancestral song. Agency drives escalation—he *unfolds*, doesn’t jump—and cost is visible: the island dissolves, severing all terrestrial ties. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via sensory saturation (vibrating bone, humming ribs) until stance crystallizes in Charged Poise: fins stretching toward song.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—carrying grief without state-sanctioned lies—is signaled early and deepens when Lena chooses raw screaming over silent compliance, then shares the bouquet and whittling as acts of mutual witness. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: her climb onto the railing isn’t passive; it’s a tactical reclamation of voice. Cost is felt in the bouquet’s disintegration and the burned tin—symbols of discarded mandates. Under Accumulative lens, this single intensification (scream → shared craft) suffices, with coincidence (Harkin’s can) complicating but not resolving core conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—poetic freedom versus imposed sanctity—is signaled early and deepens as Elira realizes respect was fear. Her agency drives escalation: touching pillars, whispering verse, stepping into the spiral. Cost is unmistakable—she forfeits stable identity for fluidity, and the elders’ fear proves justified. The tightening occurs when she grasps the ban was about containment, not exclusion, raising stakes from return to revolution.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—finding beauty in imperfection—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s silent language of plants and broken objects. The tightening occurs when Liora interprets his vine-and-petal message, forcing mutual vulnerability. Agency is exercised through renunciation (Elias rejecting visual beauty) and endurance (facing post-phoenix silence). Cost is unmistakable: sleeplessness, emotional exposure, and the implied price paid to the old woman—all crystallize in the final note, “bright, imperfect, and alive.”

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—recovering silenced sound—is deepened when Liora realizes connection resides not in recovered notes but in the “space between.” Her agency drives escalation: pressing the lens, turning it, following the shadows. Cost is unmistakable—the lens vanishes, replaced by a bell that “doesn’t travel” but unfolds, foreclosing her pilgrim identity. Pressure tightens coherently under Accumulative lens: each ghost instrument adds density until the resonator’s hum reweights all prior effort as unnecessary.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—transforming grief from static relic to dynamic vessel—is signaled early and deepens when Lena shifts from lilies to cranes. Agency drives escalation: her decision to ink the stencil onto her skin forecloses private mourning, enabling communal teaching. Cost is unmistakable: the hollow crane requires surrendering control over meaning (“didn’t know who would find them”). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each folded crane intensifies the thematic weight without false resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—mapping cultural fractures before the next crash—is signaled early and deepens when the quant reveals her brother’s role. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to treat data as story, aligning timestamps with arcana. Cost is visible—the visitor’s hollow eyes, the worthless bitcoin—and crystallizes in his final act: measuring raindrops to preempt disaster. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidental resolutions.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—whether to possess or release forbidden knowledge—is signaled early and deepens through the historian’s rejection of predecessors’ methods. Her agency drives escalation: turning the pagoda counterclockwise is a deliberate unmaking that triggers the climax. The cost is visible (her innocence, the veil’s color, the archive’s dissolution) and conceptually unavoidable. Pressure coheres entirely under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving hope too heavy to carry alone—is signaled early and deepens through Liora’s agency: she compares footage, interprets metamorphosis, chooses exchange. Escalation is protagonist-driven under Accumulative lens: each archival discovery tightens the emotional vise until the stone’s pulse mirrors her own. Cost is unmistakable: her shadow thins, she becomes “half-empty,” yet gains purpose. The curator’s lie complicates but doesn’t resolve—Liora’s choice alone crystallizes the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—self-respect vs. compassion—is signaled early (“mending what others broke”) and tightens when Elias chooses the child over the con. Protagonist agency drives escalation: returning medicine, writing amends, stepping into daylight. Cost is unmistakable—the apothecary’s heavy silence, Mara’s absence, the rabbit’s broken leg awaiting care. One meaningful deepening (shedding lies layer by layer) narrows options toward honest hands.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—deciphering scars to find closure—tightens when plants reveal memories not her own, forcing Liora to confront that she “had always been the thing in the walls.” Her agency drives escalation: turning the hourglass, opening the archive, writing on her mother’s file. Cost is unmistakable: she abandons her life’s work of “prying open sealed pain” to carry uninterpreted wounds, crystallizing stance without resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding where unused love goes—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes the letters are *in* the film, not beside it. Her agency drives escalation: touching the strip, feeding it to the projector, threading it “one last time.” The tightening forecloses the path of external retrieval; cost is the surrender of tangible proof for internal resonance. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each sensory layer raises emotional stakes until the final silence becomes the answer.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is signaled early and tightens when Liora recognizes the archway as a prison. Her agency drives escalation: she sings through the instrument, sketches equations mid-trance, and becomes the path. Cost is unmistakable—the archway’s destruction, the irreversible burden/gift of channeling cosmic stories. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens, deepening with each falling star.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving the possibility of rebirth against cyclical collapse—is signaled early and deepens when Hollow recognizes the toppled white king as a reset trigger. His agency drives escalation: prying open the crate, retrieving the spark, winding the clock backward—all narrow options and incur visible cost (carrying the weight of all sparks). The tightening culminates in a trade-off: accepting eternal responsibility to prevent another reset. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from Hollow’s choices under coherent, escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—rediscovering the mind’s wild frontier—is signaled early and deepens when the hum shifts from object of study to state of being. The tightening occurs in the fractal clearing: the shadow-composed of alternate selves—forces renunciation of singular truth-seeking. Agency drives escalation (his choice to press the gear, to reach, to walk “with” rather than “toward”), and cost is unmistakable: he forfeits the gear, his talisman of causality, to embrace probabilistic existence. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens—each sonic detail (cello-groans, glass-chimes) compounds toward the resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—courage to stay vs. go—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Liora kneels by the fire asking, “What do you do when the courage you needed was for staying?” Her agency drives escalation: traversing the ridge, pressing the punch into her palm, releasing it. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits her identity as guide (“hands empty of oars or tickets”) to join the vigil. The deepening crystallizes under Accumulative pressure—each unstamped ticket becomes a deferred life she now honors through stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—whether to uphold the lie of safety or restore sound—is signaled early and deepens when Elias recognizes the pianist. The tightening occurs when the bolt pulses warm: a physical manifestation of choice. Elias’s agency drives escalation; he could flee but stays, altering the fortress’s fate. Cost is unmistakable: pain returns, guests scream unheard, and the fortress trembles—proof that silence was never safety, only surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—truth versus illusion—is signaled early and tightens through three escalating messages, each narrowing Veythas’s options from passive guardian to active unmaker. The third message forces the decisive act: sundering requires sacrificing Lirien’s name, a price that crystallizes moral calculus. Protagonist agency drives escalation; coincidence (constellations pausing) complicates but doesn’t resolve. Cost is unmistakable in the library’s shudder and the crown’s collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.2)
    The dominant stake—recovering lost paths before they vanish forever—tightens decisively when the sonar reveals the line, then escalates as the tide recedes to expose the road. Lena’s agency drives every turn: her tapping, assembling, and final step. The cost is visible (the atlas dissolving, Voss’s alarm, the station powering down) and conceptual (truths too fragile for official record). Coincidence complicates (generators coughing), but resolution arises solely from Lena’s persistent method.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—rekindling purpose in a stalled rebellion—is signaled early and deepens when Lena realizes the fight was forgotten, not lost. Escalation is driven by her agency: touching the stone, interpreting the glasses’ flare, shouting to the scout. The tightening forecloses resignation (the lull) with visible cost—the colony’s hollow faces, the rusted bay—and culminates in a trade-off: reignition demands collective vulnerability, not just individual courage. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory beat intensifies the hum until it syncs with engines.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—evolving tradition versus rigid reconstruction—is signaled early and tightens when the kite’s script demands action before “embers cool.” Liora’s agency drives escalation: she decodes, speaks, unlocks. Cost is unmistakable: she risks heresy charges, fractures community trust, and endures public condemnation—all paid before the vines’ vindication. The Council’s pressure remains coherent, and coincidence (the kite’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; only her voice unlocks the amber.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—anchoring optimism in realism—is signaled early and deepens when Lena chooses not to correct the child’s “bird” misperception, accepting that meaning can be shared even if misunderstood. The tightening occurs in her shift from freezing time to allowing growth, foreclosing perpetual mourning. Agency is subtle but present: releasing the photo, plucking the leaf, walking toward fig trees. Cost is felt (emptied pocket, uncorrected memory) though not overtly dramatized as tactical loss.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—whether art can hold what time fractures—is signaled early and deepens when Elara abandons representation for reconfiguration. Her agency drives escalation: gathering shards becomes redesigning meaning, which triggers the library’s recognition and the lighthouse’s exhalation. The cost is unmistakable: the beam never returns, the tower dissolves, and she forfeits the self that paints for the self that *is* painted.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes tighten decisively when Kael spills the ink pattern from his nightmares, narrowing options to a single threshold. The deepening—that the thief collects fragments to rebuild something—alters Kael’s goal from justice to understanding. Cost is felt in his abandoned vengeance and irreversible step into temporal fracture, though the thief’s agency remains slightly opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving erased history—is signaled early and tightens when the letter names her as “the key.” Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to act “within the blink that follows surprise,” flooding the system herself. Cost is unmistakable: execution, branded treason, yet truth spreads. The tightening forecloses survival but enables revolution—a trade-off with conceptual and physical price that reweights the entire archive’s purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving continuity amid chaos—is signaled early and escalates through Liora’s agency: she chooses tending over flight, carving over violence, stitching over surrender. The tightening occurs when she knots the sandbag strip around the sapling, transforming debris into anchor. Cost is unmistakable: the cracked pane, the weight of paternal expectation, the ash-bound dawn. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each action deepens commitment without external reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming his daughter’s voice from mimicry—tightens when pebbles spell her name, forcing a choice between hope and protection. Agency drives escalation: he voices silence twice (question then command), digs away from her grave, and rejects the echo’s lure. Cost is unmistakable: blackened garden, stolen teeth, and the rail spike’s cold burn—a price that alters future tactics (melt or dig?). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each sensory distortion (zigzag stars, split air) raises emotional stakes without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—truth versus silence—is signaled early and tightens when ledgers reveal “V. Estate,” forcing Lydia to choose between legacy and justice. Escalation is driven by her agency: she initiates investigation, interprets patterns, acts on caretaker’s news. Cost is unmistakable: inheriting suspicion, bearing familial betrayal, risking the paper’s future. The mayor’s shadow looms via secretary’s flinch and nephew’s hire, making pressure coherent and personal under Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—silencing guilt—is signaled early and deepens when the machine reveals its true hunger. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to feed the note, triggering time fold and confrontation. The cost is unmistakable: reliving her abandonment, enduring the unending cry. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each sound layers until the ledger demands payment via witness, not erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving meaning against enforced forgetting—is signaled early and tightens when the flake warns “You’re close.” Lior’s agency drives escalation: listening → drawing → interjecting. The cost is conceptual (rejecting the elders’ “necessity = fear”) and social (risking ostracism), crystallized when he draws the unfinished maze. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with each deepening (whispers → chorus) narrowing his options to act or collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory against state-sanctioned erasure—is signaled early and tightens when soldiers intervene. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his naming ritual forces the commander to confront his own loss, narrowing options from violence to participation. Cost is unmistakable—physical pain, social risk, emotional exposure—and culminates in a trade-off: vengeance deferred for collective remembrance. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, deepening through each named fragment until the sword clatters down.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—Elias’s survival—is signaled early and intensified by Lydia’s intervention. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: Lydia chooses to act, intertwines branches, and offers visions. The deepening (timeline manipulation) narrows options—Elias must either accept possibility or reject it—and carries cost (Lydia’s fading, the coin’s transfer). Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens, with each sensory layer raising emotional stakes without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—illuminating hidden pathways—is signaled early and tightens when Lena chooses to paint rather than vanish. The escalation is driven by her agency: she devises the somatic sequence, presses the sliver, interprets Mira’s texture-voice, and commits to pigment over passage. Cost is unmistakable: she risks dissolution but foregoes immediate reunion to build a return path. The telepathy pill recall isn’t backdrop—it’s the wound that makes the key meaningful, raising stakes beyond curiosity into love’s responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to the silenced world—tightens when the fossil’s memory flares crimson, forcing Lior past observation into resonance. Agency drives escalation: choosing to press palm, step deeper, exhale. Cost is conceptual (rejecting stasis’ silence) and felt (static-dissolved wrist display). Coincidence (floating leaf) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Lior’s choice to speak earns the cave’s answer.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preventing the hourglass from breaking—is signaled early and tightens when the ledger warns “Consequence: the hourglass breaks.” Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to descend, thread the needle, retrieve, then relinquish the button. Cost is unmistakable: personal sacrifice (“We do”) replaces mechanical catastrophe. Pressure coheres under causal lens—no coincidences resolve; the traveler’s dying words catalyze but don’t solve.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—balancing the ledger of uncrossed names—is signaled early and deepens when the pillbox reveals coordinates tied to Lena’s own handwriting. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her choice to open the pillbox narrows options from hiding to acting. Cost is unmistakable—re-engaging risks further betrayal—and the moral calculus sharpens around fixing broken systems versus self-preservation. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with the wind’s shift marking each intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—crossing at the right moment—is signaled early and tightens via the gutters’ slowing rhythm and fog’s double lift. Agency lies in attention, not force; the coachman’s restraint *is* the action. Cost is felt: the merchant’s fear, the girl’s departure, the unbroken cycle of waiting. Escalation is driven by ambient cues, not coincidence, though the causal link between “percolating” mist and timing borders on mystical rather than earned under strict causality.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding why places resist change—is signaled early and deepens when the bee lands, triggering the embedment act. Agency drives escalation: the potter *chooses* to seal memory into clay, narrowing his path to cyclical return. Cost is felt in his shadow “long and unbroken”—a life devoted to fractures while the village endures. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each thrum tightens the thematic knot without false resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming agency after trauma—is signaled early (“pry open the rusted latch of her heart”) and deepens when the basil wilts and her blood fails as offering. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elias arrives: his second gauge tooth shifts tactics from solitary ritual to shared possibility. Cost is felt in Lena’s vulnerability (“quivering hush”) and the irreversible act of accepting help, narrowing her path of self-reliance.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—coexisting with the ghost of one’s species’ guilt—is signaled early and deepens when the Hesperornis attacks its reflection, escalating tension to physical shockwave. Lior’s agency drives escalation: he grabs the sundial, opens the book, steps through the door. Cost is unmistakable: the weight of being the only rememberer, the dissolution of the book, the irreversible departure. Coincidence (bird’s appearance) complicates but resolution stems from Lior’s choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—rejoining secrets vs. hoarding them—is signaled early and tightens when Liora admits “It’s not mine to give” yet gives it anyway. The escalation is protagonist-driven: her decision to offer her *own* unsent letter deepens the conflict from professional duty to personal reckoning. Cost is unmistakable: she surrenders privacy, symbolized by the dissolving orbs in her dream. Under the Accumulative lens, this single deepening suffices, though a second pressure point (e.g., monk’s challenge) would push it to 9.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—proving humanity isn’t pawns—tightens when Liora’s interference halts campus fractures, raising the cost of exposure (dean’s search). Her agency drives escalation: calibration → pulse → frequency tweak → signal’s curious shift. Coincidence complicates (faculty leaks) but never resolves; the alien’s “laughter” pressures her toward bolder action. Felt cost appears in professors’ “thin” voices and drooping signs—concrete losses altering later tactics (stealth becomes impossible).

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—unsealing the city’s true form—is signaled early and deepens when the key proves alive and the city begins rearranging. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses descent, then transfixion, then rebellion. Cost is unmistakable—the compass aims at his chest, the chamber tilts like a storm-tossed ship—and his final choice forecloses passive recovery in favor of active remaking. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each sensory intensification tightens the thematic screw.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—bearing witness to the erased—is signaled early and deepens when the lance reveals the mayor’s son’s violence. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his whisper summons the echo; his refusal to reach honors the dead’s rules. Cost is felt in empathy’s return (“heart a little less still”) and the irreversible burden of knowing. Coincidence (ribbon arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; truth emerges through his method.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—redeeming Orin’s name—is signaled early and tightens when the Maw moves, forcing Elias to choose between safety and truth. His sprint to the deck is an agency-driven escalation that narrows options irreversibly. Cost is felt: physical trauma, lost artifact, psychological burden. The storm doesn’t resolve conflict; Elias’s choice does, under coherent pressure shaped by the journal’s cipher and Liora’s warning.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—access to “amnesty” via recounting—is signaled early and deepens when Elias presses his thumb to the flake and inherits others’ fragmented memories. His agency drives escalation: choosing to look through the glass, pocket it, then play the road’s name. Cost is unmistakable—the pullout seals behind him, the flake dissolves, and he abandons the bridge identity. Pressure tightens coherently under an Accumulative lens: each sensory cue (ozone, static voice) narrows his path toward the threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding why paths circle back—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s confrontation with his father’s ghost and the startup era’s collapse. The meaningful tightening occurs in the animal car: recognizing that forward isn’t destiny reframes his entire stance. Cost is unmistakable: relinquishing the illusion of progress, symbolized by leaving the train behind not as loss but proof. Protagonist agency drives escalation; coincidence never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—decoding the temple inscriptions—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes decoding was the wrong goal; joining the chorus is the true task. Escalation is driven by his agency: adjusting the telescope, pressing palm to parchment, exhaling hoarded words. The cost is unmistakable: his ledger, identity, and sister’s absence are transformed, not solved. Coincidence (telegram’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; understanding emerges from his persistent attention under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—unearthing the truth behind his brother’s disappearance—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the plant digests the lake’s confession. Eldrin’s agency drives escalation: he steals the seed, plants it, endures the reveal. The cost—realizing his brother jumped, that the lake hoards choices—is unmistakable and alters his stance forever. Pressure coheres under Causal lens without coincidence resolving core conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—finding the intersection to uneclipse the covenant—is signaled early and tightens when Future-Liora declares, “You’re early.” The meaningful deepening occurs when Liora realizes the maze is a loom, not a prison, transforming her approach. Agency drives escalation: her scar-guided navigation and run across the root bridge are active choices with felt cost (pain, temporal dislocation). Coincidence complicates (shifting hedge) but never resolves; the covenant’s restoration hinges entirely on Liora’s earned stance.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—patching soul-holes via bartered destinies—is signaled early and deepens when the orchard demands her child’s name. Agency is clear: Liora chooses to “trammel fate” by inlaying meaning, escalating pressure until roots pull her hidden guilt. Cost is unmistakable: losing the name forever, paid for a future “unshackled.” The tightening forecloses her old path of reckless trades, crystallizing in her dawn departure—lighter but bearing scars.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—assigning worth in a world of discarded dreams—is signaled early and deepens when Liam confronts the widow’s grief and his own hollowness. The tightening occurs when he chooses the “worthless” scrap over appraisal logic, foreclosing his old identity. Cost is unmistakable: he abandons professional certainty for emotional risk. Escalation is driven by his agency—his hands coil cables in memory, then fold the cloth in real time—under coherent Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding “the physics of leaving”—tightens when Elias plants the seed, foreclosing passive scholarship for active ritual. Agency drives escalation: his invocation triggers the wind reversal, not coincidence. Cost is unmistakable: he gains insight but not reunion; the wife remains memory, not resurrection. The deepening—from deciphering to embodying transition—is protagonist-led and lens-coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving transitions lost to temporal rupture—is signaled early and deepens when the woman demands a spoon of “almost.” Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses the crucible that requires “two truths at once,” accepting the cost of working with irreconcilable states. The moon’s flip imposes physical weight as price, and the creel’s shudder marks a meaningful pressure point. Though stakes are metaphysical, they feel visceral through object-based tension.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—dissolving emotional walls—is signaled early and escalates through the inspector’s agency: each shell read tightens her resolve, narrowing options until she must choose between obedience and embodiment. The “heartbeat of hesitation” crystallizes pressure into a decisive moment with felt cost: loss of career, anonymity, and the safety of institutional detachment. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her choices under coherent environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness through truth—tightens decisively at the third bridge, where Elias must choose between denial (left) and accountability (right). His agency drives escalation: stopping medication, interpreting graffiti, walking to the bridge—all narrow options toward a single, costly renunciation (not playing the bellows, accepting silence). The price is felt in his shaking hands, unsketched maps, and the “weight that didn’t float.” Coincidence never resolves; pressure stems solely from his past failures and present choices.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—recovering unsaid words before they’re erased—is signaled early and deepens when the second letter posts, collapsing the library. The dreamer’s agency drives escalation: she climbs, touches books, tears a page, and ultimately writes anew. Cost is unmistakable: the library’s destruction, the watch’s silencing, and her own veils peeled away. Pressure coheres under a Causal lens—each backward tick yields a vision that tightens the window for action until the chime of the postman forces irreversible choice.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—weighing a dream against empire—is signaled early and tightens when coffee stains reveal two paths, then a third. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses propagation over payment, costing her security but freeing the symphony. The collector’s off-page threat creates coherent pressure without resolving via luck. Cost is unmistakable: kneeling in dirt, branded a thief, yet carrying a heavier dream.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—capturing the spark before oblivion—is signaled early and deepens into a moral imperative: bearing witness to unsaid beauty. Escalation occurs through Liora’s agency: she doesn’t wait for revelation but actively “infuses the chip with her focus,” narrowing options until only one act remains—reaching through. The cost is visible: the chip’s light is spent, and she assumes lifelong burden (“carry this with her”). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of static, breath, and memory tightens until the doorway emerges.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—accessing the “source” before contentment’s surface—is signaled early and deepens when Maren rejects peace for origin. The tightening occurs when she plucks the shoot, accepting dissolution into her veins as price. Agency drives escalation: climbing, planting, choosing, giving. Cost is unmistakable: lost hairpin, buried children, enduring grief—but now metabolized. Coincidence (finding the arsonist releasing doves) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her action does.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—freedom from borrowed guilt—is signaled early and escalates through Elias’s agency: he chooses to unhook each knot, dissolving threads into foam. Each unraveling deepens pressure by narrowing his identity (shedding others’ doubts) and raising cost (confronting his own complicity). The climax—kneeling in tide to dismantle the cloak—is earned, not coincidental, and the final pulse-beam shows stakes transformed, not resolved. Coincidence (smuggler’s skiff) complicates but doesn’t solve; Elias’s stance crystallizes through deliberate renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—teaching vanishing through appearing—is signaled early and deepens via the student’s return arc. Pressure escalates when the trance fractures the ripple pattern into a “code only he could read,” forcing Elias to confront his own method’s limitations. Cost is unmistakable: his body’s “stuttering” reversal and the grotto’s embarrassed retreat of starlight show the physical toll of revelation. Agency drives escalation—each stone drop is a deliberate act that narrows his options toward Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving harmonic navigation against predatory entropy—is signaled early and deepens when the lagging bird breaks formation. The skimmer’s agency lies in attention: choosing to bind the pulse to stone rather than abandon it. Cost is unmistakable—the Hollow Maw passes beneath him, hunger unmet but proximity lethal—and this near-miss reweights his role from listener to anchor. Escalation stems from his decision, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding the sacred in the simple—is signaled early and tightens decisively at the summit when Marlin realizes the climb was performative. The keeper’s line “mastery’s just another kind of forgetting” crystallizes the cost: institutional recognition demands surrendering authentic creation. Pressure escalates texturally (not causally), with each sensory detail (stubborn flame, humming petals) narrowing Marlin’s options until renunciation becomes inevitable. His agency shines in the final refusal to explain—a stance that forecloses career advancement but preserves integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering whether sound has color—is signaled early and deepens when Elias learns it must be *made*, not found. The tightening occurs at the door: choosing to use the key transforms passive obsession into active creation. Cost is unmistakable in the silent vow and the irreversible perceptual shift (“waves… shimmered”). Escalation is driven entirely by Elias’s agency under Accumulative pressure, with the festival’s ticking clock heightening urgency without resolving conflict coincidentally.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—interpreting the prophecy or letting existence gutter—is signaled early and tightens when Liora realizes static is a backwards voice offering a choice. Her agency drives escalation: selecting the black-hole coin sharpens static into a question, then arranging coins in a spiral triggers harmonic resonance. Cost is unmistakable: she dissolves “atom by atom,” trading embodiment for purpose. The deepening (“Do you remember the shape of your own beginning?”) forces renunciation of forward illusion, narrowing options to alignment or silence.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—naming formless fears to give them shape—is signaled early and deepens when the Leviathan warns “You’re not supposed to name us,” raising moral cost. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he chooses to press each fear into monsters despite knowing consequences (“He already did” regret). The tightening forecloses his own emotional path (no room for regret) and unleashes tangible horrors (child’s scream, ship’s bell). Cost is unmistakable: his shadow now harbors a newly named entity, and stars’ indifference underscores irreversible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—restoring balance through understanding the viaduct’s rhythm—is signaled early and deepens when drips stutter, raising urgency. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his tuning spell forces the bell to weep, synchronizing drips and churning the bay. Cost is unmistakable: physical toll (bleeding hands), social isolation (“villagers called him earnestly naive”), and the unresolved cosmic imbalance. Pressure tightens coherently under the Accumulative lens via pattern intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to bury or resurrect memory—is signaled early and tightens when Elias chooses to nail new photos instead of blank ones. His agency drives escalation: each photograph affixed narrows his path from erasure toward testimony. The cost is unmistakable: relinquishing the bottle, burning irreplaceable images. Under an Accumulative lens, the deepening isn’t causal but textural—each added photo intensifies emotional pressure until ignition becomes inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—harmonizing logic and intuition—is signaled early and tightens when the flame drinks the dew, forcing renunciation of her sentimental past. Agency drives escalation: she chooses to burn the crystal, knowing it will erase the girl who “whispered secrets to the moon.” Cost is unmistakable in the orchard’s erasure and the silent starlings’ judgment. Under Accumulative pressure, each image deepens the tension until the blue flame crystallizes her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preventing weaponized silence—is signaled early and tightens when the radio voice returns. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she revises the sequence, deploys the chute, secures the payload. Cost is unmistakable: corroded trust held alone, faith of the helpless resting on her precision. The wind’s reliability versus human betrayal sharpens moral calculus without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—identity integrity amid imperial erasure—is signaled early and tightens when Veyra delivers the “ORIGINAL” jar, forcing Kael to choose between legal fiction and existential truth. His agency drives escalation: he chooses merger over custody, paying the cost of potential dissolution. Under causal lens, each beat narrows options: from passive endurance to active vivification. The Emperor’s offstage pressure remains coherent, never resolving via coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving space for unforced discovery—is signaled early (“Failure was the point… the stretch of a mind pressing against its own edges”) and tightens when Elias embeds the seed in the labyrinth, then deepens when Lina senses it’s “breathing.” The meaningful escalation occurs when they replant it outside, shifting from game to guardianship. Cost is unmistakable: “Business slowed. Then it stopped.” Agency drives every turn—Elias chooses mystery over profit; Lina returns alone, boots muddy, ready to tend. Coincidence (anonymous seed) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from sustained attention.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring joy to a grieving household—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes his mimicry may be unnecessary. Escalation is driven by his agency: he intensifies efforts until the blower dies, forcing a pivot. The meaningful tightening occurs when real laughter erupts, foreclosing his solitary ritual. Cost is felt in his trembling fingers and abandoned instrument—a renunciation with emotional weight, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether to preserve or release dimensionally homesick books—is signaled early and tightens when the Librarian appears. Lyssa’s agency drives escalation: her hesitation, then surrender of the pendant, directly triggers the garden’s unraveling. Cost is visceral: loss of self (“weight of words lifting from her bones”) and dissolution of known reality. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—whispers become shouts, mist becomes sentient—and climax crystallizes her stance: uncertainty as home.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—Elias’s need to prove destruction can be generative—is signaled early and tightened through successive offerings (memories, doubt) that narrow his options until only forbidden incantation remains. Agency is total: he chooses to feed, to slam, to whisper “Let it be worse.” Cost is unmistakable: the guild’s inevitable retaliation, his social death, yet he smiles—he has already won. Escalation is driven by his choices under Accumulative pressure, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—tuning the unheard—is signaled early and deepens when Elara shifts from decoding to surrender. The meaningful tightening occurs when she discards assumptions, narrowing her tactic to unlearning. Cost is felt: the dish shatters, the fragment falls, yet the note persists internally. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (lunar perigee) complicates but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—keeping the ferry intact across collapsing timelines—is signaled early and tightens when the radio warns of five minutes until unraveling. Lira’s agency drives escalation: she doesn’t react but *aligns*, then *merges* lanes. The cost is visible: the ferry shudders, passengers scream, and the grotto seals behind them, cutting off return. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens—density of overlapping realities intensifies until resolution reweights what “arrival” means.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—making grief tangible to prove memory’s communal nature—is signaled early and tightens when the woman warns “They’re coming to dismantle it.” Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to complete the weave despite knowing it will be undone. Cost is unmistakable in the ending: the gallery returns to ordinary space, but Elias’s hand-taking signals willingness to rebuild, bearing the emotional toll. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each embedded fragment (laughter, rain scent) deepens the collective resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—learning alien navigation—is signaled early and deepens when Kael’s doubt forces Elira to demonstrate the chain’s “outward” potential. The tightening occurs at the Spire’s edge: one wrong move means death, yet she risks it to prove the aliens’ method. Cost is unmistakable—the abandonment of ancestral charts—and agency drives escalation: Elira’s recalibration reframes the entire city’s future.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to the forgotten—tightens when Elias realizes he *is* part of the story. Agency is clear: his choice to touch the glove escalates pressure into revelation. Cost is felt: he can no longer separate professional duty from personal legacy. The “mist takes the forgotten” stakes materialize viscerally, not abstractly, and the climax forces a reconfiguration of his entire purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—bearing witness to the unremembered—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes the cables *keep* what they track. His agency drives escalation: he chooses to cross the seam, kneel at the junction box, and carry out the “thing.” The tidal clock imposes real pressure (“minutes before the phase seam sealed”), and the cost is unmistakable—the risk of being added to the remembered, the weight of invisible light in his bones. No coincidence resolves; everything hinges on his deliberate, costly attention.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving identity against bureaucratic erasure—is signaled early and deepens when the “digital ghost” reframes the static as collective wisdom. Lena’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to defragment, to listen, to sync. Cost is felt in her relinquished isolation; the heartbeat no longer counts down but counts *with*. One meaningful tightening suffices, though the pressure remains internal and textural rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—translating the untranslatable before it vanishes—is signaled early and deepens as the echoes become predatory. Veyra’s agency drives escalation: she exhales into the diamond, ignores the tremor, and answers the canyon. Cost is unmistakable: her body seized, voice stolen, existence absorbed. The tightening occurs when the starlings scatter—the moment passive listening becomes active summoning—and from there, options vanish. Coincidence never resolves; only her flawed choice does.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—resolving cosmic injustice through bitterness—tightens when the arrowhead-seed forces a binary: rot or rewrite. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he picks up the arrowhead, answers the phone, laughs into the void. Cost is unmistakable: loss of human form, voice becoming petals. The garden’s “harmony untamed” isn’t coincidence—it’s the coherent pressure that crystallizes his stance. One deepening suffices: the phone’s confession reframes his quest as participation, not vengeance.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming organic beauty from mechanical control—is signaled early and tightens when the violinist chooses to play louder using heart rhythms, risking statue attention. Escalation is driven by her agency: each musical intensification triggers earth-shivering responses, culminating in uprooting. Cost is unmistakable: the sky-bridge frays under new wings, implying loss of her perch. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of resonant acts reweights the world’s rules without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—delivering what was never meant to arrive—is signaled early and deepens when the storm reframes “mail” as emotional truth. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to cross, to trust Lira, to run to Seventh. The seven-minute gap and drone patrols create persistent constraints that shape tactics. Cost is felt in his scar, the drones’ encroachment, and the weight that only lightens after delivery—not resolution, but resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—interpreting silence as possibility—is signaled early and tightens when the halo fragment warms in Lior’s grip, forcing him toward the song. His agency drives escalation: he chooses the "wrong turn," enters the impossible car, offers the fragment, and finally "sings" with his hands. Cost is unmistakable: the woman fades, leaving him alone with endless work, yet the silence now "felt like a door"—a trade-off between companionship and purpose. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; each sensory intensification (misting hush → chime of wind bells) deepens the central question without false resolutions.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding where stories live—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes preservation isn’t enough; he must unfold creases. Protagonist agency drives escalation: locking doors, anchoring scarf, reading silences. Cost is unmistakable: the scarf’s dissolution trades personal relic for communal access. Pressure tightens coherently under Accumulative lens—each fragment collected (marginalia, pressed flower) heightens the need for release, not retention.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—capturing the runaway dream—is signaled early and tightens when the first photo fails, forcing recalibration. The librarian’s agency drives escalation: whispered title, aperture adjustment, refracted-light gambit. Cost is unmistakable: the dream’s fraying edges and gull-cry dissolution force a trade-off between preservation and freedom. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via layered attempts, each narrowing the window for success until the sun’s climb forces crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—freeing an idea trapped by fear—is signaled early and deepens when the locksmith realizes the prison is protective, not punitive. Escalation is driven by her agency: she listens “to the space between the strands,” invoking memory to bypass tools. Cost is unmistakable: she violates her core rule, endures disorientation, and accepts that liberation means relinquishing control. The tightening forecloses her habitual method (picking locks) in favor of surrender—a trade-off charged by her personal history.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—recovering stolen memories—is signaled early and tightens when Elias realizes gaps are “spaces held open.” His agency drives escalation: pressing the mushroom to the stone triggers the hum that surges fragmented memories, forcing him to confront the trade. Cost is legible in the “crisp ache” of emotional voids and the physical tremor before his final whisper. The memory eater’s offer of a “cleaner slate” makes the moral calculus agonizingly specific.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—learning to return from exile—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency: Kael chooses to annotate despite fear, and Elspeth chooses to teach return over escape. The shadow’s lunge escalates pressure, forcing immediate action; the cost is legible in Elspeth’s withheld truth (“you learn the cost of coming back”) and Kael’s smudged hands bearing “something older” than tea. Under the Accumulative lens, each sensory and symbolic layer intensifies the weight of reversible exile. Coincidence never resolves—only character choices do.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving the color of wonder—is signaled early and deepens when the seed pulses, revealing it’s not for soil. Elias’s agency drives escalation: stepping through the veil, giving the seed, painting the girl’s wrists. Each act narrows options (he cannot stay; she must carry it back) and incurs cost (his disappearance, the orchard’s lonely trees). The moral calculus—stealing vibrancy to seed memory—is sharpened by the child’s fading form, making the theft a kindness with teeth.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—containing vs. releasing the drowned—is signaled early and tightens at the swollen knot, where Elias’s choice forecloses both paths: no fixing, no burying. Agency is renunciation (letting go), not action, consistent with Accumulative lens. Cost is immediate: spirits rise as storms, town wakes to altered reality. Pressure coheres through sensory escalation (whispers → howl → laughter), culminating in a crystallized stance—“You let it be”—that reconfigures all prior tension.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—interpreting silence as language—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: overlaying films reveals seasonal whisper, leading to the realization that the map tears at a temporal threshold. Cost is unmistakable: Elara gains insight but no proof, bearing the weight of unverifiable knowledge. The tightening occurs when she threads her own reel, foreclosing passive observation for active participation. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each sensory detail reweights silence from absence to presence.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding the physics of letting go—is signaled early and deepens when snow falls upward, forcing stance crystallization. Agency drives escalation: Liora’s choice to leave the globe, tuck the notebook, and surface into storm enacts renunciation. Cost is unmistakable: “Some things were heavier than truth.” Coincidence (sonar ping) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the Electra’s perforated wing implies prior passage through threshold, raising stakes without solving them.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—translating silence without being consumed—tightens decisively when the ghost demands entry into the balladeer’s body. His agency drives escalation: encoding begins as ritual, becomes dialogue, then defense, culminating in the rest-symbol renunciation. The cost is visceral (seared palm, raw throat) and conceptual (permanent exile from song). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: each chalk mark deepens the ghost’s presence until the stone rips, forcing the final trade-off—containment over connection.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—measuring joy amid anguish—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency: Liora chooses to unfold, trace initials, interpret data. The tightening occurs when she realizes the numbers aren’t cold records but warmth-chasing metrics, foreclosing her old narrative of imprisonment. Cost is felt in her tightened throat and the implied exhaustion of “frozen steps,” yet she climbs anyway. Escalation under Accumulative lens succeeds via cadence shift from resistance (“pages resisted”) to surrender (“gave way with a sigh”).

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—validating that absence leaves tangible traces—is signaled early and deepens when the string snaps, forcing Elias to choose between survival and communion. Escalation is driven by his renunciation (not fighting the fall), which narrows options to pure surrender. Cost is felt in the final beat: he steps out with unread ledgers, accepting obscurity for truth. However, the tightening lacks a second on-page reversal; the single meaningful turn (string snap → acceptance) meets length expectations but doesn’t exceed them.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—containing the infinite—is signaled early and deepens when the vellum instruction reframes it as spiritual rather than technical. The tightening occurs when she shifts from carving faces to crafting light, foreclosing her old identity. Cost is felt in ash-covered hands and the crew’s distant hammers. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens: each sensory layer (sap, glass, fire) intensifies the thematic weight without coincidence resolving anything.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—escaping the loop—is signaled early and tightens when engines fail mid-discovery. Liora’s agency drives escalation: her noting of patterns alters tactics, forcing Veyra to choose between protocol and possibility. Cost is felt (crew’s fear, ship’s decay) but slightly muted; the resolution lacks tangible sacrifice beyond time lost. Coincidence is avoided—the phrasebook’s map overlay emerges from prior setup, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming what the eclipse stole—is signaled early and tightens when the child reveals the hands are “inside, coiled tight as a held scream,” forcing the locksmith to risk reaching in. This deepening narrows options: repair or lose her sister forever. The cost is legible in the final image—not time regained, but “the shape of time’s absence”—a resonant trade-off. Agency drives escalation: every tool use, every whispered plea, is her choice under pressure, with no deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether Veyth can become a true “nebula of respite”—is signaled early and deepens through Liora’s agency: she chooses to listen to cracks, gather others, and finally write “We stay.” The meaningful tightening occurs when Kael reveals strangers stayed because they “didn’t ask what you’d get in return,” reframing respite as mutual care, not transaction. Cost is unmistakable: Liora surrenders her role as lone seeker to become part of a fragile, ongoing effort. Escalation follows Accumulative logic—density of action (irrigation, lanterns, teaching) reweights the stake until the planet itself “believes” in their commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving borrowed time versus releasing it—is signaled early and tightens when the puppet head appears, forcing Elias to choose between self-preservation and collective healing. The deepening occurs when he recognizes the lullaby, transforming abstract duty into personal redemption. Cost is unmistakable: “no more adjustments… just the final chime.” Agency drives escalation—Elias alone inserts the head, and the sea’s held breath externalizes pressure without resolving it.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—guiding travelers without being consumed by the orchard’s curse—is signaled early and tightens when the half-dead girl arrives, forcing Liora to act against her lifelong refusal. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she uses the blueprint’s logic to leave impressions, a method refined over years. Cost is unmistakable: she sacrifices her last nut and remains behind. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with frost acting as a live clock that narrows the window for action.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—translating separation into connection—is signaled early and deepens when Elias shifts from building bridges to allowing dissolution. Pressure escalates texturally: foam patterns → Fibonacci spiral → girl’s “map” observation, each intensifying his insight. Agency is quiet but decisive: he chooses not to build, but to release. Cost is felt in the loss of his sister’s scar, his professional identity, and the chrysalis itself—all surrendered to the river’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—locating where stories truly begin—is signaled early and deepened through the patron’s request for the “glimmering parole,” forcing Liora to enact a high-stakes ritual. The tightening occurs when she chooses the smallest slate and incises not words but listening, narrowing options to a single resonant act. Cost is felt: the moonlight’s darkness remains with her, and the library itself “makes room,” implying irreversible alteration. Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, with each sensory intensification reweighting the silence’s value.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—relieving unbearable remorse—is signaled early and tightens when Elias chooses to give rather than take. His agency drives escalation: he actively distills and delivers the memory, narrowing his emotional options. Cost is unmistakable: bearing others’ grief until he can offload it, with physical and psychic toll evident in trembling fingers and metallic aftertaste. The pavilion’s rules create coherent pressure without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—restoring communal coherence through language—is signaled early and escalates via Liora’s agency: she hides, engraves, and returns the weight, then introduces translation cards. The tightening occurs when Elias admits the spine “bends or breaks,” forcing a trade-off between grudges and survival. Cost is unmistakable: thirty years of silence must be unlearned. Luck complicates (missing weight), but resolution stems from character choices under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—recovering abandoned memories through entanglement—is signaled early and tightens when Lena feeds current through nanites, risking neural collapse. Escalation is driven entirely by her agency: each mirror adjustment deepens entanglement, narrowing her options from observer to participant. The cost is unmistakable: irreversible fusion with others’ traumas (“probe’s dying whisper… lover’s unspoken goodbye”). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with the canyon’s “wound” intensifying until the final Charged Poise crystallizes stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—finding where combinations hide—is signaled early and deepens through tactile discovery of the seeds. Escalation is driven by Lysara’s agency: she follows the whisper, kneels, presses the page, reaches. The hour-long inversion imposes a live clock that narrows options. Cost is felt in the collapsed threshold and blank manuscript, though the sudden chamber transition slightly softens causal linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—making empathy audible in a silent world—tightens when cracks “sing differently,” forcing Elias to shift from listening to active tuning. His agency drives escalation: each strum alters the sculpture’s resonance, culminating in a melody that draws birds back. Cost is unmistakable: physical exhaustion, relinquished relic, and irreversible emotional exposure. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—no coincidence, only deepening vibration.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—translating silence into legible beauty—tightens when the girl’s arrival forces Elias from observation to participation. His agency drives escalation: kneeling to correlate, refusing to answer, then choosing the dent over victory. Cost is unmistakable: the weight lifting from his chest signals emotional forfeiture of exile’s safety. Coincidence (child appearing) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the nexus’s memory only activates through their joint play.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether silence can mediate human fracture—is signaled early and deepens when the diary reveals another’s failed attempt. The tightening occurs at the sketch of two hands: silence was insufficient during the guild fire. Elias’s agency drives escalation—he chooses to test his belief by entering the ruins. Cost is unmistakable: he risks his core identity as a collector of silences by stepping into noise. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with fireworks acting as external rhythm, not resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—cultivating serenity within motion—tightens decisively when the flower blooms and forces confrontation. Liora’s agency drives escalation: stealing, planting, sketching, then stepping toward the bloom while Elders retreat. The deepening isn’t external conflict but internal recalibration under communal pressure, culminating in a trade-off: personal secrecy for collective trust. Cost is felt in the Elders’ softened robes and unlocked vault—social capital exchanged for earned poise.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding the source of resilience—is signaled early and deepens when Veyra realizes it must be cultivated, not located. Pressure tightens via the inversion’s ticking clock and the arch’s fracture-as-mouth, forcing a decisive dive. Agency drives escalation: she chooses to reach in, plant later, answer the planet. Cost is felt in the lost mentor, the broken arrow, and the irreversible bodily change—but the inversion’s end slightly softens consequence by resetting the orchard too cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—foresight through data over intuition—is signaled early and deepened when Veyra abandons documentation to run. Pressure tightens via protagonist agency: her flare strike momentarily breaks the pattern, revealing the system’s adaptability. Cost is unmistakable: lost instrument, torn sleeve, forfeited explanation. Coincidence complicates (bone sound), never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—certifying wonder over control—is signaled early and deepens through three chimes that progressively narrow options: first shatters harmony, second melts centuries of enforced silence, third dissolves the amber sheet itself. Each act carries cost (loss of elder approval, destruction of sacred artifact) and is driven by Liora’s agency. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: aurora’s response escalates from pulse to conversation to permanent presence.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving the weave—is signaled early and deepens when Elias chooses understanding over control. The child’s laughter escalates pressure not through force but through intimate, destabilizing memory. His agency drives the climax: playing the flute to widen, not seal, the breach. Cost is unmistakable—the end of guardianship as he knew it, symbolized by the uncased flute left behind.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the “mathematics of emotion”—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes equations reside in “borrowing,” not ink. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he chooses to press palm to fragment, dissolve borrowed voices, and finally set new type. Cost is unmistakable: relinquishing control, identity (“crossed out his name”), and the old method of deliberate ambiguity. The stars’ vanishing acts as coherent pressure, not coincidence, forcing stance crystallization under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—carrying wonder beyond routine—tightens when the woman crushes a seed, proving the courier’s decade of delivery was misguided. This deepening forces renunciation: he must stop collecting and start cultivating. Cost is felt in the pendant’s loss and the mentor’s revealed sacrifice. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency—his lie, his hesitation, his final planting—and the ridgeway’s tremor responds organically, not coincidentally.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—proving objects absorb emotions—intensifies when Elias realizes they *return* them, raising existential cost. His agency drives escalation: choosing the arbor, communing, interpreting frost, then rejecting the prism. The deepening (“absorption wasn’t the end”) narrows options to destruction or possession, crystallizing his stance. Coincidence never resolves; pressure stems from his own obsession and the prism’s emergent agency.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—bridging impossible distance for love—is signaled early and tightens when the amber bead appears, forcing a high-cost choice: use the last resource to weave a one-way message. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she cracks the bead, weaves through night, hangs the tapestry knowing she’ll remain. Cost is unmistakable: “the sender must stay,” her bones woven into roots. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens until silence itself becomes actionable material.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—coaxing resilience from a broken world—is signaled early and deepened through the smith’s agency: he chooses to descend, to feed the silk, to press his palm. The tightening occurs when the ground groans and the arch shudders, forcing a trade-off between retreat and trust. Cost is unmistakable: the silk’s magic is spent, his old self surrendered. Coincidence never resolves; the planet’s “sigh” responds only to his deliberate act.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—discovering the weight of withheld truth—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist-driven escalation: Liora’s choice to follow static leads to the shard, then to redirect her mapping inward, forcing the seam to reopen. The cost is legible: she must relinquish certainty (clear shard) to reclaim possibility (green shard). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each resonance (voice echo, intercom warning) narrowing her epistemic options until stance crystallizes in the final step.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—bottling safety in a world of “teeth and salt”—is signaled early and deepens when letters shift from cryptic to personal (“Adair, 1892”). Elias’s agency drives escalation: burning letters, climbing the tower, writing back, adding stones. Each act forecloses isolation with felt cost (abandoning routine, risking emotional exposure). The blue glass arrival isn’t coincidence—it’s earned reciprocity, tightening the bond. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens, culminating in a trade-off: connection over escape.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—shaping the dawn against encroaching shadows—is signaled early and tightens when the silhouette appears. Liora’s agency drives escalation: she twists the wick, speaks prophecy, flares the light. Cost is unmistakable: social exile, emotional isolation, eternal recurrence. The deepening (“The next sunrise will be the last you recognize”) narrows options—she cannot stop, only delay. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens with one decisive intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding why stories magnetize—is signaled early and deepens when the heart aches at the blind poet. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he chooses to paint, to follow the map, to unfold the wing in the square. Each act narrows options—he cannot unsee the villagers’ cracks, cannot return unchanged. Cost is felt in burned arms and dissolved wing; the final price is relinquishing control over narrative ownership, becoming a vessel rather than a master.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—carrying/transmitting sorrow—is signaled early and deepens when Elias feels the astronomer’s grief in the glass. The meaningful tightening occurs at deconstruction: choosing to listen rather than fix forecloses repair but enables return. Cost is unmistakable: Elias absorbs the memory (“hands stinging”), yet lightens as he passes it on. Agency drives escalation—his method of mapping dreams makes him uniquely capable of this ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—rekindling communal song to save the realm—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Liora’s first note cracks her throat but draws a harmonic response, narrowing options from solitary effort to shared revival. Agency drives escalation: her bleeding, singing, and endurance force the mirror world to “sing back.” Cost is unmistakable: her voice burns, her body fails, and her identity is subsumed. The deepening shift—from hoarding shards to weaving them—alters tactics and forecloses isolation permanently.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—confronting the ethical weight of her “mistake”—is signaled early and deepens when Voss’s reflection forces recognition that her hiding was itself a form of breadcrumb-leaving. The tightening occurs in the mirror chamber: Lena’s choice to accept guidance rather than flee narrows her path from avoidance to engagement. Cost is unmistakable in the irreversible locking of the door and the emotional labor of reclaiming her thesis. Escalation is driven entirely by Lena’s agency under Accumulative pressure, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—resisting the normalization of loss—is signaled early and tightens when Liora chooses to bake rather than explain. Her agency drives escalation: crumbs → wheat → loaves → communal weeping. Cost is unmistakable: she bears solitary witness until the city stops adjusting. The prince’s return isn’t coincidence but consequence of her uncloaking, paid for in silent endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—extracting meaning before total loss—is signaled early and tightens as illusions dissolve and shelves collapse. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he works faster, presses the slide harder, chooses the heart over safety. Cost is unmistakable: the library’s destruction, his ledger abandoned, his identity as mere measurer shed. The deepening—from recording frequencies to recognizing a personal invitation—narrows his path decisively toward the bridge, with no retreat possible once the ice creaks beneath him.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—avenging Papa’s betrayal while upholding the “truce of hush”—tightens decisively when Lena uses false starts to corner Veyne, narrowing his options until his greed overrides caution. Agency is clear: she engineers the trap, and the cost (carrying the sound of broken trust forever) is felt in her cigarette-smoke stillness at dawn. Pressure escalates through protagonist-driven tactics, not coincidence, and the market’s ancient rules crystallize stakes without exposition. One meaningful deepening suffices—and here it’s masterful.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding why people carry weather—is signaled early and deepens when Lira realizes she *is* the weather. The forests’ election creates coherent pressure that forces her stance crystallization (“the work was just beginning”). Escalation is driven by her agency: kneeling, tasting, stepping forward. Cost is unmistakable—the loss of her compass, her skepticism, and her former self—and visible in the ring dissolving into her veins. Coincidence never resolves; the storm chooses her only after she converges.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—unlocking suppressed creativity—is signaled early and deepens when the lock merges with the painting, forcing a trade: safety of monochrome for risk of color. Agency is clear: Elias turns the dial to a *memory*, not a number, making the climax an act of will, not luck. Cost is felt in his shaking hands, burning arms, and the irreversible abandonment of the lock. One meaningful tightening suffices: the moment the painting splits, options narrow to creation or retreat—he chooses creation.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—truth versus survival—is signaled early and tightens when Elias chooses to descend despite knowing the Archive holds unbearable confessions. His agency drives escalation: piecing the map, entering the chute, pressing the plate. Cost is unmistakable: physical exhaustion (“ink ran dry”), emotional exposure (“throat tightened”), and irreversible loss of protective artifice. The final act forecloses his former life as gilder of lies, with visible consequence in the unadorned letter.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder against a loud, brittle world—is signaled early and deepens as the ice thins into pulse. Liora’s agency drives escalation: she chooses the fragment’s placement, endures its dissolution, and smiles at misinterpretation. Cost is felt in her solitude and the irreversible loss of the ice, yet she begins anew. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves—only her tuning, the wind, and the material’s limits.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—whether preservation requires destruction—is signaled early and deepens when the box reveals grief as uncontainable data. Elias’s agency drives escalation: opening the box, choosing fire, releasing fears into the pyre. Cost is unmistakable—the woman’s voice dissolves, his programming is abandoned, and he walks into lethal desert. Magnetic pull intensifies pressure physically and symbolically, narrowing options until only renunciation remains.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to the unheard—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s agency: she chooses to listen, open, share. The tightening occurs when the mailbox yields its letter, foreclosing private interpretation in favor of communal response. Cost is felt: the burden of Elena’s unsolved disappearance is transformed into collective care, not resolved. Coincidence (maildrop) complicates but doesn’t solve; escalation is driven by Mira’s decisions under accumulating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—transforming encrypted fear into liberated truth—tightens decisively when the dice demand a dance-password. Lira’s agency drives escalation: her movement *is* the solution, narrowing options from intellectual decoding to bodily vulnerability. Cost is unmistakable: journals dissolve, lab floods, scientist’s name erased. The ocean’s “patient and inevitable” pressure coheres throughout, never resolved by coincidence but by Lira’s calibrated defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—recovering his wife’s excised memories—is signaled early and escalates through his ritualized methods. The tightening occurs in the chamber: coffee grounds spiral “tight and desperate,” the stone shifts, gravity yawns wide. His agency drives the escalation (brewing, pressing flowers, kneeling), and the cost is unmistakable—the vision’s silent scream, the stone’s disintegration, the ash of wildflowers. Coincidence (the beached whale) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the true antagonist is the system that *takes* memories.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—hushing a prophecy that unravels the world through unspoken fear—is signaled early and deepens via the summoner’s agency: she maps silence, weaves counter-spells, lunges at the escaping thread. The escalation is textural but decisive: the brook shatters, secrets scatter, yet her crafted hush lessens the prophecy’s weight. Cost is unmistakable—seared skin, tattered wing, solitude—and reweights the final moment: not victory, but reprieve earned through attention-as-action.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding the building’s language—is signaled early and deepens into interrogating its hidden trauma. Escalation is driven by Elias’s agency: lingering outside, signing the contract, demanding answers. The tightening forecloses innocence (Veyra’s lie: “you’ll walk away unchanged”) and forces a trade-off between knowledge and self. Cost is unmistakable in the brownstone’s exhalation and Elias’s staggering absorption of collective grief.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving identity against state-mandated forgetting—is signaled early and deepens when Liora chooses to archive rather than hoard memories. Her agency drives escalation: burial triggers garden transformation, which provokes patrol arrival. Cost is unmistakable: bodily capture traded for viral remembrance. The lattice’s song embodies stakes made audible, fulfilling the Accumulative lens’s demand for density shift with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—forgiveness versus vengeance—is signaled early and deepens when the forger chooses to unwrite cruelty rather than escape. Pressure escalates via the guard’s arrival and the Emperor’s weary presence, forcing a live choice with irreversible cost: the forger sacrifices his life’s work (forged decrees) to restore truth. The Emperor’s parallel stake (redemption vs. tyranny) tightens credibly through his physical collapse and plea to “teach me.” Agency drives every turn; coincidence never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—“Why do some of us echo?”—is signaled early and deepens into a moral trade-off: knowledge versus peace. Veyra’s agency drives escalation—she steps forward, presses the shell, sings—and each choice narrows options until only renunciation remains. Cost is unmistakable: losing her echo means losing part of herself, visualized in the silent shell and wind-only return. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; coincidence never resolves, only complicates (the shell’s third utterance).

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—truth versus comfort in grief—is signaled early and deepens when Lena reveals the fisherman’s ghost was misread. Escalation is driven by Lena’s agency: she chooses to show the child, then her own mother, accepting emotional risk. Cost is unmistakable: the widow gains hope but Lena reopens her wound; both pay with tears that physically alter the globe. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens—each vision tightens thematic stakes without false resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—visibility of hidden effort—is signaled early (“Why fix what no one sees?”) and deepens when Liora’s whistle summons minnows, proving perception alters reality. The tightening occurs in her choice to mimic Kael, which narrows her worldview from skepticism to participation. Cost is legible in her “pulse thrumming like a second tide”—a bodily awareness that forecloses ignorance. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—uncovering hidden truth—tightens when Elias realizes the lie protects life, forcing renunciation of his debunker identity. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: he chooses to enter stillpoint, touch diamond, and “turn the key.” Cost is unmistakable: his body dissolves, truck abandoned, orchard erased. The deepening (“quarantine, not accident”) narrows options from exposure to stewardship, crystallizing stance under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—allegiance to dawn or dark—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist-driven escalation: Elias’s micro-choices (sealing crack, hurling receiver) narrow options irreversibly. Pressure tightens under Accumulative lens via rising voice intensity and portico destabilization until the final act reweights everything. Cost is unmistakable: loss of receptive passivity, betrayal of static chorus, and assumption of violent agency (“scalpel”). The moral calculus sharpens perfectly—creation demands destruction—and the bruised-purple dawn embodies unavoidable harm.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—translating time’s bitterness into shared beauty—is signaled early and deepens when the girl validates Elias’s purpose. Pressure escalates not through external threat but internal shift: his failed repair attempt (trembling hands, rusted key) makes hoarding futile, forcing the choice to share. The cost—abandoning the dream of his mother’s voice restored—is felt in “fragile but true” note and lighter loft air. Coincidence (girl’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency lies in Elias’s response.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—containing the artifact before ice fails—is signaled early and tightens when she realizes redirection requires self-sacrifice. Escalation is driven by her agency: tuning the resonator isn’t passive endurance but active harmonic matching. Cost is unmistakable: “unravel her from the inside out” paid in real-time cellular dissolution during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—redefining revolution through patience—is signaled early and deepens via Lior’s act of listening, which narrows options: he rejects fire/fury for celestial alignment. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (kneeling, pressing ear, stepping onto ice), not coincidence. Cost is unmistakable: severing ties with sister and sanctuary, walking alone into uncertainty. The viaduct’s rise isn’t luck—it’s the payoff of thirteen winters of moon-path tracking, making the “softly purposeful” ascent feel inevitable under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—uncovering systemic erasure of Black history—is signaled early via the Railroad lantern and deepens when Platform 7 deaths echo past escapes. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his empirical tracing of symbols leads to the sealed wall, where he chooses confrontation over compliance. The cost is conceptual (risking career, life) and felt in the water’s seepage, though the physical danger remains slightly abstract. Coincidence (drought ending) complicates but doesn’t resolve; pressure tightens through protagonist-led discovery under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—earning the right to atone—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes Harkin built absolution, not requested it. The tightening occurs when he chooses to send the letter, foreclosing his habitual avoidance with visible cost (vulnerability, physical exertion in the storm). Pressure escalates through protagonist agency: each repaired cog, each penned apology tightens his commitment. The storm complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from Elias’s deliberate action under coherent moral pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake (“ring a bell no one hears yet”) is signaled early and deepens via Pip’s agency: she *chooses* to transliterate doubts into blueprints, then latches the arrow to her chestplate. Each crash extracts cost (melted arrow, borrowed fingers), narrowing options until the final spiral where fall becomes “method.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of failed attempts intensifies until the air itself yields. Coincidence never resolves; the bell remains silent, demanding more work.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—recovering erased truth against a system designed to consume memory—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Lena discovers the subdirectory *ECHO_OF_FORGOTTEN_SONGS*. Her agency drives escalation: she bypasses firewalls, inputs override codes, and pulls the files despite alarms. The cost is unmistakable: flagged for termination, she chooses deletion to restore others’ existence. Coincidence (the query appearing) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her persistent defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—whether to act on empathy—is signaled early and tightens when the fragment shifts from observer to catalyst. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to descend, to wait, to step onto ice. Cost is unmistakable—the mirrors shatter behind him, symbolizing the end of passive witnessing. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each glimpse deepens urgency until the final, irreversible step.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—learning “the sound of approaching endings”—tightens when the child’s crisis forces Lior into an ending she didn’t seek. Her agency drives escalation: stepping onto ice despite screams, accepting the fish as “reason to postpone.” Cost is legible in her canceled appointment and the dog’s blue eye—a life now tethered to hers. Coincidence (dog recognizing parasol) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her choice to cross remains pivotal. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each sensory detail deepens her stake in slow unraveling.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether love’s mismatch invalidates its truth—is signaled early and deepens when Lior reads the letter. His agency drives escalation: he chooses to reinterpret rather than reject, transforming pain into understanding. Cost is unmistakable: he forfeits reunion but gains peace, crystallized in the lighter weight. The single tightening (from grief to reconfiguration) suffices under Accumulative lens, with stakes viscerally felt through wine, charcoal, and ghost lipstick.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving wisdom’s whisper against prophetic fire—is signaled by paragraph two and escalates via the prophet’s followers burning sigils into dunes. Lysan’s agency drives deepening: her consecration reweights the parapet’s song from groan to thrum, temporarily reversing entropy. Cost is legible in her hollowed chest and the voice’s regretful warning—“You can’t hold it forever.” The tightening forecloses passive hope; she must act now or lose the clearings entirely.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—collective healing through reframing pain—is signaled early and deepens when the archivist layers photos beneath her lens, turning private grief into public art. Escalation is driven by her agency: lingering, plucking lavender, waiting for light. Cost is felt (her chest aching until now) and conceptual (the town must carry pain together). One tightening suffices: the moment she chooses to shoot, knowing the photo will hang in the bakery, altering communal memory.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—decoding why language stopped—is signaled early and deepens when the crystal reveals growth “underground.” Pressure escalates through Elias’s repetitions, each narrowing his perception to silences. Cost is felt: decades of work rendered obsolete, yet he risks further isolation to testify. Coincidence (woman’s entrance) complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency lies in his choice to join her.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—capturing the “sound of growing older”—is signaled early and escalates through Elias’s agency: he draws spirals, aligns driftwood, presses the tape to metal. The deepening occurs when the sculpture moves, forcing him to choose between flight and confrontation; his run “toward” narrows options irrevocably. Cost is unmistakable: the chalk crumbles, arrows break, and the tape falls silent—tools of his quest rendered obsolete by his own action. Coincidence (tape washing ashore) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from his choice to engage.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—harnessing the ephemeral—is signaled early and deepens when the clock spins, forcing Elias to choose between collapse or restructuring. His agency drives escalation: he climbs, reaches, syncs. Cost is felt in his surrender of control (“didn’t try to catch them”) and irreversible departure. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each flickering shadow tightens the thematic vise until the final release. Coincidence never resolves; the hand’s spin is catalyst, not solution.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—executing a flawless goodbye—is signaled early and deepens when bloodwork arrives. Pressure escalates not through external obstacles but internal calibration: Lena must play *despite* futility, embodying “decisively kind” when kindness feels like betrayal. The tightening occurs in her choice to play *Morning Has Broken* anyway, narrowing her role from healer to witness. Cost is felt in her ribs, her palms, her relinquished shard—visible, unspoken, earned.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering where shadows go—is signaled early and deepens into confronting what they *are*. The tightening occurs when Elara realizes the Academy’s dismissal masks danger, forcing her to act alone. Agency is clear: she chooses to turn the second key despite the automaton’s warning, paying the price of potential dissolution. Cost is unmistakable in the final image: she steps into hunger itself, trading safety for knowledge under Accumulative pressure that reweights light as threat.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—repairing the rupture caused by the changeling substitution—is signaled early and deepens when Liora connects the tooth to her brother’s stolen identity. Escalation is driven by her agency: she chooses to engage, press the tooth to her palm, offer a bargain. The tightening occurs when the changeling lunges—not to attack but to share memory—forcing Liora to confront the wound that became a door. Cost is unmistakable: she trades certainty for a fragile restoration, symbolized by the humming needle she keeps.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving non-consumptive light—is signaled early and deepens when the girl arrives seeking “how to *keep* it,” forcing Liora to choose between isolation and lineage. This single, meaningful tightening forecloses her solitary practice with felt cost (the ghost of Elias, the burden of continuity). Pressure accumulates texturally through memory and ritual, not coincidence, and the climax arises from Liora’s agency: she initiates the transfer, embodying her grandmother’s teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming agency after public shaming—is signaled early and deepens through Lena’s refusal to hide. The meaningful tightening occurs when she shifts from solitary refuge to collaborative ritual: offering moss, then the pendant. Cost is visible: surrendering her sole comfort object. Javier’s presence complicates but doesn’t resolve; he’s a witness, not a fixer. Escalation is driven by Lena’s agency—each choice (kneeling, plucking moss, unclasping chain) narrows options toward vulnerability as action.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether to control or release the story—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Elias stops swimming upstream. His agency drives escalation: choosing to listen triggers the cameos’ integration, which reshapes the novel. Cost is unmistakable: his body vanishes, his authorial ego dissolves. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via density (cameos accelerate) and cadence shift (“He wrote faster now…”), culminating in a stance crystallization that forecloses his old path with physical and existential price.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring the arbor through song—is signaled early and tightens when Mira realizes “remedy wasn’t in her tools.” Escalation is driven by her agency: choosing truth over safer stories, voice over silence. Cost is unmistakable—throat burn, chest tightness—and narrows options to one irreversible act. The harvest moon’s alignment isn’t coincidence but a deadline that pressures her choice, fulfilling Situational lens requirements with coherent, rising tension.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—safekeeping starlight against oblivion—is signaled early and tightens through the alchemist’s blood sacrifice and precise layering. Escalation is driven by her agency: each discarded object (apple seeds, ice shards) narrows options toward the fragile seal. Cost is unmistakable: her body bears the cold, her tears bled the ink, and the world’s end looms beyond the rim. The deepening (“she had been teaching it how to stay”) reweights the stake from hoarding to transmission.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—accessing lost wonder—is signaled early and tightens as the “wounded season” ends, forcing faster work. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: sketching in dust, aligning gears, turning them despite tremors. Cost is felt in the echo’s warble (“stretched thin”) and the race against thaw, which narrows options without external interference. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via sensory density and emotional weight, not plot twists, fulfilling the single meaningful deepening required.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—freeing others from sorrow while avoiding self-dissolution—is signaled early and deepens when the grotto itself imposes an ancient, collective burden. Elira’s agency drives escalation: her singing and flame-tilting calcify weights, but the grotto’s counter-gift forces a higher-stakes reckoning. Cost is unmistakable: she surrenders her identity as weaver, becoming part of the hush. The child’s lingering fear creates authentic tension between compassion and survival, resolved only through total acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—containing the memory of her husband before his death—is signaled early and tightens when the girl asks why the lions are never fully there, forcing a verbal reckoning. The deepening comes in the dream (circus collapse, roars in ribs), which crystallizes her fear of dissolution. Her agency is clear: she chooses to carve despite pain, then chooses to keep the lion, foreclosing income but affirming internal truth. Cost is unmistakable: “hands ached,” “half-gone herself,” “kettle had gone cold”—all physical manifestations of emotional toll.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—negotiating with one’s ghosts—is signaled early and tightens when the twenty-five-year-old ghost accuses her of cowardice, forcing Lira to articulate her true motive: protecting her younger self from her own path. This deepening shifts tactics from collection to confrontation, culminating in the leap that accepts cost (being pulled under) without resolution. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens; each ghost-Lira embodies a foreclosed option. Coincidence never resolves—agency lies in Lira’s refusal to bargain.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming agency from abandoned hope—is signaled early and tightens when Lena realizes the terminal is a “maze of intentions.” Her agency drives escalation: slotting the sextant triggers resurrection, which she then repurposes rather than fixes. Cost is unmistakable: belief was siphoned by the carnival; her solution offers passage, not escape. The bypass detour embodies a trade-off—pragmatic infrastructure over cosmic promise—with on-page consequence (kids using the new path).

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming agency over abandoned creation—is signaled early and tightens decisively at the fracture, which forecloses return to obedience. Escalation is protagonist-driven: nostalgia unravels restraint, leading to physical destruction reframed as offering. Cost is unmistakable: broken forecourt, elders’ condemnation, and the surrender of perfection (“imperfect, asymmetrical, alive”). The glacial hush shifts from oppressive constraint to liberated medium, deepening stakes without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—deciphering her father’s lies—is signaled early and tightens when the sundial’s inscription reframes the quest. The meaningful deepening occurs at the marsh: truth resides “in the spaces between” destinations, not the destinations themselves. Agency is clear—Liora chooses to let go, foreclosing the path of relic-hunting with felt cost (abandoning coordinates). Coincidence (radio broadcast) complicates but doesn’t resolve; pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving time-woven knowledge against erasure—is signaled early and tightens when Elias decodes the fulgurite knot, realizing the rope traps not protection but memory. His agency drives escalation: he doesn’t passively receive revelation but actively splices in the seed pod, binding past and future. The cost is conceptual yet undeniable: he assumes lifelong custodianship of a fragile, singing archive. The bell buoy’s impossible sound confirms the stakes have shifted irrevocably—he now hears what others cannot.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—narrating the unspeakable absence—is signaled early and deepens when the thread pulses like a heartbeat, transforming obituary into search. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to follow the thread, withhold the locket, reinterpret departure. Cost is unmistakable: he carries absences “like seeds,” foreclosing conventional mourning for perpetual witness. The tightening—from writing gaps to boarding ships as cartographer—narrows his life to one sacred task, with emotional and existential price paid in solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reawakening lost beauty—is signaled early and deepens through Aldric’s escalating commitment: from collecting fragments to risking his last drop of “liquid sunlight.” The meaningful tightening occurs at the membrane-piercing moment, where he knowingly courts failure (“quaking certainty that he was tampering with a genesis already doomed”). Cost is visceral: frayed robes, social isolation, emotional exposure. The creature’s flawed emergence doesn’t resolve the conflict but reweights it—the stake shifts from restoration to acceptance of imperfect rebirth. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with each sensory and mechanical detail amplifying thematic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—proving scars can sing via unyielding compassion—is signaled early and deepens when the boy’s injury forces Liora to enact her creed under pressure. The tightening occurs in her swift binding of the wound: same thread, same hands that stitch memory and mend flesh. Cost is felt in blood-darkened stitches and lingering tremors. Coincidence introduces the crisis, but resolution stems entirely from protagonist agency and prior-established values.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—liberating trapped memories—is signaled early and escalates via Liora’s agency: she follows breadcrumbs, pushes the door, tears threads free. Cost is unmistakable: the chamber trembles, dust rains, voices unmuzzle—a world-altering rupture. Sidereal patience reframed as tactical timing (“knowing when to push”) sharpens the moral calculus. No coincidence resolves; every intensification stems from her defiant choices under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—breaking cyclical decay to share light without loss—is signaled early and deepens when the gear demands memory as fuel. Veyra’s agency drives escalation: she chooses transit despite heresy, sacrificing selfhood. Cost is unmistakable (“let the gear take the memory of her first bloom”) and alters tactics (hands now glow, enabling new garden). Pressure tightens coherently under Accumulative lens: each ping intensifies possibility until the bridge forms.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—shaping collective grief—is signaled early (“Could grief be carved?”) and deepens when the father declares, “Grief isn’t a line. It’s the space between them.” This tightening forces the carver to abandon letter-carving for hollowing, a costly renunciation of tradition that redefines his art. Agency drives escalation: his decision to unspool the ribbon and carve absence—not names—alters tactics under spectral pressure. The three-day migration imposes a live clock, but more powerfully, the cost is felt in the granite’s crack and the father’s dissolution, charging the final trade at dinner with emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—restoring communal balance through temporal honesty—is signaled early and deepens when Elias presses the inscribed rake against the bob, slowing time to drag the past into the present. This act forecloses his anonymity (he emerges from gearwork shadows) and invites council wrath. Escalation is driven by his agency: carving names, adjusting the chime, choosing exposure. Cost is unmistakable—splintered wood, social censure, and the irreversible shift in the village’s self-perception.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—unearthing buried truth—is signaled early and escalates through Elias’s agency: each knot untied narrows options (shadows stretch, voices warn, vision reveals betrayal). The third knot’s resistance and the noose-like final knot raise cost visibly (blue flame, emotional tightening). Coincidence never resolves; Hester’s request sets pressure, but Elias’s choices drive deepening. Cost crystallizes in the final beat: he must now speak, foreclosing silence.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—innovating within constraints—is signaled early and deepens when the spire *sings*, validating her method not as imposition but dialogue. Pressure escalates texturally: wind howls, ice groans, she fears overstepping—then the resonant note confirms alignment. Her agency drives every turn: choosing the dot, trusting the nib’s dive, closing the ledger only after co-creation succeeds. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: she relinquishes control, accepting that the map’s impact depends on others’ courage (“if you dare”). No coincidence resolves tension; the spire’s song rewards attunement, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming forbidden expression—is signaled early and escalates through Elias’s broadcasts, culminating in Lira’s testimony. The tightening occurs when the girl arrives: risk shifts from solitary defiance to shared vulnerability. Cost is visible (Elias vanishes, quill abandoned) and conceptual (the state’s control fractures). Agency drives escalation: he chooses to broadcast, to open the door, to hand the mic to Lira.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.2)
    The dominant stake—whether truth can be held without destroying its fragility—is signaled early and deepened through Liora’s act of burning the portrait she finally understood. This meaningful tightening forecloses the path of representation, forcing her into dissolution-as-preservation. The cost is felt in her isolation, the mask’s bite, and the transience of her art—all legible in the final image. Pressure accumulates texturally rather than causally, but coherently under the Accumulative lens, with the chair’s stillness marking irreversible emotional depletion.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving counter-narratives against institutional erasure—is signaled early and escalates coherently: from hiding relics to blocking the tunnel mouth. The meaningful tightening occurs when Veyra delivers the flood threat, forcing Elias’s siege stance. Cost is unmistakable: his life for the cog’s witness. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (hauling, sorting, standing firm), not coincidence, under an Accumulative lens where density itself becomes resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving communal voice amid societal unlearning—is signaled early and deepens when Elias shifts from notation to subtraction. His agency drives escalation: choosing to gather remnants, place the rosette centrally, and hum negative space. Cost is unmistakable in lost members, trembling hands, and bullet scars; the tightening forecloses loud harmony but opens possibility through quiet presence. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether memory can be nourishment rather than burden—is signaled early and deepens when Elias chooses to cook with the fruit despite heresy. His agency drives escalation: planting, harvesting, serving broth—all narrowing his path back to conventional success. Cost is unmistakable: social censure, professional risk, and the emotional weight of handling others’ pain. The Great Alignment’s ticking clock raises urgency without resolving via luck; the fruit’s growth stems from his patience, not celestial magic alone.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder in a systemized world—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes the city’s failure is spiritual, not technical. His agency drives escalation: he chooses to plant the seed despite fear. The cost is felt (loss of ancestral artifact) and conceptual (rejection of seamless predictability). Coincidence (the matchbox) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the climax hinges on Elias’s decisive act under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding why some spaces feel alive—is signaled early and deepens through Liora’s ritual act, which narrows her path from seeker to witness. The tightening occurs when she places the shard among displaced objects, triggering the bay’s response and the whispered “You’re close now.” Agency is clear: her hands move “as if they remembered a ritual,” and she chooses to leave the shard, foreclosing possession. Cost is felt in what she surrenders (the physical key to hush) and gains (internal resonance).

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—whether to kill the “god”—tightens through three revelations that narrow options: first the city was planted, then the child is innocent, finally the poison targets the old world’s root. Human’s agency drives escalation; their sobbing press on the seam is a renunciation with visible cost (mission failure, identity collapse). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each truth deepens moral calculus until nuance shatters certainty. Coincidence never resolves; all turns stem from telepathic confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding vs. accepting a missed opportunity—is signaled early and tightens when Lena realizes the climb itself was the misapprehension. Her agency drives escalation: throwing the dice, leaping sideways, refusing the door. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits rewriting the past, embracing perpetual motion as choice. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens via density increase (dice behavior) and cadence shift (run → laugh → press palm → turn back).

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—whether kindness persists beyond strangers—is signaled early and tightened when the painter chooses to inscribe a child’s laughter into a dead language. This act, driven by his agency under Accumulative pressure, narrows his world to one leaf, one brushstroke. Cost is felt: exhaustion, isolation, the risk of futility. The escalation isn’t causal but textural—density of hope increases until sleep itself becomes proof of resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preventing cultural erasure—is signaled by the child’s dry loaf and escalates through Liora’s discovery of trapped hands beneath the city. Pressure tightens when she witnesses the baker’s clumsy *K*, then intensifies decisively at the oven where the lens’s glow reanimates ancestral technique—a turn driven wholly by protagonist agency. Cost is unmistakable: the beekeeper’s literal absorption into stone, the generational thinning of displaced arts, the risk of shattering the only artifact capable of revelation. The final image of golden loaves crackling with names pays this cost forward as active reparation.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—stepping beyond fate’s design—is signaled early and deepens when the yoyo’s latent radiance proves real. Elias’s agency drives escalation: reverse-engineering leads to final initiation, which triggers irreversible change. Cost is unmistakable: he vanishes from the world, clocks run backward, the lighthouse dies. The tightening occurs at the hunger stones—their transformation from inert warning to active portal forces the ultimate choice with no retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—confronting the fear-wearing-his-face—is signaled early and tightens when Lysander chooses deception over combat. His agency drives escalation: flipping the dream dictionary, pressing into the mirror, lunging *through* the doppelgänger. Cost is unmistakable: the filmstrip of his heartbeat, the advisor’s lingering whisper, the clasp’s new hunger. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via textual density and paradox (“let fear believe it’s already won”), culminating in conceptual repricing of fear itself.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—transforming obstacle into instrument—tightens when the sea answers with voice, escalating from interpretation to dialogue. Leeward’s agency drives every escalation: his choice to lean into sway, strike the heart-knot, and laugh rawly reweights the storm’s meaning. Cost is felt in the “jagged melody” that once split a mast and in the present vulnerability of trusting the sea’s hum. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: resonance builds until fracture becomes harmony.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—deciphering why the watchers await Elyas—tightens decisively when the crack replies, transforming passive study into active summons. Agency drives escalation: Elyas chooses to blow the whistle, then whisper the final sequence, each act narrowing options (the city behind him becomes irretrievable). Cost is unmistakable: the whistle crumbles, his shadow stretches toward irrevocable departure. Coincidence never resolves; the watchers’ turn is consequence, not convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—truth versus protective deception—is signaled early and escalates causally: discovery → threat → confrontation → exposure. Elias’s agency drives every turn; even the wind’s “ghost engineer” whistle reframes tension without resolving it. Cost is unmistakable: potential arrest, institutional retaliation, and the burden of shattering faith. The ledger’s revelation isn’t enough—he must show the *pattern*, making the final act a deepening that forecloses any return to ignorance.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving meaning in abandonment—is signaled early and deepens when Elias finds the note and replies, transforming surveying into dialogue across time. His agency lies in attention and repair, not confrontation; each choice (replying, sealing the note, trading the inkwell) narrows his path toward solitude with quiet cost. Pressure escalates texturally: from measuring erosion to participating in a century-old conversation. The carp’s shadow briefly raises emotional stakes, testing his resolve without resolving via coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming historical truth in a world of erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the stamp reveals coordinates, forcing Elias to choose between surface compliance and subterranean revelation. Agency is exercised through attention and hypothesis-testing, not action alone; cost is conceptual (bearing solitary knowledge) and temporal (limited blackout window). Escalation is driven by protagonist’s methodical inquiry under Accumulative pressure, though the “alternative hypothesis” beat slightly abstracts tactics. Coincidence never resolves; the archive was waiting, but only because Elias was perceptive enough to find it.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—retrieving her daughter’s voice from recorded dreams—is signaled early and deepens when the basilica begins to “descend while ascending.” The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to press the smoky quartz into the pillar, knowing it will consume her. Cost is unmistakable: her body rewritten by dream-stuff, her physical self sacrificed to join the recording. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens, tightening via sensory and symbolic density rather than causal reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—accessing unmade potential—is signaled early and deepens when Lena shifts from observing patterns to pulling threads. Escalation is driven by her agency: stealing footage, inputting frequencies, overriding warnings. The cost is immediate (field collapse risk) and conceptual (abandoning linear time), crystallized in the lead scientist’s cracked plea. Coincidence complicates (storm, drone hesitation) but never resolves; the climax hinges on her finger hovering over the console.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—decoding belonging through hidden patterns—is signaled early and deepens via Lena’s theft, which forces the observatory’s response. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her drone maneuver narrows options (pilgrim can’t reclaim the chip) and triggers the door’s reveal. Cost is unmistakable: both surrender solitude, trading it for fragile connection. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens—density of celestial imagery intensifies until the constellation reweights everything.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—evading the cost of erased truth—is signaled early and deepens when the note arrives, forcing Elias to confront Harkin’s fate. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he chooses to listen, to hurl the watch hand, to accept the summons. Coincidence (the note’s appearance) complicates but doesn’t resolve; it crystallizes pressure. Cost is felt in his shallow breath and trembling hands—irreversible commitment to face what he buried.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—freeing an innocent boy—is signaled early and deepens when Kaelis admits familial motive. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he offers not just trade but reinterpretation (“untether from a war he didn’t start”). Cost is felt in the boy’s raw wrists and Elias’s surrendered heirloom. The moon’s phase isn’t gimmick—it frames patience as finite resource, tightening the window for resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reconciliation vs. escape—is signaled early and tightens when Elias chooses land over sea. Agency drives escalation: counting poles backward is an active recalibration, not passive drift. Cost is felt in the unopened letters and the bar detour—a visible trade-off between courage and habit. Under Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies texturally (tide turning, wind shifting) until stance crystallizes without external intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to reclaim or reject empathy—is signaled early and deepens at the lake, where the voice reframes empathy as active giving, not passive reception. Liam’s agency drives escalation: he reads the paper, follows the light, throws the ball. The cost is unmistakable: he must face the man he wronged, risking rejection. Pressure tightens coherently under a Causal lens, with no reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—reforging a bond beyond death—tightens decisively when the first conjuration fails, forcing higher-risk spice use that collapses the stag into stardust. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her choice to “pull” at absence, not the stag, triggers the hollow’s gravity and the brother’s flickering return. Cost is unmistakable: physical burn, emotional devastation (“It’s not enough”), and the ash-fortune proving her metamorphosis was the true price. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via sensory deepening, not external antagonism.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming lost time—is signaled early and deepens when the saucer reveals time as a ledger of thefts. Liora’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to trace the crack with memory, summoning her brother, whose demand to “repent for time” forces her climactic renunciation. Cost is visceral—shattered saucer, dissolving brother—and forecloses her path of hoarded grief. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each sensory beat thickens the reservoir until release becomes inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—opening the dimension—is signaled early and tightens through Lien’s agency: each stitch risks failure (thread snaps), drains her breath, and alters tactics (learning to “push” the tear). Escalation peaks when hands reach through not to pull but assist, forcing her final push with visible cost: the Eulogy’s dissolution and her own potential unraveling. Coincidence never resolves; every advance stems from her needlework under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding transformation through giving light—is signaled early and tightens when the prophecy reframes her mission. Elira’s agency drives escalation: she chooses the cave detour, reads the mirror, releases the bug, hurls vials into lava. Cost is unmistakable: all her “wealth” destroyed, yet she gains wholeness. Coincidence complicates (tide recedes, fresh prophecy appears) but resolution stems from her decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes—breaking Veythar’s grip via silent sabotage—are signaled early and tightened by the blackout’s timing. Kael’s agency drives escalation: months of prep culminate in one irreversible act. The cost (permanent exile, risk of alarm) is felt in every silent step, and the final image reweights victory as fragile but irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—keeping the promise via patterns—is signaled early and tightens when the dust responds, raising the cost from futility to existential peril (“unmake you”). Liora’s agency drives escalation: her weaving of dust triggers the aurora’s fracture and eel return. The deepening occurs when she realizes the promise was never about eels but about anchoring reality. Cost is unmistakable: her body becomes conduit, blood and bone infused with star-dust.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether silenced words can be released without control—is signaled early and deepens when Elias chooses to let the storm “edit” rather than protect the poem. The meaningful tightening occurs at the timer’s first chime, triggering memory and raising emotional cost; the second chime catalyzes destruction. Agency drives escalation: every action (unfolding, pressing, tearing) narrows options until only release remains. The price—losing the “too precise” map of wounds—is visible in scattered confetti and empty envelope.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—ethical governance as lived practice, not abstract debate—is signaled early and tightens through each fencing move. Agency is clear: their choices (slap, lunge, pivot) narrow options until the sundial yields its secret. Cost is legible in Liora’s admission (“Twelve years ago…”) and Elias’s delayed recognition—time lost, trust withheld. Escalation is driven by protagonist decisions under coherent pressure, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—forging beauty from anarchy—is signaled early (“rebuilding its purpose one scavenged poem”) and tightens when Maren delivers *Songs of the Doomed* with the violet, forcing Elias to confront attachment versus transience. His agency drives escalation: choosing to add the flower (not just poems) deepens his investment, making his lie about staying a renunciation with cost (itch quieted but departure deferred). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each added text/violet intensifies the library’s fragility. Guards’ eventual arrival looms as unavoidable consequence, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming agency from fate—is signaled early (“surprise fate with an unplanned encore”) and escalates through Lena’s strategic creativity: mapping compass dances, splicing celluloid to reveal paths. The tightening occurs when compasses lock toward the screen, forcing her to trust the film’s illusion as reality. Cost is palpable: decades of wound-but-still clocks, the projector’s sacrificial burnout, and the steel in her voice masking vulnerability. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her labor.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving cultural memory against dream-induced unraveling—is signaled early and deepens when dreams turn “hungry.” Liora’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to bite the seed despite known cost, narrowing options to sacrifice or surrender. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each distorted dream tightens the noose until the monsoon forces reckoning. Cost is unmistakable: her name will be forgotten, but her voice endures as the island’s new mnemonic organ.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reconciling unsaid words with his lost brother—is signaled early (“last words had been an argument”) and deepens via the compass’s transformation, which narrows Elias’s options from passive mourning to active ritual. The tightening occurs when he follows the lace’s “whispered instruction,” trading inert grief for embodied action with cost: vulnerability (humming aloud), relinquishment (burying the compass). Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves. Under Accumulative lens, cadence shift from stillness to hum to cerulean swirl reweights remembrance as current, not anchor.
