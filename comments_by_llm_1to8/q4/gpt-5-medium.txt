  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from physical survival (past attempt) through discovery (ledger's meaning) to moral choice (how to expose truth). The protagonist's agency drives the resolution through the specific choice of glass-as-witness.

Cost is legible in her bleeding fingers and accepted isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation occurs through accumulative deepening rather than causal turns—each loop adds understanding ("the program was not erasing error, but letting errors amalgamate into meaning").

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from missing mantas through Jae's temporal theory to the rescue's personal cost. The lever pull creates genuine risk ("surge tides"), and the mantas' return validates his theory while imposing the cost of seeing his multiplied selves. Pressure coheres well under the accumulative lens, though the middle section could tighten slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as each decoded instruction narrows the path—from reading water-damage patterns to following reflection-maps to stepping only on glints, forcing increasingly precise obedience.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation occurs through accumulative pressure as the narrator moves from seeking abstract weight to embodied confession—first through involuntary smudging, then standing on the platform's edge, finally speaking the truth aloud while "the scale ticks its little metronome of snow."

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from being followed to receiving the threatening message to direct confrontation, with the narrator's lateral movement and decoy deployment demonstrating agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation operates through accumulative deepening: from playing alone to gathering children/elders, from single notes to shared stories, from individual objects in the bowl to collective "gentle obligations."

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: finding brooch → meeting keeper → returning to seam → mother's appearance → exchange. Each beat tightens the emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulating musical density from "midnight choir" to "polyrhythms" to the pearl birthing "a tone that shakes chalk from the cave's forgotten names."

Cost is visible: the narrator commits to keeping the tower open despite uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal curiosity about goodbye to a dimensional "spatial mutiny" requiring payment in memories and forgiveness.

    The dominant stake—preserving a town's essence through invented histories while waiting for its return—deepens through accumulation rather than reversal. Escalation occurs through the progression from measuring light to creating stories to the final acceptance of endless patience. The cost is legible in the narrator's isolation and burden, though a more decisive test of this commitment would strengthen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from passive collection to active confrontation as fragments accumulate (cleaners' whisper → poison label → mechanic's information → widow's arrival), with each discovery narrowing the narrator's options toward confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through depleting air ("gauge needles inch toward warning"), physical pressure ("stone teeth scrape my tank"), and the tightening choice between panic and stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulating discoveries that deepen the protagonist's obligation from professional documentation to personal inheritance. The hopscotch sequence literalizes increasing stakes as each square reveals emotional geography. Cost manifests in accepting a vow "calcified into the grain" that forecloses pure observation.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.4)

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation rather than reversal—each arranged signal raises the question of whether ephemeral gestures can honor permanent loss. The monarch's arrival tests the method when it "circled my signals, and appeared to bless the method," validating the approach with nature's witness. Cost accumulates through the acceptance that these structures won't last "beyond sunset" yet still matter.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes center on preserving memory through technical craft, with escalation through the rope manipulation revealing increasingly personal names including the narrator's own.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from maintaining the archive's directives to discovering personal agency, with the storm's approach creating deadline pressure for the wafer seal decision.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes build through accumulation: tile discovery → pattern recognition → wire alignment → urn opening → covenant choice. The protagonist's agency drives each step, with cost visible in committing scarce resources. Pressure coheres around maintaining knowledge "between regimes."

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation operates through textural deepening as Rell moves from surface resistance to cellular memory to final acceptance, with the sanctuary's "shifting grace" forcing stance crystallization. The cost is legible when "resentment loosens from his tongue like old thread" and he "returns the unspent years." One meaningful deepening sufficient for this length, though the transformation could use slightly more resistance to heighten the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from preventing the dream from tearing "the last cords anchoring the district" through the corridor's near-collapse ("edges begging to split") to the final acceptance of teaching rather than trapping. The cost manifests in Noor's physical struggle and the acceptance that "not all fences returned." One meaningful deepening through synchronized breathing that transforms the conflict's nature.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from professional repair to personal healing through Mira's presence and the ribbon's discovered significance. The tightening occurs when the narrator must use his daughter's ribbon for the ritual—foreclosing the option of keeping it untouched. Cost is visible in "I closed my fist over it until the quartz throbbed" and the final acceptance that either daughter or Mira will claim it.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from general curiosity about forbidden knowledge to the specific discovery of his aunt's fate, culminating in the choice to eat the fruit knowing it will rewrite him. The tension between wanting answers and fearing transformation creates authentic pressure. Cost is visible when he accepts that future curators must "inherit out of order" and be claimed by the orchard, though middle sections could sharpen the pressure between these poles.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes center on rescue missions—first the apprentice "caught between indexes," then ultimately "retrieving gentler futures from the overlooked." Pressure accumulates through the bookstore's increasing temperament and the difficulty of navigation, though the apprentice rescue resolves somewhat easily. The final stakes deepen when characters must "speak together without correcting" to open the library, requiring vulnerability. Cost appears in accepting failure "pronounced kindly," though mid-story tension could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure - from discovering the chimera twin in one's tongue, to finding the jar of soil, to the final breathing life into silence. The cost ("for each name you speak, you lose the twin") is stated clearly but could be more viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from archive gaps to doorway discovery to ledger recovery, with the rope manipulation creating causal pressure—crossed strands dim the door, uncrossed brightens it.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation works through accumulative pressure as the energy beings' arrival creates resonance storms that threaten the cave maps. The protagonist's agency drives the resolution through deliberate choices—reading ice patterns, finding the right corridor, planting the bloom. Cost is visible in the physical effort and the ongoing responsibility accepted at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: failed attempts with the broken prism, Lio's arrival with the missing piece, the revelation about the shard's purpose, successful rekindling that draws community. The dominant stake (proving coincidences have meaning) tightens when Lio's map matches the etchings "almost perfectly," forcing the choice to trust pattern over skepticism with visible cost in transformed isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes crystallize around the narrator's identity crisis: remaining mere archivist versus risking personal vulnerability. The tension deepens through "What if I was only a binder... and not a page" to the decisive action of stepping into the forecourt. Cost becomes visible when they must "risk an instance that hurts the page" and share their plum memory, though the accumulative design softens traditional escalation markers.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake of defeating communal hopelessness escalates from discovery (finding the knot) through preparation (mixing salts, mapping echoes) to execution (lighting sequence). Cost is visible in the careful "filtering" work and the gravity that must be "persuaded" rather than conquered. Strong agency throughout, though the conflict could push harder against the protagonists.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.2)
    The pause itself becomes the pressure vessel, with stakes crystallizing around love versus career/archives. The narrator's decision to go inland carries cost through what will be lost (daily tides, familiar rhythms), though the tension could tighten more dramatically.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—finding a silence the father could understand—escalates through accumulation of different silence types until the gilded hush creates genuine risk ("Too much gilded hush and I stop wanting doors at all"). The cost is legible when sharing requires "limiting exposure, careful for both our sakes," forcing measured vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether comfort can be measured versus catalyzed—escalates through accumulating silence: from wrapped musical notes to the velvet-lined pylons to the final breathing-threaded rustle. The operator's agency manifests in route adjustments and atmospheric modulations that gradually transform the mathematician's grief-equation into embodied acceptance, though the transformation could benefit from one more moment of resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes established immediately—find the stairway before sunrise or face "silence as sovereign for another century." The pressure tightens through physical descent (inverted ascension) and peaks when the narrator must choose between claiming power or keeping it unbound. The cost is clear: risking eternal algorithmic silence for a more fluid governance model.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes center on whether the narrator can teach the girl to breathe/cross without consuming herself. Pressure builds through accumulation: shadows encroaching, shapes hovering, the girl's crater-body forgetting breath. The teaching sequence ("count seconds between fear and breath") provides meaningful deepening. Cost is visible in renewed solitude and scar preparation for the next student.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: gauges flirting with red, multiplying texts from parallel selves, the chamber's dangerous test. The dominant stake—transforming past failure into value—tightens when the narrator must "let the vow cut you." Cost manifests as diamonds bloom "laced like frost" and the ledger dissolves, though the resolution arrives somewhat suddenly.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes deepen from personal shame to ancestral revelation to societal transformation. The gramophone sequence creates genuine tension through its blank disc producing sound. Cost manifests in relinquishing the seal and accepting the burden of knowledge. However, no active opposition creates some flatness—the revelation comes too smoothly without resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake of choosing one possibility while releasing others is signaled early and tightens through his progression from following stage directions to climbing the ladder to pressing the kernel to his tongue. The cost is legible in his abandonment of armor and warrior oaths. However, the middle section lacks a clear reversal or complication that would heighten pressure before the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation from reading dust patterns to discovering the button to recognizing the counselor's fingerprints, each revelation tightening the archivist's understanding. The cost manifests in choosing to engage with painful histories rather than merely archive them, though a more decisive foreclosure of options would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: from discovering the caption's lie, to finding the key, following puddle reflections, opening the maintenance box, and finally accepting her role as "the hinge." The dominant stake—restoring erased voices—tightens as she risks exposure ("police siren wheeled and stalled"). Cost is visible in her choosing anonymity over recognition, though the middle section could benefit from one more concrete obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through accumulating prophetic lines that must be interrupted ("A second line descends, colder, naming a city I love"), with clear consequences if the protagonist fails ("listeners outside will read a future that uses us up like salt"). The tension between completing the prophecy and maintaining the hush creates sustained pressure, though the physical manifestation of threat could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—decoding the arbor's message—builds through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate for the textural lens. Pressure coheres through the ritual's stages: waiting for the hush, interpreting leaves, building new monuments. The cost manifests in accepting perpetual transformation rather than achieving mastery. One point off for relatively gentle escalation that could push harder against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: compass discovery → greenhouse entry → waterfall descent → journal revelation → water-clock assembly. Each deepening reweights the protagonist's relationship to uncertainty, with visible cost in abandoning precision for flow. The waterfall's "kindness brutal enough to teach" crystallizes the stakes effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (processing guilt/grief through alchemical redemption) deepens through testing names' weight, repairing the vessel, and creating the alloy. The escalation from measurement to transformation shows agency. However, the mystical elements ("names attract their histories") arrive without sufficient grounding, slightly weakening the pressure's coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from collecting voices to the specific challenge of the woman who fears laughter will betray her again. The narrator's choice to reveal their own "crack in my sound" creates vulnerability that enables breakthrough. Cost appears in standing aside while the woman passes to "a clearing I could not enter."

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation works through accumulative pressure as the forest's equations intensify from "faint" to demanding "honesty from the body," culminating in the protagonist composing a theorem with the environment.

Would benefit from more active resistance or complication in the middle section rather than smooth revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.5)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: whispers guide to hidden clock, mainspring reveals debt ledger, unwinding releases trapped time. The protagonist's agency drives each discovery with visible cost in "admitting the debt meant naming the thief."

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from maintaining library balance to confronting personal loss when the whisper transforms the printing, forcing a choice between perfection (sinking) and wobble (survival). The cost is legible in the brief mother-moment that must end, though the middle lacks a clear tightening beat before the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from academic dispute through public challenge to council adjudication, with clear cost at each stage (access threatened, public readings as counter-move, final validation but shard breaks). The protagonist's agency drives escalation through ritual innovation and public demonstration. Cost is visible when "sorrow shone, burnished" as the shard cracks.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal (wilting near dishonesty) to communal (city's stolen light) with the shadow-trading cost making the price concrete. The rust's negotiation creates genuine pressure, forcing the narrator to offer both confession and permanent service. The tethering of light to listening rather than ownership represents a meaningful deepening that reweights the entire conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes deepen through accumulative pressure: from collecting scents to discovering the father's death site to accepting unexplainable loss. The water's polite return of the boots represents a meaningful deepening that forces acceptance. Cost is visible in the grief that "clicks but does not close again."

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.9)

Cost registers in accepting perpetual learning over arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding why flowers bloom at night—deepens through accumulated discoveries rather than reversals, appropriate for the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal cataloging to civic reckoning as the archivist moves from passive documentation to active reconstruction through beach arrangements. The retrocognitive trap forces confrontation with suppressed history, narrowing options to either retreat or full disclosure.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—rebuilding without divine intervention—escalates from solitary planning to collective action, with the sailor's arrival as meaningful deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from archival duty to preventing generational harm, with the prophecy creating a genuine double-bind: refuse and the orchard destroys itself, accept and doom a child. The cost is legible in "the future shifts enough to shelter a child's unpinned breath," though middle sections could tighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation builds through accumulative deepening: from watching to receiving the egg, from naming to understanding "the measure of keeping is not storage but song," culminating in planting the cap and feeling "the city beyond the panes tip toward spring." The cost manifests in accepting temporary ownership of seasons that must be passed on.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate through accumulating pressure: model's red lattice, valley station's demands, zero hour's approach. The bell choice carries real risk against institutional expectations. The storm's response validates the quieter approach, showing cost in choosing restraint over "blaring decisiveness."

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes deepen from physical maintenance to spiritual communion as the narrator learns to read the station's moods through meteor correlations. The power failure forces heightened vulnerability, narrowing options to pure attention with the lantern glass. The meteors' final withdrawal ("respecting the old boundary") demonstrates earned agency through accumulated understanding rather than confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes deepen from witnessing to active custodianship when the queen asks "if its archive could hold heat," forcing the recluse to accept responsibility for his past complicity. The covenant's terms shift from mere survival to becoming "a custodian and a kiln of listening," with cost in the stings that create bearable pain. Escalation works through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate to the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal timekeeping to communal reconstruction as neighbors arrive with "damaged time capsules, jars that had swallowed arguments." The narrator's agency manifests through patient waiting and the choice to walk the footprint-letter, with cost visible in the "borrowed heart" that must learn when to be "metronome" versus "river stone."

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (discovering beauty in loss/incompletion) escalates from observation to active intervention when the kite breaks. The boy's grief creates genuine pressure, and the poet's response requires careful navigation. However, the resolution feels slightly too smooth - the boy's transformation from loss to acceptance happens without sufficient resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation occurs through accumulative deepening: from solitary wire-setting to community involvement ("People came with laughter and suspicion"), to interspecies integration (otters, herons, crabs), to council formation, finally narrowing to the narrator's physical decline and conscious surrender. The cost is legible in lost stamina and the final relinquishment of the diary.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: arrival → convergence → ritual participation → transformation, with the narrator's skepticism providing resistance that makes surrender meaningful.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming battlefield from death—deepens through accumulation rather than reversal, fitting the textural lens. Pressure coheres as he moves from jetty to battlefield, each action (mixing fertilizer, reading birds, planting) tightening the treaty between "brine memory and seed breath." Cost is visible in the nightly ritual's patient labor against the reef's death.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—bridging impossible distance—escalates from passive longing through active discovery (cylinders) to achieved connection with clear cost (the temporary nature of contact). The riddle creates genuine pressure that the narrator must solve. Minor deduction because the resolution relies partially on found information rather than pure protagonist agency, though the choice to pursue it remains active.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation reads through accumulative deepening as temporal disorientation intensifies ("stars were not where they should be") forcing adaptation from traditional navigation to creating a new axis through layered time. The cost manifests in accepting permanent temporal isolation and pariah status, though the middle section could tighten pressure more directly.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from fixing the "wrong sky" to understanding each piece contains weather-controlling secrets that affect people's lives.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from individual gesture-archiving to collective participation as strangers spell "water," "stay," "hear/here," building communal memory against the backdrop of potential "new orders."

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes center on transforming singular confession into shared burden, with clear escalation from the artist's initial challenge through collective participation to final dispersal of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulating pressure: from measuring the statue to fitting the key charm as "the final pendulum," with the engine's activation as the peak that "drinks the room."

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—keeping a promise to paint the sea's interior—escalates from entering the caves to discovering the hidden oasis to making the crucial choice to add only "a breath, a hue no longer than a sigh."

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen from mechanical repair to emotional navigation, with the dominant stake (finding/following Mara) tightening when the compass "does not lead me to Mara; it leads me with her." The cost manifests in accepting permanent separation while maintaining connection. The accumulative pressure builds effectively though lacks one sharp reversal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)

Pressure coheres under the textural lens through pattern intensification rather than reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.6)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through the iterative returns ("We circle the same second twice, then thrice") with each deepening transforming "knots" into "structure instead of drag."

The cost manifests in accepting the brother's refusal rather than forcing resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: window displays → grotto gathering → deliberate stalemates → town-wide slowing, with each stage deepening the stake of resisting hasty decisions. The cost appears in specific moments like the mason leaving "his trowel midair" and the boy who "never resigned" finding new patience. While agency drives the change, the conflict remains primarily internal/conceptual rather than facing external opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear escalation from finding the scrimshaw through the whale's call to public self-declaration, with each beat raising stakes and foreclosing retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal compliance to corrupting children, with the narrator teaching both angles of joy and subversive pauses. The inspector visit raises immediate danger.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate from gathering under "careful permission" through synchronized breathing to the decisive lake crossing, with the guard's transformation marking the key reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—finding beauty in imperfection despite colorblindness—escalates through the barter system requiring real sacrifice (best brush, jarred smoke). The reed's awakening deepens rather than reverses, transforming Ivo's understanding from seeking color to hearing "rhythm" in broken light. Cost is visible in the trade and felt in his commitment to stay, though middle sections could tighten the pressure between desire and price.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes build through the pilgrimage stations with each bell revealing deeper layers of memory and connection. The volunteer's grief encounter with the ferry bell creates meaningful pressure. Deduction for the relatively gentle escalation that lacks sharper opposition or higher cost beyond emotional recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (transforming grief into teaching) establishes early and deepens through the shift from solitary arrival to communal practice. The accumulative escalation works through density increase—from one lily projection to multiple visitors' rituals, each adding weight.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from cryptocurrency crashes through neighborhood navigation to finding lost connections, each client bringing deeper emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from treating a small injury to confronting institutional betrayal, with the surgical amputation serving as both literal action and metaphorical choice about what to preserve.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes deepen from personal guilt about the displaced miracle to understanding Mira's final gesture of reassurance, with the protagonist's agency driving the descent into the tunnel.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as the crystal gazer moves from professional distance to personal recognition, with the key tightening when she finds her own name and must confront her shelved life.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from personal burden ("their silence was digging a grave inside me") through individual healing (the sculptor) to city-wide creative liberation. The seven circuits create accumulative pressure, with the meteor "combing the aurora" triggering the breakthrough. Cost appears in the narrator's ongoing burden ("the arch still hums") and the sculptor's emotional release, though the ease of subsequent healings slightly reduces tension.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: archive refuses→responds to humming→offers game→releases spores. The guard's agency drives each development through specific actions (humming the charm, flipping the clock). Cost is legible in the exchange of dreams for purpose, though peak pressure could intensify.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding why the protagonist translocates—tightens when the gear placement reveals each displacement as purposeful education rather than random affliction. The "ache in the hum" creates genuine pressure that forces action.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (finding unused courage) escalates from ache to active quest through ridge traversal. The protagonist's agency drives the journey—choosing bends "that resemble my old fear" and walking them anyway.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes build through accumulation: from personal injury to understanding systemic oppression to finding subtle resistance. The seventh week marks a clear escalation when "the choir had returned." Cost is visible in the enforced silence and the price of "stubborn listening" as resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation as each book Serane reads tightens the genealogical knot around her false identity. The dominant stake—exposing the pretender—manifests through concrete pressure as "the indexes braided her lineage into knots that refused any tug, except confession."

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake (discovering why paths vanish) escalates through accumulating evidence until the tapping pattern reveals the corridor's schedule, forcing a community response. The deepening from personal investigation to collective action shows clear cost: accepting impermanence and adapting to nature's rhythm rather than forcing fixed paths.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal search to collective risk when Mara decides to broadcast the coordinates. The "lull in rebellion" creates ambient pressure throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal insurgency to community transformation through clear pressure points: council refusal, solo vault breach, irreversible unsealing.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal curiosity about a quarantined letter to risking professional future by releasing city-changing information. The midnight timing creates genuine pressure with the power grid's "failed revolution" providing the decisive moment.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.2)

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.3)

Cost is visible in the ongoing labor: "I will stand...translating weather into shelter."

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (reconnecting the lovers through art) builds steadily as visitors add leaves, culminating when "they stepped onto parallel threads that converged at the waiting bowl." The installation creates genuine pressure, though the resolution arrives somewhat smoothly without a moment of real resistance or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.6)

Cost manifests in "He takes it without gauze, careful"—accepting both the danger and responsibility of memory.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (discovering where shadows go at noon) deepens through concrete investigation steps - from receiving the key to arranging mirrors to achieving the revelation. Cost is visible when "the line slipped under my skin like a lucid ribbon" - a physical price for knowledge. The escalation through accumulation works well under the textural lens, though the middle section could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure rather than reversals—from examining evidence to discovering Ari to the physical act of healing that becomes metaphorical reconciliation.

Cost is visible in Ari's physical and emotional erosion, though the resolution feels slightly too neat given the gravity of the deception.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake of bringing safe light to a fire-wary village builds through accumulation of polished glass pieces. The tension between quick fire and patient light deepens through brother's absence and village wariness. Cost is visible in "hearts a little tired of gray days" transforming to unclenched hands.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from external burdens (widow memory, soldier name) to the narrator's own fear that "love would demand my departure," with each weighing teaching new grammar of heaviness. The final self-confrontation where the narrator becomes "boundary-lessly trapped" before finding balance shows clear cost, though middle burdens could pressure tactics more directly.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation reads through accumulative deepening—from touching blank wood to revealing "collar and crescent of shoulder" to the climactic decision about the name-tag notch.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake of resurrecting functionality escalates from solo technical fixes to community shelter needs, with meaningful deepening when the janitor's practical requirements ("shelter the buses when the river floods") reorient the protagonist's abstract equations. Cost visible in physical labor and acceptance of "proportional headaches." One clear tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure accumulates through textural deepening from physical sanctuary to internal acceptance, with the finch's arrival triggering recognition of the dream as "kin."

Cost appears in the narrator's endless repetition and the visitors' surrender of familiar fire-based perception.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation operates through accumulative deepening—from testing the seafarer's name to the father's repeated visits, building toward the final kite curve. The dominant stake (discovering grief's shape without breaking it) tightens through specific constraints: butterflies marking syllables, mother's spectral guidance steering from ornament, the storm testing but not breaking the greenhouse. Cost is legible in the father's progression from steadying on lettuce beds to sharing his daughter's notebook.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.3)

    Stakes accumulate through "cousins divided by streets, languages, and injuries too old for their years" toward the performance where "suspicion tapping in twos, hope tapping in threes, and then the taps coincided." The tension between Rafi and Ola provides one clear tightening, though additional pressure points would strengthen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation follows accumulative pattern: individual memory-tastes intensify through pruning scenes, building to the communal risk of sharing forbidden "memory foods."

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from individual passage through the riddle test to citywide restoration of the drone network. The narrator's agency drives the resolution by choosing Mara as "the right listener" and revealing the hidden lacquer box, with clear cost in returning to isolation after connection.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation reads as density increase through accumulating evidence that progressively narrows the truth. The dominant stake (uncovering authentic origins versus official narratives) tightens as each document reveals deeper deception, though the personal cost to Ossa could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—healing from shadow loss—escalates through accumulative craft rituals that deepen rather than reverse.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on preventing violence through successful exchange, with escalation when "tempers climbed the steps" over the naming dispute. The narrator's intervention with the drawer pull meaningfully tightens pressure and forces resolution. Cost is visible (grain given despite scarcity, boy's survival urgency). Deduction for relatively gentle escalation that could push harder given the life-death stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation works through accumulative deepening: from solitary launch through the boy's request to the successful rescue, each beat reweights the navigator's relationship to his broken identity.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.6)
    The gravitational lock creates escalating pressure through precise calibration requirements—"If I floated too far, the hatch shut; if I sank, the hinges screamed and sealed." Stakes deepen as shadow work reveals the necessity of holding both joy and grief simultaneously. The final opening carries cost in the protagonist's promise to guard what's unsealed, though the middle section could tighten its pressure points.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—village safety from the volcano—is signaled early and escalates through the mountain's breathing patterns and eventual sideways exhale. Mara's agency drives the resolution through deliberate bottle placement and crowd orchestration, with visible cost in her depleted collection.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—transforming the fort from oppressive surveillance to communal hearth—is signaled early and deepens through the blackout opportunity. Captain Rhun's appearance creates genuine tension, but his too-easy capitulation ("one degree, as if the sundial itself had tipped him") deflates the confrontation's potential cost.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal debt to the herder's sacrifice, with the mathematical sequences creating mounting pressure toward the portal opening.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal summons to understanding systemic censorship to accepting inherited responsibility. The timer creates measured pressure between revelations. Minor deduction for the teacher revelation feeling slightly unearned, though the poet's final acceptance of their role carries genuine cost.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from waiting for a courier to decoding the sundial to the philosophical duel with Rook, each tightening options. The cost is legible when Rook must "admit fear into the treaty" and all three must commit signatures to proceed.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: from sorting memories to stringing poem-lines to rebuilding the door "from a refrigerator panel and a belt."

However, the surreal middle reduces some causal pressure, making the escalation more textural than strictly driven.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: from cataloging myths to protecting the seed to finding the right soil through dreams. The monsoon's patient waiting creates genuine pressure—"The island would let us finish if we kept our accounting faithful."

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes deepen through accumulative pressure as "rhythmically placid" builds from compass description to sea's hunger to final acceptance. The dominant stake—finding color/form for unspoken apologies—tightens when the lace reveals "muted cerulean that matched the regret I wore like weather." Cost is visible in releasing words "trimmed of their thorns" to the accepting sea.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.3)
    Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a masterful deepening of the dominant stake: how to process overwhelming loss. The pressure coheres and intensifies through Mara's observational beats, each one narrowing her options toward a philosophy of patient attention. The climax is her decision to "train the algorithm to notice gentleness first," a choice that forecloses dramatic solutions and carries the palpable cost of a long, meticulous labor. This agency-driven reweighting of the stake is unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive intensification through pattern recognition. The stake (discovering purpose/truth) is signaled early and deepens through the frost's revelation and the identification of the rival.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure escalates through a decisive cadence shift and density increase, reweighting the dominant stake of understanding time. The protagonist's agency is demonstrated through the choice to put the shard to his tongue and follow the descending bridge, a renunciation that forecloses other paths with a visible cost—accepting the ephemeral nature of the present.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is expertly managed under the causal lens: the external pressure of the wall's fall and enforcers' entry directly triggers Mara's key tactical choices (jamming the conveyor, decoding the pattern).

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, moving from external observation to internal, personal application. The dominant stake (finding the sound of trust breaking) tightens meaningfully, culminating in a choice that forecloses a path with a visible, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (finding truth about brother) escalates through decryption breakthrough to roof confrontation. Protagonist agency drives all key turns. Cost is legible in the emotional breaking and reknitting of breath. One meaningful tightening occurs when the decrypted message forces direct action. The final confrontation crystallizes stance with visible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation is driven by the accumulating pressure of silence under the textural lens, forcing the courier's stance crystallization from skeptic to believer. The dominant stake of faith/meaning is signaled early and tightens meaningfully through the wind's faltering and the shared listening.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative lens, following the coded instructions. The dominant stake (unraveling the code) tightens through a meaningful cadence shift into the silent conduction, with cost felt in the final, enduring wait. A minor deduction as the initial inspiration feels slightly external, but the core escalation is coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation is driven by the accumulating pressure of the eclipse and the therapist's adaptive choices, culminating in the high-stakes, agency-driven act of placing the locket on the guitar. The cost of this shared vulnerability is felt. A minor deduction: the stakes of "nurturing lifelong wonder" are somewhat abstract; the more powerful, immediate stake of easing Ada's grief is the true driver, and its escalation could be slightly more pronounced in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: probing diaries leads to finding the disk, which deepens knowledge and forces a stance crystallization (rearranging the library).

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative lens—each proof and dice roll deepens the textual density and reweights the stake of capturing memory.

    Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, escalation is a decisive deepening of knowledge through the discovered artifacts (ledger, photograph, compass), which reweights the dominant stake of historical truth. The protagonist's agency is in the act of "drawing parallels," a methodical choice that narrows options by foreclosing easy righteousness and forcing a complex admission. The cost is the weight of responsibility felt in the final paragraphs, a price paid for reconciling facts with memory. A minor deduction as the initial pressure is more atmospheric than actively complicating, though it tightens superbly in the second half.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, through a deepening of knowledge that reweights the dominant stake with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, through the active "hunt" for patterns and the deliberate perturbation of the current.

A single meaningful deepening—the discovery of the basin—reweights the dominant stake of finding unused potential.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive cadence shift: the realization that "the blanks are not errors, but rests" deepens the central stake and fundamentally changes the protagonists' tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a perfect density increase. The stake—preserving a space for beauty—tightens through the layered acts of wiring light, stringing poems, and handing out pages, culminating in the map's revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure deepens as observation becomes method, then community action, then a formalized plan; the notable tightening is the ethical choice to train code toward “gentleness.” Stakes stay modest and local, but the refusal of spectacle is a real trade‑off. The ongoing constraint (continuing damage, slow astrophysical change) keeps cost live at the end. No sharp reversal, but a clear deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (justice and truth without self-erasure) tightens through the frost-reading revelation and the triage of options. The choice to anneal the ledger forecloses both easy routes and carries reputational and physical risk. Escalation is quiet but tangible: evidence identification → rival implication → procedural dilemma → charged plan. A live confrontation is deferred, but the cost and stance crystallization are clear.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are coherent (can meaning be made after the hush?) and pressure coheres when the doors seal and the performance begins. The key tightening is the memory of the failed first attempt and the on‑page correction via weighted forks and controlled flows; consequences register in the old woman’s warmed palms and the refusal of “cheap drama.” Escalation is textural rather than adversarial but still deepens cost. A single additional on‑page risk or near-misread in the current session could have heightened the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (secure rest/address) is signaled early; escalation arrives via manual warning, the mantled pressure at the dome, and the urgent assembly of a counter-signal. The protagonist’s agency drives the tightening (aligning shards, inventing SOR, assigning coordinates). The visible cost is principally conceptual/endurance rather than a tangible loss, which slightly softens edge. Still, pressure coheres and deepens to the beacon’s shift.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—safeguard donors’ anonymity while feeding the community with dignity—is clear and tested in the patrol confrontation. The tightening is meaningful: Mara’s stance forecloses betrayal and risks reprisal. Tactics adapt (constellation pairs, timing by infants’ clocks), evidencing cost and commitment. The final cadence reflects an earned endurance rather than an easy solve.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are internal but legible: can she release unused love and undo a prior hoarding stance. Escalation arrives via the Kwan Yin tear, the breath-method gaining control, and the past-life figure turning toward the street. The man’s brief presence intensifies the communal resonance without solving the problem. Cost is felt as she relinquishes stored sweetness and accepts new permeability (decanting; room for the emptied jars).

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether the narrator can read/accept time’s texture—tightens as visions deepen into the submerged vault. The woman’s naming of the cost forces a stance; the narrator’s acceptance forecloses the fantasy of reclaiming the past (“I cannot snatch the past without tearing it”). Escalation is clear under the accumulative lens; the price is conceptual but felt. Slightly low external jeopardy keeps it just shy of the top band, but internal pressure is coherent and rising.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (secure and seed a future) is signaled early and tightens when enforcers arrive. Escalation is protagonist‑driven: she jams gears, solves the key pattern, chooses to carry weight visibly (chain as sling). Costs are present (risk, encumbrance, time pressure), though no single irrevocable loss occurs on the page. The cadence shift at the end reweights options toward public planting under ongoing peril.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres through a deepening rather than reversals: from general research to a field test (diver) to the self-risking act of imprinting the narrator’s own pre-fracture. The “compass to bowl to plate” sequence is a meaningful tightening that narrows options toward acceptance over pursuit of rupture. The price—reframing the goal and facing personal history—lands. Stakes are internal but not static; cadence shift at the forge clarifies them.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—can the narrator meet the summons and ethically resolve the “theft” of light—tightens through the coded bouquet and the locked door to the mentor’s plea. The decisive deepening occurs when the mentor asks “Teach me,” forcing the narrator to act and pay by reframing the craft. Pressure is coherent though low‑danger; escalation is thematic and procedural rather than perilous. The earned resolution grows from agency, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are quiet but coherent: can he establish a tender, safe practice in a harmful legacy space. Escalation is a measured intensification—kiln to orange, assembling vessels, then committing to host others. The narrowing is ethical and procedural rather than peril‑driven; a viable alternative (abandoning the project) is foreclosed. The price is endurance and ownership of risk, if not a dramatic external loss.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (identity/reckoning) is signaled early and escalates via deciphering, lock combination, and the rooftop confrontation. The meaningful tightening is the box’s reveal and the message forcing a meeting, narrowing options toward engagement rather than flight. The cost—public truth and confronting debts—reads on the page as their plan. The shell’s guidance slightly eases difficulty, trimming some friction.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve and transmit the night’s “map” versus destruction—tightens when the courier reveals his order to burn records. The pressure escalates through a density shift in listening and the decision: he keeps the booklet and she commits to stay and to stone‑carving as redundancy against failure. Costs are legible (blood, flaking gold, separation, time pressure of the single star). The escalation is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure escalates via pattern density rather than adversarial turns: broom to bow, accumulating notes, program reinterpreted, and the late generator failure compressing into hush. The dominant stake—how to act under the second‑chance loops—tightens into an acceptance with a cost (no revelation, continuous labor). While internal stakes remain quiet, the cadence shift is decisive enough for this length. A slightly clearer on‑page price paid (beyond renunciation) would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (restoring trust) is signaled early, and pressure tightens as the narrator shifts from private holding to public risk. The decisive escalation is the choice to project evidence in front of all, foreclosing secrecy and risking censure. The city’s response (bolts and reel produced, communal nod) reads as earned via the protagonist’s action, not luck. Cost is social and reputational, felt in the moment before projection.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (recognition by the garden) is pressured when the maze rejects his “mended deception,” spinning dials and forcing confession. The tightening forecloses a path: performance‑ritual alone won’t suffice; honesty with cost (penance, trimming) is required. Cost is concrete (surrendering a crafted myth; accepting wither in trimming), though the tension is quiet rather than visceral. Resolution stems from his altered stance, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (return the mantas; secondarily, prove sideways time) tightens when Jae risks the surge to wake the coils and again when he inverts the fields. The reversal/deepening is clear: apparent solution (mapping) forces a bolder choice (refracting homeward), then a subtler, costed push (markers and offsets). Price is present but understated; peril and repair are gestured at more than dramatized. Still, agency governs every turn and coincidence does not resolve anything.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—break the drowning loop without becoming its next victim—is active early and narrows into the “rests” crossing and baton choice. Pressure coheres: reading stains → under‑stage pocket → portrait map → score of silence with explicit consequences. The reversal is credible: silence becomes choreography rather than absence, with obedience carrying risk and reward. A minor limit: internal moral calculus could sharpen once more, but the physical cost stands.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is unambiguous and tightens through purposeful tests (smudge fulcrum, balance stance, scale confession). Pressure escalates coherently toward the demand to speak, with weather and oracle amplifying cost without resolving it by coincidence. The protagonist’s agency drives the turn (choosing to confess via the margins). The visible price—risking collapse of her protective lie and accepting the sway of certainties—charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is clear early: test the truth’s weight; the tightening occurs as the wheel turns and pressure climbs. Internal and external conflicts interlock—skepticism versus longing, pressure in pipe versus pressure to know. The decisive reopening forecloses a tempting path of haunting blame; cost is the acceptance of mundane culpability. Tension hums at sentence and beat levels without contrived reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—enduring as a nonjudgmental witness amid decay—tightens during the flood, forcing the burrow and sanctuary retreat. The meaningful deepening is the on‑page recognition that “regenerative silence” is glue, not magic. Costs are felt in renunciation and ongoing fragility (crumbling peace, loosened judgments) rather than dramatic loss. Escalation is modest but coherent for an accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres through a single tightening arc: as light narrows, the narrator risks a deeper intervention (asking for the locket; linking memory to sound) and Ada risks opening the locket and voice. Costs—exposure, re‑animation of grief—are legible, though the piece stays decorous rather than harrowing. The agency at the peak is clear and internal/external conflicts interweave. Quiet but earned escalation suits the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure deepens coherently under the accumulative lens: reading singed diaries, touching the tapestry, then finding the disk tightens stakes from curiosity to volunteered stewardship. The meaningful turn is his decision to align the library to the new axis and return the map to darkness—a foreclosing of passive observation. The cost is enduring porousness and responsibility in a world without dreams. Tension is quiet but persistent, avoiding static lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—publicly surfacing what the town already knows—tightens from private handling of the envelope to a public broadcast. The key escalation is the choice to enlist the lighthouse and stamp microdots, foreclosing the safer path of secrecy. Price is social and strategic (agent deceived, town reoriented), if quiet. Tension rides sentence-level pressure and a decisive middle turn rather than multiple reversals, fitting the form.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clear early: arrive before completion or the neighborhood “tilts forever.” Escalation coheres via turns in method (anaphora → chiasmus → antithesis), the husband’s touch, and the whisper’s curiosity toward the palette—each tightening options. The price is renouncing a coping bargain and its ease. While not a visceral ordeal, pressure accumulates credibly under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are coherent: invent an orchestra without breaking silence, under a dawn-and-exhaustion clock. Escalation reads as a measured deepening—wind’s prelude, ice’s basso, the refusal to write words, then an earned conducting-through-listening—rather than reversals, appropriate to the lens. The renunciation of words and deference to silence foreclose easy display and carry cost. One solid tightening (dawn “takes the podium”) anchors the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (surrender vs. continued defiance) tightens through the prescribed path to the middle arch. The key turn is the tablet’s message and the choice to lower, foreclosing the escape of hovering. The price—renouncing flight and erasing the seed—lands clearly. Pressure is internal but coherent and rising under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—overcoming numbness—tightens via the backward‑song experiment and culminates in the decisive act of threading the filament and reorienting the drum “forward.” Pressure escalates texturally (from seams of music to harbor of not‑sound to bright filament), and Mara’s agency drives the turn. The price is mainly internal (owning her prior stop, accepting a counterintuitive method) and could read slightly soft to readers craving a sharper foreclosed option. Still, the reconfiguring act clearly narrows her path toward a new teaching ethic.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—protecting truthful maps/integrity against coercive quarantine—tightens with the pigeon note, the official’s arrival, and the demand to surrender charts. The protagonist’s lateral tactic forecloses the frontal option; decoys vs. coded dispatch marks a concrete trade‑off. The price is quiet but present (risk, isolation, defiance). Escalation is clear though intentionally subtle, fitting the situational/lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether to risk destabilizing grief to seek understanding—tightens around the choice to open the vial and to attend the flower’s opening. The UV etching deepens pressure by personalizing the risk (“amberhorn” linked to mother). The felt price (tears, exposure to the “absent smell I cannot bear”) is on the page and alters stance. The escalation is primarily internal but coherent and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes cohere around an ethical approach to knowing time; pressure tightens via the being’s ripple, the two-handle dilemma, and the mirror that reframes choice as forgiveness. The protagonist’s agency escalates from attention to vow to integrating the rope (past) into present tactics. Cost is internal but legible: relinquishing self-flattering knots and accepting accountability. Tension remains steady-quiet rather than jagged, but the deepening is decisive for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are quiet but coherent: can music reorient a damaged place/community toward “unfinished” beginnings. Escalation is a density‑increase rather than a reversal; the key tightening is the communal decision to carry obligations forward, with the gift exchange sealing a costed stance. The conflict is more stance‑than‑opposition, but the hush braiding around notes offers pressure. One could wish for a sharper on‑page test, yet the chosen mode sustains tension.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—help Rhea fuse empathy with insight—tightens through the ritual, her confession, and the handoff. Escalation is a density/cadence deepening rather than reversal, appropriate to the lens. The price is choosing “affectionate detachment” over burn/oblivion and the dealer’s refusal to author her outcome. Stakes remain intimate yet consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes centralize on whether recognition can be pursued without spectacle, with the envelope complication leading to a Ledger that tests Mara’s resolve in public. The deepening arrives via naming Hideo Arai and inviting the granddaughter to speak, then the public signing—each step increases exposure and potential social cost. The explicit prices are modest but present (forgiven fees, public stance, transfer of the key). Escalation is accumulative and coherent, not reversal‑driven.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (rejoining communal center) is present early, with tightening when the “tag” is redefined as posture and bodies test it to form a living arbor. Pressure rises texturally via rumor, participation, seam discovery, and the embodied lean; cost lands in the vow to tend and the ache that remains. No antagonist, but coherent situational pressure and one decisive deepening suffice at this length. Stakes remain intimate but consequential for the community.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake tightens from observation to ethically charged intervention under a live clock. Escalation occurs at the sluice’s “silence that clocks fear,” the widened oval, and the debt bells after uncaging—each narrows options. The price (time debt, surrender of control) is visible and affects the final stance. Stakes stay scaled to length without diffuse subplots.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure tightens through pattern‑matching to action: turning the eyes to the ceiling → arranging fruit → knotting the rope → leaving the eyes as pendulums. The decisive deepening is the theorem’s emergence and his tethering choice, which forecloses the fantasy of reunion for a lived practice. Cost is felt in leaving the eyes “to keep watch.” Tension remains internal yet active and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—help the girl without being seen—tightens via the outage’s enabling hush, the tape’s pull, and the cache revelation under the atlas. The key turn is choosing to act indirectly and then to remain unseen after success, with a felt price. Pressure is subtle but coherent; the piece errs on quiet tension rather than sharp per‑beat jeopardy. Still, the escalation reads as a meaningful deepening under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—how to tend under pressure—tightens via storms, customers’ needs, and the public talk, culminating in a renunciation that alters tactics. The decisive deepening is the shift from reconstructing rows to observing drift, with visible costs (loss of control, uneven customer reception). The “old impulse to fix” is confronted, heard out, and declined, a credible endurance choice. Tension operates quietly but persistently, consistent with the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—honoring memory/meaning with the island—tightens through the exchange demand, forcing a trade (keep warmth, give up the gnat). The key turn is protagonist‑driven (she pries the resin), with a legible cost. Tension is quiet but cumulative; no antagonist needed. Slightly low friction earlier keeps it just shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—who should carry/share the pearl to serve the village—tightens as the cave’s “steadily unpredictable” music selects the pilgrim. The reversal when the pearl refuses the narrator and rolls to the baker narrows options; the baker’s offering upward is a value‑driven choice that reweights duty. Cost is legible in the guide’s surrendered authority and in the choice to share rather than seize. Tension builds via cadence shifts (polyrhythms to “cradle beat”) rather than overt antagonism, but the pressure coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes center on teaching the harbor to remember; pressure deepens via the decision to count silence (“tone: none”) and publicly enact cadence that alters bystanders’ behavior. Escalation is gentle but clear: from receiving the valve to testing intervals, to community acknowledgment, to gifting the tool. The price is a refusal of spectacle in favor of disciplined practice; still, the conflict remains low-voltage, more poise than peril.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reach the fortress and prove readiness to listen—tightens through the dare and the mouth’s demand for proof. The key trade‑off is concrete: surrendering map‑rigidity (and the punch as authority) versus keeping safe patterns. The refusal-return (offering rejected, asked to unbutton) functions as the decisive tightening. Pressure remains internal but coherent and escalates to a meaningful renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—can disciplined listening create a space to hold grief—tightens through Lio’s arrival, the alignment ritual, and the whales’ synchronized breach. The turn is subtle but real: the narrator commits to the method, pays with vulnerability, and the “room” appears. Pressure remains coherent under the accumulative lens, with a felt cost in relinquishing pure skepticism. Stakes stay intimate yet legible; no contrived antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (discover what happens after goodbye) tightens through the corridor of unsaid farewells and the demand for payment. The protagonist’s agency drives the turn (summoning, tuning, bargaining), and a visible price is paid. Escalation is more deepening than reversal but coheres under the chosen lens. The cost reads more conceptual than felt-in-body, slightly softening the peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is clear early (move Arman to asylum) and tightens at the director’s entrance and the timed alarm reset. The breach forecloses alternatives and tests the narrator’s ethic (won’t lie if stopped), adding moral pressure. The visible price is understated but present: legal risk through signed witnessing and possession of incriminating numbers. Escalation is clean and coherent under the causal lens, if quiet rather than explosive.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes concentrate around sustaining communal memory during silence; pressure deepens via material constraints (fog, freezing, fading hum). The basin’s freeze and spring’s weakening hum function as a tightening that tests his method and resolve. The conflict remains quiet and internal, trading sharp reversals for a measured ratcheting.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (reclaiming/forcing truth against bureaucratic death) tightens through concrete steps and culminates in a moral trade-off: confrontation without naming or violence. The pressure coheres; luck complicates (overheard whispers) but does not resolve. The cost is the renunciation of overt reclamation for a subtler, riskier exposure. If anything, a sharper on-page threat from the widow or guards could intensify the squeeze further.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is signaled (“decode a universal riddle before the tide drags the answer away”), and pressure tightens through specific turns (the compass responding only to failure; the wind becoming human; the choice to seek melody over answers). The resolution is a clear renunciation with consequence; costs are more conceptual than visceral, keeping it below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (keep culture without surrendering revenue) is signaled early and tightens via the VIP fences and liaison’s demand. Escalation is protagonist‑driven: the trade and console realignment foreclose riot and force exposure of a sacred tool. The cost—time‑boxed reprieve and partial opening of local codes—is clear. Tension operates across beats without coincidence solving the core problem.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—capture proof before dawn—tightens via the blue/ochre/white sequence and the moth’s stirring. Agency is quiet but active: hand‑built analog timing, patience, and the shutter at the charged instant. The price is a refusal to intervene and the acceptance of loss (“lantern that refuses to admit it is dying”). The escalation is coherent and culminates cleanly in a single charged act.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (guide the coupling before the ship departs) is clear and tested by a meaningful tightening when fog thickens and the ritual “goes silent.” The protagonist adapts at cost—time compression, recalibration, live code patch—rather than luck resolving the crisis. Tension builds sentence to sentence around tones, taps, and alignment, culminating in a concrete, earned result. Stakes are local but keenly felt; no false grandiosity.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (finding/constituting the headwater “as one”) tightens through concrete steps culminating in the turning of the valve and the felt handshake of convergence. The price is quiet—risk of cold, fear of domestication by mapmaking—but it informs the closing restraint. Escalation is a clear deepening rather than reversal, fitting the chosen lens. One tangible decisive act anchors the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes—reviving communal balance—are present from the outset and tighten as neighbors join and the cracked bell is tested. Agency drives the deepening: he asks for specific “payment,” maps the town, then leads to the bell, making the crowd’s steps the repair’s metronome. Costs (time, endurance, communal vulnerability) are legible, though opposition is mostly inertia and grief rather than an active counterforce. The cadence shift at the bell’s first sound is earned and reweights the town’s options.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is legible early and escalates through concrete turns: corridor squeeze and silt panic, the unsnarling relief, the timed exhalation, then the surge that tests commitment. The choice to become still twice undercuts panic and forecloses flailing, a meaningful renunciation with cost. The “answer far above my head” is earned by prior steps, not luck. Time/air pressure and the drag line supply ongoing prices that alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—seize narrative control before discovery—is stated and tightened by the approaching boat and the hint of “answers” practicing stiffness beneath the drain. The protagonist escalates via agency: testing the speaking tube, ascending to force the wind through the lattice, then capping the drain and choosing how to answer. The trade‑off between silence and full confession narrows to a measured, costly tactic. Pressure remains coherent under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—awakening without selfishness—tightens via the promise, bead’s activation, and the trader test. The choice to “ghost” the knock is a meaningful foreclosing with implied cost (lost wealth/power) that preserves the lesson. Pressure deepens through pattern density (cameo teachings → cadence mastery) culminating in the ghost’s departure. Stakes remain coherent and internal/external threads reinforce each other.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (reopen a living waterway with ceremony) is clear and tightens through ritual commitments: mapping ghost routes, inserting plate, sewing names, renaming the altar. The cost is emotionally legible (forfeiting the plate; taking responsibility by inscribing names). However, resistance is gentle; no turn seriously threatens failure, so tension leans on reverent cadence rather than jeopardy. Still, agency drives each step to outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are primarily internal—restoring faith—but coherently pressured by the excavation, elders’ watch, and the broken prayer‑clock. The meaningful tightening is the decision to rebuild and align the sundial to the guide’s route, which narrows options toward staying and a gentler excavation ethic. Cost is quiet but clear (slowing the dig, abandoning a clean “plan,” choosing caretaking over departure). Escalation suits the accumulative lens, though external jeopardy remains low.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—finding and addressing the right name, at the right time—is consistent and tightens through decoding to the “Auricle” selection. The late self-mark reveal deepens pressure, reframing risk and responsibility. The price is more conceptual than visceral, but the renunciatory choice to wait reads as a real foreclosing of immediate action. Escalation is subtle yet coherent under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—extracting and carrying dangerous truth—tightens as the stitchwork opens a throat, the whisper indicts falsified charts, and the room’s mechanics “choose sides.” The clear escalation beat is the whisper hardening into speech and issuing blame. The price is conceptual but legible: future scapegoating, stained cloth, and complicity by knowing. Slight abstraction of threat keeps it shy of maximal intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is crisp: retrieve the “moment before deciding” to bring back to Mara. Escalation tightens via the condensation’s admonition (“let your wanting be small…”) and the choice to practice stillness, trading the old tactic of leaving. The price—abandoning the self-protective compass and accepting an open, vulnerable hinge—reads. Pressure is internal but coherent under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can the translator soften a live divide during the surgical wait—tightens as the family returns and the interpreter chooses tactic: start with the boy’s cartoon, not history. The visible price is vulnerability and the gamble of reframing their fears as “shared,” with failure implying renewed estrangement beside a child’s uncertain outcome. Escalation is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens, with a meaningful turn when the mother mouths the Reka word. The surgeon’s news adds relief but doesn’t undercut the earlier earned bridge.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (recover joy/memory) is stressed by the damaged film, prompting an adaptive escalation via the network. The meaningful tightening is the decision to publicize failure to invite correction—foreclosing the private, solitary route. The reverse‑frame suggestion provides a gentle final turn that reweights the parade’s meaning. Pressure remains lyrical rather than acute, but it coheres and deepens.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—how to restore in lightness vs. certainty—is established early and tightens when the wall asks “what I would rather not know.” The ethical pressure escalates through successive awakenings (mason’s daughter, dancing pair), culminating in the renunciation of perfect fidelity. Costs are mostly conceptual (curator’s ask vs. her choice) but they alter outcomes on the wall. One decisive deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: communicate and resist without incurring thought tax; escalation arrives with collectors, hornworms, and permit jeopardy. The pivot is protagonist‑driven: invoking the public performance clause via a citywide garden‑choir. Cost is felt in the risk of enforcement and the forced public exposure of their defiance, even if no immediate punishment lands. Tightening forecloses secrecy in favor of performative protection, a credible trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—transform pain into beauty without betraying memory—tightens via repeated attempts until the emissary’s arrival demands a vow. The hesitation before signing and the condition “stop confusing sharpness with safety” create a visible trade‑off. Pressure grows coherently under the accumulative lens; the cost lingers in the ongoing tending. A quiet arc, but the fifth‑cycle opening provides the needed cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is legible early (“unless I hurry”), and pressure coheres: wind’s warning → guided repair under vow → balcony test. The decisive tightening comes with the hairline crack answering the sung catalog, raising the cost of inattention. The price is mostly internal (risk of losing a name; self‑reproach measured against the vow), not a stark trade‑off, but it’s felt and carries through the close.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear and present: regain trust with Lio. Escalation deepens once through the live test of the movements and the shift to joint revision, with a visible price (naming fears, revising promises). Tension is more lyrical than combative, so the tightening is gentler than maximal; Lio’s resistance dissolves quickly. Still, agency drives the turn and the resolution is earned under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is crisp (harmonize water vs. rock); escalation arrives via discovery of sabotage and the concealed sluice. The decisive tuning and ethical refusal tighten options and reweight outcomes. The cost remains mostly conceptual/social, with smooth acceptance by both factions, slightly muting peak tension. Still, agency drives the turn and resolves without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—risking trust to preserve and deliver song—tightens credibly with the clearance notice and the skylight gust. The choice to send one‑note slips, balance the flock with the meteorite, and physically climb to latch the window forecloses safety. Internal and external pressures interweave without melodrama; the price is the exposure of authorship to possible theft. The escalation is modest but unmistakable under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure coheres through a deepening: deciphering the bench and codes tightens toward the seam and the orchard-center revelation. The decisive narrowing is the choice to maintain distance, sacrificing a reunion impulse for a principled stance. Stakes remain intimate but clear; the ache is palpable. Slightly low external opposition, but under the accumulative lens, escalation is sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—earn passage/acceptance by sunrise—tightens through one meaningful deepening: synchronizing breath to captivate the sentinel. Agency drives turns (ritual, wiring, truthful stance) and coincidence does not resolve anything. Escalation remains quiet but coherent; cost is a renunciation of control and self‑presentation rather than a material loss. A single sharpened jeopardy beat could have heightened pressure, but the cadence shift suffices for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear and tightens when the path is revealed to have self‑edited; the “courtesy” reframing narrows options to rerouting. Agency drives the turn (summoning the bird, pressing glass to pool, reseeding a safer path). The price is measured—social/ethical recalibration rather than pain or loss—but it reweights the village’s habits. Tension remains low‑flame yet consistent with the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure deepens coherently: the orchestrated set-up meets the janitor’s grief, requiring the performer to risk intimacy and relinquish showmanship. The bishop’s placement and balance create a focused tightening; the return constitutes a small but felt price and resolution. Tension is quiet, sentence‑level and scene‑level, rather than combative. The escalation is elegant but mild, which trims the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres around making an unseizable memory under a ban, and deepens via the method (gaps → constellation → oath). The decisive tightening is the shift from fugitive to vocation (“exile tilt into vocation”), accepting continued exposure as the price. Stakes remain intimate but clear; there’s no reversal beyond cadence intensification, which fits the chosen lens. A slightly sharper on‑page threat could have heightened felt jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to design without betraying place—tightens through the cranes, deadlines, and the boy’s familial tie to the project. The meaningful deepening arrives at the pond when “we will build if we also rescue what we nearly lost” converts meditation into actionable trade-offs. The price is felt (resisting spectacle, accepting scars), though not dramatized as immediate loss. Tension stays coherent and grows under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—returning the saved children and making pain legible—is signaled early and tightens when she arrives and insists on opening together. The shared act of repair (using his notepad resin) is the meaningful turn that narrows options from private safeguarding to communal articulation. Cost is legible in speaking names without apology and in carrying the now‑empty box. Quiet, but pressure coheres under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are legible early (revitalizing a sleepwalking village), and escalation arrives via denser patterning, multi‑self collaboration, and the gauge’s novel steady angle. The meaningful tightening is the gauge’s posture, which narrows tactics to “choreography” and a plan to teach the village. Costs are softer (labor ahead, surrendering superstition) but present. Absence of an antagonist is fine; pressure remains coherent through the ritual’s feedback.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—ethically mapping legacy—intensifies through a pattern break: the image’s instruction to “play the room,” leading to the letter and vow. Pressure coheres as the narrator chooses burden over aesthetic evasion, with a felt price (self‑erasure hints, weight accepted). Escalation is internal but tangible via distinct beats. Quiet, but a clear tightening and stance crystallization occur.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear early and tightened through the disciplined method (structure before song; “stay/if/unless” sequence). The meaningful turn occurs when the glass “turns over to listen” and the MC chooses asking over commanding, foreclosing a path of force. Cost is subtler than visceral—ongoing restraint, patience, and acceptance of a borrowed heartbeat’s difference—but it’s present and felt. Pressure remains coherent, interweaving internal doubt with the external ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—shifting from slogans/violence to workable, costly co‑labor—is signaled early and deepens through a ritual path that forecloses spectacle and threats. A concrete tightening arrives with the casings ritual and the general’s refusal/redraft, showing price and adaptation. The closure’s stance (“judged by how well our enemies sleep”) crystallizes the trade‑off: endurance over victory. Escalation is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—keeping extinct birds audible—tightens through a ritual whose costs escalate (risk of thunder, the egg’s disintegration, secrecy). The meaningful turn is the “Release”/hum sequence that forces the trade: matter to echo. External pressure (returning thunder/rain) dovetails with internal, without coincidence resolving anything. The price is unmistakable in the egg’s spent powder and his denied tears.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (subverting conformity by redistributing voice) is signaled early and escalates with the patrol’s arrival and the shrinking window. One meaningful tightening occurs when the grate opens and she must finish the rethreading before discovery. The price is legible as risk and irrevocable alteration of the social order, though no loss lands on the body in scene. Resolution is earned by her choices rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (ethical storytelling without theft) is signaled early and tightens when the woman takes the stick and redirects the punchline. The troupe commits to costs: exposing rehearsal mistakes, yielding editorial control, forgoing applause. Escalation is internal‑external, coherent under the accumulative lens, with one meaningful tightening rather than multiple reversals. Minor softness: the initial “heated argument” remains offstage, slightly dampening early pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around whether transient gestures can register witness; escalation occurs via denser signaling (heartbeat pattern, stones for timing), the monarch’s arrival, and the hawk’s shadow pause. The hawk beat is a meaningful tightening—a necessary interruption that tests the grammar and the narrator’s method. Cost remains interior but legible: choosing fragility and patience over permanence and speech. The stakes are modestly scaled but precise and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—capturing and returning names—tightens as wind becomes language, the aurora narrows to a blade, and the bells shift from idea to sounding reality. Escalation is agency‑driven via rope reconfigurations and the deliberate refusal to write the names down. Cost is subtle but legible (exhaustion, acceptance of ongoing labor over easy record‑keeping). No contrived antagonist; pressure coheres under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (fate vs chosen path) tightens through the approaching storm and the archive’s failing directives. The meaningful turn arrives with the recovered verb “to shepherd,” forcing a stance beyond maintenance into risk. The wafer’s designed brittleness converts duty into invitation, foreclosing bunker‑safety. Price is legible in stepping into weather and abandoning the sheltering algorithm.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether and how to answer the palace’s “encrypted devotion”—tightens via Saturn’s timing, the note, the urn, and the map’s ask. The meaningful turn is accepting stewardship rather than seeking treasure; cost is sustained maintenance under scarcity. Escalation is inward but legible, each discovery demanding a deeper commitment. The vow forecloses spectacle and power-seeking paths.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—release of resentment—is clear, and pressure tightens as memory opens into the factory and Rell must gather the forgotten breath. The decisive deepening (silence forming music in his ribs) narrows options toward forgiveness. The journey tilts toward ease at times, with limited overt resistance, but the on‑page price (letting go of a long‑held stance) is legible. Agency, not coincidence, resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear and escalates when Noor’s breath wobbles and the corridor threatens to split. Ilen’s stabilizing choice (heel to frost, counting seasons) is the key tightening that narrows options from chase to contained re-creation. Costs are modest but felt (risk of shatter, endurance under cold and fear). Resolution arises from the protagonists’ altered stance and disciplined method.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stakes (restart shedding/bridge generational wisdom) are signaled early, and escalation tightens via the choice to use the daughter’s ribbon to reactivate the bell. The ritual’s success visibly reweights the world (leaves fall, sap runs), while the internal cost—choosing patience over closure—lands. External opposition is soft, but the accumulative pressure and self‑imposed constraints maintain tension. The cadence shift around the bell provides the key turn.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (knowledge vs self‑rewriting) coheres and tightens through the lineage rule and the act of eating. The cameo burning and leaving an impression gives a visible price and narrows future options. Escalation is protagonist‑driven under the chosen lens. Stakes could register one notch more viscerally at the bite to reach top band.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reaching the library—tightens via the apprentice rescue and the traveler’s ritual requirement, which narrows options to speaking failure without correction. Pressure coheres and deepens under the chosen lens, though the price paid is more spiritual than visceral. The rescue scene provides the clearest on‑page test, and the later collective whisper is an earned intensification. A sharper visible cost (loss, sacrifice) would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (find the garden without losing self) tightens when the not‑mine voice names the price and the jar appears with a smeared name. The protagonist escalates by choosing to breathe life into the “unkindled solace,” then renounces the ledger identity. The external pressure (ship can’t dock; garden approaches) entwines with the internal bargain. Cost and foreclosed path read clearly at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake is clear and held: restore the record without losing the present room. One meaningful tightening occurs as the doorway responds to knot changes and his measured counting; the threshold step heightens risk before the decisive merge. The price—renouncing deeper passage and refusing to “worship confusion”—registers, though lightly. Additional resistance or a failed attempt before the correct braid pattern would intensify pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is steady and escalates through density: resonance threatens to break maps; experiments lead to planting; hush blooms and reweights pressure. Tightening occurs when the beings close in, forcing the planting to succeed or fail now. Cost is modest but legible: the solution is partial and must be maintained, foreclosing a quick fix. Internal and external conflicts braid without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—rekindling the beacon to rethread people and meaning—is signaled early and tightens with the traveler’s arrival and the missing constellation. The decisive adaptation (using silence as a seam) narrows options and produces the turn. Cost is present but understated; failure risk and the shaving of the shard register more as lyric ache than bite. Still, pressure coheres and rises to a satisfying cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—permission to include the self in collective memory—is clear and tightens as the forecourt’s whispers press toward kneeling. The decisive act (speaking the plum memory) incurs vulnerability; the shadow’s response marks a price and reconfiguration. Escalation is primarily internal but coherently pressured by ritual, measurement, and the observatory’s expectation. A single, meaningful intensification suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (lifting communal hopelessness) is clear and narrows through the hush and the ignition count. The main tightening is the no‑stars silence into the lit cord, with tactics constrained by wind and sequence. Cost is present as risk and responsibility rather than loss, but the cadence deepens convincingly. No antagonist needed; pressure accrues through environment and time.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure coheres around one choice: to go inland or refuse, with love and vocation at stake. Escalation arrives via accumulative futures and the cicada’s “seam,” culminating in a narrowing of options and acceptance of cost. The tightening is quiet but unmistakable; the pause becomes a “tidepool” bowl that must be crossed. Stakes remain internal yet are felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (finding a safe silence the father can accept) is clear and tightens through the “limiting exposure” tactic and the decision to bring the hush home. The key escalation is sharing the gilded hush—risking both self and father’s paradigm—which pays off in the architectural softening. The cost is more conceptual/emotional than visceral but still unmistakable at this length (temptation to abandon doors vs. being “made of exits”). Tension threads through sentence‑ and beat‑levels without repetitive loops.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can comfort be catalyzed, not measured—tightens via pattern intensification (freight calls → hush checks; crystals freckle → clear). The operator’s agency escalates tactically (adjusting environment) and the mathematician’s choice to stop computing narrows an internal option. The felt price is quiet—relinquishment rather than rupture—but coherent for the lens. One decisive deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around the sunrise deadline and the ethical choice at the throne; escalation deepens from puzzle‑hunting to governance stance. The primary tightening is at the interface, where “leave unbound” vs. claim power carries a conceptual price. External friction is gentle (drones skirted, puzzles solved smoothly), so tension leans internal, but the cadence still narrows options credibly. The duet stewardship decision reads as protagonist‑driven rather than coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (can she teach breath and stabilize the crossing without self‑erasure?) tightens with the student’s arrival and the chilling ritual; the threshold steadies, then the test: an unescorted crossing. Cost is legible in the naming taboo breach and the choice to step back. Escalation is a decisive deepening rather than reversal, apt for the lens. Stakes remain intimate but unmistakably pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—stabilize the chamber without unleashing “predatory ideas”—tightens through redlining gauges and contradictory guidance. Agency drives escalation: she reorients the chamber, anchors the bolt, and ultimately signs, accepting harm first. The price is clear: risk of failure and self-cut in exchange for value creation. The cadence shift at the purr of creation reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.7)
    One dominant stake—whether and how to carry or end the dynasty—tightens through the ritual to a renunciatory vow. Escalation is a deepening of knowledge and consequence, not a duel, but the pressure coheres: silence forces a different interpretive tactic and leads to a real forfeiture. The cost is felt in the seal left behind and the decision to build ovens, not a throne. Slightly low external friction keeps it just shy of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and tightens at the kernel: he must pick one future and release the rest. The “unsnap the old vow” cue deepens internal conflict and narrows options. The decisive escalation is his climb and selection under the program’s pressure; price is the relinquishment of other possible mornings and the knightly identity. Tension remains coherent without needing an external antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—rescuing/recording quiet kindnesses against institutional erasure—tightens via the discovery sequence and the realization of the counselor’s return. The decisive act is not to solve the address but to archive kindness with an addendum and staged hope (the envelope), paying the price of living with unknowns. Pressure is quiet but coherent and deepens once. A touch more jeopardy or counterpressure could have raised the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are coherent (erasure vs. restoration) and tighten once meaningfully when the circuit opens and outside pressure surfaces (siren, possibility of discovery). Escalation is primarily textural rather than confrontational, with the synchronized lights and voice deepening risk and commitment. The price remains mostly implied; there’s no direct interference on the page. Even so, the hinge decision forecloses the safer path of silence and anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is early and constant: prevent the prophecy from being read. Escalation arrives via denser lines and the colder second sentence that names a beloved city, prompting a lower-register counter—an on‑page deepening consistent with the lens. Cost remains conceptual but legible: if the hush slips, “they will come smiling,” and the protagonist bears ongoing vigilance. A single clear tightening rather than multiple reversals, apt for the form.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—rightly decoding and grounding the prophecy—tightens with the first leaf and the imperative to build with seeds. Escalation operates as density and pattern shift (from cataloging to making), and the protagonist’s choice forecloses the old, safer routine. The on-page price is quiet but felt (patience over haste; new ongoing labor). Tension is lyrical rather than fraught, yet coherent and deepening under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—will the narrator commit to adaptive practice under real pressure—tightens at the waterfall and again at the assembly choice. The reversal through the falls is earned and narrows options; the clock-building is an agentive deepening that reweights meaning. Prices are implicit but legible: risk, relinquishing exactness, and choosing a path that refuses guarantees. Tension hums more as pressure-of-perception than threat of loss, but it coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—redeem the mistake by proving names have weight—intensifies through the calibration sequence to the furnace decision. The key tightening is the realization of the “wrong limit,” forcing a trade‑off: accept she won’t return but bind the names and return the coin. Costs are felt (surrendering the coin, hair, and button; foreclosing hope). Tension is steady and deepening rather than twist‑driven, appropriate to the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—coaxing laughter into healing—tightens when the woman fears laughter’s betrayal; the protagonist must test a riskier, crooked chuckle and invoke the tooth/river. The decisive deepening is his refusal to enter the clearing, accepting limits and cost. Pressure remains coherent and escalates via density and cadence, not antagonists. Slightly low hazard to his person keeps it just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is coherent: determine a mercy threshold before harm; pressure escalates as the body’s tremor intensifies responses. The decisive tightening is the articulation of the “brace” wall/infinite cost and the vow not to exceed it, which forecloses a path. Emotional and conceptual prices (remorse flare, carrying the forest) are on the page. The conflict is internal/external braided without overreach for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—returning a hidden name—tightens through clear pressure points: the painter’s “unsellable” stance, the shard’s activation, the scramble to “gather” letters before they fall back. The key turn is the act of naming and tying the sailcloth, foreclosing anonymity. Cost is present but conceptual rather than painful; nonetheless the refusal to “drink a third world” marks a price. Tension scales by density and cadence rather than overt reversals, suiting the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (freeing time‑debt/ghosts by confronting what ceilings hide) tightens from observation to ethical act. The meaningful turn is the decision to engage and unwind backward, with a conceptual price (admitting debt, naming the thief). Tension is more moral and tonal than perilous, but the pressure coheres and deepens credibly. The cost is quiet rather than visceral, slightly tempering impact.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—maintain buoyant imbalance or sink into perfection—is clear early and tightens with the aisle seam “untying expectations” and the explicit if/then choice. The protagonist’s act (printing the clause) resolves the external pressure and costs a tasted perfection. Internal and external conflicts interweave: grief tempts perfection; duty demands asymmetry. Tension scales sentence-to-scene without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stakes (the archive’s truth and the narrator’s credibility) are clear and tightened by Ledger’s petition and the council adjudication. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation, culminating in the risky storm demonstration. Costs are legible—professional risk, ideological suspicion, and the shard’s eventual cracking. One decisive deepening suffices at this length without needing multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are declared early and tightened by the rust’s demand for collateral, forcing a trade-off that forecloses a path (keeping one’s shadow). Escalation is coherent: the near-collapse at the door, the chamber’s test, then the binding terms. The tether proposal reframes the win condition, integrating ethics into mechanics. Tension is lyrical rather than adrenal, but the cost is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—seeking a place beyond explanations—tightens via the seam’s opening, the psychometry visions, and the father’s implied death. The cost is legible in the refusal of neat logic and the grief that won’t close. Escalation is primarily internal but coherently pressured by tangible beats (hinge failure in the past; returned offerings now). A single, purposeful tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—reimagining passage—tightens as the storm’s pressure meets the build; the lantern’s reveal deepens options and accelerates commitment. Escalation is steady rather than sharply turning; no hard reversal, but density and agency increase credibly. The price (labor in storm, surrendering haste) is present though understated. Earned resolution stems from protagonist’s choices, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are quiet but coherent: to wrest meaning from night-blooming and translate it into art that “speaks after dusk.” Escalation occurs through density and commitment—cathedral experiment to multi-panel mural to public unveiling. Price is primarily time and devotion; no antagonist, but endurance narrows options and culminates in a single charged unveiling. Slight softness in on-page jeopardy keeps this just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—public, legible record—tightens as the reverie sears, parley forces disclosure, and the clerk’s punches raise the cost and possibility of proof. The protagonist’s choices drive turns (mapping, calling for parley, accepting the punches, publishing). Cost is felt (scalding, entrapment, no relief), and the endurance/renunciation is credible. Escalation is clear without needing multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake (revival without miracles) is clear and tightens as Iria shifts from solitary prep to communal commitment. Pressure escalates via density—plans become enactment when the bell draws people and Iria publicly forecloses wishes. Opposition is soft (no antagonist), so the cost is renunciatory rather than confrontational. Still, the bell-ringing and declaration credibly narrow options and start irreversible work.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is legible early and coheres: whether to record a prophecy that harms someone or to refuse and risk wider costs. Escalation is an intensifying weave of voices culminating in the older self’s warning, which narrows options. The final renunciation is a meaningful foreclosure with felt price; pressure arises from a credible ethical dilemma rather than coincidence. Quiet but unmistakable tightening under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (keeping without clutching) tightens as the vortex demands naming, alignment, and pattern‑singing, culminating in the decision to plant it. The key deepening is the shift from storage to song; the cap placement forecloses possession in favor of stewardship. Cost is conceptual but legible: a vowed endurance (“as long as the pattern holds”) with relinquishment of ownership. Tension is quiet rather than perilous, but coherent under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to alarm three towns—is clear early and tightens toward “zero hour.” The protagonist’s refusal to rush the switch forecloses one path and risks institutional censure, and the bell choice resolves the pressure. External (audit, Reni’s urge) and internal (ethic of listening) conflicts interweave. Cost is present but relatively gentle, leaning contemplative over visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (how to live with damage) tightens through the outage and the map of the “corridor of shadow.” The choice to open the roof and accept the old boundary is a visible renunciation with cost (not to chase). Pressure grows coherently without needing an antagonist. Internal and external threads interweave elegantly.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can he accept stewardship with culpable heat—tightens when the queen arrives and asks if the archive can “hold heat.” He chooses to open fully, endure stings, and mark the sigil, foreclosing denial; cost is both embodied and moral. Pressure coheres under the chosen lens without needing multiple reversals. A single added beat of resistance could have heightened the trade-off, but the price is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes cohere (how to live without numbers) and tighten via the capsule opening and the walking-letter discovery, which deepen options and knowledge. The main turn is internal/ritual rather than confrontational, so escalation reads as density and cadence shift rather than narrowed choices. Visible price (renouncing prior certainties; accepting waiting) is present but understated. Absence of sharper resistance keeps the pressure below elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (a child’s loss and the stance toward incompletion) is signaled and tightened by the snap and the boy’s spiraling reaction. Escalation deepens via the poet’s agency—redirecting from retrieval to ritual—foreclosing the easy path. The cost is unmistakable: keeping the loss intact and transforming response rather than outcome. Pressure is quiet but coherent and sufficient for this length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are coherent and early: tune the orchard before time runs out and build interspecies trust. Escalation is a deepening consistent with the lens: fishermen’s suspicion, community agreements, storm test, and the narrator’s dwindling stamina. A visible price is paid (branch lost, energy waning), narrowing options toward a final act of consecration. Conflict remains primarily situational and ethical rather than adversarial, but the tightening is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure tightens through the ritual’s stages, with the decisive act of placing amber against the pane yielding the window’s “widening intention.” Stakes remain focused on reconciling method and meaning; the deepening is clear if quiet. The cost is primarily conceptual (renouncing easy astonishment and nostalgia), which reads but is not sharply dramatized as loss.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes—whether a living concord can replace a dead reef’s guard—are clear and deepen. The meaningful tightening arrives when he uproots bayonets and refashions them, foreclosing martial memory as tactic. Pressure is largely internal/ethical and accumulative rather than adversarial; the price is patience, labor, and choosing surrender as shelter. Slight softness in overt escalation keeps it shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (bridge distance to sister) tightens through a clear deepening at the riddle/decoding beat and a time‑bound dusk activation. The price is mostly emotional and situational rather than perilous, but it’s legible—hope risks re‑wounding; dusk is a single shot. Agency drives the turn: choosing to read, to walk, to hold the leaf steady as light fades. Pressure coheres under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens without coincidence resolving anything.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (convert confusion into exploration) is signaled early and pressures tactics as stars refuse to hold still. The key tightening arrives when true north migrates and the “glimpse” of last year forces a shift in method. Resolution is an earned stance: adopt a devotion‑axis and accept the darkness, foreclosing the need for a fixed pole. The escalation is measured rather than sharp, but the cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—restoring the world’s tuning—tightens through the patterned swapping and the locking bell that forecloses retreat. The queen’s revelation and the decision to make the final swap under constraint deliver a credible peak. The price is ethical and ongoing rather than bodily, but it is present and felt. A hair more immediate jeopardy could have sharpened the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around making an illicit record without spectacle; escalation accrues through the sequence of words (water → stay → hear/here → hush) and the pawn substitution. Stakes deepen via outlawed recordings and the looming regency, culminating in the decision to leave artifacts and vanish. Costs are implied rather than dramatized in conflict beats, keeping this short of peak intensity. Still, the tightening is unmistakable under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is internal (recovering voice/home) and pressure escalates via density and disruption: the feather test, stone vision, and the seer’s nightly reality swap that literally rearranges paths. The tightening is clear when the bookstore convulses and the protagonist must make space for resurfacing talents, culminating in choosing to follow the corridor and speak. Cost is emotional (exposure, shame) rather than external harm but is legibly paid on the page. One more concrete external constraint at the peak could have intensified the squeeze further.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—the ethical release intertwined with self‑forgiveness—is established early and tightens through the decoding sequence. The central dilemma forces a trade‑off between spectacle and pedagogy; choosing the slower method forecloses a tempting path. Prices are legible at each tug (ash taste on wrong moves) and in the ending memorial (pigeons). Tension scales via pattern density rather than adversarial reversal, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are legible early: avoid losing a single voice to the ritual by changing the price. Pressure tightens when the canyon names terms and the child is poised to pay; the artist’s decision to pay twice forecloses an option. The cost is visible (colors surrendered; mentor’s gold offered) and the resolution is earned by the protagonist’s tactic. Escalation is more deepening than reversal, but lands with force.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (make meaning/ask the right question of loss) is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist chooses to use the charm Mira “refused to draw.” Escalation is a meaningful deepening rather than a reversal: completing the rib choreography, then the pendulum choice, narrows outcomes and raises cost (truth without return). The engine’s response alters knowledge (“names the missing bolts” and the hour), reweighting options. The price—no Mira, only pattern—lands clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—keeping the hidden promise versus safety in replication—is clear and tightens as the wrong turn becomes a right door and the corridor demands restraint. The on‑page price is choosing a single curve and then leaving, foreclosing the seductive option to stay. Pressure is primarily internal but coherent and escalating within the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—guiding the freighter and validating the whisper ethos—is signaled early and tightens through the scent gambit and the wind’s “seam of calm.” The meaningful turn is the ship’s bow leaning to the seam and the mentor arriving to witness. Costs are self‑suppression and sustained attention rather than physical peril; they read but stay quiet. Escalation is lyric and controlled, if restrained.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (navigating grief) tightens: the beacon stops sweeping and points; the narrator must decide to leave, retrieve, and enact the ritual. The price is the relinquishment of a search for return in favor of a path within loss; the station’s “pulse famished” underscores cost. Escalation is coherent under the accumulative lens, culminating in the needle’s settling. No antagonist is needed; pressure is situational and interior, yet concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (creating psychological safety under surveillance and flood of empathy) is clear and tightens with the patrol’s arrival and storm pressure. The narrator adapts: smearing mud, hiding the eye, and choosing radical honesty to manage the inspectors. The refusal of the patrol to cross leans on situational pressure, but it does not resolve the conflict by luck alone—the protagonist’s tactics keep them viable. The price—risk of confiscation and communal exposure—is on the page and informs the ending stance.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake (decode the final gesture/respond) is legible early and tightens with the notch discovery and the decision to answer via light. Escalation is quiet but consequential; the single cadence shift (signal sent, answer maybe received) reweights the night. The price is ambiguity accepted plus the commitment to conceal the shrine and keep witness. Pressure coheres without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes concentrate around a single decision: step through/not, then act across water with the chip reclaimed—foreclosing the path of passivity. Escalation is coherent: creek rising, seam breathing, mirrors presenting reweighted options; the choice sharpens under time pressure. The cost is modest but clear (abandoning the “ask nothing back” life; physical hazard in the crossing). Agency drives every turn; nothing resolves by luck.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—self-sovereignty vs. throne and omen—tightens coherently toward the on-page choice to wake. The “must climb before dawn” clock and the pool-crescent key sharpen pressure. The price is legible and non-trivial (foreclosing certain forgiveness; reentering rule on altered terms). Escalation is a single decisive intensification consistent with the lens rather than multi-reversal plotting, which fits the length.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are coherent: capture the density of presence without collapsing into romance or chaos. Pressure tightens through the procedural escalation—the pocket sun’s wary lift, the threading glow, the circling and clicks—culminating in the proof’s release. The price is a chosen discipline (revaluing time, refusing hurry), though external jeopardy is minimal. One meaningful deepening lands as the sun pauses at the core, making the cost legible.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (cohering chaos into narrative to keep living) tightens through the jealous method, the feral nostalgia confrontation, and the alignment of dates into switchbacks. A meaningful trade‑off occurs: the narrator renounces the urge to intervene at their funeral; cost is accepted to gain continuity. Pressure coheres and deepens rather than flip via reversals, fitting the chosen lens. Stakes remain internal but are embodied by funeral, grave, and patrol readiness.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (steadiness in the face of birth/loss) is signaled early and tightens when the missing screw forecloses repair—until the midwife clamp screw offers a costly path. The father pays a real price by sacrificing his last relic; the narrator commits to a posture that refuses false certainty. Teaching “the breaths” is a deepening that changes options. Resolution grows from their agency, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—complete the rite within one breath—tightens credibly as lungs burn and the protagonist must choose which scars to render before time runs out. Pressure escalates via cadence and density (lightning as metronome, steam surface tightening, final sip) and the cost is felt. The resolution is earned by endurance and selection under constraint rather than luck. One clean deepening (third rune while breath strains) narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (apology/reconnection under a dawn deadline) tightens through stylus indictments (“You left”), request (“Forgive”), and the peach sketch that reframes debt to the living. The protagonist’s call to the foreman is a decisive escalation with risk that could stall the cutters. The live clock (truck beep, dawn) coherently presses. The final “Play” accepts cost and completes the emotional turn without deflating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—bind what can be recalled without lying—tightens through ritual steps and naming illusions; the decisive deepening is the hinge realization. Cost is legible in the relinquishment of certainty and the acceptance of a witness/hinge role rather than judge. Pressure is internal and ritualistic rather than antagonistic, which keeps the escalation quiet but coherent under the chosen lens. One clear intensification at the lectern prevents drift.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to enforce alignment or honor the boundary—tightens through Basin Three’s lag, conflicting instruments, and the drop/beacon synch. The decisive move is to label the event “not an error,” foreclosing the corrective path. Cost is understated but real (procedural deviation, admission of uncertainty, blood), fitting the accumulative lens. Escalation is subtle yet coherent and culminates at the hesitation of the last drop.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes center on redefining detection and negotiating grief; pressure deepens via the feral cat and the ruptured seal, prompting tactical patience and repair. The meaningful tightening is the steam rupture that forces embodied intervention and confirms her non‑clenching method. Agency resolves the throughline (hosting anomalies, rerouting alarms, bracing the strut) with a felt renunciation at close. The escalation is deliberately muted; cost is more reflective than perilous.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to “widen perspectives responsibly”—is active from the start and tightens at the Martingale corridor and the lantern’s theorem. The reversal is a deepening of risk’s meaning rather than an external clash, but it narrows options: thrill alone is foreclosed; stewardship is embraced. Cost is mostly internal; it lands through the father tie and teaching choices. Pressure remains coherent and builds through pattern notches rather than overt obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: preserve estrangement while aiding misdialed callers; it tightens with the emergency as she risks involvement via the loop. The key turn narrows options—she must involve Rojo and Flora, spending their ritual capital to steady the child. Cost is legible: Rojo’s silent exit and Flora’s tears mark changed relations, and Mara’s refusal to speak to the child forecloses a path. Slight softness: the external risk to Mara is low; stakes remain primarily relational/philosophical.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can memory reconstruct a covenant—tightens through the methodical reconstruction, then deepens when the figure appears and the couple talks via particulars. Agency is quiet but present: the archivist designs the walk and yields the stage; the woman chooses to recount anchors. The coincidence of his arrival slightly softens pressure causality. The cost—risking vulnerability without immediate forgiveness, and the archivist’s discipline not to intervene—is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—assembling a working cure for loneliness—tightens via the rain and blackout, forcing real-time logistics and communal promises. The rumor’s potential train creates pressure that’s answered by a neighbor‑dragged trolley, a purposeful reframe rather than a deus ex machina. Price is paid in effort, pledges, and the acceptance of imperfect timing (“be forgiven if you are not”). Escalation is gentle but coherent for the lens, with a credible narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are singular (find the stillpoint to reorient grief), with a meaningful tightening at the clearing where silence “weapons” and the ring’s sudden cold forces a kneeling, dowsing choice. The price is explicit: refusal to erase sorrow, choosing axis over anesthesia. Pressure escalates texturally via sonic density and interval sharpening rather than reversals. A slightly sharper moment of jeopardy or potential misread might have intensified the cost signal further.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (transforming guilt into responsible action) tightens when the narrator chooses to co‑author the signal, then faces resistance (gravity/pen/scrap) requiring altered tactics. Del’s “Unbend from the center” reframes the approach and prevents a false fix, adding cost and precision. Escalation is internal/external entwined rather than adversarial; the price remains more conceptual/emotional than visceral, slightly softening the crunch.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres around one stake: translating silence without betraying it. The meaningful tightening is the deliberate disruption (holding and then releasing the clapper) which tests the ethic the piece has built; the subsequent surrender of the map and vow to keep the camera empty make the price legible. Escalation is quiet but decisive under the accumulative lens. A touch more friction or risk in the bell beat could heighten perceived cost.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving readers/memory—tightens as the art‑trail yields instructions that culminate in planting the seeds. The stitching of the portrait’s throat and the seed activation provide a meaningful deepening that changes options and knowledge. Cost is present but largely conceptual; external opposition is minimal, keeping pressure more interior than antagonistic. Still, the cadence shift near the end credibly narrows paths and commits the narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (reconnect/awaken Mira) is clear and escalates through rhythmic tactics, the lagoon, the crack, and the donor influx. The tightening moment—accepting foreign memories to save Mira—carries a felt price that lingers. Institutional pressure arrives (monitors, security) without deflating agency. Resolution grows from the protagonist’s insistence on shared rhythm over declared “recovery.”

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear (find the courier; prove whispers over shouts) with a meaningful tightening at the jammed gate. Escalation is protagonist-driven via the bet, acoustic mapping, and tool craft; thunderous searchers serve as pressure contrast. The visible price is mostly reputational for Rade; Ivo’s risk is implied rather than sharply felt. Tension runs sentence-to-scene without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (can the narrator hold/use light against grief’s undertow) tightens through patient acts: light‑weaving, the silent question, confession, and finally bearing the tool. The key pressure turn is the transfer of the mirror and the narrator’s choice to aim it, with a felt price in reopening the “familiar door.” Escalation is quiet but clear under the accumulative lens; no soft reset. A single mythic remove slightly softens the sense of immediate risk.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (slowing the town) is signaled early and deepens via the synchronized windows and the staged stalemate. The clock’s single ring and moonrise provide a tangible tightening. Cost registers as the foreclosed path of decisive victory; effective but muted.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (claiming true self publicly to make the island hold) tightens through the crowd’s arrival and the requirement to name aloud. The key turn is the spoken name under communal witness; the price is vulnerability and the irrevocable shedding of the “hardshell.” External jeopardy is muted by the pacified world, slightly softening visceral risk, but the social/emotional cost is clear and active. Escalation is protagonist‑driven at each step.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—how to honor grief without punishment—is signaled early and deepens via live tests (surprise inspection; the contraband, off‑mic lesson). The choice to go silent strategically and the final refusal to name joy are coherent escalations under the accumulative lens. The price is subtle but present: professional risk, token economy pressures, and the sustained vacancy that replaces “victory.” A quiet but solid tightening rather than multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether communal meaning can live without fear—tightens through cumulative acts (breath syncing, charter paraphrase, rule-softening, first step across threshold). A visible price is paid (badge set aside, public transgression of a line, risk on ice). Escalation is driven by the poet’s agency and the crowd’s incremental buy-in, culminating in crossing into the lake space. The pressure remains coherent without requiring a villain.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are quiet but clear: will Ivo secure/accept an awakening that serves his lack—and at what price? The meaningful tightening occurs at the trade and the deliberate non-blow whisper into the reed, which risks failure and forecloses his old pursuit of color. The subsequent decision to stay converts desire into a chosen practice with social and temporal cost. Pressure remains coherent, if not high-heat, and grows via patterned intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres around making an honest, reparative circuit; escalation is a deepening rather than a reversal, appropriate to the accumulative lens. The volunteer’s grief forces a recalibration (the unexpected sandbar) that narrows the easy path of abstraction. The on‑page price is a relinquishing of tidy outcomes and a commitment to be “changed without argument.” Stakes remain intimate but felt; one meaningful tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under a textural lens, pressure coheres and deepens: from private return to public facilitation to the mother’s question about broken futures, which tests the narrator’s ethos. Stakes are dominant and consistent—whether grief can be held and taught without pretending to cure. The price is the commitment to patience and to “illuminate what refuses itself,” which forecloses escape. Escalation is quiet but decisive in how the narrator’s role solidifies.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure mounts by pattern accretion: clients shift from coins to tides; broken screens become bones; historians’ search demands a literal walk; the last client forces a values test. The decisive tightening is the reframing of the final stake away from reunion to a sustaining solo chorus. Costs are conceptual rather than visceral, but the trade‑off is unmistakable and earned by the method established. No antagonist, yet coherent pressure persists.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—ethical access to forbidden knowledge—tightens through the landings and culminates in a refusal to steal and a renunciation of publication. The archive’s pressure coheres and grows (mirrors’ warnings, tablets’ bargain, chorus of names). The price is felt: self-alteration and relinquishing conventional scholarly reward. Escalation is more deepening than reversal but remains unmistakable under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is clear early (reuniting the shadow without breaking the library) and tightens when the library resists, forcing a trade. The sacrifice of her stored dreams is a visible price that alters the end state. Escalation is coherent under the chosen lens; no coincidental bailout. Slight softness: the vow to the leaves works quickly, but the paid cost preserves rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clear: save the animal and salvage integrity/trust. Escalation proceeds through deepening: stripping the terrarium, committing to amputation, then committing to public accountability—each move narrows options and carries cost. The moral calculus sharpens at “I did not invite rage; I invited precision,” culminating in naming profiteers and inviting oversight. Quiet but unmistakable price is paid in both flesh and reputation.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether to keep opening wounds to seek closure—tightens as she chooses action over rumination and renounces the keepsake. The reversal is internal-to-external: from scrying coffee rings to irrevocably pouring sand into a fossil ring. Cost is legible in the loss of the hourglass and the acceptance that the miracle won’t be “put back.” Pressure coheres under the chosen lens without needing an antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are internal but coherent: finding unused love consolidates into discovering her own deferred life. Escalation arrives when the projector answers and the aisle labeled with her name forces a choice, narrowing her stance from divining for others to revising her own goodbye. The price is subtle—admitting self‑denial and marking a shelf for others rather than securing a neat fix. Pressure is gentle but tightens once in line with the lyric lens.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (free trapped creativity to relieve internal pressure) is clear, and pressure coheres via ritual circuits to a tangible opening and one artist’s release. A meaningful tightening arrives with the meteor/door and the choice to enter and sleep-listen; failures/rest show price and adaptation. Stakes deepen from individual to city-scale without diffusing focus. Conflict remains mostly internal/liminal but earns consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—resisting erasure by coaxing the archive to cohere—tightens through a clear cadence shift when the archive folds “like rain becoming a cup.” The “game” with the clock, the choice of the shortest night, and the refusal to look too soon mark escalating commitments. Cost is quiet but legible: the guard trades personal ease for sustained, careful labor under fragile conditions. The pressure coheres without an antagonist; one deepening turn suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—relieving the hum’s ache to regain inner frontier—tightens through the missing‑second clock. The key turn is the choice to repair despite resistance; the price is relinquishing the lesson of ruin for calibration. Escalation is internal but coherent: ache→warning vowels→paused branches→risk and repair→corridor and library. Slight softness in overt external jeopardy keeps it just under top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake centers on accepting courage; pressure coheres and tightens via the guides’ rule (“through indirect routes”) and the choice to take paths that resemble fear. The key tightening is the instruction to choose those bends, culminating in the final reach that forecloses hesitation. The price—sustained vigil, relinquishing ferry, and owning navigation—reads on the page. Quiet, but the escalation is unmistakable under the lyric lens.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—expression versus safety—intensifies through accumulation and a single tightening: the radiators’ pattern announces the choir’s return and forces a stance. Agency is a deliberate endurance decision: to remain and play “space,” paying with pain and complicity in a silence renegotiated, not abolished. Cost is felt, though external jeopardy is muted; pressure coheres without reversals. The trade-off lands clearly at the bench.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is focused: reveal/renounce legitimacy. Pressure tightens through the guided volumes to the ink’s irrevocable mark; options narrow from plausible denial to confession. The decisive act is Serane’s withdrawal, and the cost is visible in status loss and emotional forfeit. Escalation is quiet but coherent and cumulative rather than hinging on a single dramatic reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are focused (safety/route vs erasure), and pressure tightens via discovery: pressing “Assemble,” decoding the old keeper’s taps, and risking a communal night crossing. The decisive deepening—recognizing the path as a rhythm—forces a trade: timing over fixed ground, with daily re‑setting under storms. Escalation is inward and procedural rather than peril-chase, but it remains coherent under the chosen lens. The protagonist’s radio call and choreography are agency‑forward and pay a visible logistical price.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres and deepens: patient vibration→ritual touch→heat→system wake→public reveal. The dominant stake narrows options (risking exposure to revive silenced circuits), and she chooses to act. Cost is present but felt more as risk than consequence on the page, keeping escalation persuasive but not punishing. The final act reweights the rebellion’s options from rage to orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (who steers tradition) is signaled early and tightens at the council’s refusal, prompting Lida’s transgressive act. The escalation is coherent and protagonist‑driven, culminating in the embryo’s transformation. The felt price is relatively light—pushback arrives but softens fast once the tree manifests. One meaningful deepening occurs, but the conflict resolves smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—can Rafi practice care without denial?—is signaled early and deepened by the helicopter-triggered freeze. The tightening arrives when Leda’s numbered tasks bridge him back into agency, with a felt price (re-exposure to trauma) that informs later choices. The later exhibit and conversation are secondary deepening rather than new peaks, keeping the escalation quiet but coherent. Resolution is an earned stance rather than a neat cure.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—rekindle the light to re‑aim herself—tightens as weather thickens and the wick proves perished. The decisive deepening is the choice to braid thread through the wick housing, risking loss of the deck to gain light. The price is understated but legible: relinquishing idle rumination for keeper‑duty, and sacrificing the “broken” divination tool to make guidance real. Tension operates at image and beat scale without relying on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (end the market that sells crisis‑time) tightens through discoveries and culminates in the throne test. The on‑page turn is the refusal, a renunciation that forecloses a path to power; the cost is identity erasure and relinquished control. Pressure is coherent across beats; one clean deepening suffices at this length. A single on‑page complication mid‑way (a near failure or loss) might have amplified felt risk.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are singular and clear: preserve vs release with social and personal cost. Pressure escalates through the ritualized hesitation to a timed act that forecloses a path (pure preservation). The aftermath shows consequences distributed across the city, not erased. Quiet, but the tightening is unmistakable under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—transmuting blame into mercy—tightens when the trio demands the father and “the map to grief.” The protagonist’s agency (ritual, story, replanting blame into names) drives the turn; the laid‑down knife and nursery redirection foreclose confrontation. The price is endurance of ambiguity and the father’s continued absence. Escalation remains gentle but credible for the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—recovering and restoring the coastline’s song—tightens through the bargain and the elders’ examination, then crystallizes in the renunciation. Escalation reads as density/pressure increase (garden shudders, hush descends) leading to a single consequential choice. The cost is the surrender of possession for stewardship. Slight softening of concrete jeopardy keeps it from a higher band, but the internal price is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—ethics of shaping public reality—tightens through the wager and the proof’s consequences. The on‑page reversal (nothing happens… then the emergency light; citywide stall) credibly escalates pressure. The price is a public, structural choice (funding as open data, abandoning silence as orbit) rather than a private epiphany alone. Slightly soft on immediate personal loss, but the social cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (atonement/hushing guilt) escalates coherently: the spectral letters and recorder deepen pressure, the client’s need crystallizes it, and the self‑tattoo forecloses avoidance. The baby’s translated “stay” forces the protagonist to pay a personal price. No antagonists needed; agency drives the turns. The tightening is unmistakable and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—discovering meaning without smoothing—tightens when the bearded man’s deflection threatens to ossify the mandala and the narrator intervenes. The tile placement and the child’s relay of the hush deepen pressure by reorienting the group’s stance. The price is conceptual (releasing slogans, accepting mess) rather than visceral, which slightly softens impact at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—repair versus retribution—is clear early and deepens when the arsonists are called into the plaza. The decisive tightening is the narrator’s choice to recast a trial into renaming with burdensome tasks. Opposition is somewhat low-friction (the men kneel with little challenge), reducing experiential cost on the page. Still, the ethical calculus is sharp and consequences feel ongoing, not tidily resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes (prevent spill, stabilize memory/time) are signaled early and tighten when the fracture appears and the ghost pleads to anchor the Star. The narrator’s choice to bear the “heavy” blue bell and speak lost names narrows options toward endurance/letting go. Cost is felt as ongoing obligation and relinquishment of pure nostalgia. A single sharper consequence would intensify pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are focused (placing memory within reach) and pressure coheres via misreads, skepticism, and the jolt of static that forces a reset. The tightening is gentle but present: a pause/countdown → recommitment → successful recall with visible effort. Costs are emotional and embodied rather than plot‑heavy; they register but never bite hard. Resolution arises from the protagonists’ chosen method rather than luck.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (earning trust to speak for the unknown) tightens when the storm surges, forcing an on‑page decision: take the fossil or entrust it to the cave. The narrator adapts tactics—grabs the fossil for safety, then deliberately returns to place it deeper, paying a visible price by surrendering control. Pressure remains coherent and grows; resolution stems from chosen renunciation rather than coincidence. The cost is felt and charges the final plateau.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (freeing prophecy from fixity) is clear and advances through one primary tightening: opening and matching the echo, then opening the doors. Escalation is largely internal and procedural; external pushback is absent, and consequences are benevolent. The confession without penalty dissipates pressure at the crest. Still, the act of breaking taboo and redistributing time/voice reweights options.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (trust/return vs. self‑erasure) is signaled early and tightens via the ring reveal and the agreed signal to open the pillbox. The meaningful turn is the disposal of microfilm—foreclosing a path and accepting reliance on Len. Internal and external conflicts interweave (self‑repair vs. operational risk). Quiet but palpable pressure; price is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—complete the crossing and fulfill the promise—stays coherent. Escalation is modest but functional: the current tries to turn them; they answer by stitching/rowing in rhythm and time‑boxing “until rain gutters stop ticking.” The costs are exertion, exposure, and choosing motion over fear. Resolution follows from their agency rather than luck.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (can care reconfigure a resisting place?) tightens as small offerings escalate (water → cleaning → song → cups → cross‑thread gifts). The “thrum” and braided timelines mark deepening pressure and feedback. Price is modest but real, and the decision forecloses easier withdrawal. Lack of overt opposition keeps it quiet, but escalation under the accumulative lens is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are coherent and escalate from intention to tangible tests (row → lock → brittle wick → beam). The tightening is subtle but present; success isn’t trivialized by the careful cleaning and single quiet click that could fail. Cost is largely emotional and procedural rather than peril-based; a slight softness in jeopardy keeps it just shy of top-band.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—maintaining tuned coexistence without calcifying into isolation—tightens when the stone circle coughs and shelves drop. The protagonist’s agency (angling the dial, answering with herd‑song) earns resolution; the narrowing is clear and coherent under the chosen lens. The price lands more as exertion and attentional endurance than a concretized loss. Still, escalation reads as a purposeful cadence shift rather than a soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (rejoining) tightens as the lovers’ leaves sway together, converging them toward the bowl and the public reading. The narrator’s agency (hiding/revealing letters, architecture of threads) drives the turn. Cost is present but restrained—public exposure and surrendering secrecy—fitting the mode. A slightly sharper moment of jeopardy could heighten escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—resist manipulative cadence—intensifies through coherent pressure: dean’s refusal, orchestrated campus symmetries, and the wave’s escalating bribes. The protagonist’s phase‑inversion and countersigns constitute a decisive tightening and test of resolve. The visible cost is a foregone status path and ongoing vigilance. Tension operates at line and beat levels, culminating in a chosen slower, messier civic tempo.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—retrieve and use the key despite the city’s mutiny—tightens with the triangle transfixion and the polite‑guard exit; internal claustrophobia spikes twice to escalate pressure. Agency drives turns: choosing to prick geometry, to wear the key openly, and to confront the Council’s interdiction by going to the Observatory. The price is present (risk, breath, social defiance) but not sharply cashed on the page, tempering the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—extracting truth/empathy from a cold site—is signaled early; the key tightening is the blue‑ribbon mismatch prompting the identity‑swap inference. Pressure coheres through accumulative discoveries and culminates in a renunciation (“I do not know who harmed her”) that forecloses the solve‑it path. The cost is felt but quiet; absence of a live antagonist or harder on‑page push keeps the escalation modest by design.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is legible early (reverse exile/honor ancestor), and escalation tightens from discovery to activation to public consequence. The director’s attempt to shut the protagonist out provides credible antagonistic pressure. The visible cost is mostly reputational/institutional; a deeper immediate consequence would intensify the squeeze. Still, the reversal line of exiles is a strong earned test of commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—recovering/forgiving the vanished hitchhiker—tightens through a single deepening turn: from artifact discovery to performative risk under surveillance. The on‑page price (entering the “system,” potential toll of the ledger) heightens the final measure; agency drives resolution rather than coincidence. Stakes remain intimate yet consequential, with no soft reset. Minor note: the cost’s external consequences are primarily implied, not dramatized post‑choice.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is set early and pressure coheres: investors vs. memory, growth vs. restraint, culminating in shutdown. The meaningful tightening is the market correction and the decision to close, foreclosing one path while deepening the quest’s meaning. Prices are visible (loss of the venture, coders leaving, the train reclaimed by useless ribbons). Escalation is primarily textural, not scene‑conflict, but it sharpens options credibly under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—decoding/meaning-making through witnessing—is active from the telegram to the braided reading. The key tightening is the shift from solitary transcription to dialogic response, narrowing tactics and redefining the path. Costs are modest but legible (vulnerability, relinquishing lone authority) and the final commitment forecloses a previous mode. Tension is quiet yet sustained, with one meaningful deepening sufficient for the scale.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering the frozen confession—is signaled early and escalates through one meaningful tightening: the eighth-circle snag and the decision to spend the one seed. The ethical cost sharpens as the seed bites the denial, foreclosing the mayor’s cover and the druid’s tool. Resolution follows from the protagonist’s deliberate method, not coincidence, and entwines internal/external conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—liberating/redefining the covenant—tightens through the scar-link vision, the maze’s emergence, and the heart confrontation. The pivotal refusal and counter‑offer are protagonist-driven and narrow options with conceptual cost. Pressure coheres under a hybrid lens, but the antagonistic force (gardeners) subsides swiftly, softening the felt jeopardy at the peak. Still, escalation is clear and purposeful for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (re-route a doomed fate) is present early, and pressure coheres via the Weaver’s condition and the boy’s refusal fate. Escalation is a deepening rather than a reversal, appropriate to the lens, with a visible trade‑off at the end. Tension is more hushed than taut; the cost is felt but not razor‑edged. Still, the barter and debt sequence narrows options credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—maintain professional insulation vs. acknowledge grief—tightens when the narrator recognizes the scrap’s specific night. The decisive turn is the revaluation with museum recommendation, which forecloses pure detachment. Cost is the acceptance of memory’s claim on work. Escalation is subtle but coherent for the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is explicit early (prevent rubbing/sparks by reestablishing harmonic guidance), and pressure coheres as night and storms tighten the window. Escalation is a textural deepening (voice tuning, node adjustments, planting) rather than sharp reversal, appropriate to the chosen lens. The felt cost is present but more atmospheric than visceral; a near‑miss or concrete loss would raise intensity. Still, agency drives resolution, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—holding the woman’s shape/name—tightens modestly as the tide/phase clock hums in the background. The key turn is the cards migrating to one true name and the bells finding a capturing note without pinning. Stakes remain interior and ritualized; the price (identity remains migratory, kelp‑to‑paper shedding) is poignant but understated. A slightly clearer ticking or foreclosed option would sharpen escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (approve isolation vs enable communion) is signaled early and tightens at the “heartbeat” window. The crowning forecloses a professional path and reweights the mission with visible cost (“logged…unfit for isolation,” vow). Internal and external pressures interweave cleanly. Slightly soft external consequence keeps it just shy of peak.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (self‑forgiveness) is signaled early and tightens through following coordinates to charged sites of failure. The turning point arrives at the sluice gate and culminates in entering the shallow—physical risk and moral exposure. The agency is renunciatory and procedural, with a visible cost in abandoning the “tidy creed.” Pressure coheres without contrivance; no luck resolves it.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is early and focused; escalation is a clear deepening via method: listening, aligning breath, decoding, then writing without speaking. The pivotal tightening is the door’s refusal of hurry, forcing a trade—speed for access—and the later vow to burn the first letter adds cost. Stakes remain largely interior, but tension persists at sentence and beat scale as tactics adapt from ink to pauses to breath. The resolution grows from the protagonist’s disciplined agency.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—propagate now or surrender to the empire—is signaled early and tightens under the heat/noon deadline. The play/melt decision forecloses a live, lucrative option with visible cost. Pressure coheres and deepens as motifs condense (“perforated destiny,” museum arrival, plants urging). Only minor external resistance on the page keeps it from perfect maximality.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is coherent and tight: retrieve a last echo before oblivion. Escalation is a density intensification—aurora brightens, rhythm emerges, voice briefly arrives, chip dims—culminating in the archival sealing. The price is the acceptance of non-resurrection and letting go; tension is quiet but real. A single deepening turn (her mentor’s words captured) meaningfully reweights the path.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure is quiet but coherent: the need to locate contentment narrows into a choice to use and then surrender the heirloom, trading possession for belonging. The tightening comes at the slit and in the stool/pruning sequence that tests her values. Stakes stay internal; the felt price is the relinquished relic and assumed ongoing duty. A touch more friction or risk in accessing the chamber could have further intensified the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (confess vs. conceal) tightens through the chime-decoding that yields three concrete options. The third option forecloses easy paths (victory or shame) and declares visible costs (return funds, name officials, raise taxes). Escalation is clean and coherent under the situational pressure. A single meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—learning how to vanish ethically—tightens through endurance (“stay until the water forgot my stone”) and the trance’s moral ask to step aside. The meaningful deepening arrives when the narrator agrees to release, trading personal presence for communal flow; the cost is felt. Pressure remains coherent; no cheap coincidences resolve it. Quiet but decisive, consistent with the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is clear from the outset; escalation accrues through humming, flock patterns, and the stuttering pulse until the decisive intensification: the pulse routes through the narrator. The cast of the arrowhead and the leaving of stones represent narrowing options and a trade-off in practice and identity. Pressure remains coherent; no coincidences resolve it. The cost is understated but unmistakable in the yielded tools and the charged emptiness of the cord.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (retain agency over imagination vs optimization) escalates through the keystone’s activation, the hush “glove” as portable cost/boon, and the city test (blank table vs kiosks). Pressure tightens with the explicit choice to refuse ownership and accept an identity with ongoing cost. The piece remains gentle, but under an accumulative lens the cadence shift and renunciation read as a real narrowing of options. No antagonist is needed; internal and situational pressures cohere.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are internal but legible: earn the color of sound by disciplined listening versus the easier, ornamental encounter. Escalation follows the lens via deepening—breath steadies, hum gains “thawing silver,” and the need to vow introduces a real trade‑off. The tightening is subtle rather than a reversal, yet it forecloses a path (borrowing color without earning it). Pressure is coherent, if gentle, through to the vow.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—extracting intention from static without brittle faith—tightens once the prophecy’s middle clause is fulfilled, forcing the distillation and renewed trust. Escalation arises from the narrator’s decisions (coin flips, gyros reversal, surrender to method). The price is conceptual/emotional rather than physical, but it’s legible and alters tactics. Slight abstraction keeps the pressure cerebral, though coherence never slips.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is legible early: make the nameless nameable to answer Miren’s loss. Pressure tightens when her unsaid words resist settling, forcing the tactical pivot with the scythe and the last light. The crystallization and naming foreclose an option (letting the fear remain amorphous) with a felt price (accepting ongoing, not singular, salvation). Tension runs more as density than reversal, but the decisive intensification is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (re‑timing the world enough to bring back fish/life) is signaled early and tightens via the sunrise clock and the hum aligning with syllables. Escalation is a density increase, not a reversal, appropriate to the accumulative lens. The on‑page price is attention/endurance and acceptance of partial repair (“echo, not the original”). The fisherman’s gentle challenge sharpens the moral calculus at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (preserve communal memory vs. neutralize hazards/story) is clear and tightens as the trail leads to the grove. The meaningful turn is the radio call that forecloses procedural neutrality. Stakes interweave internal and civic ethics; tension hums rather than spikes, befitting the mode. Cost is mostly implied rather than bitten into on the page, keeping it just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (balance before transformation) tightens via pattern accumulation and a decisive refusal (not reading formulas). Escalation is subtle but coherent: birds teach, hour ripens, ember patience, copper cue, then sealing. The price is internal—relinquishing certainty and possession—which fits the lens but keeps jeopardy low. Resolution is earned by her altered stance.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving trust through a safe docking—is pressured by the “squeezed” seam and a sudden air blister. The protagonist escalates via decisive revisions: fog color, taps, rope give, and instructing the colder ribbon. Cost is emotional and relational, visible in the withheld apology and the final nod that maintains a debt. Tension runs sentence‑to‑sentence without coincidence resolving the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (custody/awakening the duplicate mind) is clear early and coheres with the narrator’s numbness battle. Pressure tightens via training contrasts and the decisive test of switching elements; the jar’s “consent” narrows options to together or fail. The verdict forecloses single custody and the narrator’s observer‑only stance. Costs are legible though mostly conceptual/emotional.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—stewardship vs. spectacle—is signaled and tightened by the seed’s arrival and her self-imposed rules that explicitly trade profit for meaning. The meaningful turn is the decision to plant and codify constraints, which narrows options. Pressure remains primarily internal and situational; credible external friction is invoked (landlord, inspectors) but not dramatized. Still, the renunciatory cost is clear at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is focused and escalates via density: machines tune, cords are yanked like bells, airflow becomes rumor-into-visitation. A meaningful tightening arrives when the mother’s remembered squeal returns and is placed “where a drumbeat should be,” shifting options from effort to orchestration. Costs are felt (physical pain, anonymity, the endurance of grief-as-audience) and do not vanish at resolution. The conflict remains coherent without requiring an explicit antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (belonging without erasing self) tightens through the pendant test and the demand to “give to stay.” The reversal/deepening comes when waiting is reframed as binding work, not stasis, and the breath tithe makes cost explicit. Escalation is internal but legible and coherent under the chosen lens. No cheap resolution; endurance forecloses easy crossing.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—defying doctrine to vivify possibility and alter fate—is legible and steadily tightens. The decisive deepening is the snap of the crozier, which forecloses an old path and prices the act. Pain and forfeiture register, and the opening gate is earned. Pressure is internal/external coherence rather than antagonistic, but it sharpens credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (placing endings without erasing them) sharpens through one meaningful tightening: the city’s refusal breaks only when assumptions are discarded and the hush is applied. The lunar perigee acts as a live pressure that reweights options, culminating in the stylus recording act. Cost is more conceptual than visceral but present in the refusal to resurrect and in leaving key objects embedded. Slightly softer edge on overt jeopardy keeps it from higher.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure coheres around one stake: end the ferry’s vanishing. Escalation tightens via the captain’s order to shut the radio, the entry into the grotto, and the instructions to drift under the next drip, culminating in the door choice. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral but legible: he forgoes a tidy, tide‑less certainty in favor of honest undertow. Agency drives turns rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can attention create a trustworthy bridge—tightens through the introduction of a third point (the visitor) and the curator’s written doubt. The triangle requires steadiness, narrowing options to sustained, intentionless holding; the “bridge” holds only if they endure. Stakes remain intimate but legible; the “debt” confession deepens cost but doesn’t escalate jeopardy beyond a charged poise. One decisive intensification suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to navigate/teach in a lit, forgetting sea—tightens when the aliens return. The protagonist’s agency (volunteering, mapping rays, answering the signal) drives the turn. Cost is legible but quiet: choosing darkness/edges over civic comfort. Escalation is a deepening of pattern rather than a sharp reversal, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—protecting a vulnerable voice by finding the right connection—is signaled early and tightens at the misread photo → man alive reversal. Pressure coheres as the narrator must choose to act against institutional friction and risk failure with the child on the line. The cost is primarily emotional and ethical, felt in the patience and grief carried into the final action. A small additional on-page trade-off would have amplified the price.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—return and witness within a deadly window—is clear and tightens through entry, activation, reading, and renunciation. The meaningful deepening is the choice to leave the talisman, sacrificing luck/control for remembrance. Time pressure and claustrophobia interweave with operational challenges (lock, terminal, tide). Cost is legible without melodrama, though no hard reversal beyond the ethical trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (redeem the failed array/self) is present early and tightens via the ghost’s accusation and the risky choice to re‑enter the burned archive. A decisive deepening occurs with defragmentation and the mentor’s reframing; the final renunciation (letting the signal fade; refusing to feed the wrong ghost) carries cost. Internal and external pressures braid cleanly. Only minor softness: the technical task unfolds smoothly without a visible hazard beyond psychological stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (rescue a language before its textures erode) tightens as the tunnel demands payment, forcing a trade: a name for a choir. The meaningful turn arrives when the canyon refuses law/war and the birds scatter, prompting a tactical retreat and re-approach that culminates in the sacrifice. The price remains legible and reshapes tactics (staying as caretaker). A brief on-page beat of jeopardy right before the offering might have heightened the squeeze further.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether and how to engage the untamed harmony without becoming lost—tightens through the arrowhead gambit and the phone’s instruction. The decisive turn is singing static and planting the arrowhead, which opens the way and demands a commitment. The keeper-not-hero calculus registers as a trade of freedom for belonging. Escalation is clear for lyric mode, though the external risk remains more numinous than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear and tightens: play awakens beauty without triggering punishment. Escalation is earned via the statues stepping closer, the wrist‑reach, the gathered crowd, and the heart‑signal deepening. The locust mute is a tactical adaptation with consequences for tone and risk. Cost is mostly averted rather than paid, but tension operates at beat and sentence levels.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    The pressure coheres: carrying a volatile jar; Mina’s opening; the mirror’s directive; delivering the letter without proof. The tightening is a knowledge deepening rather than a hard foreclosing, but it narrows options toward an ethically risky action. Costs remain understated (no immediate reprisal), slightly softening impact. Nevertheless, the cadence shift around the jar’s opening and the final delivery earns resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reanimating the carousel without brute power—is clear early. Escalation tightens via the failed mechanical attempt and the discovery that “the train had been thirsting not for power but for voice,” which forces a different tactic (singing). Cost is understated but present in breaking his defining silence and assuming guardianship. The pressure is coherent and deepens rather than multiplies.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—find where stories live—tightens as the room opens and the map threatens to vanish without news. The key turn is agency-driven: she forgoes going deeper to preserve/translate the discovery for patrons. Stakes remain intimate but legible, with a real trade-off felt in the return. Pressure is coherent, if quiet, throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (how to pursue a dream without erasing it) is signaled early and tightens at the sea’s challenge. The key turn is the decision to shoot the seam then open the door—capturing hesitation but refusing possession. Cost is felt and forecloses a path (keeping/owning the dream). Tension rises in cadence and density rather than reversals, consistent with the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around the choice to risk voice; the tightening occurs when the mirrors “show the rooms where I had hid my wanting,” disorienting the guarding habit and narrowing options. The decisive act—singing despite the belief that the voice is a “cracked vessel”—pays a visible emotional price. Stakes remain intimate and internal, limiting visceral jeopardy, but the cadence shift at song delivers escalation under the chosen lens. Agency drives resolution rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering memories—tightens through a clear turn: admission to the ring in exchange for recollection. The live clock (tide turning) and spatial constraints escalate pressure, forcing triage: “I took what I could, not everything.” The price is unmistakable: a painful truth relinquished and partial, time-limited gain. Resolution grows from the protagonist’s agency rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (the library’s survival and the ethics of memory) is clear early and tightens when the council arrives with tapes and boots. Escalation proceeds through the protagonist’s tactics (serving tea, orchestrating the reading, moving the shadow to underline records). The price is vulnerability on the record; the win is partial (a stay, not absolution), preserving tension beyond the page. Slight softness: jeopardy feels assuredly containable, though still convincing at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure deepens through the seed’s demand for “where to be planted” and the child’s plea about “tired” apples, forcing a consequential choice. The dominant stake narrows to surrendering the heirloom for communal memory, with a visible trade‑off. Escalation is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens; the bell‑like release after pruning functions as a midpoint intensification. Slight softness in overt jeopardy keeps it from the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (ground the restless spirits) is active from the start; escalation accrues as each knot yields memory and some resist, culminating in the snapped line and near fall. The choice to persist and adapt (hymn, weighing, braiding joy with grief) narrows options toward an earned stasis. Costs are gently framed but present (drinking the room’s quiet; releasing “last sip of storm”). A single sharper trade‑off could have heightened the pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are quiet but coherent: uncover the chapel without violating its hush or the community’s trust. Escalation tightens through discovery and the ethical decision to wait for the village before opening. The price—choosing restraint, public stewardship, and preserving the wound—registers, though danger never spikes. One meaningful turn suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—listen/understand letting go under limited air—tightens once when the current tugs and the narrator answers, prompting a measured exit. The choice to remove and promise to “return [the globe] to light” forecloses a pure‑observer path. Prices are articulated as drift vs. weight and tallied in breath/time, scaled to length. Escalation is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—translating need so the city can breathe—is clear and tightens with the storm’s approach and the “cupped hands” need-signal. The meaningful turn is the plate‑harp and encoded map prompting real action (vents, standpipe). Pressure is coherent, but obstacles are soft; opposition is atmospheric more than contested, and the price is mostly in restraint/patience. Still, escalation by density and cadence reads purposeful under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres and tightens via cadence and discovery: each rise adds a functional layer (goggles → cipher → keys in refusals → shelves = absences). The decisive tightening is the recognition that the encryption resists despair, forcing a choice of curation over possession. Cost is primarily conceptual/emotional rather than peril‑based, but it meaningfully narrows options at the crest. A slight softness in external risk keeps stakes elegant but contained.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (find safe return while honoring a proof) is legible early. Escalation is modest but coherent: squall advances, radio silence gives way, choices steer around “recidivist jealousy,” and reconnection forecloses drift. The cost is contemplative rather than acute, which keeps tension elegant but gentle. Agency at the end (issuing headings via emotional taxonomy) earns resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (finish a sky that can endure the fall) is clear and coherently pressured by the countdown and missing recipe. Escalation arrives via two decisive tightenings: solving the coin/safe puzzle to acquire pigments, and the ticking demolition forcing “breath-thin” layers and a negotiated minute. The visible costs (time, pigment fracture boundary, bodily stillness) channel into an earned endurance. A sharper on-page risk of failure mid-paint (e.g., a real misstep that costs a layer) might have heightened the pinch.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—free and map the stranded luminance—tightens plausibly as the glow intensifies, the static rises, and the apprentice commits to a childlike code under real navigational risk. The request for the helmsman’s trust and the controlled figure‑eight provide the decisive tightening. The price—danger of entanglement, social risk, and bodily charge—is felt but not deeply scarring. Escalation is clean, if gently scaled.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative lens, pressure tightens when the mirrors show snowfall where his face should be, forcing the uncapping choice that changes options. He then adapts through specific craft corrections that steadily open the path. Stakes remain intimate but coherent: restoring time’s filing in this place versus letting it remain misaligned. Cost is conceptual and modest yet legible; escalation is subtle but present.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can a brambled group act as one?—tightens at the arch disaster and again with the decision to launch into the air‑river. Prices are visible: risk to twelve families, raw exertion, and the surrender of old quarrels, with agency distributed but legible in the narrator’s team choices. Escalation coheres under the signal system without coincidence resolving anything. A single decisive deepening—the unprecedented braided alarm—credibly narrows options and compels change.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (buying the world heartbeats) tightens as the needle leans and the mechanism stutters; the tangible bent tooth forces adaptation. The escalation peaks in the decision to transform warning into vow via song, risking failure to purchase poise. Internal and external pressures mesh (politics’ “thunder,” pane’s thrumming) without coincidence resolving anything. The price is endurance and the possibility that singing may not avert ruin.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (get them out before frost/patrol) is clear and tightens via early frost scent and patrol change. The seed‑lock moment is a satisfying tactical turn earned by prior beats. Cost is the protagonist’s renunciation of leaving, with the orchard’s “little” loosening as bittersweet payment. Slightly more friction inside the corridor could have heightened the price further.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes (atoning by redesigning and facing consequences) are clear and tighten when the foam insight converts to a plan with public costs. The turn from listening to committing (“I returned to the city… change the plant… lawsuits”) narrows options. External antagonism is mostly projected, but sufficient for this length under the accumulative lens. Internal/external threads interlock without forced reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are coherent: gain entry by quantifying absence to retrieve beginnings; the tightening occurs when counting absence reveals the hinge and demands an offering. Agency drives every beat—she maps, measures, pours, trades—and the price refines the outcome rather than arriving by coincidence. The pressure is quiet rather than acute, but the contractual condition (the lull) narrows options meaningfully. A slightly sharper sense of what failure would cost in the now would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure coheres around whether the protagonist will risk contamination to transform stored remorse. The tightening arrives when the coral touches the wrist, forcing a choice that narrows options and imposes cost. The decision to cook and feed the keeper pays off with a visible reconfiguration. Escalation is more deepening than reversal, but the cost is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres around rehabilitating the elevator and building literal bridges; escalation arrives with the first span’s lowering (counted in interlaced languages) and the elevator’s steadier voice. Stakes are communal rather than adversarial; the tightening is a cadence shift rather than a reversal, consistent with the lens. Costs (shared responsibility, work, weather) register but never bite hard. Still, agency clearly drives the deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—opening safe routes for old dreams—tightens through pulses, the colleague’s apparition, and the quake’s seam; the final split forecloses the salvage path. Escalation appears as density/reprise rather than adversarial turns, appropriate to the chosen lens. Cost is present (embracing fragmentation) but understated, keeping tension more meditative than fraught. Still, the cadence shift at the seam provides a clear deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (accessing and opening the “forgotten combinations”) tightens via the iron band’s selection, the safe’s attentional method, and the hour’s ticking limit. The refusal of ostentatious crowns in favor of the plain iron band is a credible narrowing with cost (time lost, seductive options declined). The decisive deepening is internal-agency driven: attention as currency to unlock dilemmas. Stakes remain intimate and conceptual rather than perilous, but pressure coheres and rises.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is coherent: conjure living music without violating the grove’s hush. Escalation is a deepening shift—abandoning a symphonic aim for a heartbeat, narrowing options to endurance/attention with a felt price. The tension is quiet but persistent; the jay’s aborted call and the hedgehog’s behavior calibrate pressure. No antagonistic force, but the internal trade‑off is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (restore balance/learn how beauty survives) is coherent and tightens via translating silences and seating the stone before moonrise. The visible price is non‑victory and exposure to judgment, with surrender as the climactic move. Escalation is more deepening than reversal, fitting the chosen lens, though a sharper on‑page consequence could heighten the squeeze. Still, the endgame pattern offers a clear narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is coherent: open the clasp and ethically continue the archive before the hush breaks. Pressure tightens via the ticking window and the self‑imposed constraint of non‑violence; the “click” is a decisive intensification. The cost is internal but legible (acceptance of a promise that will govern future work), though antagonistic pressure remains largely atmospheric rather than oppositional.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (stabilize motion) is clear and tightens: village restlessness → taboo object choice → controlled blooming → communal endurance. The decisive escalation is the bloom’s stink and the village’s forced sitting-with-it during the council. Costs are legible (social risk, physical revulsion, confronting grief) and the price reframes motion. It’s quiet but coherent, with one meaningful turn that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear early (find the source of resilience) and escalates as the narrator commits to the cathedral, risks contact, and must finish before gravity rights. The key tightening is the touch/fusion choice that forecloses mere discovery in favor of stewardship. Pressure remains lyric rather than visceral; cost is conceptual and ongoing, not acute, which keeps tension from cresting higher. Still, agency drives the turns and the resolution feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is clear and tightens when the child reports the failing generator, converting diagnosis into time‑pressured action. The investigator forecloses a live option (the usual approach) and imposes a cost in restraint and precision (“promise nothing,” “refuse” the corridor). Escalation remains coherent and agency‑driven, though the internal risk calculus stays cool rather than viscerally fraught. The quiet resolution feels earned under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are coherent—release/shape the hush to reweight how the world values wonder—and escalate through cadence: the initiating strike, architecture “rearranged like a flock,” and the decisive final tone. Cost is more devotional than perilous, but doubt and the demand for precision impose pressure. The tightening is clear at the first chisel strike and at the aurora’s slowed river; one meaningful intensification occurs. A slightly higher felt price or jeopardy would raise the band.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—repairing the breach to atone—tightens when the note “takes a path I did not choose,” forcing pursuit and adjustment. The major turn is the tempo change that relinquishes control and admits fault, with a visible effect (awnings exhale, murmur returns). Pressure coheres through the accumulative lens; coincidence complicates (the note remembers) but does not resolve. Emotional and technical costs converge credibly at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—ethical use of “transposed empathy” and the courage to own it—is clear and tightens through the couple’s commission and the proof’s effects. The key deepening is the self‑indicting confession that forecloses the path of hiding behind Maris. Costs remain mostly conceptual rather than materially punishing, but they’re felt. Escalation coheres under the chosen lens without needing reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.8)
    One dominant stake: enabling/containing a brief reunion under grief’s pressure. Escalation is a decisive intensification when the seeds germinate into a corridor; the courier must hold the pitch and then relinquish the miracle. The visible cost is letting it end and planting the yew (a foreclosing act). No coincidence resolves the conflict; it’s agency-driven under the taught method.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—winning a credible witness and extracting proof—tightens when the frost forms faces, then escalates with the prism’s green‑to‑blue flare and the handprint that forces Mara’s choice. The cost is legible in real time: her tremble, the name she wouldn’t say, the draining skepticism. Agency belongs to the narrator throughout, with Mara’s charged assent at peak. The pressure is quiet but coherent and accumulative; one decisive deepening is enough at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is clear and escalates via a density increase and cadence shift: from gathering tools to the fabric animating and crossing the river. Cost is legible (self‑thinning; loom empties; borders surrendered), and the burial act forecloses a path. Pressure remains coherent under the accumulative lens; the key tightening is the fabric’s breath/launch. Slight limitation: the conflict is almost entirely internal/ritual rather than opposed by a counter‑force on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (stabilize the town/orchards) is signaled early; pressure tightens with the storm and honest-oath test. The meaningful turn is the vow’s cost (memories, bruising) leading to arches settling and rubble becoming workable. Agency remains with Iven; the “Deliberate” tactic forecloses spectacle in favor of vowed exertion. Costs persist post-turn (fatigue, continued barter with mines), keeping consequence live.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake (discover and bear the withheld truth) is clear and tightens at the console replay until the decisive self‑implication. The cost is internal but legible: choosing memory over mercy, accepting that her act redirected lives. Escalation is a deepening of pressure rather than adversarial reversal, apt for the lens. The final choice forecloses the path of self-erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—maintaining a felt safety—tightens when the lamp dies, forcing makeshift measures and recommitment. Escalation is quiet but firm under the accumulative lens: stones for love, the unsentimental myth of the drowned keeper, and the skipper’s early arrival focus cost and choice. The final stance forecloses escape into numbness by embracing the ache as guiding light. Pressure remains coherent without coincidence solving anything.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—keep meaning and guidance alive—tightens via an accumulative escalation: ritual → storm dialogue → prophetic crate/child → newsroom of two → burning absence. The child’s arrival is the key deepening that raises responsibility and narrows options. Cost is endurance and vigilant care; the storm’s “edits” strip indulgence to verbs, which reads as pressure. There’s no sharp reversal, but the density increase credibly reweights the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (ethical handling of stories) tightens when the widow accrues “borrowed tales” that may burn, compelling the protagonist’s protective brew—a real adaptation. Pressure remains coherent under the accumulative lens, and the cost is an embraced discipline that forecloses greedy capture. The subsequent week’s practice meaningfully deepens, not diffuses, tension. Quiet but decisive intensification rather than a set‑piece reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—learning what trees witness/deconstructing grief—tightens with the hush → pin → root → excavation sequence. Agency drives turns, not luck: following the sound, aligning the crack, prying mortar, reading tags. The price is quieter (labor, vulnerability, acceptance of grief’s ledger) but felt and scaled to length. Escalation is a clear deepening rather than reversal, apt for the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (rekindling) is present from the start, and pressure tightens through the ledger’s requirement, the pivot to voice‑threads, and the revealed necessity to weave across the mirror. Agency drives turns (repurposing the window, recruiting communities, accepting shared scars). The price is not catastrophic but felt—control ceded, night not banished but bargained with. Tension operates at image and beat scale without soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes (can understanding reconfigure a damaging mistake?) tighten decisively when the man’s identity is revealed, forcing a stay/flee choice. The paired reading is a tactical response that deepens pressure and costs them the fantasy of reverting. Tension is quiet but coherent, with the refusal to reconcile into previous forms serving as the price. The escalation is measured rather than spiky, yet unmistakable under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (absolution vs. forgetting) tightens as the narrator moves from solitary ritual to shared witness and commits to sustained tending. The key deepening is the cashier’s entrance, which reframes the act from private solace to communal obligation, and the cost is refusal of clean exoneration. Pressure escalates texturally through ritual density, culminating in a stance that forecloses easy absolution. A touch more external resistance could have heightened price, but it’s not required at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—keep the archive breathing—tightens when the library demands a final binding clause. The mentor’s fracturing and the cracked slide escalate pressure and narrow options to a self‑sacrificial vow. Cost is clear: the protagonist becomes an entry, foreclosing a prior self. Escalation is driven by the narrator’s choices rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    One major tightening lands when Lark’s thwart of the cutpurse triggers the lime spill, forcing the Kettle–smuggler stare‑down under hush. Stakes are legible and coherent: risk of theft/exposure against the goal of capturing a rare sonic fracture. Cost is present but quiet (ethical and social rather than bodily), fitting the lens; a slightly sharper on‑page consequence could heighten the price. Agency drives the turn rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether belief can be grounded—tightens through Mirelle’s arrival, the walk toward quorum, and the tally where restraint wins. Agency is quiet but decisive: the narrator chooses proximity, trust in the emergent compass, and a new obligation. The cost is the surrender of solitary certainty for communal duty. Escalation is subtle yet clear under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming suppressed work/legacy—tightens when memory fails against the broken lock, forcing a new tactic consistent with her craft. The reversal (knowledge won’t open the box) creates pressure that her charcoal portraiture resolves, not by luck but skill reframed. The price reads as an ongoing obligation and exposure risk rather than a single dramatic loss, which slightly softens the edge. Still, escalation is coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth circulation vs controlled suppression—is signaled early and tightened by a concrete refusal (no more leaf‑post) that exacts social and practical cost. The mid‑story turn (secret archive) reframes pressure and sharpens the ethical calculus (“mercy…thirsty for consent”). The public gathering forces the postmaster’s stance change without coincidence solving it. The price is felt in the city’s dimming and the risk of defying infrastructure.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is clear: whether truth will be hardened into document or kept supple through resonance. Escalation tightens with the Keepers’ arrival and their claim on the shard, forcing Iri to choose demonstration over surrender. The resulting shift—Keepers relent—stems from her agency, and the lingering cost is the ongoing burden to “guard delight.” Quiet but unmistakable pressure throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (contain the roses’ thirst/system destabilization) and tightens with the hard click and polarity flip. The key turn is the decision to contravene system homeostasis via a controlled, mini burn that narrows options and carries risk in a glass dome. Internal and external pressures braid effectively, with the roses’ “desire” angling into the paths mirroring the narrator’s own need. The price is more conceptual than visceral but lands.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are legible early (listening as cure; mailbox mystery) and tighten with developer intrusion and the crew’s arrival. The choice to maintain hush and enlist the interlopers raises the price of the method, then the hairpin act consummates the build. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens rather than via reversals. The cost remains primarily emotional/communal but is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (free the names) is signaled early and escalates through the Warden’s warning and the “question” key that risks exposure. Agency is constant—dance, encoded hesitation, negative-space movement—and the turn forecloses open confrontation in favor of subversion. The price is mostly conceptual (risk, patience, self-effacement) rather than a visible loss, but it’s felt. The resolution stems from their chosen grammar of resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (retrieve a lost memory) tightens through the chemist’s divination and the grave‑robbing of the salt box; pressing the glass becomes the critical turn. Pressure grows coherently as gravity pockets become active hazards (“opens like an unscheduled mouth”). Explicit material cost is gentle, but risk and trespass are palpable and reconfigure options. Resolution stems from the protagonist’s choices, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are singular and legible: prevent “iron noon” by releasing the code. Escalation proceeds via density and a midpoint snag (“the code balked at vanishing”), prompting a tactical adjustment—measured breathing and attention guiding. The price is largely internal (patience, non‑triumphal restraint), credible for this mode, though not viscerally costly. The tightening is sufficient and earned under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes center on whether the narrator earns the building’s language and the ethic of its lies; pressure deepens via the forbidden question and the stamping act. The key tightening is the choice to interrogate and then to press the seal, accepting cost. Escalation is tonal and conceptual rather than adversarial, consistent with the chosen lens. The price is quiet but present: custody of truth and complicity.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is legible and tightens once: the negotiation with the quarantined memory forces a trade (“archive its winter”) that forecloses a path. Escalation is internal but real; the ethical calculus is clear and the one‑way bridge choice shows agency under pressure. The cost is explicit and alters the protagonist’s state going forward. Slight softness: external resistance is minimal, but the lyric lens supports this.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure coheres around one stake: completion versus merciful restraint. The meaningful tightening arrives as she chooses to leave the margin blank and replant the thorn, renouncing power; the cost is exile renewed and work left open. Escalation in the accumulative mode is a density increase and cadence shift rather than a reversal, and it reads. The ending’s stance crystallization is earned by prior beats (unlinking as mercy).

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—discovering why some people echo—tightens as Lio shifts from observation to rigorous testing, then stakes personal identity by singing the mother’s song. Pressure deepens through the nonverbal answers (“silence full of teeth,” stone refusing to breathe), culminating in a vow that forecloses a prior self-image. The cost is internal and legible; no antagonist is needed under the chosen lens. A whisper more friction in the middle could raise the squeeze, but escalation reads clean.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (expose the true cause to release the dead) is signaled early and tightens via the discovery and strategic handling of proof. The decisive deepening arrives with the music box “password,” followed by a public test against logs. Cost reads in the chosen method—foregoing accusation for ritualized proof—culminating in a quiet, un‑cheering outcome. A single on‑page reversal (company stepping out, foreman lowering eyes) is understated but effective.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure is quiet but coherent: crowd skepticism and the councilor’s push for fireworks oppose the narrator’s aim. Escalation arrives via demonstration beats (whistle → foam patterns → naming unseen labor → collective mending), narrowing the option of spectacle in favor of service. The visible price (relinquishing the whisk; social risk of a silent event) is legible. The piece favors deepening over reversal, appropriate to the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—survival and demystification—tightens via storm observation to technical proof to communal recalibration. The meaningful turn is the reveal of the resonator’s design and its retraining of tactics, culminating in the held storm. Costs are present (relinquished myth, social friction, refusal of the diamond) but not punishing. Tension is steady, not razor‑edged, yet coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clear early (weatherwork vs. town hunger/power) and tighten through Brin’s arrival and Knoll’s conditional support, culminating in the risky acceptance of a storm‑baptism and opening the portico. The prophet as pattern shifts options and drives the town’s re‑alignment. Costs are present but mostly conceptual/communal rather than concretely dramatized harm. Escalation is coherent and protagonist‑driven under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres through accumulation rather than antagonism: discovery of the box’s voice, bottling notes, and inviting the village tighten toward a single communal test. The visible price is gentle but legible: the narrator’s partial self‑erasure in favor of communal stewardship. The dawn event functions as a decisive intensification, not a coincidence that resolves. Stakes—bridging generational static—sharpen at the beach and resolve through action (opening jars, orchestrating harmony).

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is established early, and pressure tightens when the seeker arrives and Marek opens the lens, forcing a nonviolent gambit. The decisive test is the offered key, which narrows options and risks loss of control. Escalation is coherent under the chosen lens but remains hushed; the antagonist’s resistance ebbs quickly, softening the felt price. Still, the trade is clear and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres around how to meet “change” without panic; it tightens with the messenger’s question and the men’s ropes. The protagonist’s stance crystallizes as patience-as-action, tested by directing communal labor away from spectacle toward maintenance. Cost is quiet but legible; stakes remain community steadiness versus fear. Escalation is measured but purposeful under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—truthful attribution vs. institutional closure—tightens via supervisor messages and the algorithm’s bias. A clear escalation occurs when the narrator turns off radios and recommits to a noncompliant report and to retaining the lantern. Cost is felt (career/institutional pressure) and interwoven with the external (preventable deaths) and internal (family memory). Stakes stay coherent and focused without needless spread.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can care be translated into a sustainable practice—tightens at the discovery and extraction of the metal “thorn.” The cadence shifts decisively when the heart ticks and later when Jonah breathes with it, narrowing options to a repeatable, chosen practice (“choose again tomorrow”). The price is persistent discipline rather than a one‑time fix. Slightly soft external pressure, but coherent under the hybrid/accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear early, and escalation accrues via density and pattern: failed pass → recalibration (“hunger again”) → algorithm autonomy → hinge twitch. The decisive tightening is letting the algorithm choose speed, leading to the switch’s “kiss of metal.” Cost reads as earned patience, risk of relinquishing control, and the ache articulated by the bell. Stakes are inward rather than perilous, which keeps the ceiling just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.6)
    One dominant stake—restore a missing voice versus keep policy silence—is signaled early and tightened by the illicit access and the diary’s revelations. The lie to the bot and solving the lyric gate escalate pressure credibly and compress options. The legal/ethical trade-off at the end carries a visible risk. Stakes remain personal rather than cosmic, which fits the length.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is clear early (resolve theft-of-light feud without further loss). Escalation moves from evidence-gathering (mirrors) to a concrete plan tested by public challenge, tightening at the breath before reply. The price is refusal of certainty, social exposure, and the protagonist’s decision to remain and be accountable. A neat reversal is not needed; the cadence shift and foreclosed “verdict-only” path suffice.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (whether to meet the appointment) tightens via concrete pressures: child overboard and buoy snap/approaching storm. Escalation is textural, not twist‑driven; readiness and listening become tactics that foreclose the immediate oblivion path. The phone call cements a price—continued endurance and vigilance—earned by prior beats. Stakes remain coherent and felt without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (self-truth vs. relationship demand) tightens through the burned-edge reveal and the rootstock/heartstock frame, culminating in a negotiated boundary. The knife-and-twine offering is a concrete, narrowing choice that forces a trade-off. The price is conceptual but felt: she cannot apologize for loving rivers more; their meeting is conditional and costly. Escalation is quiet yet discernible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (preserving legible echoes) is clear and tightened by the midday wind and the shift to peripheral awareness. The stitch‑across‑gust beat and the “face away” tactic are decisive deepening moves that reweight options. Cost is endurance and disciplined quiet rather than loss, so danger reads controlled rather than precarious. One more concrete risk or near‑loss would heighten escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (“chart their grief”) is signaled early and tightened through staged acts (circle stories → mirror reveal → walking the route → final word offering). The material cost is subdued but legible in the trembling “places we have not named” and the protagonist’s solitary walk to face the ruins. Escalation is a cadence shift consistent with the lens rather than a causal reversal, yet it meaningfully reweights options. Earned resolution arises from the protagonist’s method and stance.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes consolidate around whether meaning can grow without new dictionaries and how he’ll testify. Escalation is a density increase: each card pulls older currents, culminating in a procedural decision to “play” the crystal for the printers. The tightening is modest but clear, foreclosing conventional speech. Prices are quiet—exposure, vulnerability, and the commitment to a nonverbal testimony—but present.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—locate and catch the midnote/echo of aging to orient a forgetful future—is stable and tightens via the rising tide, the humming filament, and the arrows’ clocklike rearrangement. He makes a decisive stance shift (asks only for accompaniment, accepts the reordering as permission). The price is the acceptance of disappearance and the need to reset markers for a self who won’t recognize them. Escalation is quiet but unmistakable under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—catching a faint lunar tremor against noise—tightens via the quake’s tiny misalignment and the chronometer’s “plea.” Escalation is a deepening of interpretation and calibration culminating in the quarter‑turn click to painful sharpness. Agency drives the turns; the price is endurance and relinquishing certainty, not a dramatic loss. Pressure remains coherent and grows to a meaningful cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—facilitating a flawless goodbye—tightens immediately with the “hours, maybe a day” clock. The therapist’s decision to call the son creates the major turn; the shard hand‑off and the father’s last breaths seal the cost. Pressure remains coherent and grows via accumulative songwork and the live medical cadence. Resolution is earned by action and renunciation, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres around compelling the impossible noon: arranging mirrors, narrowing the light seam, entering the noon‑within, then signing. Escalation is a deepening rather than reversal and is driven by the protagonist’s agency. The price is conceptual and bodily (consenting to a contract under the skin), not spectacle, but it tightens options credibly. A moment of jeopardy or failed attempt could have intensified the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—navigating truth/mercy under communal pressure—tightens when Ari appears injured and confesses, forcing the narrator to choose action and stance. The physical conflict of the shoulder and the moral conflict interlock, with a visible price in social exposure and personal shame. Escalation is coherent under the hybrid lens; one meaningful deepening is enough. Slight softness: the town’s threat remains implied rather than on‑page tested.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (safe light vs. village’s fear of fire) is clear and escalates via the patient making, communal stringing, and the tide‑driven activation. Pressure is quiet but coherent; the meaningful tightening is the shift from solitary polishing to communal display, risking failure without matches. The price is patience, labor, and a refusal of spectacle, reweighted against the brother’s “quick” star. Some readers may want a sharper on‑page risk, but the lyric deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are singular and early: how to meet after public betrayal without becoming spectacle. Pressure tightens with her entrance, the proffer, and the joint decision to bury rather than return; each step narrows options and exacts a price. The conflict remains internal/relational yet advances tangibly through consent queries and renunciations. The cost—relinquishing the pendant and choosing practice over absolution—is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around one dominant stake: integrity vs. market compliance. Escalation reads as a purposeful deepening—the mist opens, artifacts arrive, the protagonist wades in, and chooses the river. The price is implied (turning from market structures) rather than viscerally tested, keeping the tightening subtle. Still, the pact moment and renunciation are earned and narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (restore rites before the harvest moon) is signaled early, and pressure tightens via the live clock and rehearsal until silence becomes a “tool.” Escalation arrives as density and cadence shift when the moon rises, the tendril glows, and the ritual effects manifest. The price is felt in endurance and communal discipline rather than jeopardy; no hard reversal, but the deepening is clear for the chosen lens. Stakes resolve through collective action guided by Rowen’s method.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—restoring a navigable path for the living—is clear early and tightens through the choice to spend starlight and later to “seal the seam.” Pressure coherently deepens rather than reverses, appropriate to the accumulative lens. Cost is legible (exposure, finite light, leaving breadcrumb glass) and the sealing move forecloses stasis by teaching the breath to travel. A single pronounced reversal is absent, but the decisive intensification suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around the aim to capture and portion echoes; it deepens through failure (slipped spring), discovery (the hollow), and the renunciatory choice to leave the timer. Stakes are conceptual but legible, with a visible price in relinquishment and rationing resonance “like grain in a lean year.” Escalation remains gentle rather than tense, yet the narrowing of options reads. Agency drives every key turn.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    Pressure coheres and tightens as public burdens cede to the private, with a mid‑scene deepening (soldier’s name that can’t be lifted alone) and a peak test (the narrator’s own fear). The decisive tactic—orienting—costs honesty and posture; the weaver’s touch nudges but doesn’t solve, preserving agency. Stakes are internal but legible, shifting from competence to vulnerability. The piece resists melodrama and earns its quiet turn.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—how to hold grief without fixing it—is signaled early and deepens under the kettle’s ticking pressure. The turn tightens at the knot decision and culminates in the renunciations (not restoring the tag; leaving the tin shut) with a felt price. Escalation is textural but coherent: steam builds, whistle blooms, then a quieting that enables her decisive stance. The cost is internal, visible through restrained action.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—securing an authentic truce with the self‑ghost—is pressured coherently: the ghost rejects rehearsed bargains, demands verbs, and the narrator must pay in regret and endurance. The tightening arrives with the demand set (“admit, forgive, rebuild, stay”), which narrows options and imposes cost. Resolution is earned by agency, not chance. Slight softness in external jeopardy, but internal stakes carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes center on resurrecting function for community need; pressure tightens via actionable fixes, a wary janitor, and the mother’s arrival, culminating in an earned quiet readiness. Tension is gentle but cumulative; the key deepening is aligning intention (intern + janitor) which reconfigures the maze into a workable plan. The cost is present as sustained labor and redefined ambition, though it could bite harder. No undercutting coincidence; agency drives resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are internal but coherent: make peace with the abandoned dream. Pressure tightens via the vow, the unheard bell, the finch’s “conductor” pose, and the apology carried along crystal seams, leading to a stance that forecloses rebuilding. The cost is quiet yet felt as surrender of a grand ambition to a sustained companionship with ache. Escalation is a cadence shift rather than reversal, fitting the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are coherent—retrieve evidence to counter institutional lies—and the tightening arrives with the on‑page haul and the ledger’s implication of the engineer. Escalation remains quiet but accumulates pressure: find → read → implicate self/family → confront. The price is primarily conceptual and relational; physical danger is implied rather than dramatized, keeping intensity a notch below peak. Resolution is earned by stance and alliance rather than victory.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—earning and preserving method and trust—tightens through the resisting splice and the obligation to prove the braid. The decisive deepening is the test with fir seeds, which could fail and would betray mandate or rope. Cost is quiet but legible: time, restraint, risk of damaging the working line, and responsibility taken in another’s absence. Escalation remains coherent under the textural lens, if softly contoured.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—naming a living absence—tightens as the narrator moves from request to crossing to composition to transfer of the thread. The “because/therefore” is lyric but coherent: hiring → projection → encounter → document → reconfigured domestic path. Costs are felt (salt/brass in breath; the woman’s irrigating weep), though the pressure remains gentle rather than harrowing. The earned stasis—acceptance without return—forecloses a prior need (setting a second cup).

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes (reawaken beauty vs. mechanical dominion) are active early and tighten through the cradle build and the storm catalysis. The decisive beat (egg hatching into a third thing) forces a costly stance shift: renounce conquest, declare caretaking. Escalation is protagonist‑driven, with the environment amplifying pressure. Minor softness: external resistance is limited, keeping the price mostly conceptual/social.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—proving “scars can sing”—tightens as ritual turns to action with the boy and the graft. The meaningful turn is the sacrifice of the thread and the teaching moment that reframes harm; cost is emotional and talismanic rather than peril‑driven. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens; however, escalation remains gentle, edging toward meditative rather than urgent. Still, the narrowing of options (to act, to not scold) reads clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (restore names/memories without erasing them) is signaled early and sharpened by the broker’s tempting shortcut. The refusal forecloses a live option with social and temporal cost, and patience becomes a tactical constraint (waiting for geese). Pressure builds coherently via successive “unstickings,” not static repetition. Consequences (slow trickles, incremental restorations) recalibrate the path forward.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clean: convert fire‑logic to resonance without harm. Pressure tightens when travelers “do not always listen,” forcing a pedagogical demonstration that requires them to cut burn and submit to the garden’s language. The cost is humility and relinquishment, with the narrator’s ongoing discipline. Escalation is quiet but decisive and consistent with the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—carving language that can hold grief—tightens when the father asks for “words strong enough to hold the date.” Agency surfaces in offering the ribbon and adjusting carve depth as his hand steadies. Under the accumulative lens, escalation arises from density and restraint rather than reversal, with a felt price in pared ornament. The storm and migration deepen pressure without resolving it conveniently.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (restoring shared balance) is signaled early and tightens through the high‑risk hold at the pendulum’s crest. The decisive deepening is the maintained stillness used to re‑tune mechanics and ethics, then tested in the encounter with the fisherman. The cost—accepting less rigid precision and owning past harm—reads on the page. Tension runs continuous rather than twisty, appropriate for the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is coherent and tight: find the truth the widow hid. Escalation arrives through deepening knowledge (border grammar → missing grave → sacks → confession), with the gardener’s choices steering each turn. Visible costs are soft-focus (moral and custodial rather than peril), which keeps tension elegant but modest. The end forecloses the option of comfortable ignorance by publicly marking the truth.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—design an archive that innovates within constraint—is clear from the outset. Escalation deepens via tested alternatives, then a hinge compromise that forecloses purist options and assumes a stewardship cost. The bead “rain” test makes pressure concrete; fear of misuse complicates the plan and prompts remedial structures. The ending’s poised pen confirms commitment under limits rather than a risk-free flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake—reviving story—tightening when the broadcast asks “payment in kind.” The protagonist’s agency (promise, concealment, disciplined pacing) resolves the tension with a visible cost: secrecy and ongoing duty. Escalation is quiet but decisive; the “payment” beat reweights all prior listening. Stakes remain intimate and artistic, not life‑threatening, which caps intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure increases coherently: need for permission, decision to use the letters, commitment to unlabeled display, and the public test with visitors. The decisive deepening is the mother’s tacit complicity and the audience’s reactions, culminating in the chair’s uncanny motion and final cessation. Stakes remain intimate but real—risking exposure without naming—and the cost is acknowledged. Escalation is quiet but unmistakable under an accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (avert immediate flood) is clear and tightens with a live clock. The arrival of the three claimants concentrates pressure, and the water’s rise on the narrator’s chalk literalizes escalation. The solution is protagonist‑driven and forecloses a path (lying, symbolic co‑optation) with a visible price in social capital. A single decisive tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—braiding divided voices—tightens through the rehearsal to performance arc. The key pressure point is the Rafi–Ola face‑off reoriented by the rosette and rests; later, the audience’s suspicion/hope “taps” align. Costs are quiet but legible: relinquishing anger’s timing and risking public imperfection. Escalation is accumulative rather than adversarial yet narrows options toward shared silence.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—defy prohibition to cultivate a healing fruit—tightens as pruning demands sacrifices and the ordinance is invoked. The meaningful deepening is the pruning sequence, where each cut carries memory-cost and narrows what the tree (and community) will hold. Resolution grows from the protagonist’s agency in serving the soup to neighbors. External pressure could be sharper on the page, but the gentle rebellion frame still produces a credible price.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—restore the hive network without losing ritual—tightens via the riddle gate and the compelled reveal. Escalation is gentle but present: from gatekeeping to collaboration under live lightning; the decisive intensification comes when the tower’s “first lightning breath” demands action. The price is a relinquishing of guardianship to efficacy. No major reversal, but deepening aligns with the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (to discern house‑aliveness) is clear, and pressure tightens via resistant House Two and revelatory House Three. Escalation is a pattern deepening rather than a clash, consistent with the lens. Costs are understated, centered on responsibility and ritual rather than loss, which slightly softens the sense of price. Still, the beetle‑tin restitution narrows options and reweights the inquiry.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—whether to recode the city’s response from panic to deliberation—tightens through the threading journey and the scholar’s pushback. The decisive act (breaking the ampoule) deepens stakes by diffusing time and risking paralysis or misunderstanding. Pressure is coherent under the accumulative lens; the price is the embrace of delay under scrutiny. Escalation is subtle rather than jagged, but it registers.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving the missed opportunity’s texture—tightens when the rupture opens and tempts a shortcut. The refusal to step through forecloses a live option and asserts a costed stance. Agency drives escalation via biased rolls, lemma‑placing, and the final renunciation. Pressure coheres without soft resets, culminating in a conceptual but legible price.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear early (will kindness translate?) and tightens when the neighbor arrives with the map, validating and enlarging her project. Escalation is a deepening rather than a reversal, culminating in the ritual final dot and a communal tea—earned stasis more than a high-cost pivot. Prices (fatigue, vigil, anonymity) are present but understated. Coherent pressure, modest cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving names/arts against dissolution—is present from the outset and tightens through the lens rule revelation to the risky waterfall rite. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation (proposing the bread method, choosing what survives, staging the test). The stranger’s arrival risks convenience but reframes only a secondary tension (murder rumor) without solving the central pressure. Cost is visible in assuming the lens and instituting vows that bind the community.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is clear early; pressure escalates as the yoyo initiates the mechanism, the script resolves, and futures with costs are revealed. The tightening forecloses one path (stepping through) in favor of another (choosing the keeper) with visible price. Internal and external pressures interlock; the keeper’s call converts temptation into a moral calculus. No reversals wasted; the single deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Pressure coheres and tightens through the plan’s execution: opening the mouth, staging the paradox, baiting fear, then sustaining the unblinking gaze for the flash. The decisive turn is the shadow gagging on “door” and confessing what attention does to it. The on‑page cost is primarily psychological exposure; the external threats feel controlled by competence, shaving a bit of danger. Still, escalation is clean and protagonist‑driven.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—keep the orchard alive—tightens through specific turns (counter‑D, bee swarm, perforated tower, knife net). Each adaptation narrows options and alters tactics; the tower moment is a clear escalation pivot. Consequences are felt in tilt, swarm, and deck danger, though no lasting loss is paid. Resolution arises from the protagonist’s deliberate re-framing rather than luck.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.0)
    One dominant stake—seek an answer at personal risk—tightens through tangible turns: the crack → mother’s tag; ledger → lattice grammar; watchers turning → corridor of glare. The final decision forecloses retreat, with cost implied as annihilating measurement. Internal/external threads braid (duty to city vs. drive to ask). Escalation is clean and unbroken under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. town-stabilizing lies—is signaled early and tightens as evidence reframes “shipments.” The decisive turn is the narrator’s commitment to publish and deliver the ledger, rejecting “noble lies.” Cost is present but mostly conceptual; no antagonistic pushback appears on page, slightly softening pressure. Still, the internal/external conflict interweaves convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres and tightens via access and time: the river calms post‑bridge, the sealed door must be wrested, and the descent culminates in the “deepest room.” The felt price is endurance and invisibility, sharpened by the refusal of spectacle (“heat without spectacle”). The move from survey to custodial care (program retrieval, names copied, final slip) is a clear deepening consistent with the chosen lens. Stakes stay singular and legible: to witness and ledger absence.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—truth of origins versus rehearsed myth—is live and tightens through evidence reversals (minutes reveal imports, not weather). Escalation is cumulative rather than confrontational, appropriate to the lens, with one decisive deepening when the registrar’s margin reframes the city’s fate. Cost is mostly conceptual and vocational, not bodily or social on‑page, but it reweights options (secrecy, preservation). The final concealment forecloses the cathartic reveal path.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is explicit early and pressure coheres via ritual steps: craft → vision rupture → offering → shadow’s test. The key tightening is the nave release where his expectation is tested and he accepts a partial, costly outcome. Agency drives escalation; coincidence doesn’t resolve. Stakes stay intimate but consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes (locate and read unused potential without collapsing the hush) are signaled early and deepen as the sky “bruises green” and the basin forms. The protagonist’s agency drives the turn (running the perturbation, sending coordinates “like a dare”), and the cost is ethically and bodily legible. Escalation is a single decisive intensification rather than multiple reversals, appropriate to the lens. The commander pressure is implied rather than on‑page, slightly softening the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres around decoding belonging under mounting constraints (resistant dome, missing vowels, algorithmic failure). The decisive tightening is the reinterpretation of absence as rests, which reweights options and unlocks the cadence. Stakes remain intimate and conceptual rather than perilous, limiting felt cost. Nonetheless, escalation is driven by the narrator’s agency and culminates in a new tactic that resolves the impasse.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (naming the withheld truth and its cost) is clear from the outset and tightens at the shore. The planks create an escalatory cadence culminating in the watch hand’s revaluation and the protagonist’s costly choice to burn his ledger. Pressure coheres without coincidence solving problems; internal and external conflicts interweave. The price—reputation and livelihood—registers in the act and its restrained emotional aftermath.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—safe, principled exchange—tightens credibly at the name‑snag; soldiers’ held breath sharpens the moment. The negotiator’s agency drives resolution through reframing and the charged object. Costs register in endurance, restraint, and the grain concession. A second, sharper test or trade‑off could have intensified pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (align heart and action) tightens when the boy appears, forcing a choice that forecloses retreat. The rescue sequence provides a concrete test with coherent stakes and a visible emotional price. Escalation is modest but sufficient at this length; the eelgrass grounding and channel threading deepen pressure credibly. Cost is felt more internally than externally, but it clearly charges the end.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is legible early—whether to cleanse or shoulder responsibility—and escalates through the warming ball forcing confession. The pivotal tightening forecloses an escape option at the end (leave with cleaner hands vs. stay to ferry). Internal and external pressures braid well, with the caretaker applying situational pressure (“pay with risk, not with lies”). Cost is felt without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is clear early and tightens meaningfully when the orchard names the price. The choice to accept metamorphosis forecloses a significant path (losing “plain speech,” identity contours) and reweights the relationship. Pressure coheres without antagonist, driven by ritual and cost. The beats escalate cleanly to the decisive acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (recover/atone for lost time) is signaled early and deepens at the chamber of stalled seconds. The required rite (place a card on each second and name the missing action) forces costly confessions that narrow options from longing to atonement. The choice not to foretell but to locate where to kneel forecloses an easier path (prediction/control) for a harder one (ongoing repentance). Pressure coheres without needing an antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is clear and tight: open the dimension without violating pacifist ethics. Pressure coheres and deepens through one meaningful tightening: calibrating affect to weight while integrating shadow work to avoid both flight and sink. The door’s demand for a story adds an on‑page test that narrows options and exacts a price (vulnerability, grief integration). Resolution is earned through sustained restraint rather than a single wrenching turn, fitting the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—defusing communal panic—tightens through pattern: arranging light, listening to tremor tempo, gathering townsfolk into safe positions. The escalation is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens, culminating in the mountain’s gentle exhale and coordinated, practiced actions. Cost is more conceptual/emotional than visceral, but it’s legible in the relinquishing of the collection and refusal of myth. A slightly soft middle jeopardy keeps it just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear—transform spectacle to hearth—and pressure coheres through the stealthy traversal and clandestine adjustments. The meaningful tightening occurs with Captain Rhun’s entrance, testing resolve and legitimacy. Resolution derives from the protagonist’s stance and persuasion, not coincidence. However, Rhun’s quick assent reduces the bite of the trade‑off and the sense of jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—rescue with an ethical price—is signaled early and tightened when understanding requires participation. Escalation is earned: sequences invert, spiral becomes a door, then the sacrifice condition is revealed and accepted. Agency drives turns (the narrator agrees, braces the aperture, commits to continue). The visible price (herder’s tethering) unmistakably lands.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes concentrate on voice reclaimed vs. silence; escalation accrues via ritual: initiating the timer, speaking the forbidden poem, the lineage reveal, the charged pause at the thunder crest, and the final recommitment. Pressure tightens through the “when masks slip” window and the ethical demand to read harm and “refuse” it. Costs remain conceptual/emotional rather than materially foreclosing a path, but the charged poise is credible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—resurrect the outlaw library before identity molts and demolition arrives—is clear and tightens through the map reveal, community arrival, and the active rebuild. Pressure escalates by density/cadence rather than adversary; the siren grazes but doesn’t intervene, so opposition is soft. Still, the choice to continue, expose the map, and “practice until dawn” forecloses retreat with risk. The cost is more existential than immediate, which trims peak intensity slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—bend the timetable without breaking it—is signaled and tightened by the horizon clock, ebbing tide, and the station’s live schedule.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is clear and tight: plant the seed before monsoon to safeguard memory.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (recovering/embodying apology) tightens as the lace instructs a clockwise walk and the compass pulls to the cove.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve songs vs risk trust—is signaled early and tightened when the attic is to be cleared. One meaningful deepening: the decision to send Lark with the meteorite and hymn slips forecloses the option of keeping the songs safe in the attic.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“learn the rhythm of belonging”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when the algorithm demands an honest answer; the shared exhale micro-turn narrows options from intrusion to consent.

No external antagonist needed; the law’s absence is pressure enough.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“illuminate value in the mundane”—is signaled early and tightens through the escalating threat of erasure by development. The single deepening (salvage the ferry boards) narrows options and carries visible cultural cost.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: translating pain into legible form. Escalation is one deepening: from solitary bearing of the box to joint repair and future communal teaching.

Pressure tightens when the mother refuses to touch the box until they open it together.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore village wakefulness—tightens when the gauge locks at an unseen angle, foreclosing further trial-and-error.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: persuade mirrors to show possibility–intensifies each beat (rejection→instruction→image of citrus & shared hands). Micro turn at instruction moment; cost legible when hospital pallor yields, stakes deepen without external reversals. Stakes internal and driven by agency.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—how to price redemption—escalates through direct argument (“penalty without horizon is a prison”), micro-choices (redrafting clauses), and visible cost (general’s fatigue). Each turn is driven by protagonist agency and culminates in the ritual weighing of casings.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—audible preservation vs. ecological guilt—tightens once through the egg’s dissolution and the chamber’s hum. Escalation is accretive: each archival birdcall layers pressure until the final slackening. Cost is visible in the egg’s vanishing and the sting of salt. Agency remains his throughout; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: free collective voice vs. palace conformity; pressure escalates single beat “guard patrol arriving” narrowing timeframe; cost visible as bowl set and grate click; no secondary reversal, but single tightening suffices at 600-word scale.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether ethical storytelling can survive exploitative method—is signaled in the argument and tightened when Sorin vows to “remove my fingerprints.” The woman’s demand turns the punchline back on power, forcing a visible trade-off: applause is forfeited for shared authorship. Cost is legible in the final hush.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: honoring undocumented keepers before erasure. Escalation is textural: each fragile structure increases the felt cost of impermanence.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“preserve forgotten names”—escalates through each braid turn and organ breath; every shift narrows the field of action and layers cost, culminating in renunciation/sustained attention rather than ringing resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“why paths choose walkers”—tightens when the archive’s map steadies into a corridor. The storm’s approach is a live clock that forces the decisive step; cost is the forfeiture of shelter and certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: keep the arithmetic alive between regimes. Escalation is textural—each discovery (tile, urn, disk) tightens obligation. Cost is explicit: perpetual oil and hours. No coincidence; every complication is mined from the palace’s bones.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—resentment’s release—is signaled early and tightened through shifting grace that forces Rell to re-experience the factory memory. The micro-turn occurs when silence forms music inside his ribs; the cost is the unspent years he kneels to return to the floor.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—prevent the dream from severing district from city—is signaled early and tightened through each mirrored corridor and breath count.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—pursue forbidden knowledge—tightens when rule “ask with your lineage” forces curator to risk identity. One meaningful deepening: choosing the dullest fruit after seeing aunt’s self-archiving. Cost is the cameo’s burn and the promise to return, foreclosing retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—finding the library—tightens through each gap discovered and each rescue offered. The meaningful turn is the collective act of speaking errors kindly, which opens the shelves; the cost is the admission of fallibility. Pressure escalates via pattern accumulation rather than causal reversals, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—find the garden—tightens when the voice demands unsaying names; each narrative thread spoken forecloses the twin discoverer.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—restore excised history—tightens when the doorway’s brightness waxes/wanes with rope crossings. One decisive escalation: pressing seal to ribbon reconfigures the treaty, foreclosing the option to leave history lost. Cost is the archivist’s partial exile (he stays on the landing).

    Single dominant stake—selfhood carved from collective memory—tightened by archivist’s micro-choice to speak her own plum-taste memory in rain.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—rekindling collective hope without speech—tightens when the no-stars hush becomes literal pressure. Each mortar placement is a micro-choice that forecloses silence; the final comet’s green hush is the decisive intensification with visible cost (ash on children’s hands).

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether to leave the coast—is signaled early and tightens through textured reflection. The pause itself escalates pressure; the decision forecloses the tidal life with visible relational cost. No reversals, but one decisive intensification suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—collecting a silence the father can understand—tightens when the gilded hush is rationed and shared. The cost is visible: widening bunker entrances sacrifices the father’s original fortress logic.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is “teaching the girl to breathe without apology”; pressure tightens once when the girl’s gaze seeks permission to vanish and the keeper denies by stillness, then a cadence shift as the girl steps through unescorted. Cost is visible (keeper left alone scar-ready), sufficient under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—keep the quantum promise or lose crop and self—is signaled early and tightened once: the backward-text chorus forces the 90° turn and console signature. Cost crystallizes in the edible diamonds and dissolved debt. Agency drives escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether to perpetuate or end the dynasty—tightens when the ash confession reveals the dynasty’s self-planned mercy. One meaningful deepening: the “bridge of intuition” becomes a literal map of retreat. Cost is visible: the protagonist forfeits the ancestral seal and accepts public shame. Escalation is coherent under the Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“capture the shape of possibility”—is tested when he must choose one future and release the rest. Escalation is accretive: each grafted star narrows infinity to the single pulsing kernel. Cost is legible in the swallowed futures and the theater bells’ toll.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restoring erased voices—tightens once: the key turns, the lagoon answers, the museum’s authority begins to quake.

Pressure coheres under causal lens without coincidence-driven rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent the prophecy’s completion—tightens with every new glistening letter.

The price—perpetual exile from memory and mentor—is legible in the ash-scented coat.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—decoding prophecy without haste—tightens once when the sorter delays the reach, then again when monuments must ground the future.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—integrate laughter into healing—is signaled early and tightened only once when the woman fears betrayal.

    Dominant stake—finding the mathematics of mercy—escalates through embodied pressure: each step tests the ratio of intention to harm. One tightening beat: knotting the strap forecloses further harm. Cost is visible in the forest’s dimming to “normal green.”

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recovering an erased name—is signaled in the third paragraph and tightened when the lens reveals the hidden child.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“keep the living honest”—is signaled early and escalates only once, fitting the 600-word scope. Choice to unwind spring pays perceptible cost; the silence that follows is an earned alteration rather than coincidence resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.1)

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    A single escalating question—was the court cruel spectacle or communal craft?—tightens through accumulating storm-readings until the cost of belief is (literally) a vibrating shard and career exile. Each reading stakes more: authority, reputation, then the shard itself. Agency remains high; coincidence never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.3)
    Single, dominant stake “recover the city’s light” intensifies scene-by-scene: each truthful admission tightens negotiation, and each echo of lullaby debt raises personal price until the final binding of listening leaves no option but to uphold vigilance—the cost is visible in perpetual shadow labor.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“to find the place where explanations fail”—tightens through each psychometry reading; the final refusal of explanation crystallizes stance with felt cost. Agency is interior but decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—how to build passage when all signposts vanish—tightens steadily as the storm and the lantern’s vision narrow options. Each driftwood choice becomes an irreversible structural cut; shell talismans teach the wind new manners—visible prices. Causality stays intact: every escalation flows because wood, tide, and vision jointly disallow retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—why flowers bloom at night—tightens through accumulating sensory evidence rather than external opposition. One deepening: the realization that night is “the gentlest daylight” reconfigures the artist’s task from depiction to portal-making. Cost is felt in the inherited loneliness the postcards reveal. No external antagonist; pressure is situational and internal, coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—truth versus silence—tightens when clerk delivers stenograph punches; each punch is a lost syllable now reclaimed. Escalation is density increase: debris pattern → diary heat → clerk arrival → signatures. Cost is public exposure of vanished bodies; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—archive or spare the future child—signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened by the prophecy’s warning. One decisive turn: the scribe releases the stylus, accepting unrecorded mercy. Cost is the orchard’s uncertain future and the scribe’s self-imposed silence.

    Dominant stake—custody of seasons via vortex—tightens once when the keeper must release Return into the cap. Cost is legible: relinquishing exclusive guardianship. Agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to warn or listen—tightens once when the corridor stalls and the bell is chosen over sirens. Escalation is atmospheric but coherent under Accumulative lens; the cost is the audible restraint that replaces blaring decisiveness. No reversals, but one decisive deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—keep unspoken witness safe—intensifies as the queen-ghost demands the archive hold heat; escalation is visible in reopened lid and glowing frame.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to live faithfully when numbers fail—tightens through each impossible item posted; the deepening is the shift from solitary keeper to communal calendar. Cost is the unending vigilance of “waiting tasted like cedar.”

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to hold loss without erasing it—tightens when the kite string snaps. Escalation is textural: each loop drawn in sand deepens the boy’s breathing and reweights the silence. Cost is visible in the relinquished kite and the poet’s spent ink.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—fostering interspecies respect before death—is signaled early and tightened through each beat. The remodel’s rhythm escalates under Accumulative lens; each new relationship (otters, herons, children) narrows the caretaker’s remaining options. Cost is visible in afternoon fatigue and the final relinquishment.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can ritual simulate return without nostalgia?—tightens once when the basin reaction yields scent and pulse, foreclosing the institute’s data-only goal. Cost is felt in the narrator’s acceptance of immeasurable “patience.” Agency drives the final stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—bridging distance to sister—clarifies early and escalates as the cylinders’ riddle forces action. One meaningful tightening: raising leaf at final light is irreversible; it either works or the promise fails.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—finding a personal true north after catastrophe—tightens once when the constellations misalign and the protagonist chooses to layer sketches rather than fix a single bearing.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—mending the dissonant sky—tightens through each swap; the cost is the thief’s catalog of future restitution. One deepening turn: the queen’s letter reframes the entire quest as pre-ordained yet still requiring consent. Agency remains with the thief throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—archiving small gestures against erasure—is signaled early and tightened by each spelled word; the final refusal to await “kings” forecloses spectacle in favor of witness. Cost is visible in the relinquished board and the dispersal of the gathered strangers.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens through each tug on the tapestry threads; the incremental release method forces a trade-off between instant absolution and ethical pedagogy, with visible price paid in ashes tasted after wrong pulls.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“price of forgiveness”—tightens when canyon demands per-speaker tribute, forcing artist to double-pay.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—keep the hidden promise or vanish into copies—escalates through each sensory intensification. The wrong-turn oasis forces the decisive micro-choice: add one brushstroke and leave, paying with permanent exile from the self-painted world.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—decode the stranger’s gesture—tightens when the notch reveals its history, foreclosing the option to ignore. Escalation is textural: each sensory layer (knock pattern, remembered girl, lantern swing) increases the weight of witness. Cost is felt in the salt-packet and the swept-clean shrine. Agency is observational yet decisive; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will the narrator cross the doorway or retreat?—is signaled early and tightened by rising water and mirrored futures. One decisive turn: stepping into overlap forecloses map-bound safety with visible wet cost. Escalation is coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—steady the father’s fear—tightens when the screw is fitted and the clock’s new rhythm becomes permission rather than ruler.

    Dominant stake—threading scars into letters—escalates under literal storm countdown. Cost manifests: breath burns, facets of fear reflect back, stance crystallizes into earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—deliver apology and earn forgiveness—tightens when the stylus demands action, not absolution. Agency is active: the phone call to the foreman is a decisive escalation that forecloses safe retreat. Cost is visible: the column’s publication will end the narrator’s career. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the stalled truck is a rumor’s mechanical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—binding memory without lying—tightens through each spiral circuit, but the escalation is more accretive than sharply tested; the cost is diffuse, felt as surrendered certainty rather than a single forfeiture that narrows live options.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—teach the farm (and herself) permeable vigilance—is signaled early and tightens through each sensor recalibration.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—how to teach risk without ruin—tightens when the theorem stub forces a choice between inherited thrill and stewardship. One meaningful deepening: the lantern’s note “Check your priors” reframes prior examples into curriculum. Cost is felt in the quiet boarding of the bus.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“teach endings how to begin”—escalates via densifying loops until the elevator crisis narrows to a single switch-flip; felt cost exists for Rojo/Flora, but Mara’s stake pays off conceptually more than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can small moments be preserved against erasure—tightens when the man’s silhouette appears; escalation is situational pressure crystallizing stance. Cost is the archivist’s self-exclusion and the woman’s unspoken risk. One decisive turn suffices.

    Dominant stake—cure loneliness via reciprocity—tightens through each ladle, postcard, and returned thermos.

    Stakes signal early ("bridge of love") and pressure deepens through the choice to tap donor memories with felt cost of "brine violin" weight.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—prove whispers outrun shouts—is signaled early and tightened once: Rade’s acceptance of the wager raises social stakes, then the gate’s silent opening forces Rade’s concession. Cost is Rade’s loss of face; no external coincidence resolves the search.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—how to keep the brother’s darkness from winning—tightens through each reflected syllable. Escalation is accretive: each shutter pattern raises the emotional ante until the mirror’s beam becomes a narrow road the narrator must walk. Cost is felt when shame “tried retreating.”

    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    One dominant stake—how to honor grief in a surveillance state—tightens when the inspector visit forces tactics, and again when the staged dish-without-audio becomes the decisive choice.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—honest listening without spectacle—tightens through each station; the volunteer’s grief becomes the pressure test, and the narrator’s renunciation of destination crystallizes the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—permission to feel honestly—tightens when the narrator refuses to bargain for purity and later refuses to publish. Each refusal forecloses a path with visible cost (loss of safe bread, loss of citation). Agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“preserve the shape of hope”—is signaled early and tightened once: the library’s jealousy threatens balance until Mira trades her private futures. Agency is hers; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. Cost is felt in the emptied dream-casing glowing like unbuilt rooms.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—rebuilding trust after fraud—is signaled early and tightens when the handler chooses radical transparency over further spin.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—learning the forest’s grammar to understand one’s own translocations—is signaled early.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: can Rafi convert trauma into sustainable care without denial?

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake: coast disintegrating into devouring silence. The tightening is monotonic but potent; each test widens the personal price of guardianship, culminating in the demand to become permanent listener.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    One dominant stake: can observation alone change the world? Each turn escalates—call ➔ wager ➔ phones stay silent ➔ markets stall—costing her both innocence and profit. Shutters going dark is a “visible price paid” that alters later tactics and ideology. No coincidence used to rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—how to honor grief without re-arming harm—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened twice: first when the boy asks for a non-burning name, then when the plaza demands a “difficult naming” for the arsonists.

    Dominant stake—retrieving lost words without force—tightens through each wand pass and static nip. Agency remains joint yet legible; the final stilling of the rig forecloses further attempts.

    Dominant stake—reestablish harmonic guidance before trunks spark—is signaled early and tightened through each node adjustment. Escalation is Accumulative: each tablet pressed, each vowel tuned increases density until the rails answer.

Pressure escalates through pattern break: the rupture offers literal exit, forcing the decisive refusal that forecloses escape. Cost is the perpetual climb itself, paid on the page. Agency drives every intensification; coincidence complicates but never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—proving kindness persists—tightens when the neighbor arrives bearing the map, forcing Lina to recognize her work’s living echo. Pressure grows accumulatively: each portrait widens the circle of reciprocity until the city itself responds. No external antagonist is needed; the conflict is internal endurance versus doubt, resolved in earned stasis. Cost is the ongoing insomnia and anonymity she accepts.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—rescuing dying arts—faces escalating tests: wax too hard, names washing away, lens selecting survivors. Each beat raises the cost of failure; the final vow is a stance crystallization under coherent pressure. Agency remains with the curator; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.5)
    Hunger stone’s promise (beyond fate) escalates to self-blood for abdicated transcendence; keeper-scan thread reweights with off-page death—felt cost scales tight.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—turn obstacles into instruments—escalates through each dub and tower construction; the gale’s mouth is a coherent pressure that forces stance crystallization. Cost is visible in the transformed deck and the prophet’s exhaustion among pears. One meaningful tightening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—answering what the watchers see—tightens once when the corridor opens and footprints stop. Escalation is pattern-driven (five-six-five intervals, lattice grammar) that forces the protagonist’s decision to be measured. Cost is visible in the instant of stepping forward; no coincidence resolves anything.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. town peace—tightens when the historian chooses to publish. Cost is legible: the stationmaster’s “trembles” and the historian’s acceptance of possible backlash. One clear escalation suffices, but the external pressure (army demand) is off-stage, capping at 8.4.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—mapping absence without restoring it—tightens through each inserted note; the act forecloses the fantasy of recovery. Escalation is textural: each slip increases the weight of what cannot be recovered. Cost is visible in the final ledger that “even silence has.” No reversal, but deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    Tension rises each time story recorded as ‘storm’ is re-stamped alongside council agenda of pumps/anchors; choice to stamp redacts scabbed ledger transforms power into parasitic saving.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—fold grief into cranes to guide the shadow—tightens through each polishing and steaming beat. Agency is crystallized when he sets the lanterns in triangle and bows. Cost is felt in the “absent weight” loosening, not returning. No reversal, but deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.9)
    A single intangible stake—how arrival hums—escalates as each audit trail tightens the noose on definition; the decision to stay belongs requires irrevocable tenderness traded for grid anonymity, with conventional backlash legible in the drone-fed city.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. safety—tightens once: the discovery of the fifth plank forces the confession and the burn. Escalation is causal, not coincidental; each forged plank now exacts a visible price. Cost is the public un-naming of the narrator’s own past.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—untethering people from past mistakes—escalates through each trade; the second snag on a misremembered raid tightens pressure visibly. Agency is the negotiator’s refusal to let calendars or insults dictate terms, forcing both sides to accept moon-synchronized risk. Cost is legible: the boy’s near-death, the waterlogged stores, the lingering possibility of betrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness through service—tightens from internal ache to external test; the tide’s slide becomes irreversible pressure. The tightening choice (take the boy in at “tide was sliding away”) narrows escape from self-penance, then delivers visible cost when the father’s glance makes shame public. No coincidence resolves; the poles, hum, and compass are all protagonist-governed aids.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—atonement vs. numbness—is signaled early and tightens through the warming baseball. One meaningful deepening: the confession forces the choice to stay. Escalation is causal and protagonist-driven; no coincidence resolves anything. Felt cost: perpetual ferrying replaces clean slate.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reforge bond beyond death—is signaled early and escalates via scent-conjuring and the reluctant metamorphosis. One decisive tightening: the choice to open the seam beneath the ribs, with visible cost (loss of human voice). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—retrieving lost time—intensifies as each stalled second demands a confession, tightening choices. Agency drives escalation: every named regret narrows future minutes. Cost is legible—her rising throat-closing beauty marks the price for each retrieval.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—opening the dimension without betraying pacifist values—tightens through each calibration of weight and memory. One meaningful deepening: the realization the chamber is a library, not an arsenal, forces a stance crystallization with visible cost (the caretaker’s perpetual stewardship). Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—extract panic from the village’s marrow—is signaled early and tightened through the bottle-arc ritual. Escalation is textural: density of arrivals and synchronized breathing increase until the sideways plume forecloses panic. Cost is visible in Mara’s surrender of her curated coincidences.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—shift the fort from spectacle to hearth—tightens when the blackout enables the act; each beat (quill, dial, circuit) raises the risk of discovery. Agency is decisive: the sentinel chooses heartbeat power over full glare, paying with permanent vigilance. Cost is visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—rescue brother—signaled in third paragraph. Escalation is one deepening: each stone laid tightens the spiral until the trade becomes inevitable. Cost (her loss) is visible and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—understanding the cartography of scars—tightens when the poet must match lightning to wounds under measured silence. One decisive deepening: stopping the timer at thunder’s crest forecloses retreat. Cost is the audible hush after the last bolt.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten from abstract proof to lived irrevocable step; the “confession of ignorance” thesis is pressure-tested in steel and sunlight until the only unspent coin is departure itself; cost is registered on the floor and in Rook’s bow.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.0)
    Blooming resistance escalates under situational pressure: each new hand from bus stops narrows the plan into an inevitable act of endurance before demolition notice looms, trading safety for collective creation.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—derail fate without wrecking the world—tightens through each compass flicker and tide shift. One meaningful escalation: the last-train delay externalizes the wager’s success. Cost is the risk of permanent exile from clock-time, felt in the arbor’s ebbing tide.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: prevent cultural memory erosion. Tightening is textural (scent testimony shifts with humidity; monsoon fist at horizon narrows planting window). No perfect reversals, but luminous doubt forecloses passive waiting and crystallizes the act of planting—cost is rain counting its victims—earned via prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—finding the color of unspoken apologies—tightens through the clockwise walk and tide-fed deepening; the cove forces the decisive utterance. Cost is palpable: relinquishing lifelong practice of “shaping storms into cages.” One clear escalation suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes (stripping drama from disaster) are coherent, but escalation lacks meaningful pressure point; neighbors' arrival offers communal warmth but no narrowed options or tactical shift, missing the visible price escalation required for 8.8+ under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation via protagonist's agency (ledger → frost match → wind memory) narrows options to the annealed solution; cost legible in renouncing guild/destruction paths, though timeframe lacks urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes deepen via protagonist’s algorithm rewrite, but cost ("refuse cheap drama of misread sadness") lacks visceral payoff. Agency shines in weighting forks with leaves, though grief’s "pooling" remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (giving rest addresses) tightens meaningfully when mantled thing tests the dome. Protagonist's agency in aligning shards despite warning creates visible cost. Escalation driven by accumulated pressure under Accumulative lens, though antagonist lacks sufficient causal progression.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Patrol confrontation escalates sanctions pressure into visible cost (Mara’s silent defiance forcing tactical refinement), narrowing options through Accumulative deepening; "fewer lists, fewer boots" lands conceptual price without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes deepen through protagonist's breath-driven agency ("sending portions I never spent"), narrowing options to exhale/inhale rhythm; the cost in "attic lungs" visibly shapes the decanting resolution under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation driven by agency: pressing the shard multiplies distances, forcing confrontation with grief. Cost is unmistakable when the narrator "cannot snatch the past without tearing it," narrowing options to acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake (freeing seeds) tightens via enforcer confrontation forcing key-sorting under pressure. Agency-driven escalation: Mara jams gears, decodes keys, distributes seeds. Cost legible in chain's "vow weight" and "both require tending" reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through the diver test (secondary pressure) before the patent betrayal climax. Cost is unmistakable in "battered marvel here"—permanent damage transformed but not erased. Agency drives escalation: protagonist's choices (testing bowl, sealing pattern) narrow options toward earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (interpreting flowers, using moonbeams) under Accumulative lens, with visible cost in the mentor's "unpaid silence" becoming embodied presence; the single deepening (redefining illumination) sufficiently narrows options to crystallize stance.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.4)
    Stake ("safe zones for inquiry") tightens through Arlen's escalating physical investment (shaking arms) and methodical narration. Agency drives every beat; cost ("arms shook") visibly alters tactics while meltwater's "metronome" intensifies pressure under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist's decryption agency under Accumulative lens; "fear-sweat" on the dial and "shaking hands" reweight vulnerability as power with felt cost, though secondary debt-hunters lack concrete on-page manifestation beyond the letter.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stake "where thoughts come from" tightens through protagonist’s looped agency: violin draws frost from self, errors "amalgamate into meaning." Cost is eternal practice ("tomorrow will be another yesterday"), legible in "ice remembers fingerprints." Salt-trail loop slightly dilutes pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stake (mistrust vs transparency) tightens when registrar projects doodles publicly, narrowing options to confession. Cost is visceral in "held it too long," but escalation relies slightly on crowd’s instant acceptance rather than protagonist’s agency under Accumulative lens—minor friction in pressure coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency: mended deception confrontation forces stance crystallization with cost ("bones quiet as twigs" kneeling). Escalation driven by garden's pressure, but timeframe element fails to act as live clock narrowing options as required.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (proving sideways time) tightens via lever pull that risks station integrity; cost legible in surge damage repairs and emotional "felt forgiven"; biologists' cheer feels slightly convenient but not resolution-breaking.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen through protagonist's agency: "disobedience means drowning again" crystallizes the cost early, and the water-level constraint intensifies pressure as he crosses the room. Escalation via Accumulative lens succeeds—density of reflection motifs ("beads throw constellations," "ceiling paints itself twice") reweights the drowning loop—but the ghost's mechanics remain slightly abstract, softening the cost's visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency through naming truth "at the edge," with unmistakable cost in physical release. "Swaying certainties" deepens stakes via stance crystallization under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency: mapping radio timestamps leads to valve turning, narrowing options to confronting the truth. Cost is unmistakable—"weight arrived in my arms... from the stubborn metal of intention"—reweighting the dominant stake of swallowed truth.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.4)
    Stake (can music bridge grief?) tightens via therapist's agency: matching Ada's tapping creates "a line form," placing locket on guitar alters tactics. Cost legible in her "whisper" voice and "ticking" locket. Escalation driven by protagonist choices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes deepen through brass disk revelation, narrowing options to rearranging library; conceptual cost legible in historian's palm-biting with tapestry, though escalation leans slightly passive for protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation via Accumulative lens: microdot preparation tightens stakes through sensory density ("boiled sugar, inked rice"), narrowing options to the lighthouse projection. Cost is legible in the agent’s misinterpretation ("report that nothing happened... ricochet until admission").

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully when the husband’s palm placement shifts tactics, stacking breaths into a "visible ladder" under the loop pedal’s pressure. The possession’s near-completion raises cost visibly ("flexed, testing for anchors"), and Mara’s choice forecloses the deal with felt consequence. Agency remains Ilario’s until the critical moment where Mara reclaims her name—elegant escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure accumulates through memory mapping as the dominant stake tightens, but escalation lacks visceral cost beyond fatigue; the hospital corridor's sudden appearance disrupts causal coherence in the Accumulative framework.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake ("conquer labyrinth") signals late (line 5), weakening escalation. Tightening occurs at middle arch when runes align, forcing the lowering choice with visible cost ("surrender gravity"), but the pressure build lacks one earlier causal beat to justify 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen through Mara's agency (rigging needle to drumhead) narrowing options from fear to action; cost legible in "she had already stopped without noticing," though Oko's role slightly dilutes protagonist-driven escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (truth vs. rogue control) tightens through protagonist's weather expertise, foreclosing direct confrontation. Cost is visible in decoys and pigeon's flight, but escalation lacks secondary pressure for 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes tighten through scent progression: curiosity → vial-triggered collapse → bloom-induced reconfiguration; cost legible in physical collapse and single tear collected for the archive.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (texture of time) tightens via energy being’s canyon/silt vision, forcing moral calculus: "ethics of change are playful or cruel." Cost is legible in "knots I tied to seem heroic," but escalation lacks one visible price paid before the mirror climax.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.5)
    Stakes crystallize through Rhea’s agency: her reaching for the petal ("trade works only when shared") forecloses pure data or longing, with visible cost in "humane arithmetic" balancing herd survival against map honesty under accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (recognition vs. secrecy) tightens through Mara's micro-choices: taking the mistaken envelope, initiating the Harbor Ledger.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes (time debt for uncaging echoes) escalate through protagonist’s agency (borrowing sighs), narrowing options to repayment. Cost is visceral in bells and "nap tug," but escalation lacks one deeper trade-off—e.g., physical toll—to tighten tactics before closure.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (coherence vs. ambiguous loss) tightens through Accumulative escalation: fruit arrangement → rope-knotting shows deepening acceptance; cost legible in "hinges stop squealing" remaining unachieved, though early stake signal could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully as the outage lowers "the world enough that whispers could surface," but the tape’s agency in locating the notebook feels coincidental rather than driven by the dweller’s methodical choices, muddying escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation via weather pressure narrows options to release/control binary; cost legible in "knots sighed loose" and shelf reconstruction futility, though internal conflict resolves a hair too neatly for maximum tension.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes deepen texturally: brooch discovery forces keeper’s vulnerability ("looked as if a bell had rung"), escalating to the gnat’s release as irreversible cost. Pressure coheres through sensory density ("heat moved through us the way tides reason") under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes tighten when pearl refuses guide, narrowing options to surrender. Escalation driven by baker's agency (whispering dough sounds) under Accumulative lens. Unmistakable cost: guide's certainty emptied by chord, crystallized in "I did not see it coming" repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten when valve ritual forecloses passive waiting for parades; cost is the emotional weight of "navigated absences." Agency in choosing practice over performance drives escalation under Accumulative lens, though exile's urgency could press harder.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: "aligning arrows, aligning heartbeat" forecloses avoidance path. Cost legible when "constellations resolve into ramparts"—avoided conversations become literal barriers, altering tactics (folding maps) under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (discovering after-goodbye) tightens via corridor emergence; cost ("boredom had edges") alters immortal’s state. Agency-driven escalation peaks when spatial mutiny "raised its quiet flag."

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (silence vs. paper) tightens through Accumulative lens: basin freezing reweights options by breaking the halo. Protagonist agency drives escalation—measuring hum, refracting light—culminating in visible cost ("lamp's hum weakens"). "Invented histories bear weight" crystallizes stance with conceptual price. No coincidence; pressure coheres relentlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.5)
    Dominant stake (reclaiming erased history) tightens when mechanic reveals widow's involvement, forcing crystallization at the stack; pressure accumulates through fragment-gathering until widow encounter forecloses reconciliation with visible cost in her fear and clerk's departure; agency lies in the narrator's silent choice.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation via deepening density: cello vibrations accumulate meaning until conceptual repricing. Cost unmistakable in "riddle unclench like a fist" and shell cooling. Stakes tighten through "tide drags answer away" deadline.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (gentrification vs community) tightens through Nessa's agency: encoding messages → chip trade → proving self-regulation. Cost ("only a season") is legible and scales to length.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (capturing proof before extinction) escalates through ochre vial's "five minutes" countdown, narrowing observation window.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes escalate through fog thickening (textural density increase), but the artisan's seamless adaptation lacks the "visible price" required for 8.8+; raindrop solution feels earned yet minimizes the cost of near-failure.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (finding river origins without destroying wildness) tightens when turning valves: "Part of me feared the map I would make" forces trade-off between knowledge and preservation. Agency drives escalation—breathing on glass, prying locker—culminating in the cost of moral ambiguity made visible in the ledger.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency (footsteps pacing → cistern calibration), narrowing options to communal walking. Cost legible via abandoned kitchens reopening—conceptual price of years lost made visceral by thyme scent.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.5)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency: "override instinct" becomes active tactic narrowing options (kicking/clawing vs. stillness), with visible cost in "gauge needles inch toward warning." Time pressure tightens decisively at "pop the vial's stopper" under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (truth vs. protective silence) tightens meaningfully when boat approaches, forcing narrator's lens-like measured response. Escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure before this beat; "bodies under stairs" introduced too late to deepen tactics earlier despite conceptual cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation via deepening: lessons narrow options to "press and release like a vow," culminating in saplings uncurling. Cost is unmistakable in "mournful elation" and her vanishing "as a note disappears," reweighting the stake under accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation via protagonist agency: rejecting "precedents say leave offerings" to press the plate into the socket narrows options to one irreversible choice, with cost visible in "nets stop grieving" and the town's stunned reverence.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative pressure builds through bone/cataloging motifs toward the gnomon's reconstruction. Agency in rebuilding earns the shift, but the single tightening lacks visceral stakes escalation beyond emotional reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency as chalk decoding narrows options to "Auricle," with felt cost in the erased footprint; escalation peaks when busker's violin vibrates the clipboard, driving the naming choice under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten through embroidery's physical unraveling ("soft laughter leaked"), crystallizing in "you will be blamed" with visible cost in stained cloth; keeper's pressure remains underutilized for full escalation potential.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake ("moment before deciding") tightens through protagonist's agency: evoking spirits leads to condensation messages demanding "let your wanting be small enough." Cost is visceral—the scar reopening at dawn, then healing into a "small white door." Pressure accumulates relentlessly under Accumulative lens with no coincidental resolutions.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation driven entirely by protagonist’s agency: decrypting smudged notes reweights "shared anxieties" from abstract theme to tactical pressure (e.g., "hunger stitched between signatures"). Cost crystallizes when mother’s "dry-eyed" state shifts to sleeve-grab—a visible relational price paid under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stake (lost joy) deepens through community corrections narrowing options—e.g., "boy with wings" becoming mirror maker forces artistic recalibration. Cost manifests in joy's fragility ("pockets smelling of pith"), earned through protagonist's agency under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.1)
    Single stake (certainty vs curiosity) tightens through protagonist agency: each echo query ("who loved her?") deepens mystery, culminating in visible cost—admitting fear of erasure—which alters the mural's outcome. Pressure escalates via pattern breaks (vine greens "in the pause"), reweighting restoration stakes with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes deepen via protagonist’s agency planting "RATTLE CHOIR" as legal loophole. Cost legible when officers’ laughter cancels levy, but "thoughts taxable" pressure lacks live clock tightening—timeframe remains atmospheric rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen through Accumulative pressure: "photosynthesize pain into beauty" evolves from abstract motive to tangible "sorrows... woven from losses turning them into lanterns," with cost legible in ongoing insomnia now "tended" rather than conquered, narrowing options to gentle endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (preserving escaping sound) tightens via wind's warning and crack's "trembling" during mending, narrowing options to immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (harmonizing water/ash values) tightens through protagonist's adhesive analysis, with cost crystallized in "tremble again"; escalation driven by agency but council pressure lacks sufficient spatial choreography for full 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes tighten through attic clearance pressure forcing final hymn copying. Agency-driven escalation in mapping dust for Lark’s route narrows options to one fragile trust choice, but violinist’s passive waiting slightly softens the cost legibility at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation through density increase (codes aligning with wood grain) successfully reweights the "necessary distances" stake, though the lack of tangible opposition slightly weakens pressure legibility under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.5)
    Escalation via shared exhale deepens the dominant stake (rhythm of belonging) with visible cost—tide clocks "cupped in ribs" reweights tactics as the city shifts from threat to consent, driven entirely by protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.4)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: the shepherd’s vision reveals the path folded not from fear but "courtesy" toward the sleeping beast, narrowing options to scattering seeds as an alternate corridor. Cost is legible in the path’s "deliberately removed" gaps—a visible forfeiture that reshapes the recollectionist’s tactics toward "considerate caution."

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation via performer's agency—tilting bishop to catch drip, balancing coin on water—narrows options toward the janitor's silent confession; cost crystallizes in the returned bishop, reweighting "orchestrated serendipity" as fragile human connection.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes (preserving memory vs development) tighten when boy's question forces articulation of "window can hold a day," but "cranes cough beyond headland" lacks sufficient escalation pressure; cost legible in "scaffolds and orange tape" yet could deepen tactical constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single dominant stake (translating pain) deepens via joint paper-repairing micro-choice; "rewove a missing hand" action narrows options toward library agreement with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate through pattern density: needle tremors narrow communication options until the gauge's "steady angle" forces trade-off—abandoning solitary calibration for communal choreography, paid via the village's transformed path.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.3)
