  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—exposing the arson attempt while avoiding forgery accusations—is clear. One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist rejects direct guild presentation or destruction in favor of the frost-legible window, narrowing options. However, the escalation operates through reflection rather than on-page pressure; the rival's threat remains background and the canyon method unfolds without resistance or visible tradeoff. The final plan reconfigures tactics but its cost (future guild meeting, reliance on natural phenomena) is anticipated rather than paid on the page, placing this in mid-band under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—translating silence into legible meaning—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the first attempt fails (heat pools, lilies blister) and the protagonist rewrites the algorithm, weighting forks with leaves to modulate flow. Agency is present in the correction and the nightly sessions, but the final performance does not narrow options or force a visible trade-off; the crowd receives warmth and the protagonist pockets gratitude without cost that forecloses a path. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens via pattern deepening, yet the closure moment affirms continuity rather than testing commitment with an on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: "give rest a permanent address, somewhere the lost can forward themselves without fear of eviction." One meaningful deepening occurs when distress signals become a new question ("Where shall we rest"), reweighting the task from passive beacon to active registry. The mantled thing tests the dome but withdraws once addresses are assigned, providing external pressure that validates the internal shift. Minor gap: the escalation is conceptual rather than a narrowing of live options under time pressure, and the protagonist's agency is more interpretive than decisional until the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: sustaining the community through sanctions without exposing donors. Pressure tightens when the patrol stops "right under the arbor" and Mara declares "They do not exist as persons," forcing visible risk. The teens learning to "place hunger in the middle and ego at the fringe" offers a deepening that narrows their options (no more reckless pride). Spring's arrival with "fewer lists" registers cost and change, though the resolution leans summary. Agency is present in Mara's refusals and the community's coordinated timing.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—is signaled early and pursued through the breath-and-box practice. One meaningful tightening: the past-life woman in glass turns toward the street, which triggers the rib-closet unlatch and enables the decanting. The man's pause and shared breath rhythm adds a secondary pressure accent. Cost is legible (the emptied jars, the unlocked closet) but the resolution feels more like permission granted than a trade-off with visible sacrifice, keeping it from the higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—understanding and navigating grief through the maze—is signaled early and tightens as the halo fragment intensifies, forcing the protagonist deeper into retrocognitive scenes. The pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: each fragment activation adds density (father's lesson, library fire, pavilion encounter, underwater vault) until the final acceptance that grief's exits loop back to their entrances. The woman's declaration ("You stitched grief into paths") and the protagonist's reply ("exits always end as mouths that ask for more steps") articulate the cost of perpetual engagement. One micro turn—the shard becoming a ring—reconfigures the tool and opens the final image. The escalation is more textural and accretive than a sharp reversal, but the cost is visible: the protagonist relinquishes the hope of closure and embraces ongoing reverie.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (retrieve seeds to plant resilience) is signaled early and pursued with one meaningful tightening when enforcers appear and Mara jams the conveyor, forcing her to accelerate under pressure. The scavenger-enforcer obstacle provides external escalation, and Mara's patient sorting of keys under time pressure shows agency. However, the enforcers are dispatched easily (plush avalanche), reducing the felt cost of the confrontation. The ending crystallizes her ongoing mission with visible tactical choices (chain-sling, seed distribution), but the cost reads more conceptual (endless labor) than a trade-off that forecloses a live option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.2)
    One dominant stake (finding the sound of trust breaking) is signaled early and tightened when the protagonist shifts from seeking the fracture to recording its prelude, a meaningful reweighting of approach. The diver sequence provides an on-page test that demonstrates the method's efficacy, raising stakes for the protagonist's own wound. However, escalation is more additive than dialectical—beats accrue rather than narrow options—and the final act (the partner's betrayal addressed via forge imprint) unfolds without visible friction or cost in the moment, relying on retrospective conceptual charge.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether destiny answers and whether the mentor can be redeemed—is signaled early and maintained. Pressure accumulates through clue-following (bouquet, moonbeams, locked door) and one meaningful deepening: the jar's light transforms the failed negatives into truthful portraits, restoring the mentor. The protagonist's agency is present in each tactical choice (jar placement, lock-picking, final moonbeam release), but the resolution feels more delivered by the jar's properties than forced by a trade-off or visible sacrifice from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: craft vessels that hold questions without harm, preparing the space for a gathering. The piece deepens rather than reverses—Arlen moves from solitary preparation through physical labor to imagining the gathering under green lamps. One meaningful tightening: the transition from testing his own narration ("the journey was ridiculous and exact") to abandoning "his old fear that science and tenderness could not share a bench." Cost is visible in his shaking arms and the sustained ritual labor. Under the Accumulative lens, the pattern break (from work to invitation) reweights the stake adequately, though a second visible price or trade-off would lift this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—proving that vulnerability is power while confronting identity theft—is signaled early and tightens through the decryption sequence. The protagonist's agency drives escalation: choosing to answer the cryptic request, steadying shaking hands with breath counts, reciting bone-break dates, and climbing despite fear. The rooftop confrontation crystallizes stakes with the brothers planning to "return the credits and keep the courage." However, the resolution leans on dialogue planning ("We would outwit the knives by writing our own billing") rather than a single decisive action with on-page cost, slightly diffusing the pressure at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: the oracle's mission to map silence for travelers, braided with the courier's search for absolution. Pressure tightens when he reveals his order to burn records but kept one scroll—a reversal that narrows his options and forces the oracle to reframe his mission. The map's fragility (flaking gold, rain, potential star-death) creates cost. Agency appears in the oracle's decision to stay and the courier's choice to carry the booklet, each forecloses a path with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—"to find where thoughts come from"—is signaled early and tightens through accumulative pressure across loops. Agency manifests as attention-choices that foreclose paths: each loop's experimentation narrows options until the protagonist accepts practice over revelation. One meaningful deepening occurs when the robot realizes "the program was not erasing error, but letting errors amalgamate into meaning," reweighting the stake from correction to integration. The final renunciation carries visible cost: the protagonist lays down the violin and chooses custodial routine, accepting that "there is no grand revelation" and forfeiting the investigative drive. Under the Accumulative lens, coincidence (violin appearing at twilight) complicates without resolving.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—thawing mistrust—is signaled early and tightens when the registrar moves from private eavesdropping to public confession, forecloses the option of remaining hidden, and risks communal judgment. One reversal (held lens → returned lens with transparency) narrows options under the Accumulative lens and the final reconciliation is earned by protagonist agency. The cost is visible: "they can decide if the ledgers deserve me" and the curator's bow with "forehead almost kisses the tarp." The escalation could press harder if earlier beats introduced a clearer immediate threat (job loss, exile), but the social price is legible and the resolution avoids coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake ("to prove that gardens know their gardeners") is signaled early and tightens when the maze objects to the planted marble, forcing the narrator to choose between maintained deception and honest confession. Agency operates through renunciation: admitting the lie, trimming the vine "accepting the leaves that chose ground," and leaving the gate unlatched. The cost is legible—the narrator surrenders control and performance, accepting incompleteness. One clear reversal (maze disapproval → confession → acceptance) drives escalation under the Accumulative lens, though the coincidence of the overnight corridor arrival slightly weakens causal spine.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: prove sideways time and recover the mantas. Pressure coheres through the Accumulative lens: magnetic nexus traps the herd, Jae builds the probe, pulls the lever (one tightening that narrows his option to retreat), inverts fields (second tightening), mantas return. Agency is clear—his choices drive each beat. Cost is visible: he risks surge, succeeds, but then withholds the full proof (his own temporal echo) to preserve the affection over the test, foreclosing the public-validation path. The escalation is modest but sufficient for this length; no second reversal complicates the inversion, so the turn feels slightly linear, keeping this below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—unraveling the ghost's code to disrupt the drowning loop—is signaled early and tightens once when the program reveals the instruction to step on reflections only. The protagonist's obedience (tilting the lantern, conducting rests) advances pressure under the Accumulative lens, and the resolution (the portrait softens, the program rearranges, the house rests) shows a visible change. However, agency is passive: the musician follows instructions rather than generating choices that trade off competing goods. The cost is implied (the musician must conduct silence, honoring the ghost's terms) but not viscerally felt as a forfeiture or renunciation that closes a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—finding the weight of a swallowed truth to relieve internal calcification—is signaled early and tightens through the gentian-smudge ritual, the balance exercise, and the spoken confession. Agency is clear: the protagonist chooses to circle inward and name the lie, foreclosing evasion with visible cost (vocal exposure, acceptance of perpetual sway). The storm's scheduled arrival intensifies time pressure. One meaningful tightening (the protagonist's inward spiral to the lie's core) suffices for this length and the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—finding "the weight of a swallowed truth"—is signaled early and tightened when the narrator engages the valve wheel, imagining the quota day and his father's death. The act of turning the wheel narrows options: the protagonist could leave it closed (preserving mystery) or open it (correcting the wrong). Turning it a quarter, then setting it to open, forecloses the path of passive investigation and commits to a stance. The cost is felt in the refusal to forgive human actors and in the deliberate correction of the mechanical state. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: each fragment (calls, echoes, valve wheel handling) deepens engagement until the final act reweights the stake from passive appraisal to corrective forgiveness of the tool itself.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake: preservation of the chronicles and the keeper's witnessing role under environmental threat (rising river, decay). One tightening occurs when the flood forces the keeper to burrow through a bricked niche, narrowing options and introducing the obsidian refuge as a regenerative resource. Agency is present but limited to endurance and spatial navigation rather than decision that forecloses competing paths. The keeper's choices are reactive (retreat, wait, record) rather than transformative. Cost is conceptual—continued isolation, acceptance of crumbling peace—but not viscerally tested against a competing desire on the page. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but does not escalate dramatically; the flood complicates, then recedes without forcing a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—helping Ada engage her grief without collapse—is signaled early and tightens when she refuses the eclipse glasses. The narrator's decision to place the locket on the guitar (agency through adaptive action) narrows options and creates the totality moment where "we were one instrument." The cost is visible: Ada must trace the question mark rather than answer it, and the narrator must pitch the lullaby lower "because nights were hard." One meaningful escalation through protagonist micro-choices under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—collecting the stories walls have heard before silence forgets—is signaled early and tightens once through the discovery of the brass disk, which reconfigures the historian's understanding and tactical response (rearranging shelves along the new pull). The piece offers one meaningful deepening that narrows options under the accumulative lens. Agency is expressed through renunciation and endurance (volunteering to absorb stranded stories), with visible cost in the final commitment to teach walls and stitch echoes.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: "design the smallest message and make it visible to everyone." The protagonist's agency drives escalation: choosing the lighthouse over trading the specs, then actively orchestrating the light projection. One meaningful tightening occurs when the specs are transformed into microdot-stamped fortunes and broadcast, foreclosing the spy option and forcing public acknowledgment. Cost is visible on the page: the agent is deceived, the town's etiquette shifts from "nobody looked" to "everyone finally looked," and the protagonist accepts the role of arranger. The resolution is earned by the protagonist's choices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—stop possession before completion or lose the neighborhood—is signaled in the opening third and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the whisper "tested for anchors" and found only silence, forcing Mara's choice with visible cost: she must own her name or be erased. The palette maneuver (reflecting the whisper to itself) narrows options under accumulative pressure, and the final exhalation reweights her agency. Agency is decision and renunciation with on-page cost; the husband's touch and Ilario's rhetoric scaffold the turn without solving it for her.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—to conduct unheard symphonies—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist realizes "to conduct what cannot yet be heard, you first tend to what hears you back," forcing a shift from command to invitation. The escalation reads as accumulative deepening: mapping memories, scoring breath, inviting elements to join, and finally recognizing the orchestra's listening is "louder than any noise." The cost is conceptual and felt: the protagonist finishes "before exhaustion hits" and the shell cools, implying depletion. Agency is enacted through attention and renunciation of force.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: conquer the labyrinth of self by charting the suspended instant without breaking it. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening when the tablet reveals the protagonist's own runes and message, reframing conquest as surrender and altering tactics (lowering instead of flying). Cost is visible: erasing the seed, relinquishing flight, accepting the ground. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through rain-guided sequence, timeline sliding, and shadow refusal, culminating in the choice to lower and walk. Agency is present (following puddles, lowering, erasing the tablet) but the stakes remain abstract and contemplative; no antagonist or external friction sharpens the choice, keeping escalation intellectualized rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (defeating emotional numbness) is signaled in paragraph six. One meaningful tightening occurs when the absurd surgery of needle-to-drumhead forces Mara to trust the backward method despite its fragility. The escalation is accumulative rather than causal—density increases until "the drum became a heart remembering forward" reweights her capacity. Cost is visible: she must abandon her prior teaching stance and lead through shared vulnerability. Agency is clear in her choice to thread the filament and carry the repaired needle home.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving integrity and delivering unedited storm data despite surveillance—is signaled early and tightens through the message-tube threat and the figure's arrival. The protagonist's agency drives escalation: choosing to craft a second coded message, using decoy charts, and progressing laterally rather than submitting or fleeing. The lateral escape is a visible trade (public confrontation avoided, but the archivist now holds evidence). Pressure coheres under the Causal lens; coincidence (pigeon arrival) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: discovering time's texture without "breaking anything that could feel." The poet's choices—darkening the lantern, looping the rope, asking the being to show "how time bruises"—escalate engagement and culminate in the mirror confrontation where past heroism is renounced. The tightening is present (each vision peels a layer, narrowing toward self-confrontation), but the final turn lacks a live trade-off or visible price paid on the page; the poet consents and the grotto "approves" without dramatized resistance or forfeiture that would raise the cost band.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—unbinding the chronic hush—is signaled early and tightens once when the solitary act becomes communal practice. The bowl fills with "things we do not throw away," and the group commits to "visit the halves and the almosts," a meaningful deepening under the accumulative lens. Agency reads as attention and endurance rather than decisive reversal; the hush "loosens one more braid" rather than breaks, and the cost is the quiet acceptance that repair is incomplete. No antagonist or sharp reversal, but pressure coheres and the final commitment forecloses pure withdrawal.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: Rhea must reconcile insight with empathy before grant money ossifies into meaningless charts. The pressure deepens through the dialogue about the herd's half-truths and culminates in the narrator's key constraint: "the chest must not pretend to be landscape, only to be listening." Agency is exercised through shared ritual and Rhea's acceptance of the counterfeit as a bridge. Cost is visible in Rhea's acknowledgment that it's borrowed feeling, and her transformation forecloses the path of pure data or pure longing. One substantive tightening under the Accumulative lens is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—uplift silent contributors—is signaled early and sustained, but pressure remains diffuse: no live antagonist, time constraint, or resource scarcity forces a tradeoff. The mistaken-address envelope initiates the friendship and trace, but this complication does not narrow options or raise cost; Mara and Jun proceed without impediment. One meaningful deepening occurs when they "learn the man in the photo taught children to tune by ear," reweighting the locket from artifact to emblem, yet the granddaughter's arrival and public gathering unfold without on-page resistance or visible price. Agency at closure reads as mutual promise rather than decision under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—grafting onto community—is signaled early and tightens through the search pact, gossip accumulation, and discovery of the posture. The protagonist's agency (listening walk, reed sculptures, building the new arbor) narrows options and the final dedication forecloses a path (practice over finished work). The cost is felt but quiet; the ache "stays, but now it glows" registers as Charged Poise. One meaningful deepening (finding the seam, adopting the posture) is sufficient under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: find and document the birthplace of echoes. Pressure escalates through the accumulative lens: locate → approach → open the moment → witness larvae → confront ethical choice. The "interrupted cadence" recurs as mechanical constraint and thematic frame. The protagonist's agency at closure—sealing the oval and letting one larva escape—forecloses the path of unconstrained observation with on-page cost ("Time borrowed must be repaid"). One tightening: the realization "It needed to be uncaged" shifts want into moral calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: to achieve coherence between his sister's absence and his daily life ("the hinges stop squealing"). One meaningful tightening occurs when the mosaic's chipped geometry provides the theorem, narrowing his options from seeking reunion to accepting carriage of uncertainty. Agency is renunciation with cost—he leaves the eyes and carries only the rope-end, forgoing spectacle for "gentler mathematics." However, much of the escalation is contemplative rather than pressure-driven decision; the orchard invites rather than forces, and coincidence (moon threading through fissure) enables rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: the dweller's desire to help the girl find the notebook while remaining unseen. The outage tightens conditions, allowing the tape fragment to surface whispers. One meaningful pressure point occurs when the girl speaks "where her mother kept the blue notebook"—the tape hums, triggering the dweller's cache solution. However, escalation is gentle; the protagonist faces no live opposition or trade-off. The resolution (sliding the atlas case, withdrawing) costs him nothing visible on the page beyond enduring invisibility, which he already chose.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: how to tend plants (and self) through disruption. One meaningful tightening occurs when the storms prune certainties and every knot sighs loose, forcing Mara to choose between retying and releasing. The jasmine-hop braid and the ledger of what she did not force demonstrate agency through renunciation with on-page cost (relinquishing control). Escalation is driven by protagonist choices under the Accumulative lens; the cost is legible in her "small unfixing" and the vow to "take apart certainty."

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is established early: to thresh meaning from post-war wreckage through paint and attention. The brooch discovery narrows tactics (keep or return), the keeper's recognition escalates toward the pact, and the mother's exchange demand forces a visible trade (gnat for warmth). Agency is shared but coherent: the narrator chooses to walk with the keeper, then to pry open the resin, each foreclosing retreat. The final pact—paint for lamp-tending, accepting what the island gives—carries opportunity cost (refused collectors, accepted silence) legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake: magnify everyday magic, signaled early. The pilgrim's kneeling choice—"not to take it, but to ask what taking might change"—narrows options with moral calculus. The pearl's refusal of the guide and rolling to the pilgrim is a meaningful reversal that reweights prophecy versus humble spell. The final offering to the stalactite deepens the stakes with visible cost (sharing breath and duty). Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens, though the guide's resistance is brief and underplayed.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: giving the harbor a practice of return after exile's erasure. Escalation under Accumulative lens: woman's knock → valve revealed → rhythm taught → dockworker pauses → promise of return. One meaningful tightening when the archivist decides to gift the valve, foreclosing the archive path. Agency is clear (choosing practice over preservation). The cost is visible (valve wrapped and given away, "belongs with her steps"). Does not reach 8.5: the escalation is more additive than narrowing; no live option is dramatized as incompatible until the gift moment.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—reaching the "fortress of unspoken truths"—is signaled early. The protagonist's agency manifests in tracing arrows, using the punch, and laying down maps, but these actions do not face meaningful resistance or force a trade-off with visible cost. The mouth's challenge ("tender proof that I would listen") is met through symbolic offering rather than a choice that forecloses a live option. Pressure accumulates through atmosphere and pattern rather than escalating consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: whether entangled memories can be made coherent, whether the tower "keeps her voice." The narrator's agency is decision and endurance (offers tea, transcribes, sits at the chair to "test the room"), with the cost being professional distance surrendered ("I rarely do because my job prefers clean hands"). Escalation is modest—one meaningful deepening when the protagonist names losses and griefs exchange coats—but pressure accumulates through the tile mechanics and Lio's question. Coincidence (whale breach timing) complicates but the protagonist's transcription and seated choice drive the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—discovering what happens after goodbye—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the storm-fed ritual, the appearance of the corridor, and the payments extracted (narrator's frost-throated memories, Lio's unforgiveness softened). One meaningful tightening occurs when the corridor demands "wages of witness," forcing both characters to surrender something. The cost is legible (the immortal's boredom gains edges, Lio's refusal is revised) but feels more conceptual than a concrete forfeiture that narrows future options. The escalation under the Accumulative lens is solid but not unmistakable; the corridor sequence deepens understanding without a sharp pivot or visible price that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—help Arman reach asylum without lying—is signaled early and tightens through the taught breach window: shift change, alarm reset, the director's habit of leaving the bolt hanging. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as each beat (waiting actively, camera theater, the reset chime) narrows the escape corridor. The protagonist's agency is clear: choosing to sign witness and carry the laundered-bribe evidence to the clinic attorney forecloses the path of silent complicity with visible cost (the risk of testimony). One meaningful deepening occurs when the sponsors hand over the account numbers, transforming the escape from mercy into a fair trade with proof that can balance.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: providing "workable grammar for waiting" to the evacuated town. One meaningful deepening: the shift from solitary measurement to sending stories downward as relational act. Agency is enacted through ritual and renunciation rather than confrontation, fitting the Accumulative lens. The final turn ("my pages will be only paper") forecloses authorial permanence with felt cost. Pressure coheres through lamp hum as clock and the bonsai's patient demands. Minor issue: no on-page moment dramatizes why invented histories are ethically preferable to documentary silence—the choice is claimed rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming erased identity or at least its texture—is signaled early and tightens when the poison label links to the widow's private warehouse. The narrator's agency is renunciation with visible cost: he offers evidence, lets her choose, and walks away still nameless, foreclosing justice but preserving his listener role. The mechanic's sideways look and the widow's throat-unbuttoning recognition are micro-reversals that narrow options. Pressure accumulates through overheard whispers, the label's discovery, and the tidal rhythm guiding the final approach. One meaningful tightening: the widow's arrival forces the confrontation the narrator has layered toward.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—decode a universal riddle before "the tide drags the answer away"—is signaled early and drives the ritual with the cello and shell. One meaningful tightening: the compass moves only when he thinks of failure, forcing him to "retell" disproved stories (a deliberate vulnerability) rather than seek certainty. The figure stepping from the draft ("the page that never closes") deepens pressure by personifying the riddle, and their duet produces the insight that "kindness carried forward until it looks like gravity" is the answer. Cost is felt (he leaves without full resolution, the dome continues without him), though the escalation relies more on thematic accumulation than a sharp decision that narrows live options. Agency is present but mediated by ritual rather than direct confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—prove self-regulation to delay privatization—is signaled early and escalates through Nessa's agency: from passive mapping to active encoding, then to the liaison confrontation and finally the raft realignment that forces VIP/market fusion. The chip-press trade is a genuine tightening that narrows options with visible cost (one season's reprieve, not victory). The brother's torn allegiance adds secondary pressure without diluting focus. The final image acknowledges the cost ("seasons are how rafts survive, one patched plank at a time") and the ongoing nature of the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—photograph the moth before extinction and secure agency funding—is signaled early and tightens through the timed chemical sequence. Agency surfaces in the narrator's preparation (unpacking vials, setting camera) and endurance (waiting through the chemical countdown). One meaningful deepening: the white vial's exhalation and the moth's emergence narrow the window to a single shutter press with irreversible consequence. The cost is legible on the page: "the moth made a soft collision with my sleeve, dusted me with a century, and then climbed into a brightness no one could indict" forecloses the possibility of another chance. Escalation operates under the accumulative lens via the timed progression; coincidence (the moth waking) complicates but the narrator's prior setup earns the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—guide the coupling without sight during fog—is signaled early and tightens when fog folds thicker and the second car slants. The artisan's agency (calling for more bowls, patching code midair, counting taps) drives the reversal from hesitation to success. The escalation is earned by her adaptive technique under accumulative pressure, and the cost is legible: precision demanded, ritual momentarily silent, then restored. Coincidence (fog, wind) complicates but does not resolve; protagonist action closes the gap.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—finding where the rivers begin—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when the falcon reports "a mouth that swallowed maps," forcing the editor into the cold. The valve-turn is protagonist-driven agency that narrows options (the convergence cannot be undone) and forecloses the path of passive observation. Cost is visible: the editor becomes "clerk and herald," fearing the map will "tame what should remain wild" yet trusting "naming follows listening." The final commitment to follow departure imposes occupational and conceptual cost. One meaningful deepening (from tracing to turning to recording) is sufficient under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: restore communal balance through shared rhythm. The piece tightens once—from solitary pacing to collective footwork—and the mother's tentative return supplies a micro-reversal that opens the town. The tuner's agency is ritual action rather than decision under duress, and no live option is foreclosed with visible personal cost; he asks for time and they grant it without friction. The bell's repair and the community's agreement to practice together constitute a deepening, not a dramatic turn, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—rescue the submersible crew—is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful reversal: the corridor narrows, panic threatens, stillness allows progress, and the signal takes with "a subtle tug in the line." The protagonist's agency (unsnarling, positioning, exhaling tones, overriding instinct to achieve stillness) drives escalation under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible on the page: the gauge needles inch toward warning, depth feels "like a hand," and the protagonist swims "proud and afraid" with survival still uncertain. No coincidental resolution; pressure coheres and the final swim forecloses a path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—"to thread a labyrinth with my own story before anyone closed it off"—is signaled early but remains abstract. The piece accumulates pressure through spatial ascent and the approach of "a boat with questions," yet no on-page reversal narrows options or forces a visible trade-off. The final act (placing the lattice over the drain) reads as symbolic preparation rather than a choice with legible cost, and the time constraint ("before they find the bodies") never alters tactics in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: waking the orchard without the heart key. The ghost bride's arrival supplies the carved bead and coaching, tightening options ("Do not hack… press and release like a vow you will keep"). The keeper's promise not to wake grief forecloses selfish use with visible cost: ghosting the trader denies a lucrative sale. The final six-syllable cadence wakes the youngest saplings, a protagonist-driven deepening that earns the orchard's self-sustaining warmth. The escalation is accumulative rather than plot-reversing, fitting the inferred lens, though the river-rescue backstory is late and summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake (restore the harbor) is signaled early, and the escalation follows an accumulative path: Sera moves deeper into the labyrinth, interprets carvings, sews names, and performs a ritual that opens the sluices. One meaningful tightening occurs when she presses the plate into the socket and the chamber opens, narrowing the path forward. However, cost is muted—there is no live trade-off or visible price paid on the page; the resolution feels granted by the labyrinth's acceptance rather than driven by Sera's agency under pressure. Coincidence does not resolve, but the ritual's efficacy is asserted rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (restore lost faith) is signaled early and tightens through accumulative beats: hearing time hesitate, the sundial's missing gnomon, the guide's interrupted journey. One meaningful deepening occurs when rebuilding the gnomon aligns noon with "home" on the stele, causing "a hinge give way in my chest"—a felt internal shift. Agency is clear: the narrator chooses to rebuild, to return objects, and finally to stay and tend. Cost is visible in the forfeited departure and the shift from documenting to embodying the orchard's grammar. Escalation reads as textural density increase rather than causal collision, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—naming someone so "their truths can travel" without surveillance—is signaled early and tightens through the protagonist's process of decoding chalk, testing aliases, and choosing "Auricle" because "ears remember what mouths deny." The constraint that "speed kills certain meanings" grounds the choice of surface mail and generates tactical pressure. However, the climactic withholding of the letter ("I step back, not dropping yet") lacks a visible trade-off or foreclosed option; the final beat reads as atmospheric stasis rather than a decision that narrows the protagonist's agency with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake: carry the conspiracy's rumor safely without triggering the coup prematurely. The narrator's stitching deepens pressure in discrete steps (pattern opens throat, whisper tells of falsified charts, names slip into fibers), and the keeper's warning ("You will be blamed") tightens options by making cost explicit. The final choice—accepting the embroidery and a place to sleep—is a renunciation of safety with visible cost. One weakness: the conspirators and their tactics remain off-page, so the opposition feels atmospheric rather than embodied; no on-page antagonist tests the narrator's tactics directly, slightly dulling escalation bite.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: the narrator seeks to witness the moment before the failed apology and carry that honesty back to Mara. Pressure accumulates through reflection and the spirits' counsel, culminating in the vow to "practice on water, answering ripples with stillness." One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator shifts from wanting to "change" the past to wanting to "witness honestly." Agency is present but oblique—the narrator's choices are internal and preparatory rather than a decision that forecloses a live option with immediate visible cost. The escalation fits the Accumulative lens but lacks a sharp on-page trade-off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: brokering peace between the mother and uncle through the boy's cast. The translator's task is clear from line 5, and pressure tightens when both adults arrive separately. However, escalation is muted—no resistance or reversal tests the translator's approach; the surgeon's good news and the mother's gesture feel earned but not hard-won. Agency is mostly observation and interpretation; the act of "stitching a small script" and offering the coral are choices, but they lack visible friction or a moment where the translator must forfeit something. The cost is implied in the rain-treaty's fragility, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—rediscovering lost joy—is signaled early but remains abstract. Pressure accumulates through the collaborative correction of the festival images, a meaningful tightening that narrows the protagonist's solitary method into communal work. However, no on-page reversal forecloses a prior option; the ending promises continuation ("paint the gaps tomorrow") without a visible price paid in this window. The mirror maker's suggestion to reverse the final frame is a micro turn but does not raise cost or narrow options under accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restore without erasing living hands—is signaled early and tested when the wall asks "what my own face hid." The protagonist's agency is dialogic choice: each question narrows certainty and opens a layer, culminating in the admission of fear. The wall's "amused" granting of whisper-retention is a tightening that forecloses perfect restoration yet achieves depth. Cost is visible: the mural "keeps asking," obligating ongoing wakefulness rather than finished certainty. Pressure accumulates through the reciprocal questioning pattern, and the final cost (lighter burden, unfolding map) is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: to protect thought from taxation by creating a language the state cannot audit. The piece escalates through accumulation (secret club → garden patterns → city-wide choir) and one causal tightening (the night collectors arrive for Kline's permits). The protagonist's agency is present (founding the club, planting the verdict, shaking the gourd, singing the clause) but often collective and performed rather than personal. The climax hinges on the legal loophole ("artistic rehearsal…tax-exempt") and the officers' involuntary laughter, which reads more as conceptual victory than a choice that forecloses a path with felt personal cost. The "visible price" is diffuse—Kline's permits at risk, the risk of arrest—but not dramatized as a trade-off the narrator visibly weighs and loses on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake: converting insomnia/pain into beauty through the blossom armistice. The galaxy postcard and the Gardener's arrival provide one meaningful deepening—the treaty requires "two signatures, written in breath." Yet the tightening is more thematic than tactical; no live option is foreclosed on the page. The poet's hesitation is brief and resolved without visible trade-off. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens but never narrows choices through protagonist agency. The treaty and gardens feel like granted fulfillment rather than earned reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—preserve the escaping sound of a forgotten name—is signaled early ("the sound inside that fracture is escaping") and tightens through the repair sequence: the crack "trembles against my palm," the protagonist sews "where the song guides me, never piercing the tone." The final test ("I ring the chime once, and the name travels down") reweights the prior work with visible consequence (someone below lifts their head). However, the escalation lacks a meaningful obstacle or cost that narrows options; the repair succeeds without visible tradeoff, and the protagonist's prior failure ("I failed them once, years ago") is told rather than dramatized as a present friction.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring collegial trust after Lio's three-year silence—is signaled early and tightens through the composition, test-reading, and joint revision. The protagonist's agency is clear: composing promises, placing pages strategically, inviting Lio to "play what I wrote." One meaningful reversal occurs when Lio steps out and the dynamic shifts from monologue (apology) to dialogue (collaborative rewrite). Visible cost: "we revised the coda together, bending the promises to fit," explicitly adding "clauses to confess doubts aloud"—a tangible concession that forecloses the old silence. The piece avoids multiple forced reversals and lets accumulative pressure do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and sustained: harmonize water flow (traders) versus geological safety (ash-keepers). Pressure tightens when the protagonist discovers the hidden sluice and must decide whether to expose the lovers or honor their encrypted compassion. The final tuning represents a meaningful choice that reconfigures the system, though the cost reads more as technical obligation than personal sacrifice. The envelope discovery provides one solid reversal that narrows options. Agency is present but tilts more toward problem-solving competence than a decision that forecloses a live emotional or moral path with felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—learning to trust again after betrayal—is signaled early and tightens when the attic's clearance forces the protagonist to send the songs down to the violinist. Agency is visible: copying hymns, writing the route for Lark, climbing the beam to fix the latch, and tying the meteorite chip to the bird's ankle are all protagonist-driven decisions under pressure. The escalation is accumulative rather than reversals: each act layers trust until the final release. Cost is legible: vulnerability, risking theft again, and the impermanence of the bookshop all charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—"to discover why some thresholds feel sacred"—is signaled in the opening third and tightens once when the codes align with the bench grain, opening the seam and forcing a choice between descent (reunion) and preservation (sacred distance). The narrator's agency is renunciation with conceptual cost: keeping the distance makes "the love articulate" but postpones welcome and accepts permanent separation. Under the Accumulative lens, this single deepening suffices; the final image reweights prior material (mazes as intervals, father's belief in necessary distances) and forecloses the reunion path. Pressure coheres but escalation is muted—most beats are observational rather than forcing trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.1)
    One dominant stake—learning the rhythm of belonging—is signaled early and sustained. The mid-story tightening occurs when the sentinel algorithm tests their breath-sync and grants access, narrowing options (pass or fail). The ending reweights the sunrise from threat to consent, a meaningful deepening. However, no sharp trade-off or visible loss appears on the page; the algorithm simply "invited us to rest," lowering tension rather than escalating cost, and the protagonist's final insight arrives without friction or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering why paths disappear—is signaled early but never tested. The recollectionist encounters no obstacle, makes no trade-off, and faces no reversal; the bird appears on cue, the vision arrives without cost, and the solution is delivered intact. Pressure remains static across beats; the protagonist's interpretive walk through the cave does not escalate or deepen options. The ending recounts the planned tea-and-explanation without showing the villagers' reaction or any friction, leaving the stake abstract and the resolution unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake is legible: the performer must sustain his craft of "orchestrated serendipity" and survive the season through curated moments rather than applause. One tightening occurs when the janitor's grief surfaces and the performer uses the bishop to create a shared revelation. Agency is present but muted—the protagonist arranges options and waits for drift rather than making a high-cost decision. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal; pressure does not narrow options so much as deepen the atmosphere. The ending reaffirms the premise without a visible price that forecloses a path. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices, but the lack of a tangible trade-off or foreclosed option keeps this in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—to preserve memory through clandestine art under a nostalgia ban—is signaled in the opening and sustained. Pressure tightens when the verse completes and the protagonist decides to stay and continue the practice ("elective exile becomes a home when the craft teaches you where to stand"), a stance crystallization with conceptual cost (ongoing risk, self-imposed constraints). The cartographer's request ("Your departures, my returns, the distance that teaches our shores to speak") provides thematic deepening but not a dramatic reversal. The final image of walking the coast as "clandestine barometer" forecloses the option of safe anonymity, meeting the modest escalation requirement for this length under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: illuminate value in the mundane before "everything shifts" (cranes, deals, survey flags). The pond scene provides one meaningful tightening—the boy's question and the narrator's realization that the atrium must "rescue what we nearly lost"—which narrows options from abstract opposition to concrete incorporation (ferry boards as benches, tide-map etchings). The decision to argue for railings "polished by hands" at the noon meeting forecloses pure spectacle in favor of communal access. Cost is conceptual and relational: the glazier risks professional standing and must persuade architect and investor. Agency is stance crystallization under Accumulative pressure, consistent with the inferred lens. No antagonist appears, but the investor's lease demand and the mayor's ribbon deadline provide external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: how to return the paper children without drowning in guilt or causing further harm. Pressure accumulates through waiting, the mother's arrival, and her refusal to touch the box until she sees his hands. The shared repair of the missing hand and the agreement to teach constitute meaningful deepening that narrows options from solitary burden to collaborative path. The tightening is visible when "making it legible" replaces "making it right," and the cost is on-page: he carries the empty box, the old bargain shifts "less a debt, more a pathway."

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: revitalizing hope for the post-storm village. The work escalates from solo trial-and-error to multi-self collaboration, then to a legible solution ("the needle ticked and then held steady"). The protagonist's agency is clear in pattern-setting and gauge-reading; the cost is the ongoing commitment to teach and calibrate. One meaningful tightening occurs when the gauge holds at a new angle, narrowing the village's future path. Weakness: the village's sleepwalking is backdrop rather than on-page pressure; no antagonist or resistant force tests the solution.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: to map the house's dream and honor legacy's burden. Pressure accumulates through discovery (diary, negative, letter, hopscotch), and the protagonist's agency is shown in the choice to play the room and bind the negative into the ledger. However, escalation is gentle and the final act is acceptance rather than a trade-off that forecloses a live alternative. Cost is present (the shawl settles, the promise to return) but accumulative rather than a decisive narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—learning to persuade mirrors to show possibilities—is signaled early and pressure accumulates through the method (coded lullabies), the glass-trembling beat, and the corridor of two-future trees. One meaningful tightening occurs when the narrator must match breath to heartbeat and sing the tune of "stay/if/unless," narrowing from desperation to disciplined coaxing. Agency is visible (singing, breathing) but the escalation remains textural rather than a sharp reversal or trade-off; no live option is visibly sacrificed on the page, and coincidence (the painter appearing, the mirror cooperating) facilitates rather than complicates, keeping cost legibility at mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (brokering peace through ritual, not spectacle) is signaled by line 10. One meaningful tightening: the soldier's demand for penalty meets the counterargument about prison, resolved by the negotiator's reframing ("redemption is priced by work shared"). Agency is renunciation and endurance (they sign nothing yet but draft the breathing) with visible cost (provisional agreements, annual vow). Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens: each ritual addition (names, casings, facing the sea) deepens commitment. No coincidence resolves; the delegates' shared stance emerges from the negotiator's facilitation and the children's voiced needs. Cost is legible in the final image: the promise to feed tomorrow, to let enemies sleep, to return annually.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving bird echoes through manufactured drought—is signaled early and tightens when the egg cracks and releases powder. Agency appears in the ritual's execution (striking tuning fork, setting speakers, lowering egg) with visible cost (egg grows lighter, spine slackens). The manufactured rain at closure reweights prior choices, though the escalation reads more as ceremonial deepening than a turn that forecloses options. No explicit antagonist; pressure coheres through the protagonist's internal calculus and the environment's response.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—defying the palace's lullaby of conformity by freeing trapped voices—is signaled early. One tightening occurs when guards approach and "the window between sigh and smile began to shrink," forcing the courtesan to quicken her knotting. Agency is present (she descends, reweaves threads, times the ritual), yet the guards pause without on-page confrontation and the city's waking feels like an off-stage result rather than a dramatized reversal. Cost to the protagonist is implied ("courage rather than etiquette") but not made visceral; we do not see what she loses or forecloses by this act.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—exploring ethical storytelling—is signaled early and sustained. The tightening occurs when the woman enters and her notes transform the show's structure, foreclosing the old method. However, the escalation is recounted in summary ("We built from her notes…their sentences curved like fish") rather than dramatized beat-by-beat, and the opening night is compressed into mood rather than a live choice under pressure. The story delivers one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens, but the cost at closure remains atmospheric rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories before they vanish—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure deepens through the monarch's arrival (last verb of a vanishing language) and the hawk shadow interruption. Agency is present in the act of building signals and the spoken promise, but the final lying-in-stillness reads more as receptive waiting than a choice that forecloses a path with on-page cost. One meaningful tightening (the cadence interrupted by danger, then resumed) narrows the narrator's options under the inferred Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (preserving forgotten names in cast bells) signaled early and pursued through escalating technical choices. The grandmother's bell error adds visible prior cost and motivates return. One meaningful tightening: aligning aurora, card scrap, and wax to capture the transcribed memory. Agency is clear in the rope-braid manipulation and pour. Minor: the escalation reads as procedural accumulation more than a narrowing of options; coincidence (aurora timing) facilitates rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering why some paths choose their walkers—is signaled early and drives the protagonist's ritual of dream translation and archive consultation. Pressure escalates when the storm approaches, the wafer seal breaks (a one-way commitment), and the archive recovers the verb "to shepherd," which transforms the directive from command to invitation. The final door opening is protagonist-driven agency with visible cost: "the choice arrives as weather does, inevitable because it has already begun," and the protagonist steps through, foreclosing return. One meaningful tightening occurs; coincidence (the storm's timing) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—seal a covenant with the unknown through maintenance—is signaled early ("I was the frugal astronomer…paying attention instead of rents") and tightens when the tile's sums converge on the alcove. Agency is renunciation and endurance: the narrator pledges "oil when oil was spare," explicitly forgoing power for stewardship, and the price (scarcity, patient hours, erasure of grandeur) is legible on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when the disk unscrolls the map requesting "a steward who could promise nothing except maintenance," narrowing options to a vow the narrator can afford. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through layered particulars (tile, arcs, urn, disk, thread) without requiring a set-piece reversal; the final act—writing the name and pledging resources—forecloses spectacle with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—teaching Rell to release resentment—is signaled early and pursued through one meaningful tightening when cellular memory opens the factory corridor and Rell gathers his mother's breath, forcing a shift from blame to forgiveness. The resolution (resentment loosens, he kneels, returns unspent years) is earned by prior setup, but the escalation is smooth rather than pressured; Rell does not resist or make a trade-off on the page, and the narrator's agency operates as guide rather than protagonist under constraint. Cost is implied (the narrator's solitude, Rell carrying the broken pin) but not sharply visible in the climactic beat itself. One tightening is sufficient for this length under the accumulative lens, but the lack of a visible price that alters tactics keeps this in the mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (capture the runaway dream before it severs the district) is signaled early and drives all beats. One meaningful tightening occurs when the corridor wobbles as the dream thrashes; Ilen steadies Noor's breath by counting orchard seasons, and the dream begins to listen—a narrow causal choice that alters tactics from chasing to teaching. The final settlement (dream shouldering beside them, willing) results from synchronized breathing and the recreated room, fulfilling the protagonist's plan. Cost is visible but muted: not all fences return, boundaries erase only where harshness pretended to be order—conceptual consequence rather than visceral forfeit. Agency is present (Ilen's heel-touch steadies rhythm, his memory of fruit weight grounds the work) but reads more as skilled execution than agonized trade-off. No antagonist; coincidence does not resolve. Escalation under Accumulative lens: density increases (fractured twilight → corridor → glint) and the cadence shift at "Gentle, he murmured" reweights the approach from force to care.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is bridging generational wisdom through the orchard's repair, signaled early ("I came for another reason too, quieter and sharper than money"). Pressure tightens through the ritual sequence: the narrator must start the shedding without choir or calendar, uses the ribbon to ring the bell, and the pruning/grafting acts foreclose both forcing reunion and abandoning connection. The final graft with the ribbon is protagonist-driven agency that narrows options with visible cost (the daughter may return or Mira may wear it; either way, the father waits). One meaningful tightening under Accumulative lens suffices. Band guardrail for 8.8+ typically requires a visible price charging the final image; here the unopened tin and ribbon-as-bridge carry that cost, meeting threshold. Slight abstraction in "because some economies grow from gifts the books cannot tally" keeps it shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—pursuing forbidden knowledge—is signaled early but remains abstract. The move from bathroom pod to forbidden grove tightens options, and the tree's whispered rule ("ask with your lineage") narrows his approach, forcing him to use the cameo rather than voice. The choice to eat the dullest fruit feels arbitrary rather than a trade-off under pressure; no live option is visibly foreclosed. The orchard claiming him in return is stated but not dramatized with felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.2)
    One dominant stake is signaled early (find the library of unlearned lessons) and pressure coheres through gap-reading, diary-following, and the apprentice rescue. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening when the library opens and questions are allowed without exile. However, escalation feels more atmospheric than driven by protagonist agency: the bookstore rearranges itself, the traveler reappears with instructions, and the resolution hinges on collective whispering rather than a choice that forecloses a live option. The cost of "being allowed to err" remains conceptual; no visible price (time, stamina, tool, social credit) alters tactics or charges the final image with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—find the garden of forgotten names—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the not-mine voice reveals "the price was that you would forget," introducing a trade-off between discovery and twin-self. The protagonist's final act (pouring soil, breathing to wake "unkindled solace," planting the jar) enacts agency, yet the garden's approach feels externally granted rather than earned by protagonist decision. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as density increase (booth voice, carousel gesture, jar discovery, shore appearance) rather than narrowing options, and no live tactical cost or forfeited path is dramatized—"one hand letting go" remains metaphoric.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring order by reuniting divided records—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when crossing or uncrossing blackened rope strands dims or brightens the doorway, narrowing options and forcing a precise method. The protagonist drives the escalation through agency (counting wraps, pressing seal to ribbon), and the closure forecloses the path of leaving absence untranslated. Cost is conceptual and legible but not visceral: no live option is dramatized as lost, and the archivist's calm competence leaves little room for felt trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake signaled immediately: find the quiet in the storm before maps break into useless echo. Pressure accumulates through the beings' arrival, their overfull abundance, the caves' instability, and the mapkeeper's need to plant the bloom without precedent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist places the stone, breathes with the corridor, and the beings draw closer with "cores troubled by memories of windless skies"—the moment that narrows options and forces technique under scrutiny. The bloom's taking and the beings' softening constitute the turn, and the cost is visible: ongoing tending, the map now holds their hinge, hands remember the motion. Escalation under the accumulative lens reads as density increase and pattern break (fizzes dimming to slow aurora, cracks softening) that reweights the stake with undeniable effort.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: rekindle the beacon to call lives from the saltlands and prove coincidences have meaning. The custodian's agency drives pressure—tracking star paths, adjusting mirrors, recognizing the shard's role. Lio's arrival tightens the problem (matching star map, missing constellation), and the repair sequence escalates through tactile struggle ("trimmed the shard with heated wire, listening to its mute cries"). The resolution is earned by their joint work, and the campfires answering the beam show visible consequence. Cost is present but muted: the protagonist remains in role, and the ending tilts toward communal uplift rather than a hard trade-off or foreclosed path, keeping this mid-7s under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator can claim personal identity within collective memory—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the narrator risks self-disclosure (plum memory), forecloses the option of remaining purely archivist, and earns inclusion. The cost is legible: vulnerability and the "temporary seam" that stitches identity to the archive. Under the Accumulative lens, the pressure deepens rather than reversing; the plum moment reweights prior doubt. Agency is clear but the escalation is incremental rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: defy hopelessness through fireworks performance. The discovery of the knot and pact with Lark provides one meaningful tightening that narrows options—they commit to the night's performance. However, escalation is largely atmospheric rather than driven by protagonist agency under pressure; the fireworks succeed without visible friction or trade-off. The "gravity loosen, not vanquished, but persuaded" registers as conceptual rather than a choice that forecloses a path. No moment where failure genuinely threatens or where the protagonist must sacrifice one good for another.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (whether to go inland) is signaled early and sustained. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through the pause itself, which functions as a container for competing future visions. The narrator's sidelong seeing of three futures (arguments compacted, grotto silting, comfort mistaken for completion) narrows options by making consequences tangible. One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator recognizes "we needed was naming passage" rather than outcomes, shifting tactics toward shared migration. Cost is legible: leaving the coast, carrying tidepool methods into alien terrain. Agency is renunciation of staying and affirmation of change, forecloses the path of comfort, and the cicada's split-metaphor enables the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: finding a silence the father could understand, braided with the risk that too much gilded hush will erase her need for exits. Pressure coheres across the catalogue (citrus-ache laughter-silence, rain-copper apology-silence) and tightens when she catches the rarest one by limiting exposure, then deepens when she shares it with her father—his recognition ("tastes safe... like stepping into a room you have never left") forecloses her solitary hoarding and opens collaborative redesign. The cost is visible: she risks her own dissolution and succeeds in altering his bunker logic, with the final image of sprouting openings together showing the trade-off between solitary collection and shared creation.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: whether the operator can catalyze comfort for the mathematician's grief-entangled problem. The pressure is situational and accumulative rather than causal-agonistic: the mathematician's resistance to the schedule, her need to "be held" by air rather than proof, builds through conversation and sensory immersion until she stops computing and breathes differently. One meaningful tightening occurs when she "does not try to compute the angle of our sway" and asks the operator to name the work. The cost is legible in her relinquishing the equation's logic, a path foreclosed. Agency is present but quiet—attention and calibrated drift rather than decisive confrontation. The escalation is modest, fitting the lens, but could bear more visible friction or trade-off to reach higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—find the stairway before sunrise or lose the throne for another century—is signaled in paragraph five and tightens spatially (cross tramlines, breach waterfall, decode murals, open hatch, descend). Agency is clear: the narrator uses the ruby flake twice (split broadcast, align bridge) and makes the closure choice to refuse singular rule. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as density increase and cadence shift: the murals "breathed in thin sighs," the bridge "clicked together," and the throne "hummed like a heart in a radio." Cost is conceptual and relational: the throne remains unbound, governance becomes seasonal duet, and "the chair stayed nobly empty." However, the sunrise deadline loses urgency after the hatch opens; no on-page clock reminder tightens the descent or chamber negotiation, and the final paragraph reports "until sunrise arrived full and forgiving" without dramatizing the remaining margin or consequence if they had been late.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—teaching the suffocating to breathe while honoring the cost of leaving—is signaled early and tightens through the lesson with the student. The doorknocker's chill and the scars provide persistent constraints that shape tactics. Agency is renunciation: the narrator steps aside, foreclosing the role of escort. The tightening is visible when the student's readiness ("no longer smoke but silhouettes") alters the narrator's next move. Cost is felt: the girl's refusal to look back confirms the lesson's success and the narrator's solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake signaled early: translate pressure into value, survival after scam trauma. One meaningful tightening: gauges "flirt with the red," parallel-dimension texts escalate instructions, and the protagonist must choose whether to trust ghost-selves and "let the vow cut you before it cuts the crop." Agency is decision (installing the bolt, signing the console, opening the feed) with visible cost: accepting vulnerability, relinquishing patent control, volunteering post-success. The chamber's transformation and diamond bloom narrow options (the method cannot be replicated without trust) and foreclose the purely transactional path. Escalation driven by protagonist choices under the accumulative lens; cost unmistakable in the charity delivery and refusal to commodify the method.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the hidden truth and deciding what to do with it—signals early and tightens when the ash-letters spell the confession. One meaningful reversal: the protagonist arrives believing the fall was shameful defeat, discovers it was strategic mercy, and the discovery forecloses restoration ("Do not rebuild the throne"). Agency is renunciation with visible cost: leaving the seal, pocketing the crank as gavel, walking away with "empty hands." Thegramophone mechanism and caretaker's choreography apply escalating pressure that narrows options under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: capturing the shape of possibility. The orchard's pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens—each beat (program whispers, armor removal, ladder climb) deepens the knight's commitment and narrows options. The cost surfaces explicitly: "choose one shape and release the others, or else drown in a statistics of miracles." One meaningful tightening occurs at the crooked ladder and kernel, where the choice crystallizes. The protagonist's agency is contemplative rather than agonized; the escalation relies on accumulation and setting invitation more than internal resistance or external antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: transforming the "unknown" into something examined and bridgeable. The discovery of the button tightens options (the archivist must respond), and the addendum plus envelope choice narrows the path from passive record-keeping to active hope with visible cost (vulnerability, the risk of never meeting Micah). Escalation is Accumulative: dust-reading → button discovery → file review → addendum → envelope → photographing the shelf. One clear deepening: the realization that the retired counselor left breadcrumbs shifts the archivist from solitary to accompanied. Agency is decision and attention that forecloses detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—restoring deleted voices to the museum—is signaled early and pursued consistently. However, escalation under the accumulative lens relies on atmospheric intensification (moths thickening, police siren wheeling) rather than a meaningful on-page tightening that narrows Mara's options or raises cost. The reversal (captions beginning to "sweat," voices returning) is asserted as future consequence rather than dramatized with immediate, visible price. Mara faces no on-page resistance or tactical dilemma; the process unfolds without friction, limiting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—hush the prophecy before listeners outside read it—is signaled early and held coherently. Escalation under the accumulative lens proceeds through three iterations: first letters, second line, and the final figure, each demanding adjusted technique and deepening urgency. Agency is clear in repeated micro-adjustments (feathering, changing embouchure, sliding registers) that foreclose the prophecy's completion. The cost is legible in the final ring "held open and harmless" and the protagonist's departure carrying the oath. No major reversal occurs, but the textural tightening through repetition with variation is sufficient for this length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—decoding leaf-messages to guide villages—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the ritual sequence (leaves drift, dust speck warms, phrase emerges), yet no reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off. The narrator's agency is descriptive and observational; the key realization arrives as insight rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation would require density or cadence shift that reweights cost; the final act (feeding the sentence to the airstream) reads as closure of the ritual loop, not a tightening with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake signaled early: how to repair/rebuild after failure. Escalation under Accumulative lens occurs through density increase—each discovery (compass, greenhouse, stairs, waterfall, journal, hearth token, key) reweights the approach until the water-clock assembly crystallizes a new method. Agency is clear: the protagonist chooses to follow the compass, study the spray's rhythm, read the journal, and build the clock. The cost is legible: abandoning the old workshop's precision and accepting "traveling without certainty." One meaningful tightening: the waterfall's rhythm forces adaptation ("I could not plan for water, so I did what brass teaches: improvise"). No requirement for multiple reversals under this lens; the single deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—redeem Mara's loss through measured proof—is signaled by paragraph 3 and tightens across six escalating steps: repair cup, test names, feed name to furnace, add jacket button/hair, fuse coin. Agency is renunciation with visible cost: the narrator tempers grief into an alloy rather than demanding resurrection. The accumulative lens governs: each step narrows options until only fusion remains. The final carrying of the heavier coin forecloses bargaining, establishing Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—coaxing lost voices home by integrating laughter into healing—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs when the woman's voice arrives hesitant, confesses fear, and is coaxed through joke-telling until she "climbs the harp's crooked ladder toward a clearing." Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through rising motif density (harp, tooth, river), but escalation is additive rather than narrowing options—no live tactic is foreclosed, no visible price paid that alters subsequent moves. The protagonist remains functionally passive, facilitating rather than choosing under friction. Cost is atmospheric ("light wearing her name") rather than legible as forfeiture or tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—discovering the mathematics of mercy to "learn when to stop the turn of the screw before a soul fractures"—is signaled early and pursued throughout. The forest's algorithm demands honesty from the body, creating one meaningful pressure point when "equations reach into that line and pluck a fraction." Yet the tightening is conceptual rather than agonistic; no live option is foreclosed, no trade-off forced. The protagonist walks away with the theorem intact, the caretaker nods approval, and the cost remains implied rather than dramatized, capping escalation at mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—honoring an overlooked child's history—is signaled early and tightens when the lens reveals coordinates and the protagonist speaks them back into the canvas. One meaningful deepening: the act of naming forecloses anonymity with relational cost (the painter nods, the frame is tied with sailcloth bearing her name). Agency is decision and renunciation (choosing to speak the name rather than sell or withhold). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; coincidence does not resolve. Minor deduction: the painter's complicity and the child's erasure are told more than tested on the page, limiting escalation texture.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—discover what ceilings hide / balance the ghost debt—signals early and tightens through the mainspring discovery, which narrows options to engage or leave. The choice to unwind backward is protagonist-driven and forecloses the haunting with on-page cost (the room exhales, ledger entries cross out, buzz dies for good). The price is legible: "paid in breath enough" and the receipt-burden the protagonist carries out. Under the accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening suffices; the coiled tension unwinding registers as escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: maintain the library's survival through destabilizing wobble versus sinking into flawless stasis. The frost clause ("compress eternity into a moment") introduces a hunger the operator shares, raising personal and systemic cost. Pressure tightens when "the oldest pane...chose rupture" and the cloud sea tests the roots. The operator's agency—setting the line, pulling the lever—drives the turn; the library's rejection of perfection (it "flinched back") demonstrates on-page consequence. One credible escalation with felt trade-off: the mother's wish is honored in a closed circle, then released to preserve buoyancy.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (reimagine the civilization's nature) is signaled early and coheres through escalation: private discovery → public readings → formal adjudication. One meaningful tightening occurs when the council vote forces institutional recognition, foreclosing the narrator's solitary interpretation with visible cost ("my revolution remained defunct"). Agency is clear—devising ritual, summoning crowds, presenting evidence—and the storm-admission at council crystallizes pressure. Ledger's opposition applies sustained counter-pressure without requiring multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaim stolen light—is signaled in the opening promise and tested across escalating thresholds: door (truth vs. collapse), chamber (offering vs. refusal), covenant (shadow vs. keeping light). The rust's terms narrow options with visible cost: shadow forfeiture and ongoing labor ("mending what isn't torn"). The tightening is causal under the Accumulative lens: confession → rust listens → binding requires collateral → light tethered to attention. The story delivers one decisive deepening (light becomes conditional on listening) with cost legible on the page and a persistent constraint (shadowless vigilance) shaping the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—finding "the place where explanations fail"—is signaled in the opening act and tested through three psychometry beats that accumulate contradictory images until the lagoon refuses logic. The protagonist's agency drives each step: she follows the compass, releases scents to open seams, and finally sends boots out in an offering that the water rejects, forcing her to sit and listen until the scarf ledge appears. The visible cost is renunciation of the compass (her father's tool) and acceptance that awakening leads "only back to courage," foreclosing the easier path of mechanical answers. One meaningful tightening—water returning boots—narrows options and shifts tactics to seated listening.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake: to reimagine passage when markers vanish. The GPS failure introduces loss of navigation, and the storm pressures the protagonist toward the archway. However, escalation is minimal; the cartographer's gift and the slide's layered meanings provide solutions without forcing trade-offs. The gate construction proceeds smoothly with ghostly collaborators who "nod" approval. One tightening occurs (storm turns from "anger" to "rhythm"), but agency feels more like execution of instructions than a choice that forecloses a path. Cost is announced ("vow to keep building") rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—uncovering suppressed civil-rights records—is signaled early and coheres under Accumulative/Textural pressure. One meaningful tightening occurs when the clerk empties stenograph punches into the archivist's hands, unlocking erased testimony and forcing the choice to publish. The retrocognitive trap raises visceral cost (scalding reverie, inability to breathe), and the resolution pays a visible price: the archivist remains partially trapped while the city speaks. Agency is clear (arranging patterns, calling for parley, filing evidence), though much pressure is delivered through mystical mechanics rather than antagonist resistance, which slightly softens the felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: coax life back without divine mercy, rebuild through labor and trust. Pressure accumulates as Iria moves from solitary acts (lighting three lanterns, writing invitations) to collective action (sailor arrives, scattered people called, meal and sweeping). One meaningful tightening: the bell's ring summons the townsfolk, transforming solitary conception into witnessed, accountable labor. Cost is conceptual—wishes rejected, ease refused—but felt in the shift from wish-granting to the "first market arguments." Agency is consistent (Iria's refusal and methodical conception drive every beat) though the sailor's convenient arrival softens protagonist sole-agency at the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to archive a prophecy that would pin a child's breath—is signaled clearly by mid-story and tightens when the scribe's own future voice warns against the vow. The scribe's agency is renunciation with visible cost: unarchived work, professional restraint, departure without the usual closure ritual. The orchard's threat (fruit drop, root crack, lost vowels) raises external pressure, and the harbor memory seeds the final choice. One meaningful tightening occurs when the prophecy names the exact harm, forcing the ethical calculus. Weakness: the middle ritual beats feel processual rather than escalating; we cycle through languages and basin work without a failed attempt or complication that narrows options before the prophecy arrives.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake signaled early: restore the orchard by receiving and releasing the vortex of seasons. One meaningful deepening occurs when Return teaches the protagonist to "turn the key" by singing layouts and humming names—the tactic shifts from waiting to active transmission. The cost is legible: the protagonist steps into the seasons "to discover the texture of borrowed time, then pass through," forfeiting permanent control. No antagonist; pressure accumulates through the ritual's demands and the need to release rather than hoard. The line "you kept it without keeping it" articulates the trade-off. Agency is present but slightly diffused by the lyric mode's reliance on abstract imagery in the seasons passage.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether to sound the alarm or wait—is signaled early and tightens through micro-pressure: model's red lattice, raw corridor carving toward the pass, valley station demanding confirmation, budget audits favoring decisiveness. One meaningful deepening occurs when the bell's restraint persuades the storm corridor to falter and split, demonstrating that listening altered the weather's intention with visible cost (institutional friction, risk of under-warning). Agency is clear: the protagonist's decision to pull the bell rather than throw the main switch forecloses the siren path and stakes the town's safety on soft guidance. The valley station's question and the margin note ("restraint had been actionable data") make the cost and tactical shift legible.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: the protagonist seeks strength through vulnerability and empathic maintenance of the overlooked station. One meaningful tightening occurs when the power fails and plunges the space into "absolute night," forcing a choice to light the room with lantern glass and speak the engineers' names—this act narrows options (cannot simply restore power) and reweights the relationship with the station. The final beat offers a second pressure point: opening the roof and standing exposed to the wind is an act of readiness and attention that the meteors honor by respecting the old boundary. However, agency in both turns leans toward spiritual observation and empathy rather than decisive action with high trade-off cost; the protagonist's choices enable rather than force outcomes, and the meteors' cooperation reads as mystical validation rather than hard-won consequence. Cost is felt (years of waiting, cracked heart, exposure to ice wind) but not sharply foregrounded as a sacrifice at the closure moment itself.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: whether the recluse can witness loss without being consumed by complicity. The covenant ("he promised to witness, and the ghosts promised not to drown him") establishes the terms early. Escalation occurs through accumulative pressure: daily preservation rituals deepen until the queen's arrival forces a shift from passive archive to active acceptance of heat/complicity. The turn at "He had accepted survival as witness, but he had not yet answered for it" narrows options—he must either refuse the queen (breaking the covenant) or accept the burden of holding fire (visible cost: bee stings, indefinite custodianship, marking the hexagon). Agency is clear: sliding the lid open, placing the frame within color, marking the sigil are all protagonist-driven choices that foreclose the path of detached observation. Cost is legible: pain threading present to archive, the kiln metaphor, "the archive accepted the burden without smoldering."

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—rediscovering non-numerical time-keeping—is signaled early and drives the garage-sale encoding, Lio's arrival, and the communal calendar invention. The capsule crack and urn fragment create one meaningful tightening: the narrator must choose patience over force, foreclosing quick answers. However, Lio's collaboration introduces no friction or competing method; coincidence (someone who reads breadcrumbs correctly) advances the plot without protagonist struggle. The final choice to "not mind the waiting" carries conceptual cost but lacks a visible tradeoff or forfeited path, keeping escalation pressure in the mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—helping the boy process loss—is signaled when the kite string snaps and intensifies through the poet's interventions: composing aloud, offering the feather, co-creating the raft. One clear tightening occurs when the boy asks "Is it fixed" and the poet's answer ("the song is richer in the torn places") forecloses easy repair, accepting incompleteness as the resolution. The cost is visible: the kite remains lost, and the boy must carry "a new listening" rather than recovered joy. Agency belongs to the poet's choices (rising, offering, tending), and the boy's participation (drawing loops, embodying the lesson) earns the shift in his breath and stance. Under the Accumulative lens, this single deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—remodel the orchard as a farewell act fostering interspecies respect—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the orchard begins to respond, narrowing options to negotiation rather than imposition. The late communal shift (council, otters, neighbors) adds texture but diffuses rather than escalates pressure; the protagonist becomes facilitator, not protagonist under duress. Agency at closure is present (placing the diary, winding the final copper circle) but reads more as ceremonial completion than a choice that forecloses a live alternative with sharp cost. The Accumulative lens permits this cadence shift, but the final third lacks a second pressure point to test commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: understanding homecoming's chemistry without succumbing to ritual fog. The narrator's skepticism faces one tightening when the facilitator smiles at dissent and the amber-drop reaction shifts perception from suspicion to acceptance. Agency is attention and acceptance rather than decision; the protagonist does not choose to refuse or alter the ritual, only to reinterpret it. Cost is conceptual—rebellion "grown into its own discipline"—but no live option is visibly foreclosed. The convergence and basin-carrying are participatory but do not narrow choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—letting a garden reclaim the battlefield—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Pressure accumulates through textural density rather than sharp reversals: he plants, he listens, he removes bayonets, he recites prayers. The closest tightening is the discovery of the bayonet pit and the choice to convert it into a lattice, which narrows his method but doesn't foreclose a live option or impose visible cost. The ending deepens by naming the jetty "narrow as mercy," but cost remains atmospheric rather than a specific trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—translate distance into closeness—is signaled in paragraph 9 and tightens through the riddle, cylinder decoding, and relay walk. One meaningful deepening: the vendor's riddle reweights the leaf into actionable signal, and the dusk ritual narrows options to this exact method. The relay conversation at closure delivers felt cost (the sister's conditional promise "if the salt flats did not rise" forecloses certainty) and reconfigures the narrator's stance. Agency is clear: the narrator chooses to trade, decode, and walk to the relay. Accumulative lens allows coincidence (cylinders exist, relay waits) to complicate without resolving; the resolution arises from the narrator's enacted choices.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: establishing true north amid temporal dilation and social exile. One meaningful tightening occurs when "the stars were not where they should be" and the protagonist realizes the compass rose maps temporal axes (past/present/elsewhere/return), then decides to layer anniversary sketches to chart drift. Agency is choice and endurance: she refuses perfection, names a new custom, and constructs a navigable field from confusion. The blackout as prior cost shapes present tactics (solitary ritual, temporal patience). No explicit antagonist; pressure arises from disorientation and the need for devotion-as-anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—amending the sky's wrongness by swapping weather-knotted secrets with mercy-bound promises—is signaled early and tightens through the sequence of piece swaps. Each swap (pawn, knight, rook, bishop, queen) narrows options by binding the protagonist to their catalog of thefts and future travel. The final queen swap forecloses the path of wage-seeking and crystallizes the vocation. Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens, with visible cost in the protagonist's "trembling certainty" and the teacher's relief. The window showing ships in the stratosphere complicates but does not resolve, consistent with Situational allowances. No redundant loops; each swap advances the board's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—to archive small gestures and unbind the record from spectacle—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the ritual: spelling "water," arranging human pawns, spelling "stay," "hear/here," "thanks," and "hush." Each word deepens the method and tests the narrator's ability to hold participants steady. However, escalation is more textural than causal; no live option is foreclosed, and the widow's button gesture in the penultimate beat introduces a new element rather than tightening prior choices. The cost at closure—leaving the gallery to travel with the penumbra—is more thematic than felt, and no antagonistic pressure forces the narrator to choose between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: recover "the shape of home" and "lost rooms." Pressure coheres through the Accumulative lens: feather on tongue, stone vision, seer's nightly substitution all deepen understanding. One meaningful tightening occurs when the stone reveals the buried accent and its cost. Agency at closure is present—the protagonist chooses to seed tongue and steps—but the escalation reads more as accumulation of metaphor than a narrowing of options or trade-off between competing goods. The seer warns "hold fast" during substitution, suggesting danger, yet no visible price is paid for that moment.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: forgiveness/redemption signaled in paragraph six. Pressure escalates through the tutor's method—each right pull returns a gray second, each wrong brush tastes ashes—until the central choice: release the village entirely (satisfying but reminiscent of past destructive lessons) or "careful increments, lesson by lesson." Agency is decision and renunciation; the protagonist rejects the brilliant sacrifice for pedagogical patience, forecloses the cathartic path, and accepts lasting reminder (pigeons frozen). The trade-off is explicit, the cost felt. One meaningful tightening at the tapestry's center suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake: change how forgiveness is priced, signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the canyon names new terms (colors instead of voice), then the child's chant disperses the artist's doubled price. The artist's agency—spreading cloth, inviting chorus, offering to pay twice—drives the sequence. Visible cost: the artist surrenders the mentor's last morning and feels the weight unclench. No coincidence resolves; the ritual keepers arrive after the voices have already paid. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens and the final color-gift forecloses silence.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake signaled early: "conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" and "complete the memory engine." Escalation under the Accumulative lens: measurements → bell-hum → charm installation → engine speech, each beat narrowing options until the final choice to "finish the rest tomorrow" forecloses despair with visible cost (unsure still, bearing "sharpened hope"). Agency is decision and endurance: the protagonist sets the final pendulum, an act that reweights Mira's absence. No coincidence resolves; the engine offers pattern, not resurrection. One meaningful tightening at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—keeping the hidden promise to paint the inside of the sea—is signaled early and tightens when the painter enters the cave, narrows further when the pool reveals "the quay I paint and the quay I avoid," and crystallizes when the voice says "keep yourself from vanishing into copies." The single brushstroke is protagonist-driven agency under Accumulative pressure, and the cost is legible: the painter must leave rather than inhabit the painting, forecloses the fantasy of permanence, and returns to the quay altered. The corridor closing after the curve is laid demonstrates irreversible consequence. No false reversals; the escalation deepens through recursive mirroring (glass split, pool reflection, corridor passage) until the choice to "not live in the painting" resolves with visible renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: prove whispers reach farther than shouts, tested when the freighter approaches. The narrator's choice to beckon by scent rather than horn tightens options and the freighter's muffled passage confirms success. Escalation deepens when the mentor stops mid-stair, witnessing the hum—his concession ("the right kind of listening is work") exacts a relational cost. One meaningful turn (the captain's salute) validates the narrator's method with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake signaled early: to navigate the geography of loss, not the coastline. One meaningful tightening occurs when the beacon stops sweeping and points inland, forcing the protagonist to journey to the shelter where Mara's notes lie. The inland walk narrows options: the navigator must place the censer foot and complete the compass rather than remain at the station. Escalation under Accumulative lens: density increases as the journey layers memories (hydraulics fail, Mara singing, vowels on driftwood) onto present action, culminating in the recognition that "reverse migration is not return but recognition, not recovery but route." Cost is visible: the station will dim, the pulse famish, yet the protagonist commits to "answer the next midnight call," foreclosing the possibility of cessation.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—cultivating psychological safety through the glass-eye method—is signaled early and tested in two beats: the smuggling gamble and the patrol encounter that nearly exposes the contraband, then the group session where the girl unburdens. The narrator's involuntary truthfulness forces tactical occlusion (smearing clay, careful sequencing of disclosure), and the inspector scene narrows options before the canyon thunder grants reprieve. The ending reweights cost: "Fractured grace is the only style we have left" acknowledges endurance over cure, and "until the eye grows warm from all we allow it to hold" implies ongoing, cumulative labor. One weakness: the patrol's retreat feels partly coincidental (the storm intervenes) rather than wholly earned by protagonist action, softening agency slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—decode the stranger's gesture and answer with light—is signaled at the inciting incident and tightens when the keeper aligns flower to notch, triggering the borrowed memory. The inversion (chest tap, then flower) narrows options: he must reply in the girl's code. Agency is clear in the lantern-swing choice and the deliberate sweeping of the notch. Cost is legible: he assumes permanent ledger-keeper duty for "the sea and its stubborn dead." No wasted escalation; each beat adds pressure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (honoring the promise to find the doorway) is signaled early and tightens at midsummer. One meaningful deepening occurs when the hallway shows alternate routes and the protagonist realizes "the door did not choose for you, it only stopped time long enough to notice." Agency crystallizes in the decision to remove the chip and step where reflections overlap, foreclosing the easy-door path with felt cost. The creek's rise supplies physical urgency. Escalation is driven by protagonist observation and micro-choices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—unraveling the mystery of recurring dreams versus serving the throne—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when the queen meets the wanderer, drinks, climbs, and confronts her stone self. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is a single intensification (the grotto reveal), not a sequence of narrowing choices. The wanderer's warning ("you will choose who rules when you go back, and who you will not be able to forgive") promises a high-stakes decision, but the resolution is abstract: "they unstitched; she was one again." No visible trade-off or foreclosed path appears on the page. Cost is asserted in her whisper but not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—capturing "the density of presence"—is signaled early and persists. However, pressure accumulates through lyric intensification rather than escalation that forecloses options. No reversal or complication tests the protagonists' resolve; the experiment succeeds without visible trade-off. The final "we promise to keep the chamber open" gestures toward ongoing cost but does not name what was spent or what path was closed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear early: "to distill chaos into narrative" and resolve chronological confusion. The tightening occurs when jealousy of past selves sharpens the scroll's letters, forcing them to "confess their pattern," then deepens in the dream when the narrator bargains with feral nostalgia, trading envy for continuity. The final choice—to pack the scroll and patrol forward without correcting the burial—narrows options with on-page cost: accepting death's ledger rather than resurrection. Agency is renunciation with visible consequence ("ready to patrol the day after my own funeral"). One clean escalation under the Accumulative lens; pressure coheres throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (unveil ordinary miracles via repair and emotional terrain-mapping) is signaled early and tightened when the father reveals his partner is laboring and he seeks steadiness through the clepsydra. The midwife's screw arriving as the exact needed piece narrows options in a lyric/Accumulative mode—cost is the screw's irreplaceability and the inheritance's transformation. One meaningful deepening (the father learning siphon-clock breaths) alters his stance from fear to permission. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but escalation is gentle; the screw's arrival borders on convenience, mitigated by its thematic charge. No visible trade-off forecloses a live option at closure, capping the band.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: transform scars into runes within a held breath. Pressure tightens as each rune is drawn and the breath-hold approaches its limit—"my chest is starting to burn," "my breath thunders in its cage." The final act (drinking the tea with the runes) is driven by the narrator's agency under accumulative pressure. Cost is legible (breath exhaustion, the embodied risk of the rite), though the resolution feels more ritual-complete than hard-won. No multiple reversals are required; one meaningful deepening is present and sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (deliver apology and earn forgiveness) is signaled in paragraph five and tightens when Mara's stylus writes "You left" and later "Forgive." The narrator's agency escalates from passive guilt to active exposure (calling the foreman), a choice that narrows options and carries visible career cost. The metronome's uneven ticking and the stylus drawing a peach operate as pressured reversals that demand response. The final nocturne is an imperfect miracle earned by prior causality, with cost (career scandal, incomplete reunion) unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—unifying the broken record to avoid falling into its echo—is signaled early and tightens through the spiral arbitration's demand to "weigh illusions against their cost, breath against breath." The narrator's agency appears in loosening the straps, speaking the illusions, and revising the margin note, each narrowing certainty and reweighting the task from judge to hinge. However, the escalation is more conceptual than visceral; the turns are renunciations of stance rather than choices between competing goods with immediate cost, and no live option is visibly foreclosed—the path expands rather than contracts.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake signaled early: to understand what clocks measure beyond forced obedience. One meaningful tightening occurs when Basin Three lags, forcing the protagonist to count backward and discover "razor edges where one state cuts into another." Agency is renunciation and endurance (staying after shift, refusing correction in the note), with visible cost in the bleeding finger and the boundary event left unresolved. The backward-counting method imposes a constraint that narrows options and deepens perception, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—widening perspectives responsibly—is signaled early and tightens when the theorem stub offers both warning ("Practice risk as stewardship, not as theater") and template for the seminar. The narrator's agency is renunciation and endurance (accepting the father's legacy with revised framing), not a dramatic reversal. Pressure accumulates through reflection and motif layering rather than a single sharp turn, consistent with the Accumulative lens. Minor deduction: the tightening feels more lyric and cognitive than visceral; no moment of high-cost choice under immediate external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: sustaining her practice of cultivated estrangement as a necessary method for helping misdialed strangers. The emergency-line crisis tightens options—she must risk connection by looping the child through Rojo and Flora, testing whether her method can scale under life-or-death pressure. The resolution is earned by her choice to route rather than speak directly, maintaining her stance while expanding its reach. Cost is legible: Rojo and Flora hang up "ending something that had begun before they noticed beginning," and Mara feels the "melodically haunted quiet return," a price paid for her persistent separation.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: the woman seeks covenant repair; secondary: the archivist's archival mission. Pressure accumulates through the ritual (ink prep, proximate-cause questioning, jetty walk) but escalation is gradual rather than sharp. The footsteps introduce a reversal, yet the coincidence undercuts protagonist agency—the reunion is situational luck rather than a choice the woman or archivist forces. The couple's subsequent ladder-building ("bus, thermos, pink scar") is told rather than dramatized, reducing visible cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: catalyzing return (of train/conversation/community) to cure loneliness without calling it miracle. One meaningful tightening occurs when rain and power failure force real-time logistics (candles into routes, strangers into households), raising immediate cost. The trolley's arrival—dragged by neighbors, not rails—pays off the rumor setup and earns the protagonist's withdrawal. Escalation reads through accumulative pressure rather than reversal; the logistician's agency manifests in redirection and pairing until the system self-sustains, but the final choice (slipping the moon rock, mislaying name) feels more thematic exit than high-cost forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—learning grief's coast rather than erasing it—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist kneels to dowse and the hidden stillpoint is revealed, but this moment is observational rather than a choice that narrows options. The resolution (tracing sorrow's lines, accepting the stillpoint as axis) is recounted in summary without a visible trade-off or forfeited path. Agency appears as attention and endurance, but cost is asserted ("ache," "losses") rather than demonstrated through a specific on-page price that alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake signaled early: the protagonist seeks to "thresh meaning from experience" and escape the debt of failed crops. Pressure tightens when the broadcast speaks of "crops, calendars, and apology," making the abstract personal. The protagonist's agency—taking Del's pen, writing furrows, allowing Del to guide the lines—produces the interference melody and seed manifest, a tightening that forecloses passivity with visible cost (the timeline becomes contingent, clocks "forgot which wrist they loved"). The escalation is driven by protagonist choice under the accumulative lens, and the cost is felt in the addendum's impossible date. One micro turn (Del's guidance) supports the final reconfiguration without fragmenting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake—"translate silence into music"—is signaled early but remains abstract. The bell-ring and pencil sketches constitute actions, yet no genuine tightening or trade-off narrows options; Arin encounters permission and cooperation rather than resistance. Escalation under the Accumulative lens would require density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost; here the final image repeats the premise without demonstrable loss or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—honoring Miren's promise to shelter readers—is signaled early and carries moral weight. The arson backstory provides context, but on-page pressure remains largely episodic: each clue (painted birds, mosaic, portrait gouge, spool) is solved without complication or cost. The seed-planting is framed as climactic, yet no antagonist, time limit, or internal hesitation tests the protagonist's commitment. One meaningful deepening occurs when the hidden message links past and present names, but agency reads as following a pre-set trail rather than making a trade-off that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—reconnecting with Mira before the treatment resets—is signaled early and tightens through the drumming ritual, the bridge crossing, and the final awakening. Agency is clear: the narrator's decision to "carry what did not belong, if it returned Mira breathing" forecloses a path (accepting the donors' intrusion) with visible cost. The escalation deepens under the Accumulative lens: drumming → bridge of tone → shared breath at the crack → Mira's eyes opening. The cost is legible on the page: "I promised them I would tap out their names each dawn until their echoes felt at home."

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: prove whispers outrun shouts and retrieve the courier faster than Rade's men. The challenge initiates pressure, Ivo's method narrows the search (folding the map, tapping the brass key, reading boot scrapes), and the jammed gate forces a final tactical choice (zodiac coin to hinge, key to drainage slot). One meaningful tightening occurs when the whisper finds the courier and Ivo must navigate around the shouting searchers. Cost is relational and reputational (Rade's authority versus Ivo's quiet expertise), legible in Rade's final surrender. Agency is consistent; coincidence (the storm) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—teaching darkness the value of stars, literalized as grief work for the brother—is signaled by line 34 and drives the mirror exchange. One clear tightening: the guardian gives the narrator the mirror (agency transfer) and the narrator angles light toward drowned arches, forcing confrontation with the brother's refusal. The barge pilot's unclenched pain provides secondary evidence that the method works. Escalation reads accumulative under the chosen lens: density increases from passive witness to active participant, and the cost is visible when the narrator "told him the secret I had withheld" and receives stitching-light in return. The ending walk reweights the opening solitude without soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—planting "forests of second thoughts"—is signaled early and drives the window-display choreography and grotto gathering. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is a single deepening (the town slows, the children practice stalemate) without a second beat that narrows options or raises cost. The coach's agency is primarily observational ("I watched"), and the resolution ("we might live with our next moves unfinished") is asserted rather than earned through a protagonist decision that forecloses a path. No persistent constraint (time, resource, opposition) shapes tactics or the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—holding the disappearing island by naming oneself without apology—is signaled early and sustained. The scrimshaw discovery and the whale's call form one meaningful tightening that narrows options toward the crossing. Agency is clear: the protagonist detaches mooring lines, lifts the scrimshaw, speaks their true name, and rows across, all with on-page cost (foreclosing the hardshell identity, risking public scrutiny). The final image reweights the opening premise: post-violence restraint becomes combative tenderness, a visible tactical shift from hiding to witnessing.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (cultivate lightness versus mandated happiness) is signaled early and tightens through inspector visits and the private lesson with microphones off. The protagonist's agency operates through renunciation and performance calibration, each move narrowing options (teaching compliance while seeding the pause). The unannounced inspector scene escalates pressure; the final on-camera line forecloses safety by naming the distinction. Cost is legible: social and economic risk under surveillance.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake: collective permission to speak and gather after years of enforced silence. The piece signals this early but never narrows options through a meaningful tightening—no competing choice or visible tradeoff emerges. The poet invites synchronized breathing and the group follows onto the ice, but these acts feel ceremonial rather than decision-laden; no live cost or foreclosed path is dramatized. Escalation under the Accumulative lens would require a cadence shift or density break that reweights the stake with felt price; instead, the final image asserts resolution ("boundary dissolves responsibly") without demonstrating what was risked or lost.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: Ivo wants to find beauty in imperfection, signaled early. The market of bartered awakenings provides the mechanism for one meaningful tightening: Ivo trades his best brush and a jar of smoke to acquire the reed, a concrete forfeiture. The reed moment deepens the stake by teaching him that "beauty in imperfection is a rhythm" rather than a visual clarity, narrowing his approach and charging his decision to stay. Agency drives the key turn (his choice to whisper colors and wait, then to stay and paint). However, escalation is modest—one trade, one realization, one commitment—and the stakes remain more conceptual than viscerally urgent. The cost is visible (the brush and jar) and felt (he stops searching), meeting the lens requirement for Accumulative design, but pressure doesn't compound through multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—designing an honest pilgrimage through sound—is signaled early and accumulates texture across stations. However, escalation reads as lateral accretion rather than tightening: each station adds sensory threads without narrowing options or raising cost. The volunteer's moment near the ferry bell offers a micro-turn, but the narrator's own choices never face a trade-off or visible price that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: transforming personal grief into a communal grief practice. The protagonist's agency manifests in leaving origami invitations, conducting wire-tracing rituals, and soldering clasps at hesitation points—each narrows options toward sustained vigil rather than closure or escape. One meaningful deepening: the mother's visit crystallizes the ritual's purpose ("intention honors even the broken plans"). Visible cost: the protagonist forgoes closure ("I will be here as long as the curtains lift"), accepting solitude and ongoing work. No false reversals; pressure coheres under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—mapping cultural patterns that survive floods of belief—is signaled early and coheres through client visits. Escalation operates through the Accumulative lens: each client (phone screens, historians, bandmate woman) deepens the methodology's application. The cryptocurrency crash tightens resources, forcing barter and reweighting value systems. The final client's "chorus that will let her sing alone" offers a meaningful deepening but lacks a visible price paid on the page; cost remains conceptual rather than dramatized through forfeiture or embodied consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: to access forbidden knowledge without conquest. The archive tests this through metamorphosis (pagoda opening, tablets offering purity bargains), and the narrator's refusal to bargain with the tablets is one meaningful choice under pressure. However, escalation plateaus after the second landing; the third landing and top chamber deliver visions without additional narrowing of options. The ending resolves by absorption ("breathed until it tasted of mercy") rather than a protagonist-driven decision that forecloses a path. Cost is stated ("alignment, not citation") but not felt in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: restore Ilen's shadow to preserve hope. One meaningful tightening occurs when the library's vines resist, forcing Mira to trade her stored dreams—an on-page choice that narrows options and carries visible cost (the empty casing where her dreams had been). The shadow's separation is established early; the river stone anchors it in a charged beat. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, though Ilen's agency is minimal—he kneels and remembers, but Mira drives all turns. The resolution is earned by Mira's sacrifice; the price (her unlived life) alters the final image and forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: rebuild trust after the con, signaled early ("accounts were hollow"). One meaningful tightening: the tail removal mirrors the thematic choice to strip vanity, narrowing options to transparency. Agency is clear—handler writes the donor letter, names profiteers, invites scrutiny—foreclosing performative redemption with on-page cost ("you will decide"). The chameleon's question-mark tail externalizes the handler's uncertainty. Minor deduction: the broker's betrayal is told in summary, reducing the on-page pressure that forces the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—learning to read stories in scars without opening more wounds—is signaled early and tightens once: the descent into the tunnel is a renunciation of the wound-opening stance, paid for by planting the ivy and releasing the hourglass. The protagonist's agency (choosing to descend, cracking the hourglass, whispering the plant-command) drives escalation under the Accumulative lens; coincidence (the displaced miracle) complicates but does not resolve. The fossil ring discovery deepens knowledge by showing Mira's last gesture was reassurance, which reconfigures the guilt. Cost is legible on-page: the emptied hourglass and the closure-as-garden acknowledgment.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—is signaled immediately and tightens when she discovers her own name on the warehouse shelves, forcing a personal reckoning. This reversal narrows options from professional observer to participant with cost: "expertise and longing had to keep distance." The final action (writing the new goodbye) represents a stance crystallization with visible price—abandoning her safe curatorial role. However, the escalation would be stronger if the piece dramatized what specific conversation or threshold she's been avoiding; the key ring "for a conversation that had aged into shyness" tells rather than shows the concrete choice she now faces.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake (freeing trapped creativity) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the instrument "hums" and the door opens, narrowing the narrator's path to repeated return. The sculptor's release demonstrates visible cost (the narrator must continue for others), but the peak beat—pages drifting, sleep, gallery of breathing statues—is told in summary rather than dramatized with micro-choices that narrow options. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but lacks a second on-page reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: awaken and stabilize the archive to cultivate sparks in the unlit corners. Pressure tightens through humming → clock gesture → whispering charm → spore deployment, each narrowing the archive's instability. The final cost is legible: the guard remains dreamless, "a placeholder for restored woods," trading rest for motion. Agency is visible in micro-choices (flip the clock, choose the shortest night, carry spores to axles) that alter the archive's state.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake: rediscover the wild frontier of the mind by learning the forest's grammar. The hum shifts from counsel to ache, signaling a problem stuck "like a bent cog in thought's teeth," which tightens pressure. The protagonist's agency—choosing to press the gear home despite preferring ruin—forecloses the path of passive observation and triggers the recalibration. One meaningful deepening occurs: the repair unlocks the map and reveals why translocations hurt, reweighting the cost from affliction to pedagogy. Escalation is textural (the hum's ache intensifies, the wind warns then permits, the gap "exact as longing") and culminates in the shelter discovery. The cost is felt: accepting perpetual displacement as the method of self-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding unused courage—is signaled early and tightens through the guides' instruction to "choose the bends that resemble my old fear" and walk them anyway. The protagonist's refusal to reach ("not yet") and later decision to do so constitutes one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. However, the escalation is primarily contemplative; no external complication tests the commitment, and the cost (what is forfeited by claiming courage) remains implicit rather than dramatized as a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—understanding and renegotiating the cost of safety—is signaled early and tightened through the protagonist's acceptance of pain, repair of the bench, and final "playing easing" at the piano. One meaningful deepening occurs at week seven when the radiators pattern becomes legible and the protagonist chooses to remain and let the humming shape breath. Agency is renunciation and endurance with on-page cost: the protagonist does not play notes but creates space, forecloses escape, and accepts cold hope. The bellhop's tears and the fortress's exhale mark a visible shift in the rule without breaking the silence.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—unmasking the pretender—is signaled early and drives all major beats: Lyr's cryptic messages, Serane's arrival, the guided reading sequence, the ink pellet test, and her withdrawal. One meaningful tightening occurs when the pellet rolls across Serane's finger and "ink recognized kinship," forcing confession through physical test rather than argument alone. The accumulative lens supports a deepening rather than a traditional reversal; pressure coheres as Serane moves from confidence ("glass looks stronger than it is when light flatters it") to undoing ("tears brilliant as a forfeit"). The cost is legible—she withdraws her claim, the coronation is canceled, her chosen name blurs—and Lyr's agency (arranging mirrors, deploying the pellet) forecloses her path with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—why paths vanish where maps promise footing—is signaled in the opening quarter and drives all investigation. Pressure accumulates through the assembling of tide logs, torn page, and tapping-code revelation, culminating in the radio call and lantern choreography. The tightening is meaningful: the corridor exists but drifts in time, so the solution redefines the problem from spatial to temporal. Cost is visible in the elders' tears, the nightly reset of lanterns, and the acknowledgment that "nothing assembled stays assembled if it cannot move."

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—finding her father and the Lark—is signaled early and tightens when Mara risks the circuit to ask the machine. One on-page reversal: the bay's answer (map of the Lark's route) transforms her search into a tool for the rebellion's orientation. Agency is clear: her decision to broadcast the route forecloses secrecy with visible cost (exposure to "whoever had silenced them"). The escalation follows the Accumulative lens: pressure deepens as she moves from listening to the stones, to closing the circuit, to projecting the map. The pause in rebellion creates situational pressure that her action reconfigures. Cost is felt in "her knees gave... in release" and stepping into the light "barefoot and sure."

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether to unseal the embryo and claim agency over tradition—is signaled early and escalates through the kite discovery, council refusal, and solitary vault descent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the council folds into refusal, forcing Lida to choose between waiting and acting. The unsealing itself is protagonist-driven and forecloses the path of passive preservation; the seedling's acceptance and the children's laughter on the scaffold confirm the new order. Cost is legible: Lida defies the council oath, acts alone at night, and stakes the valley's future on her interpretation. The vine "borrowed breath" moment and the "declared map into living wood" could be higher-stakes—there's little doubt the embryo will cooperate—but the social and philosophical price is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: learning to build "rooms that storms could enter without wrecking" (integrating trauma without avoidance). The gull rescue provides one meaningful tightening where the freeze response is met and worked through via somatic markers, narrowing the path of pure avoidance. The photograph's final folding at closure shows agency as endurance with visible cost—he can now hold the memory steadily. The helicopter trigger during the gull scene escalates pressure under the Accumulative lens by layering past and present. Minor: the niece conversation adds thematic depth but does not create a second reversal; it deepens rather than turns, which fits the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: Can Mara repair her fractured vision (and the lighthouse's literal beam) before the weight of isolation closes in? The tightening is accumulative: discovery of the broken box → decoding the keeper's thread-chart → descending into the gearhouse → braiding the new wick. Each step narrows options and raises cost; the final act (lighting the flame, writing the commitment) forecloses retreat with visible price. The pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, and the cost—accepting the keeper's mantle, staying to tend faces—is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—ending the market where crisis is currency—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure tightens when the ink reveals the buyer is "not a person but a hunger: an algorithm in the metronome," narrowing options from investigative tracking to confrontation with a non-human force. The protagonist's agency at closure is renunciation: refusing the throne and letting the outline disappear, which forecloses becoming "the trader who sets the tempo." However, the escalation is more Accumulative (gathering clues through ink patterns) than a sequence of reversals that test commitment, and the final cost—becoming outline-less—is more poetic than viscerally felt as a trade-off with immediate consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (preservation vs. escape, silence vs. speech) is signaled early and tightens through the hesitation ritual. The midnight grid-reset provides a timed window that narrows options and forces the release. The cost is legible: professional discipline melts, future uncertain, yet "people did not speak of what moved them, yet their walking changed"—a distributed consequence that reweights the protagonist's isolation. One small gap: the council's impotent response (meeting to "denounce vandalism") could have shown sharper risk to the archivist personally, but the story privileges systemic change over individual peril.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: maintaining the farm as a reconciliation space while the father remains in exile. The trio's arrival tightens pressure—they demand blame and a map to grief—and the narrator's response (plant names, not violence) narrows options and demonstrates cost. The revelation of the father's letter deepens understanding and reweights the vigil with explicit renunciation ("cannot come home until blame learns to breathe"). Agency is enacted through teaching and withholding, though the visitors' conversion happens quickly without visible internal resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is clearly signaled: retrieve the coastline map from the goddess's echo by returning her name from the sleepwalking constellations. The fisher's agency drives escalation—casting silence, walking aisles, planting the spike—and each beat narrows options under the Accumulative lens. The final choice to release the map rather than hoard it forecloses ownership with felt cost: "hold in a way that keeps opening" implies an ongoing discipline. However, coincidence plays a role when the constellations "came down in a zigzag" without prior earned causality, and the goddess's stipulation (return her name) is never explicitly satisfied on the page, leaving closure slightly opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: discover whether the device manipulates news flows. The wager tightens options meaningfully—assume no effect, seal shutters, wait for evidence—and the "emergency light blinks, papers stall" delivers a felt reversal. The board call is protagonist agency with visible cost: she accepts scrutiny and resource constraint ("sanctuary for open data") on the page. The caretaker's lever-touch is his renunciation, and the heiress's choice to believe "just enough to act" shows moral calculus under pressure. One tightening and one deepening escalate cleanly under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—hushing the dissonance of old guilt—is signaled early and pressured through escalating encounters: the letters address the narrator by name, the recorder plays back the cry he ignored, the client arrives with the cabinet as payment, and the final self-tattooing forecloses retreat. Under the Accumulative lens, each beat tightens by adding symbolic and causal weight until the protagonist's choice to "stay and listen" redefines his stance with visible cost (accepting unforgiven state, embedding the tether in his own pulse). Agency is clear in the decision to tattoo himself after the woman leaves. One gap: the woman's arrival feels slightly coincidental rather than motivated by prior action, though thematically it completes the pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—discovering meaning without smoothing the mess—is signaled early and shapes the mandala exercise. One meaningful tightening occurs when the narrator intercedes to redirect the bearded man's dismissive tone, unlocking his real confession and shifting the group dynamic. The tile flake's placement narrows how the group listens, foregrounding a specific vulnerability. Cost is conceptual and felt ("assignment would outlast ritual"), though no live option is visibly foreclosed on the page; the price is ongoing discomfort rather than a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—renaming to bind harm to repair—is clear and tightens once when the boy's request escalates to the perpetrators' trial. The narrator's choice to rename rather than condemn forecloses the "easy echo" path and forces the crowd to accept "a different labor," but the men's compliance arrives without visible resistance or cost to the narrator. Agency reads as decision (the narrator "calls for the men," "asks them to kneel"), yet coincidence assists: the tessera and caps simply "yield four names" without struggle or failure. The resolution depends on the plaza's voice more than the protagonist's alteration or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—helping the ghost achieve a final encore and mutual release—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the ritual sequence: producing echoes, speaking marquee names, stepping through the leaf-door, and the final shared bow. One meaningful tightening occurs when "the ghost turns, genteel panic in his voice, and asks me to anchor the Star before it spills away," raising the cost of failure. The protagonist's agency is active (presses coin, speaks names, walks the aisle) but the ghost remains a recipient rather than co-agent. The ending reconfigures the nightly repetition into intentional closure ("promising to return only if we can finish letting go together"), though the exact trade-off—what the narrator sacrifices—is implied rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—using the pill regimen and light-painting apparatus to access painful memory without flinching—is signaled early and accumulates through taps, breath-counts, and the arcing static. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening: Mara moves from brittle resistance to the cobalt flash that lets her hold her brother's word "like a bird landing in a pocket." The method doesn't narrow options so much as it reweights the emotional cost of remembering, fitting an Accumulative lens. Agency is present but quiet—endurance and attention rather than dramatic confrontation—and the price (no longer burning) is felt rather than forfeited in a decisive trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: "to become the voice of the unknown, without presuming to own it." One meaningful tightening occurs when the storm surge forces immediate action—grabbing the fossil, wedging into the tunnel—and the protagonist must choose whether to remove or relocate the token. The fossil's relocation to "a deeper niche" forecloses the path of portable ownership, establishing partnership terms with visible cost. Agency is enacted through renunciation (not carrying the leaf out) and the logged promise, which binds future action. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: each negotiation step (floating, pressing, waiting, relocating) deepens the relationship with the cave.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (reshape prophecy from lock to key) is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the theft, the jar-opening, the button-sorting, and the ledger-matching sequence. The warehouse opening and villager arrival constitute a meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens, but no live option is visibly foreclosed—no elder confrontation, no risk materialized, no competing path rejected on the page. The cost is conceptual (shared responsibility replaces singular enforcement) but not felt as a trade-off with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: Ansel's return from exile and internal repair, signaled early and sustained. The encounter with Len tightens via the pillbox reveal—microfilm plus ring—forcing a choice between clinging to old secrets or accepting quieter reinstatement. The plan (retire microfilm, keep ring, accept safehouses) narrows options and forecloses spectacle with visible cost. Escalation is modest but coherent under the Accumulative lens: each beat (arrival, message tracing, Len's nod, pillbox opening, decision) deepens pressure without reversal fireworks. Agency is clear: Ansel walks to the edge and releases the film, then slips on the ring—both decisive acts.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—finishing "what we began with that needle" and crossing the palimpsest promise—is signaled early and maintained. The stitching ritual at midpoint narrows options (old letters show through new lines, fog becomes "intelligible drifts"), and the ferryman's recognition that "your road is water tonight" deepens the coachman's stance. Cost is legible in the phrase "not erasing, but warming the scars" and the fog parting "in narrow alleys of view," but the escalation reads as patient accumulation rather than a forced trade-off, consistent with the Accumulative lens. No antagonist appears; the river's resistance is momentary, and the final image lands without visible forfeit beyond ambient transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding resistance to change—is signaled early and deepens through ritual actions. The lantern glass reversal (past/now/almost threads) narrows options by making timelines visible, forcing the potter to choose a stance: she offers kindness across all three. The thrumming response and timeline braid-tightening mark escalation under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible: she expends her last water, fires cups with scavenged material, and walks away leaving her work behind. No antagonist needed; the environment and fractured timelines supply coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—responding to loss by lighting the harbor—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist rows out and kneels at the locked gate. The unlock and flame-lighting are agency moments that foreclose inaction, and the beam's sweep delivers visible cost (accepting the mother's decline, committing to persistent care). One meaningful deepening occurs when the light shifts from private grief to shared relief. The piece does not require multiple reversals under its accumulative lens, and the protagonist's prior delay adds moral friction without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: maintaining the library's resonance and the narrator's independence without "hardening into salt." The stone circle's faltering hum provides one meaningful tightening that narrows options; the narrator must find the knotted resonance and sing the herd call to stabilize shelves and voices. Agency is demonstrated through tool use (angling the sundial) and vocalization (the herd song), and the ending reconfigures the narrator's role from passive cataloger to active tuner. The cost is the acceptance of perpetual vigilance and solitude, legible on the page but quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—helping two estranged lovers rejoin—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the installation's assembly and the arrival of first visitors, then the lovers themselves, tightening as their paper leaves "moved in the breeze until both noticed the shared sway." The final convergence and letter-reading deliver visible emotional cost (vulnerability, public exposure). However, the lovers' agency is minimal; the narrator orchestrates everything, and coincidence (both arriving separately at the right moment) resolves the setup rather than protagonist choice under duress, which moderates the escalation's bite.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—autonomy versus manipulation, the protagonist's integrity versus external orchestration—is signaled early and escalates through discovery, tracing, confrontation with the wave's temptations, and the choice to broadcast countersigns. The wave's offer of tenure and painless nights tests commitment; the protagonist's refusal and the dean's call create a meaningful tightening. Visible cost: walking away from the committee chair, accepting community messiness, labeling a channel for emergencies rather than control. One small gap: the wave's "receding" feels slightly passive; a stronger on-page resistance or consequence from the trickster would have sharpened the final trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: recover the key to unlock the Observatory and understand the spatial mutiny. The protagonist's agency is clear—she signals the sexton, uses the compass point to "prick a triangle," breathes to "invent a larger room," and retrieves the key—and these actions narrow options by committing her to defiance of the Council. One meaningful tightening occurs when the alleys shift and the protagonist's claustrophobia rises ("the old tightness... behind my ribs"), forcing her to use breath and geometry to carve navigable space. The cost is conceptual: the protagonist accepts the role of "wistful rebellion" and the Observatory's revelatory price. However, the escalation is smooth rather than sharp; no reversal threatens failure, and coincidence (the sexton's favor, the key's exact location in the silt) enables success without forcing a trade-off or foreclosing an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: reconstructing Mara's fate when evidence is gone. The narrator's agency drives the search; finding the wrong-color ribbon forces a theory revision that narrows options (Mara traded identities, was displaced rather than simply vanished). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: each fragment—ribbon, case, vial—tightens the emotional and investigative picture. Cost is legible in the painting's ambiguity and the narrator's admission "I do not know who harmed her," though the resolution via letter rather than on-page choice mutes the protagonist's final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—honoring the ancestor's overlooked bravery by restoring the exile system—is signaled early and drives the nail insertion. One meaningful tightening occurs when the narrator discovers the panel and realizes the ancestor designed refuge, not punishment. However, escalation is largely intellectual (decoding stanzas, realizing the circuit) rather than pressure-driven friction with live costs. The director's opposition arrives late and resolves via assertion ("I showed him the couplets, the maps, the nail") without sustained tactical adjustment. Agency is present (the nail insertion) but the path feels prescribed; coincidence does not resolve, yet the lack of genuine obstacles or trade-offs lowers pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—recovering the vanished hitchhiker and resolving the "ledger" debt—is signaled early and tightens when the glass shard is discovered, then deepens at the river meeting where music enacts forgiveness. One meaningful pressure point: the fiddler's choice to "play the measure that forgives" narrows options (acceptance of risk, performative vulnerability) and the system responds with tangible warmth and presence. The cost is felt as conditional reunion ("the ledger closes, if only until another crossing"), foreclosing permanence. Agency is clear: the fiddler's music and choice drive resolution under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—discovering why paths circle back—is signaled early and sustained. The startup's arc provides external pressure, but the piece prioritizes thematic deepening over tightening choices. The shutdown is a reversal, yet it arrives more as confirmation than as a turn that forecloses options with visible cost. Under the Accumulative lens, the escalation registers as pattern accumulation and cadence shift rather than agency-driven narrowing, which keeps this in the mid-6s despite coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (decode temple inscriptions via variable stars) is signaled early and tightens when Mara arrives with her copies. The reversal occurs when the narrator realizes "the lock was our conversation"—variable stars are only the key—narrowing method and raising intimacy cost. The shared reading where Mara speaks counterpoints is the earned escalation; the closure image ("healing travels fastest by ordinary words") makes the conceptual price of vulnerability undeniable. Agency is decision and attention that forecloses solitary decoding.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: recover the frozen confession to expose the mayor's lie. The protagonist's method—expanding circles—tightens when the eighth circle brushes "a cold thread," then escalates as the seed is deployed and the hooks of frozen words twitch. The mayor's corruption (bribes, drowned orchard) materializes on the page with visible cost: his trembling, the crowd's witnessing. Agency belongs to the protagonist's choice to use the seed and guide it through the current. One clear reversal when the lie is chewed away and the truth "stands between us."

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—renegotiating the eclipsed covenant and heeding the garden's voice—is signaled early and coheres through to the ending. One meaningful tightening occurs when the narrator and woman press scars to see the hidden corridor and gardeners, forcing the choice to enter the maze. The ending negotiation ("we told them no") and new vow reconfigure the covenant with conceptual cost (the gardeners' authority is diluted, time becomes conditional). However, the escalation is textural rather than causal: the woman's arrival, the maze-seed's acceptance, and the gardeners' capitulation feel like unfolding revelations rather than choices under pressure that narrow options or exact visible trade-offs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—patching grief's holes—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist encounters the boy with iron shoes. One meaningful turn: bartering the soldier's future for scholar's hush narrows options and forecloses the original path with visible cost (protagonist must plant stories she'll never keep). Agency is decision and renunciation; the Accumulative lens supports pressure through density increase rather than multiple reversals. Cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: reconciling professional distance with unresolved grief after public failure. The tightening occurs when the narrator's hand recognizes the scrap and "my practiced distance flutter[s]," forcing a trade-off between cataloging as "petty cash" and honoring "memory load disproportionate to market." The protagonist's agency (decision to assign differential value and recommend museum placement) drives the resolution. One visible price: the narrator abandons pure emotional insulation, the "professional tape that kept cables from tangling into grief," accepting that "facts could hold space without bricking it shut." The escalation is driven by protagonist choice under the accumulative lens, and the cost is unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake signaled early: prevent drifting rails from sparking. One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist moves trunk by trunk, correcting nodes, then plants the seed in the center cradle—narrowing options from diagnosis to embodied repair. The seed's split and rooting is the decisive turn, earned by prior vocal and tactile work. Cost is legible: the protagonist releases the ambition to "own transition" and accepts a service role. Agency is renunciation with visible on-page consequence (the arbor gathers weight, the seed roots).

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: preserve the woman's migrating identity against erasure by tide and moon. The stake is signaled early ("She needs a book that will hold her shape") and accumulates pressure through a single meaningful tightening: the three pulsing library cards migrate, then settle into "one true name" that neither woman nor bells have yet learned to pronounce. The librarian's agency—taking the cards, pouring words from the creel, allowing contradictions to be smelted—drives the turn. Escalation reads as density increase under the Accumulative lens: the bells learn "a migratory pitch," the kelp coat dries into paper and leaves chlorophyll, and the woman breathes into slackwater calm. Cost is felt but subtle: the woman leaves, the bells fall silent, and the librarian returns to solitary routine. No overt antagonist or multiple reversals, but the moon's erasure threat and the tide's amnesia supply coherent opposition throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—whether to certify isolation or honor connection—is signaled early and deepens when the shell's confessions personalize the abstraction. The moment of hesitation ("the heartbeat of a hesitation") opens the decision space, and the pearl placement is an on-page act with consequence. However, the escalation is textural rather than oppositional; no external pressure tests the choice, and the inspector's professional obligation dissolves without visible cost or friction. The shift from "isolate, calculate, fortify" to "listen, braid, release" reads as internal realization rather than a choice forced by narrowed options or accumulated price.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake signaled early: self-forgiveness for a wrongly mapped flood that killed the brother. The graffiti coordinates provide a tightening: each mark narrows the path toward the shallow. The culvert-mouth arrival and step into the water are protagonist-driven choices that foreclose retreat. Cost is visible: the narrator counts to twelve, releases the sum, and accepts the river's honest weight. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening suffices. The brother's drowning backstory compresses effectively, but the sluice-gate beat ("I had cut a corner to make a deadline sing") trends slightly summary-only rather than fully dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake ("find the library before silence hardened") is signaled early but never escalates or narrows options. The door "would not open for hurry, only for proof that I could wait"—yet waiting and matching breath to the watch succeeds without complication, cost, or trade-off. No reversal or tightening occurs; each step (listen, turn screws, breathe, write) unfolds as a sequence of granted permissions rather than choices under pressure. The confidence man's watch and the cipher resolve problems they did not help create, and the final act (breathing the letter onto the page) costs nothing visible—no renunciation, no foreclosed path, no felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—play the violin to propagate memory versus let the empire archive it—is signaled early and tightened by the noon deadline and the woman's promise. One meaningful reversal occurs when Ilya moves from weighing options to setting bow on ice, narrowing the path irreversibly; the act of playing propagates the dream through the city ("cups paused midair") and forecloses the museum option with visible price (the violin melts, he catches the last drop on his tongue). Agency is clear: Ilya's decision to honor the dream rather than the paycheck drives the closure, and the cost—loss of income, defiance of empire—is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—capturing one last spark before oblivion—is signaled early and sustained throughout. Pressure accumulates through the ritual sequence: cleaning, placing the chip, tuning the radio, hearing the mentor's voice, infusing the balm. One meaningful tightening occurs when the chip warms and "took what was offered," then dims, foreclosing further contact. The cost is legible (the mentor's final traces are preserved but she is irrevocably gone), though the protagonist's agency reads more as witness and facilitator than as a decision that narrows her own live options. Escalation operates under the Accumulative lens via density and cadence shift rather than reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: finding the source of contentment. Pressure tightens when the hairpin unlocks the chamber, narrowing options from search to stewardship. The protagonist's agency drives the turn (pruning, planting map-scraps, releasing the pin), and the cost is legible: she loses the last physical token of her mother yet gains belonging. One clear deepening when the vines respond and the "foolish seeds" sprout, reweighting the quest from possession to cultivation. Escalation is steady under the Accumulative lens but lacks a second sharp reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—whether Lark confesses port bribes or hides them—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure tightens when the chimes offer a third option ("speak and set terms") that refuses binary safety, forcing a harder trade-off: return money, name officials, fund boats through unpopular taxes. The escalation is causal under the Accumulative lens (the third pattern reweights the choice) but relies heavily on the procedural device rather than Lark's internal struggle. Cost is legible—political risk, broken promises—but the narrator's agency dominates the final move, leaving Lark's active choice slightly muted in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: learning "how to be seen" by mastering disappearance. The trance deepens pressure when the narrator sees their persistence as a dam and must choose to "step aside, to be gone without leaving." The agreement to release is a pivot that forecloses the dam-like stance, though the cost feels conceptual (loosening others' binds) rather than viscerally dramatized. The researcher's withholding ("the grotto would answer when it was ready") models the delayed-revelation method and raises epistemic tension. One meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens; the final lines—"I vanished where I hindered, and appeared where space needed"—land as Charged Poise with the cost of persistent restraint implied but not shown in a loss or sacrifice beat.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is signaled early and tested once through the protagonist's shift from active skimming to stillness, tuning breath to birds and pulse. The arrowhead's introduction and final casting constitute a meaningful tightening: the protagonist must choose to release a tool to achieve navigational address, foreclosing the option to retain the skipping stones. The cost is legible (empty cord, stones left for others) and the agency is renunciation, fitting Accumulative pressure. However, the escalation is thin—no reversal or complication resists the protagonist's method—and the "wandering pulse" remains a cooperative atmosphere rather than an antagonistic force, limiting the felt difficulty of the accomplishment.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—finding the sacred amid automation—is signaled early and tightens through the climb, keystone test, and descent. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist realizes "the keystone is not a key but a question," reweighting the object from tool to inquiry and foreclosing ownership as a path. The street table practice demonstrates visible cost: offering "nothing but blank paper and a chair" with no profit motive. Agency is decision and renunciation (removing the stone nightly, refusing harvest). Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through recurring images (light, hush, fog) until the final climb crystallizes the stance with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering the color of sound—is signaled early and tightens once: the hum acquires "subtle not-green, not-yellow" then "thawing silver" when the vow is mouthed, narrowing the protagonist's understanding and compelling the binding promise at closure. Agency is enacted through renunciation (leaving a vow that obligates future attention) with visible cost. No antagonist required; the accumulative lens supports this arc. The tightening is meaningful and the price (perpetual tending) forecloses casual attention.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—wavelength alignment with purpose, not faith—is signaled early and tightens once when the backwards prophecy compels them to distill noise and trust the toss. Escalation operates under Accumulative/Textural lens: prophecy clauses narrow options, flipping coins stitches a pattern, tuning gyros to those intervals produces the corridor. Agency is present (they choose to flip, tune, face the hush) with cost legible—enacting a prophecy that already declared their actions. No antagonist, but constraint (backwards causality, "static bursts," prophecy order) applies consistent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: to give names to nameless fears, motivated by Miren's unnamed fear that led her into the tide. Pressure accumulates through the ritual: listening to cylinders, projecting through scattered light, coaxing shapes into language, naming Rasp and Mire. The climactic tightening occurs when Miren's voice arrives and the reaper must name "Shoreless"—a wound made of horizon—using his scythe to cut vagueness. Agency is sustained: he steadies the page, whispers forgotten phrases, breathes slowly, lifts the scythe. The cost is felt: "no triumph, only a new corridor of work," and acceptance that some fears will flee unnamed.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: restore the cosmic timing hinge to allow fish (and survival) to return. One meaningful tightening occurs when Efan ties seaweed threads and taps the reed, narrowing the drips into "a new ceremony" that shifts the sea's breathing and aligns gull flight—options narrow from passive observation to active calibration. The fisherman's question ("Do we fish again, or do we listen until we learn hunger differently") forces Efan to crystallize his stance: "both were true, because the sea was also a teacher." Cost is visible: the city's muted response ("did not cheer, but its doors stayed open a little longer") and the modest return ("silver ripple...modest as a memory") make clear the repair is partial and fragile. Agency is through micro-decisions under accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—preserve collective memory against bureau erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the warden realizes the bureau wants "a second, cleaner death." The radio call to gather residents is protagonist-driven agency with on-page cost (defying orders, "he will not expunge"). One meaningful deepening occurs when the photographs transform from personal curiosity into a map of communal debts. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, but the escalation arc is smooth rather than sharp; no reversals test the warden's commitment, and the volunteer group's arrival faces no friction or complication on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—harmonizing logic and intuition—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when Iri reads the starlings and realizes "her formulas would ruin the music if recited now," narrowing her options. However, the tightening is cognitive rather than dramatic: no live trade-off forces her to forfeit a concrete alternative on the page. The orchard's need is declared ("to remember, to tell the trees how to hold both frost and blossom") but the consequences of failure remain abstract, weakening the felt urgency of the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: preserve trust by guiding the pilot safely after a prior failure. Pressure coheres and tightens—radio static clears, clouds squeeze into a vortex, the watcher revises the approach, the wing shudders, then lands. Agency is decision and endurance: the watcher reads the seam, taps the code, sets lanterns to green-blue, and leans with the rope to shape calmer air. The cost is legible: "we are not done paying," and the harness adjusted rather than dismissed. One meaningful tightening (the vortex complication and revised route) suffices, and the protagonist's attentive invention drives the resolution under accumulative/situational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—who will receive custody and vivify the brain—is signaled early and sustained. The sparring test constitutes one meaningful escalation: Neri and Rae trade elemental roles at the narrator's shout, the jar vibrates consent, and the narrator chooses joint custody. Agency lies with the narrator's final call, which forecloses individual custody and reweights the terms. The escalation reads under the Accumulative lens as a cadence shift and pattern crystallization rather than a causal reversal. Cost is implied (neither claimant wins alone, cooperation is mandatory) but remains conceptual; no on-page forfeiture of a live tactical option or visible sacrifice anchors the price, leaving the tightening legible but not viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: restore lost laughter to a household where "jokes curdled" and children "whisper their fun as if ashamed." Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as density increase and cadence shift—machines "macerate old silence into mulch," the conductor "yanks the cords like bells," and drafts of warmth reach the children who begin "aligning unspoken joys like dominoes ready to fall laughing." One meaningful tightening occurs when the mother hears the squeal and the conductor catches it, reweighting the ritual. Cost is felt but oblique: the conductor's knuckles "redden obediently" and he walks home "a leader without applause," yet no irreversible forfeiture or live option is foreclosed on the page; the resolution feels granted rather than earned through a trade-off under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—how to address dimensional homesickness and exile by certainty—is signaled early and tightens when the guardian asks "what I will give to stay." The protagonist's empty hands and offer to wait raise the cost (waiting as "binding, like thread pulled through a wound"), and the pendant's tithe (keeping "a sliver of my breath") narrows options by creating a visible price for belonging elsewhere. One meaningful deepening: the shift from "lost, but not geographically" to "carry doorways the way others carry luck" reweights the stake from exile to portable thresholds. Agency is renunciation (leaving by not leaving) with on-page cost (day "thinner for a breath"). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, though the escalation is more layered than propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—interrupting the guild's charted destiny—is signaled early and pressured through successive approximation: each micro-adjustment (salt, air, bellows) tightens options until the narrator must fully break the crozier to open the gate. Agency is clear: the protagonist's choices (packing the crozier, feeding splinters, pressing palm into heat, snapping the staff) drive escalation. The cost is legible: burning the relic of authority, enduring physical heat, and stepping into uncertain air all foreclose the guild's path. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length, and the final act reweights options under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—honoring endings without erasing them, finding placement for dead stations—is signaled early and tightens through the protagonist's discarding of assumptions and the city's refusal until that shift occurs. One meaningful deepening: the hush clarifies rather than deadens, and the mast-as-stylus turn reweights all prior material with visible cost (the protagonist leaves the tools behind, accepts the task's one-way nature). Agency is clear in the acts of pressing, winding, threading, and descending. The signals' desires (one more take, a doorway not a wall) add texture but remain secondary; the piece would benefit from a sharper trade-off or visible loss during the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (achieving reliable arrival) is signaled early and tightens when the radio voice offers the merge method. The protagonist's agency drives the key turn: tracing patterns with the broom, instructing the helmsman, choosing the tide-door over the no-tide option. The cost is legible—"promises mean little without their undertow"—but the escalation relies more on atmospheric accumulation than on a dramatic narrowing of options or visible trade-off. One meaningful deepening occurs; a second pressure point would lift this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—discovering "the texture of connection" through rational enchantment—is signaled early and pursued in each chamber. The architect's choices (anchoring thread, circling the curator, forming the triangle) tighten incrementally, and the visitor's arrival adds a third point that crystallizes the experiment. However, no live option is visibly foreclosed; the resolution lands as collaborative success without a counterpressure or trade-off made legible on the page. The piece stays in coherent pressure but lacks a felt cost at closure to enter the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—learning to navigate by unseen starlight via alien edge geometry—is signaled early and tightens through teaching (students laugh, cry, go quiet), solo night mapping to preserve what lamps erase, and culminates in the alien return where the instructor answers with the geometry and receives validation. The escalation is accumulative rather than causal-turn: each iteration (classroom, night crawl, alien exchange) deepens understanding until the pattern-recognition moment "I knew then how to teach them all" forecloses the old method (dull sonar scrolls) with visible cost in the instructor's years of patient, solitary work. Agency appears as endurance and attention rather than decisive confrontation, fitting the somber-marvel frame.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: find the child's mother by following the faint pulses; the tightening arrives when the narrator realizes the woman was laughing, not listening, and the pulses swing to the man. That reversal narrows options and forces a recalibration. The final beat—guiding both to dial and speak—applies modest agency; the narrator's role as facilitator is consistent with the job but leaves the protagonist slightly outside the final action. Cost is present in the patience and the acceptance of "incidental" rather than decisive heroism, though the escalation could press harder on what the narrator risks or loses by walking into the fog.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—Return what I took and stand by the unremembered—is signaled early and tightens through escalation: cave squeeze tests resolve, door unlocking via fleck raises cost, terminal scroll forces public witness, and discovering her own name reframes the act from restitution to self-recognition. Agency is layered: the protagonist chooses to speak names aloud, chooses to leave the fleck (renunciation with visible cost), and exits before the tide closes the window. The pressure coheres under the Causal lens with Accumulative texture; coincidence (tidal window, the archived note) complicates but does not solve—the resolution is her decision to leave the fleck and the closure carries undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear: repair the array and reckon with the failure that scattered the team. Pressure accumulates through the ghost's accusation ("You left the sky disordered"), the protagonist's confession ("I chased a false aurora and saturated the sensors"), and the recalibration sequence that forces confrontation with "regret charted in frequency and fill." The mentor-ghost's reframing—"you merely believed yourself big enough to, and that faith blinded you"—narrows options and the protagonist's final choice to align the dish and let the signal fade is agency expressed as renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—translate the dying language's textures before they wear smooth—is signaled early and drives all moves. One meaningful tightening: when the canyon resists law/war topics and birds scatter, the protagonist retreats and offers the travel-name as payment, narrowing options (no return to travel) and enabling the treaty flood. Agency is clear in the name-sacrifice and the choice to stay as caretaker, both forecloses paths with visible cost. The storm and drought beats extend the caretaker role but do not escalate pressure; they illustrate continuation rather than new reversals. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but the escalation arc is gentle—each attempt adds density without a sharp tightening point until the name-offer, which arrives late and resolves quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is the protagonist's undercover mission to catalog anomalies and confront the unnamed "thing," which shifts to accepting keeper status and allowing metamorphosis. The piece offers one meaningful tightening when the arrowhead is planted and the drain opens, forcing the descent. Escalation under the Accumulative lens proceeds through density increase (missing returns, seedlings moving, floor breathing) rather than reversals. Cost is conceptual and relational: the protagonist becomes "kept by the work" and must "let the garden metamorphose our bitterness." The herbalist's warning ("keepers sometimes must be kept") signals the price, but the protagonist's acceptance arrives without visible friction or a trade-off that forecloses another path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (reawakening beauty vs. triggering statue enforcement) is signaled early and tightens when the statue reaches for the violinist's wrist. The heart-rhythm breakthrough narrows options and the orchard's response (scent, branch movement) marks escalation. However, the resolution—statues swaying, joints unclenching, child climbing—lacks a visible, felt price paid by the protagonist; the transformation reads more like cooperative release than a trade-off that forecloses a path. Agency is present (playing, using the locust mute, heart-signaling) but the cost at closure feels conceptual rather than viscerally on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: foster fragile ties the border frays, signaled early. One meaningful tightening when the mirror reveals the boy waiting, narrowing the mailman's choice to deliver the misrouted letter. Agency is present in staying with Mina and delivering without proof, but escalation is gentle—pressure accumulates through atmosphere and moral calculus rather than sharp reversals. Cost is legible in the boy's postural change and the mailman's "heart ungoverned," though the price feels more emotional than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: restore the carousel to motion (and by extension, the train's vitality). The carpenter's early attempts fail ("the circuit would not close"), forcing the wrong-turn discovery of the oasis. That beat narrows options: he must sing despite his silence, a trade-off with visible cost (he "chose to sing" implies the forfeiture of his defining trait). The tightening is meaningful—his voice becomes the missing element, not mechanical power. The carousel's consent-based turning ("not by engine but by consent") and the travelers' subsequent engagement show escalation under the accumulative lens: pressure deepens through density and cadence shift. The child's touch on the tiger and the platform's steadying pulse confirm that the resolution is earned by protagonist agency. One reversal (oasis discovery) and one deepening (singing) suffice for this length. Cost is clear: silence sacrificed, communal responsibility accepted ("the work was now shared").

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—"to find the place where stories live"—is signaled early and tightens when the narrator steps off the grid into the no-wall reading room, writes the card ("stories live where vectors consent to curve around a heart"), and encounters the seabed-shelves that answer with "tide charts" grammar. One meaningful deepening: the scarf-wring produces snow-letters, validating the hyperbolic method with conceptual cost (the search remains open, "not found...but seen its weather"). Agency is navigational and ritual; coincidence does not resolve. No antagonist required under Accumulative lens; pressure coheres through accretion and pattern-break at the saddle-space.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: capture and understand the runaway dream without possessing it. Pressure accumulates through the cipher's resistance, the sea's question, and the dream's return. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist answers the sea and refuses ownership, narrowing the ethical frame. Agency is decision and renunciation: opening the east door to let the dream run. Cost is legible in "I refused to turn around" and the filing under "Beginnings, knowing they would never be checked out." Escalation is textural rather than causal, fitting the Accumulative lens; no antagonist required.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake signaled early: freeing the idea that voice can transform loss into beginning, currently imprisoned by fear. One meaningful tightening: the courtyard ritual (laying the hair, singing the wavering note) forces the protagonist to act despite terror, narrowing options from silence to song. The locksmith's request to "speak my mother's promise without her words" and "sing anyway" escalates pressure by demanding embodied vulnerability. Visible cost: singing a note that "searched its own hallway" risks exposure ("cracked vessel no one should drink from"), and the ribbon's release forfeits the keepsake's protective function. The resolution is earned by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: the song itself performs the unlocking. No antagonist, but fear as persistent constraint is legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—recover stolen memories—is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful escalation: the protagonist must "feed the ring the missing truth" (confession about the anchor-rope woman). That confession narrows options and costs relational honesty, reweighting the final image. The price is visible ("I had let it slip") and the grandmother's cadence returns "patient, precise, and a little amused," making the trade-off legible. One reversal suffices at this length under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—proving reversible exile is not hoarding—is signaled early and tested when the council demands proof. Escalation: letter fails → trial prepared → tea ceremony → shadow corridor demonstration → council sees "the same steps unwalked, a return path" and grants stay. Agency rests with the archivist's choices (unstopper bottle, serve tea, annotate margins), and the child's reading aloud deepens pressure. Visible cost: "trembling," backwards pacing rehearsing "retreat to defend presence," and the corked portion of dusk saved for the child. Enters high 7s because the tightening is legible and cost is felt, though the council's reversal hinges partly on a shown vision rather than a trade-off the archivist must forfeit.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: preserve the valley's "color of wonder" so apples taste like "first light" again. The child's arrival introduces secondary pressure (their mother's tired apples, the window turned toward grayness), and Miren's response—tapping jar to seed, pruning silence—tightens options by gathering testimonies into the seed. One meaningful deepening: the seed becomes "hungry not for soil but for testimony," reweighting the task. Agency is present (Miren's pruning choices, the child's promise), and the planting forecloses散失 of wonder with felt cost ("careful work of keeping a path swept"). Escalation is gentle rather than sharp, fitting the Accumulative lens but preventing higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—grounding restless spirits—is signaled early and tightens through the net-unraveling sequence. Agency is clear: the restorer's actions (loosening knots, sealing cracks, touching each brow) drive the resolution. One meaningful deepening occurs when "a line snapped and wind spilled," introducing brief friction. However, no live option is foreclosed with a visible price; the work proceeds without forced trade-offs or moral calculus, and escalation remains linear rather than forcing a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: interpret the cartographic blank and honor unspoken care. Escalation unfolds through accumulative deepening: torn map → video comparison → seam discovery → village gathering → conditional reopening. Agency is renunciation and curation—narrator refuses solo reopening, involves community, frames the wound rather than mending it. Cost is legible: the verger's face-wipe, the narrator's shift from solver to witness, and the conditional "and then see" foreclose permanent answers. No forced antagonist; pressure coheres under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—"to understand the physics of letting go"—is signaled early and accumulates through observations of the keeper's failed stability, the freighter captain's unanswered plea, and the narrator's own line management. One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator shifts from cataloging to rescuing the snow globe, accepting the cost of drift to grant artifact weather. The tug on the line creates brief physical pressure, answered with two deliberate pulls, but no sharp reversal tests commitment. Agency is present but the escalation under the Accumulative lens is gentle; a stronger trade-off would elevate this further.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake clearly signaled: articulate unspoken needs of the courtyard's inhabitants via ghost-in-code dialogue. Pressure accumulates through the storm's approach, chalk/paint exchanges, valve blinks, and the balladeer's iterative encoding until the map crystallizes and the city acts (ovens breathe, jugs fill, standpipe opens). The protagonist's agency is translation and listening rather than confrontation—appropriate to the accumulative lens. One meaningful tightening occurs when the plate is bolted and "the ghost pressed through the drawing," syncing tempo and enabling the caretaking map. Cost is legible: the balladeer's role shifts from singer to "hinge," louder songs renounced, perpetual translation duty assumed. No traditional antagonist, but the ghost's opacity and the city's inertia supply coherent resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: decode the diary to honor Mirek's method of smuggling joy. Pressure accumulates floor by floor as the narrator pieces together cipher mechanics, culminating in the alignment with the tin's polish. The tightening is one meaningful deepening (understanding that encryption protects against despair, not thieves) that reweights the task. Agency is present in the arrangement choice and vocal promise, but the cost is primarily conceptual—no live option is visibly foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—proving that empty spaces remember—is signaled in the first third and drives the meteorologist's method throughout. Pressure escalates through the drift (loss of mooring), the approaching squall line, and the choice to persist with emotional cloud taxonomy despite professional risk. The captain's radio contact and the protagonist's decision to thread "coordinates through feeling" and log blank lines constitute a meaningful tightening that forecloses conventional scientific reporting. Cost is legible: the unconventional log risks credibility, yet the choice reaffirms the father's legacy and the method's validity. Agency is clear in the navigation and documentation choices.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—complete the mural before demolition—is signaled immediately and tightens through the foreman's countdown, the one-minute extension, and the artist's limit-testing ("I test the limit of the blue until it fractures"). Agency is clear: the protagonist chooses to stay, to layer pigment, to sign with the coin, and to hide the letter, each decision foreclosing retreat. The blast and collapse deliver visible cost, and the mural's survival reconfigures the initial promise. One tightening suffices for this length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—chart the stranded luminance—is signaled early and drives every beat. One meaningful tightening: the apprentice moves from passive observation to decoding the hopscotch and steering the Petrel, narrowing options and accepting visible risk ("a fingertip of trust"). The figure-eight maneuver unspools the light with on-page consequence: "leaving our ropes unprickled and our tongues our own again." Agency is protagonist-driven under the Accumulative lens; coincidence (the chalk board's presence) complicates setup but does not resolve—the apprentice must interpret and act.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—learning repair as a rhythm of attention rather than single motion—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure accumulates via lyric density and the sequence of adjustments (uncapping bottle, tuning clocks, filing gear wheel). However, no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows live options with felt cost; the protagonist succeeds at each step without error or trade-off. The mirrors "turn from ice to water to window" without resistance, and the master volume appears as reward rather than challenge. Agency reads as attentive application, not decision under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.1)
    Dominant stake is collective survival/trust-building; the arch crisis provides one meaningful tightening (twelve families stranded). Agency is distributed across the "we," obscuring individual trade-offs. The bell's braided alarm and chalk instructions orchestrate the rescue, but the resolution (all saved, feast, then launch) lacks visible cost—no one is left behind, no resource exhausted, no renunciation dramatized. The nebula's unveiling feels granted rather than earned through protagonist sacrifice under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake (delay doomsday, vouchsafe heartbeats) is signaled early and remains coherent. One on-page tightening occurs when the needle leans and the brass tooth bends, forcing the protagonist to file it and wind the springs. However, the resolution is not driven by a choice under pressure—the protagonist's actions are procedural and unopposed. The off-stage outcomes (riots pause, soldier sets down rifle) are told rather than shown, and no visible cost alters the protagonist's own options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear: guide the travelers out before frost. Pressure coheres through the ticking clock (shadow reaching the split trunk, horn note announcing patrol change, north wind tasting frost) and escalates when the boy's nut unlocks the passage, narrowing the window. The narrator's agency is constrained endurance—obeying the orchard's bargain forecloses any path to freedom. The cost is visible: another pair of boots will test the path, and the cycle renews. One tightening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (atonement for packaging failure that harmed wildlife) is signaled early and deepens when she reframes it: "to atone is not to erase... but to keep listening until damage finds its counterpoint." The tightening occurs through accumulative observation that narrows to a single actionable insight (reversible rings at pH shifts). Agency is decision: she sketches the Braiding architecture, climbs the cobbles, and commits to returning with a plan despite anticipated "lawsuits and scorn." Cost is felt ("my sister would answer my paper with a margin note instead of silence") and conceptual (rejecting mentor's definition of strength). One meaningful deepening suffices for this length under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.2)
    One dominant stake (enter the vault) is signaled early and tightens through accumulative ritual: the vendor follows the map, finds the vellum door, quantifies absence via counted breaths and moonlight drips, and opens the hinge. The method imposes a felt constraint—the vendor must "weigh the hesitations" and "solve for entry"—and the seed's contract ("sprout only in a store during the lull") forecloses future options. No overt antagonist, but the vault's riddle and the need to quantify absence create situational pressure. The single deepening (discovery of the seed) narrows options with visible cost, meeting the lens requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake: transform stored remorse into something bearable, signaled early ("sandpaper rough memories… leave grain without splinters"). One meaningful tightening: the pavilion's filament touches the chef, transferring the keeper's unbearable memory and raising the cost of cooking from it. The choice to cook (whispering to the coral, rendering it into broth) narrows options and forecloses the path of leaving the archive untouched. Visible cost appears in the first spoon scouring the chef's throat with brass before softening, and in the keeper's visible relief. No antagonist required; pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as the contagious remorse accumulates and is then subsumed.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—rehabilitate the silos and braid the town—is signaled early but never faces meaningful opposition or cost. The town agrees ("no one feels bulldozed"), the bridges succeed without setback, and the elevator cooperates; pressure remains static across all beats. No on-page reversal, tightening choice, or deepening that narrows options is visible. The resolution is declared rather than earned through protagonist agency under pressure, and no visible price alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—becoming an archaeologist of abandoned dreams rather than salvager or escapee—is signaled early and tightens once through the mirror-work sequence. The protagonist's agency is visible in setting up the kit, timing pulses to breathing, and adjusting angles; each pulse deepens access to entangled memories and rearranges internal circuitry. However, escalation reads as ceremonial intensification rather than friction: no move fails or forces a visible trade-off on the page. The canyon quake and mirror's final split provide closure participation, but the cost (accepting fragmentation, leaving without trophies) feels philosophical rather than forfeiting a live alternative the protagonist struggled to preserve.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—finding forgotten combinations—is signaled early and pursued across beats (doodle clue, crown trials, safe study, corridor choice). Pressure accumulates through the tilt-hour constraint and the practice of refusing haste/glitter, but escalation reads as a series of unlocks rather than a narrowing dilemma with visible cost. The protagonist's agency (scattering vigilance seeds, choosing the final corridor) is present but the safes "offer their skeptics" without forcing a tradeoff or risk that alters later tactics. The ending reconfigures the city's locks, yet the price paid—patience gathered, blaze kept latent—remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—creating music that the silent grove needs—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure deepens when the protagonist realizes the grove wants a pulse, not a symphony, forcing a pivot from ambition to companionship. The old sculpture provides a reversal: analyzing its stress cracks teaches patience and reweights the protagonist's approach. Agency is clear in the choice to "surrender cleverness" and strum only enough for a heartbeat, foreclosing the symphonic plan with visible cost (the lowered chime, the stopped vibration). However, escalation is single-step rather than compounding; once the lesson is learned, execution flows smoothly without further resistance or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake signaled early: "learn how difficult beauty survives." Pressure tightens when the stone must fit before moonrise and the nexus needs a pattern. Agency is renunciation and endurance—offering the king, teaching "quiet is not absence"—with visible cost (accepting possible re-exile). The escalation under Accumulative lens reads as density increase and cadence shift when the hum resolves into chords. One meaningful tightening sufficient; the ending forecloses paths (staying or leaving both involve teaching, not escaping).

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: catalog silence, honor Anya's method, open the clasp without wounding. Pressure tightens through the fireworks countdown (external clock) and the resonance attempt. The protagonist's agency is decision and endurance (not prying, waiting for agreement), and the cost is visible when they inherit the promise and commit to continuing the archive. One meaningful deepening occurs when the clasp opens and the pages instruct the protagonist, narrowing options to patient harmonics. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift that reweights the stake. Minor limitation: the conflict is largely internal and methodological; no antagonist or external resistance tests the pacifist stance directly, though the clasp's stubbornness provides material opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (cultivate serenity within motion to restore village equilibrium) is signaled early and tightens when children wake panicked and bridges tremble. Escalation under the Accumulative lens proceeds through planting, guiding the bloom with "slow drums and leaf-tied chimes," and the climactic unfurling where "the village flinched." The protagonist's agency drives every beat (planting, inhaling, mapping the smell) and the final steadying forecloses the path of restless ambition with visible cost ("ambition softened into stewardship"). One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist inhales fully, translating rot into balance, which reweights the village's shared breath.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—finding the source of resilience—is signaled early and pursued throughout. Pressure accumulates through the Accumulative lens: the pilot navigates obstacles (the arch, the water ribbon, the resin spindle) and the final act of planting reweights earlier loss. However, escalation is driven more by revelation than by narrowing options or forecloses paths; the protagonist encounters mysteries but does not face trade-offs that alter tactics or impose a visible price that charges the final moment under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake signaled early: prevent another landing accident in wind-trained turbulence. The child's arrival escalates from abstract survey to live rescue (generator failing, hospital need), tightening the timeline and raising immediate cost. The investigator's agency is active throughout—documenting patterns, chalking arrows, uploading offsets, coaching the child—and the final landing attempt hinges on those micro-decisions. Visible cost: the patch "barely stirs" confirms success but the inventory of "what almost failed" acknowledges fragility. One meaningful tightening (survey → urgency → safe landing) suffices for this length. The "singular convergence" framing—many lines meeting at one tight window—charges the investigator's method with conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—to "unfetter a sound" and "certify wonder as essential"—is signaled early but remains abstract until the synchronized strike. The tightening (sculptor's chisel fall coordinated with bell tone) is a single beat that narrows method but not options for the protagonist. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, escalation should show density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost; here the ritual proceeds in parallel increments without a visible trade-off or complication that forces a harder choice. The ending asserts global effect ("streets learned a softer geometry") but the protagonist's agency at closure is execution, not decision under competing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—mending the breach without repeating the pride-driven shortcuts—signals early and tightens when the flute's first note "found the seam, the place I had failed, and it would not let me pretend ignorance." The protagonist's agency drives escalation: stopping the hurried tempo, arranging driftwood to guide the weave, and "gentling the phrase to follow" rather than forcing it. The cost is legible: "I had taken shortcuts, trusting the flute to mend what I tore, and the markets paid in emptiness." One micro-turn (the note ghosting back) deepens pressure without requiring multiple reversals. Deduction: the "answer came slowly, woven of miscounts and pride" verges on summary; dramatizing one specific miscount in flashback or present perception would make the lesson more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: understanding the mathematics of emotion, tested through the commission. Pressure accumulates as the protagonist sets type for the grieving couple, registers their forgiveness request, and confronts the limits of borrowed courage. The halo fragment's cooling when the protagonist sets their own confession provides a micro-reversal that forces self-examination. Cost is legible in the admission of evasion and the promise to "disorient fear" rather than hide behind it. One meaningful tightening occurs when the couple's need exposes the gap between the protagonist's technical mastery and emotional honesty, narrowing the option to continue hiding.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: deliver the relic and coax wonder from routine grief. One meaningful tightening occurs when the courier steadies hands, tunes to the widow's breath and ridge hum, and the three "begin to agree"—narrowing options to this exact pitch. The corridor's thinning imposes time cost and the widow's smile at its limit shows acceptance. Agency is clear: the courier holds pitch despite the mentor's absence, and the planted yew forecloses easy resolution. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—proving objects absorb emotions—is signaled in the opening third and tested through the car-window ritual. One clear tightening occurs when the frost reveals "a boy gripping a birthday ribbon" then "a darker scene" of rehearsed ending, forcing Mara to confront stored grief she tried to discard. Agency is shared: the narrator guides the experiment, but Mara's palm-press and whispered acknowledgment constitute the stance crystallization. The cost is felt (she must now "carry" her weather) but slightly diffuse—no single forfeited option is named on the page. Coincidence does not resolve; the arbor's amplification and the prism's response follow the established mysticism rules without late invention.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—carrying a message to her brother across the dead river—is signaled early and held throughout. Pressure accumulates through the weaving process: threading edges, setting the amber, tapping rhythm, thinning herself. One meaningful deepening occurs when the fabric launches and "her brother stood and knew he had been held," reweighting the longing into contact. The cost is stated ("there was a latent sacrifice in each fiber") and felt at closure ("the pull snap back," the loom emptied). However, escalation is entirely additive rather than a turn that narrows options; no reversal or complication tests her commitment, and coincidence (the trader's box, the puzzle edges) enables rather than forcing a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—restore the town by coaxing rubble to stand—is signaled early and escalates across three nights via deliberate bartered awakenings. Iven's memory-trade (naming parents and dog) constitutes on-page agency with visible cost (bruised wrist, "breathing like a bellows"), and the silk's tightening externalizes honest-oath pressure. The escalation reads as accumulative cadence shift rather than causal reversal; coincidence (the wind arriving on night three) complicates but does not resolve, as Iven's vow and the community's lifting complete the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—"to discover the weight of a withheld truth"—is signaled early and tightened through the shard-to-terminal action, which narrows options by forcing the protagonist to witness her own hand on the button. The Accumulative lens supports one meaningful deepening: the withheld truth becomes internalized responsibility, and the final tactic (mapping routes for survivors) forecloses evasion with visible cost. Pressure coheres, though the abstract phrasing of the child's agency ("cyclically spontaneous, obedient to rhythms") slightly diffuses escalation at the pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: to protect "the tender hush that arrives after weather" and pass along the bottled feeling of safety. The lamp's death and the haunted visitation create immediate pressure; the narrator responds by lighting the candle, finding the sea glass, writing "We are still here," and stacking five stones. One meaningful tightening: the skipper's early arrival and wordless exchange reweights the anonymous letter chain with urgency and mutual recognition. The final act—stacking stones "where waves could almost reach them"—narrows options (the keeper will not return) and the cost is legible: solitary endurance and the ache that "guards a coastline better than iron." Agency is clear, escalation coheres under the Accumulative lens, and the price is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake—maintaining guidance after newspapers fold—is signaled early but pressure remains diffuse. No meaningful tightening occurs: the storm and child are complications without visible cost or tradeoff. The narrator's "accidentally prophetic" trait never forces a gamble or renunciation; feeding the child and teaching her feel like lateral moves rather than escalation. Coincidence (ocean delivers child) complicates without agency, and the ending summarizes continuation rather than a turn or deepening that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake clearly signaled: to learn why some people magnetize stories and whether the donor heart's "strange tug" is part of that craft. The narrative tightens meaningfully when the narrator tests understanding by adjusting the wing to shift story flow from courier to widow, demonstrating agency in experimenting with discovered principles. The widow moment creates visible risk—"borrowed tales can burn if you press them too hard"—prompting the protective brewing of indigo steam. Escalation follows Accumulative logic: observation → experiment → protection → systematic application ("tracking sun trails from dawn to dusk over the next week") → formal appointment. The cost is visible in the responsibility accepted and the discipline required, though the stakes remain more contemplative than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—understanding and managing sorrow via the labyrinth's mysteries—is signaled early and tightens through a single meaningful escalation: the pin-drop leads to excavation, the tags, and the sextant's healing. The protagonist's agency (measuring dream dust, excavating mortar, arranging tags by weight and ache) drives the pressure forward under the Accumulative lens. The final cost is legible: the role shifts from fixer to witness-archivist, and "measured grief will float" becomes an earned principle. One constraint: the escalation is primarily deepening rather than narrowing options, which fits the lens but keeps the band shy of 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—rekindling a dying realm—is signaled early and tightens when mornings stop arriving and the protagonist must weave a dawn from community voices instead of intact mornings. The realization that the dawn must be woven across both mirror sides is a meaningful escalation that narrows tactics and forces a collaborative choice. The cost is felt: communities lay down names "stubborn, sharp with resentment," the protagonist shares scars with the twin, and the bound release requires relinquishing sole grip. Agency is clear in the swaddling, threading, and loom-opening decisions. However, no live option is explicitly foreclosed on the page—the communities drift to the greenhouse willingly, and the dawn's arrival does not visibly require sacrificing an alternative path, keeping the band below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: unearthing wisdom in the mistake of staying while leaving. The pressure coheres when the man whose marriage cracked appears, forcing a crystallization of stance. The paired reading of Mistake/Wisdom is the key tightening that narrows options: both must choose whether to perform blame or to "stack motives." The protagonist's decision to stay at the table ("my knees knew the room") forecloses flight with felt cost. The ending's refusal to reconcile into old shapes is an earned choice with visible consequence: no repair, but no ongoing rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: honoring small losses and refusing creeping normality. The narrator's choice to uncloak the doorway, speak names, brew tea, and plant seeds demonstrates agency; the cashier's arrival deepens pressure by revealing the systemic forces (landlord, cracked oven) behind the bakery's vanishing. The beat where they sweep crumbs and press seeds into seams tightens the commitment with on-page cost (returning tomorrow, holding the line thrown from shore). Minor issue: escalation is more additive than dramatically narrowing; each beat enriches rather than forcing a harder trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving luminous vows and the library's function—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the fractured pledge arrives and the directive demands "a final entry...to anchor even the vanishing and the false." However, escalation is largely conceptual rather than driven by protagonist agency under pressure; the library "demands" rather than the protagonist choosing between competing goods. The resolution (making the vow) feels inevitable rather than earned through difficult trade-offs. No visible cost alters tactics—the protagonist's transformation into "another entry" is declared, not shown through foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.9)
    One dominant stake (capture trust breaking) is signaled early and pressure accumulates through Lark's orchestrated false starts until the lime spill forces Kettle's too-fast reach and the smuggler's recoil. The "brittle inhale" is the tightening moment that narrows trust into fracture. Cost is present but diffuse—Lark pays a coin for dignity, the cutpurse fades unpunished, and the hush loosens—rather than a sharp personal forfeiture, and the escalation relies partly on coincidence (the cutpurse's hook) rather than pure protagonist agency, capping this below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: to learn why some people carry weather. The piece tightens when the narrator moves from passive observation to active participation (walking beside Mirelle during the final count). Agency is expressed through the decision to walk with Mirelle and to carry her story, forecloses solitary skepticism with visible cost. The fork in the meadow where "companionship was the shortest path" narrows options under accumulative pressure. Mirelle's storm and the weatherbearer gathering apply external pressure that tests the narrator's skepticism.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—uncork suppressed creativity versus survival economy—signals early and tightens through the descent. The broken lock becomes the escalation point: knowledge (mnemonic recall) alone cannot turn grief-split metal, forcing the artist to use portraiture (charcoal sketch) to solve it, a choice that embodies the calling. Cost is visible: retrieving wild pages and committing to sign them with Vera's name forecloses the commercial-only path. One meaningful tightening drives the closure under the Accumulative lens; no multiple reversals required at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake signaled early: finding lost conversations vs. the city's need to suppress volatile truths. One meaningful tightening when the protagonist discovers the vault system and realizes complicity, then escalates by withholding leaf-post service. The strike forces the city to choose visibility over managed silence. Agency is clear in refusal and in forcing collective opening. Cost is legible: the protagonist forecloses solo artistic practice ("no more leaf-post until archives reopen voluntarily") and risks social standing. The postmaster's trembling hands and the councilwoman's arrival add secondary pressure that converges at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is legible: Iri must preserve wonder against the Keepers' archival claim. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: the Keepers' arrival, their request, the sculptures' reply, and Iri's refusal form a single tightening that forecloses lending the shard. The cost is visible (trembling, the Keepers' new slowness) and the protagonist's stance crystallizes on the page. Agency is renunciation with felt cost. No reversals are required under this lens; the deepening suffices. One persistent constraint (the shard's irreplaceability) shapes the final image, lifting the score within band.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—resolve inner static by stabilizing the roses—is signaled early and tightens when polarity flips. The protagonist's agency drives escalation: opening the tin, arranging fears into a shape, seeding the controlled burn. One clear deepening occurs when "systems will not allow it," forcing miniaturization. The burn's success narrows options (the fog uncurls, roses retract) and forecloses the runaway-thirst crisis with on-page cost (overriding default protocols, risking system censure). The stakes remain internal/operational rather than life-or-death, fitting the length. Small deduction: the mechanical linkage between moth-wing flame and pump recalibration is gestured rather than causally explicit, relying on metaphorical rather than technical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—proving that listening heals—is signaled in the opening and tested when the outside world (developers, camera crew) intrudes. One meaningful deepening: the confessions of Marta and Jonah raise vulnerability cost and the protagonist's waving-in of the crew transforms threat into witness. Agency is clear in the choice to tap the hairpin and lead the ritual. However, no live option is visibly foreclosed; the news crew lowers gear without friction, and the mailbox opens through accumulated testimony rather than a hard trade-off. Cost is felt but diffuse across the collective rather than a single consequential sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (liberating the drowned names) is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens when the Warden pulses a blue warning, forcing the protagonists to answer "in the negative space" and use doubt as the key that opens the vent. The middle turn (doubt entering the lung, water withdrawing) narrows options and changes knowledge. Agency is shared between Mara's choreographed cipher and the narrator's transcription. The resolution is earned by their method, but the cost remains conceptual (the risk, the patience) rather than a visible forfeiture or trade-off on the page. One meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (finding deleted memories) is signaled early and tightens through a single meaningful deepening: the exhumation discovery that opens the corridor. Agency manifests through deliberate choices (borrowing spade, pressing glass to whale, choosing the specific memory) that foreclose the path of passive grief. The cost is legible on the page: the protagonist must physically carry memories back and seal them into fragile containers rather than simply remembering. Under the accumulative lens, the pressure coheres through density increase until the final image reweights "what my work really keeps."

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—hushing a prophecy of "iron noon"—is signaled early but remains abstract; the threatened future is described rather than dramatized as a live cost. The code "balked at vanishing," a tightening moment, but the summoner's response (whispering measured breathing) does not narrow options or force a trade-off with visible price. The resolution ("the code untied") declares success without showing what the summoner spent or risked; coincidence or inherent power completes the task rather than protagonist agency under escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake: learning the building's language, signaled in paragraph one. Escalation under Accumulative lens: borrowing sugar → weekly lessons in listening → rooftop ritual during meteor shower → seal-press that elicits the building's sentence. The narrator's agency is tested when they "interrogate" the tutor's nature and accept the seal with its custodial obligation, foreclosing the path of passive curiosity. Cost is legible: "keep listening even when the roofs look at the meteors and forget us" binds the narrator to an open-ended duty. One friction: the tutor's revelation that both are "sentences looking for a wall" and the building's cooperation in the architect's lie arrive as exposition rather than dramatized pressure, slightly softening the escalation's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—translate isolation into independence by accepting the quarantined memory—is signaled early and resolves on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when the child asks the narrator to "archive its winter," tightening the abstract quest into a concrete exchange. However, the escalation lacks visible cost in the moment: the narrator agrees with philosophical ease ("I would carry it usefully"), the transfer completes without friction, and no live option is foreclosed. Agency reads as acceptance rather than renunciation or sacrifice, and the "dizzy" aftermath is the sole bodily marker of price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—to forgive the unfinished work—is signaled in paragraph two and deepens when the protagonist realizes the mentor "feared mercy offered too quickly becomes another whip," narrowing the mission from completion to acceptance. Agency manifests as renunciation (leaving the verdict margin blank, planting the thorn) with conceptual cost made legible: "the only honest room." Pressure accumulates through lyric recurrence (dripping stalactites, unlinking, pearl twilight turning marble to pages) rather than causal turns, consistent with the Accumulative lens. No antagonist or reversal required; the tightening is a single reweighting that forecloses the option to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—learning why some people echo—is clear and pursued through sequential questions that deepen understanding. Pressure accumulates through the answers' escalating intimacy (strangers → mother → self), and the final insight about entanglement vs. severance reweights Lio's self-knowledge with conceptual cost. However, escalation reads more as progressive revelation than rising external or internal resistance; no option is foreclosed or complicated mid-journey. The questions flow smoothly without a moment where asking becomes harder or riskier, and the protagonist's agency lies in interpretation rather than a choice that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: expose the welding company's culpability. Escalation under Accumulative lens: the rhythm decoded → dive retrieval → globe warmed to yield password → dreamers assembled → public tapping forces confession. One meaningful tightening when the globe's beats "matched their maintenance logs" and the foreman lowers his eyes. Agency is investigative rather than confrontational; the narrator orchestrates but doesn't face a personal trade-off at closure. Cost is legible (company steps outside, foreman swallows) but social/external rather than protagonist-borne, limiting the felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—appreciating hidden effort before it vanishes—is signaled early and drives all moves. Escalation under the Accumulative lens: whisk demonstration → whistle revealing wet places → pouring tea for named invisible laborers → councilor's sash gesture that catalyzes collective participation. One meaningful tightening occurs when the crowd shifts from passive observation to active wiping of moss, foreclosing the prior dismissive stance. Agency is distributed but coherent: the philosopher's choices (whistling, holding the bowl under lantern light, asking the crowd to name laborers) narrow options and the councilor's unexpected participation locks the turn. Cost is visible: the councilor sacrifices status by using his sash as a cleaning rag, others abandon observer safety to engage physically with the stones. Minor limitation: the turn happens swiftly in the final quarter without significant friction or setback before acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake ("excavate truth from comfortable lies") is signaled early and tightens through investigation: finding the stuttering shredder, reassembling letters, discovering the resonator's function, then teaching caretakers to tune it. The turn arrives when the director's memo reveals "Liability exceeds projected goodwill"—comfortable lies cost less than difficult truths. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (camping, rebuilding, teaching, refusing the diamond), and the cost is clear: walking away no richer but steadier, having kept only the love note. The resonator holds during the next storm, validating the mechanical solution with visible consequence (fruit shone, caretakers ran with sacks and songs).

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: "shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" is signaled early and pursued via radio instructions, Brin's collaboration, and town negotiation. Pressure tightens when the town arrives with skepticism and Knoll's variant allegiance, then deepens when the "prophet" becomes a hunger-pattern pointing cityward. The seeds-into-lightning act narrows options (public commitment, municipal soil offered). However, agency at closure is split between radio instruction and Brin's gesture, diluting protagonist drive. The visible cost—public miracle, town embarrassment—is present but soft; no irrevocable forfeiture or trade-off that we see pay out on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—becoming "the translator between generations"—is signaled early and tightens when the music box's melody "had kept returning alone, having lost its second voice." The poet's agency (choosing to open jars in sequence, arranging them "like vowels ready for breath") drives the village reconciliation and forecloses his old solitary trade with visible cost. One meaningful deepening: the widow's tune was grief; combined with jarred echoes it "became conversation." Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens. Does not reach 8.5+ because the escalation is a single decisive intensification rather than a compounding sequence, which is sufficient at this length but leaves no tactical trades visible mid-conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (protect the artifact from ransom) is signaled early. The arrival of the seeker tightens pressure. Marek's choice to open the lens room and let sound operate rather than argue is a meaningful turn under the Accumulative lens, and the seeker's renunciation forecloses the ransom path with visible emotional cost ("a smile that did not hide its ache"). Escalation is driven by Marek's agency (sonic absolution strategy) and the stone's response. Cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: teach patience as革命 method without surrendering agency. The girl's question ("Who will teach us to wait without surrendering, to turn rage into shape?") and the village men's ropes/worry introduce immediate pressure. One meaningful tightening occurs when the narrator moves from passive observation to active instruction ("I sent them to carry salt… Do these things softly purposeful"), narrowing tactics and raising the social cost of visibility. The cost is partly visible—the narrator forgoes solitary vigilance to become a public figure—but the final image lacks a moment where the narrator visibly pays a price or forecloses a concrete path, keeping escalation legible but muted.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: whether to sign off (institutional compliance) or document systemic failure (fidelity to the dead). Pressure coheres through layered opposition: supervisor's chiming messages, the algorithm's preference for "easy drownings," and the investigator's internal pull toward closure versus truth. One meaningful tightening occurs when the investigator turns off the radios and lets "only the tunnel speak," escalating the defiance. The choice to sign the report as "preventable, collective, and mine" and to withhold the lantern narrows options with visible cost (career risk, accountability accepted). Agency is clear throughout; the investigator's micro-choices (kneeling, lifting the lantern, turning its key, documenting the drains) drive escalation under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear early: can Jonah turn apology into action? The thorn discovery narrows options (a physical fix enables the larger choice), and the ticking heart forces the final decision with visible cost. Agency is active: the chaplain brings the heart, the proprietor diagnoses and repairs, Jonah chooses to breathe with the beat and nod. The chaplain's question "Do your machines ever teach you" and the proprietor's answer deepen the calculus without stalling pressure. One meaningful tightening shapes closure under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.2)
    One dominant stake: ring the bell via the yearning algorithm. Pressure accumulates through iterative trials (first sideways failure, twenty-ninth dawn success). The arrow-tip switch provides a clear tightening mechanism—it "twitched" then "swung closed"—narrowing options to success. Cost is present but muted: the algorithm "hums, not satisfied," and Ilex denies tears, but no meaningful path is visibly foreclosed; he simply achieves his goal and continues. The resolution leans on Ilex's persistence rather than a high-stakes trade-off, keeping this in the strong-but-not-exceptional band.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding where deleted files go and recovering Aida's voice—is signaled early and tightens through the lie, vault descent, and Sink access. One meaningful pressure point (the choice to post publicly despite job risk) narrows options under the Accumulative lens. The escalation is clean, though the final turn would benefit from a visible complication or trade-off dramatized in the moment (e.g., a colleague's warning, a system alert) to elevate the felt cost and test the narrator's resolve more concretely.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—bridging the rift between keepers and fishers—is signaled early and tightens when the shard reveals the drowned child. The narrator's patience under Matilde's and Harun's challenges constitutes agency via endurance, and the proposal (beacon saplings, paired shifts, naming the child) forecloses easy blame with visible social cost. One clear deepening: the mirrors show "the underside of choices," transforming abstract blame into actionable amends. The nod at the end carries weight because the prior beats established the depth of mistrust.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—learning to recognize endings without surrendering—is signaled early and tightens through the child rescue (tap finding hollows, rope remembering hitches) and storm preparation (the buoy line snapping, clearing the plankways). Agency is renunciation with cost: each clinic delay forecloses the original appointment while binding the narrator to edge-listening. The rescue and storm are meaningful escalations driven by the narrator's learned skill (the parasol tip, patience as instrument). Score held below 8.0 because the escalation is more deepening than turn-based; the narrator's stance crystallizes rather than reversing, fitting the Accumulative lens but lacking a second discrete pressure peak.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—whether the traveler can reconcile rivers and rows—is signaled when she shows the map. Pressure tightens when the sentinel reveals the burned letter edge, and the traveler admits she saved only the edge because "the middle was a promise she cannot keep." The kneeling act (writing a new letter, binding the scar) narrows options with visible cost: she must tell him she loves rivers more, without apology. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length, though the sentinel's agency is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: preserve legible echoes against the prophet's arrival and the valley's forgetfulness. The midday wind forces a tightening when the walker "strings a line across the gust like a stitch" and they "sew calm into the air," raising tactical pressure. The decision to widen the clearing by trusting peripheral awareness deepens risk and succeeds, proving the method. Cost is implied through repeated labor ("Tomorrow we will do it again") but not viscerally dramatized as loss or trade-off within the scene. One meaningful escalation under the Accumulative lens is present, but the cost reads conceptual rather than felt at the moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: collective healing after "too many years of sirens and layoffs." One meaningful tightening occurs when the archivist asks for "one moment when the factory breathed for them," narrowing the town's options from abstract grief to specific memory. The mirror reveal ("the bottom is a mirror, so every person sees their face tangled with ribbon and light") deepens pressure and the circle's laughter signals a micro-turn toward agency. The final ask—"a word each, not about loss, but about what the town could give a stranger tomorrow"—reweights the ritual with felt cost (bread, patience, blue, sparks, lavender, room). Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, but the archivist's personal stake never forces a trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—decoding growth's pattern after the last dictionary—is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful deepening occurs when the scholar realizes "growth begins in refusal" and later "the grammar of tending." However, escalation is gentle; no external opposition tests the scholar, and the only reversal is internal (from recording to understanding). The cost is conceptual (renouncing volumes) rather than a hard trade-off. Under the Accumulative lens this is acceptable, but the lack of a visible price paid limits the band.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake signaled early: "to capture the sound of growing older." The piece tightens via accumulative pressure—he chalks lines, arranges driftwood, listens, whispers empty years—until the driftwood rearranges itself (line 20), granting tacit permission and narrowing his path. The final kneel at the toppled head and resetting of markers for his unknowing future self constitutes agency as endurance with visible cost: he forecloses the fantasy of permanence and accepts recursive loss. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening suffices. Deduction: no moment forces a trade-off between competing wants; the progression is meditative layering rather than a decision under duress, and the price—while felt—remains elegiac rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—capture the Moon's faint thermal tremor—is signaled early and tightens through the misalignment discovery, which narrows options and raises cost (precision tuning under deadline). The chronometer subplot braids neatly: what others fear as failure becomes a message requiring "stubborn ears," then a burr solved on-page. Agency is consistent: the protagonist diagnoses, adjusts, interprets, with each move altering tactics. One meaningful deepening (the belief shift from "certainty is a luxury" to answering the Moon's speech) with visible cost (the exhausted vigil, the gamble on hope).

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: "execute a flawless goodbye" before death. Pressure tightens when the therapist calls the son, who arrives with "the weather still clinging to his jacket," and the estrangement must be navigated in real time against the father's narrowing hours. The son's arrival and the transfer of the shard constitute a meaningful reversal that forecloses the path of silence and distance. The resolution is earned by the therapist's and son's agency (the call, the son's decision to stay and take the shard without gauze) and the cost is visible: the father dies, and the son accepts the burden of memory and fragility.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding where shadows go at noon—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the mirror-ring arrangement, the rune for return, and the nine-fold key turn; each step narrows options under the Accumulative lens. The cost is felt in the gold-line signature and the ongoing obligation ("the answer needed to continue"). One meaningful deepening is present, sufficient for this length. Minor deduction: the caretaker's nod at the end is passive confirmation rather than active complication.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—protecting Ari and reframing blame—is signaled early and tightens through discoveries (tooth, map, Ari's emergence with dislocated shoulder). The narrator's agency drives escalation: choosing to enter the maze, examining evidence, setting the shoulder, and committing to "tell it plain" despite town pressure. One meaningful reversal occurs when Ari emerges, transforming the investigation into an immediate medical and moral choice. The resolution is earned by the protagonist's renunciation of the witch-tale and acceptance of social cost, with visible price (tomorrow's clamor) that alters tactics (leaving the tooth as burial, walking home carrying "the ache of repairs").

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (sharing light without fire) is signaled early and pressure coheres through accumulative deepening: solo craft→remembering brother/village fire→carrying garland up→village acceptance. One tightening occurs when the garland "learns its work" and village faces soften, narrowing the either/or (fire vs. darkness) into a third option with visible cost (patience, no spectacle). Agency is renunciation and endurance—refusing quick fire, embracing slow polishing—with the final image foreclosing the torch path. The village's "wary of sparks" constraint shapes the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: whether reconciliation is possible after public betrayal. The tightening occurs when she arrives and follows the constellation, forcing the protagonist to act on the prepared ritual rather than retreat into silence. The pendant-burial decision narrows options (no return to former intimacy) and the mutual promises foreclose prior patterns with on-page cost: "I will not make art from me again" vs. "I will not make silence from her again." Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (the invitation, the proffer, the burial choreography) under the Accumulative lens. The price—giving up the pendant and former dynamic—is unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: resist market convention and collect the "shapes of different hopes." One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist wades into the river—a physical commitment that tests resolve. The cameo figures then offer emblems, and the protagonist chooses to accept them, which alters their creative method. However, escalation is muted: no moment where market pressure concretely threatens this choice on the page, and the emblems arrive without resistance or cost. The resolution reads as acceptance rather than earned transformation through struggle. Agency is present (the wading, the choice) but opposition is abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—restoring sacred practices—is signaled early but never tightens or tests Rowen's agency. No on-page reversal narrows options; the harvest moon "arrives," the songs are sung, and the remedy succeeds without friction, adaptation, or cost. The one-day timeframe mentioned at midpoint ("Only one day remained") does not shape tactics or create visible pressure. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation would require density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake; instead, the text loops through synonymous descriptions of singing and alignment without meaningful deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake signaled early: translate heartbeats into a followable map so people can leave the silenced world. One meaningful tightening occurs when starlight touches the ladders and shadows bend toward the closed-eye bark, validating his method and narrowing the search to one trunk and then the lake fissure. The alchemist's agency drives the escalation—kneeling, listening, unsealing starlight, arranging discarded items, fitting the plate—but the final act (sealing the fissure seam with flash-paper) resolves by teaching breath to travel rather than forcing a trade-off or visible personal cost. Pressure is coherent under the accumulative lens; the cost is environmental (the world exhales, aurora moves) but the protagonist's renunciation or price is not dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: to harvest echoes using the repaired timer. Pressure tightens through the escalating repair (disassembly, machining replacements, testing), installation, and whisper-harvest sequence. Agency is visible in his choice to remain until the jars hum and in his final renunciation (leaving the timer, stacking jars in the cellar for future need). The flood-damaged valley and road repairs add ambient pressure but remain secondary. One micro-turn: the cave answers "with his earlier story, softer, deeper," deepening the harvest's success before he seals it away.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—learning "the grammar of their heaviness" by orienting properly—is signaled early and sustained. Each burden (widow memory, soldier name, mother's dread, narrator's own fear) tests and refines method, creating accumulative pressure rather than a single sharp reversal. The narrator's agency is visible in micro-adjustments (setting pulse to north, angling shoulders, allowing the weaver to turn them), and the final burden forecloses evasion with on-page cost ("for a moment I was boundary-lessly trapped"). The escalation is coherent under the Accumulative lens, though a single decisive trade-off would sharpen the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (how to inhabit loss without erasure) is signaled early and tightens through the carving's progression: touching the blank, working the knot into a scar, refusing to restore the tag, wrapping unfinished. Agency manifests as renunciation with visible cost—she will not perfect what he never wore, will not open the keepsake tin. The kettle's duration creates a persistent constraint that narrows all moves. One meaningful deepening: the pause at the knot where she watches rain and speaks aloud, then turns off the flame—refusal becomes active choice. The final arrangement ("keeping all three in sight like a new ring") reconfigures prior loss into disciplined witness.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—negotiating with one's ghost to resolve misfiled time and eroded ambitions—is signaled early and tightens through the bridge of murmurs, the camera wheel truce, and the ghost's verb demands. One clear deepening occurs when the protagonist admits, forgives, promises, and stays, foreclosing the option to flee. Cost is conceptual (regret "sinks with a relieved shudder," ambitions reframed as sand) but remains abstract rather than viscerally felt. Under the Accumulative lens, the tightening is sufficient; pressure coheres without requiring causal reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—resurrect function in a dead building—signals early and tightens when the janitor's concrete needs (shelter buses, brighten clinic) transform the intern's abstract equations into shared purpose. The progression from solo technical work to collaborative mapping constitutes meaningful escalation under the Accumulative lens. Pressure builds through each redirected flow (rain gutters, breakers, escalator reversal), and the cost is legible: "proportional headaches of functioning mercy" and ongoing maintenance. The mother seeking a nap space dramatizes stakes without resolving them artificially.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—reconciling the abandoned dream of a city of bells—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure operates via accumulative density rather than causal escalation; the protagonist's internal negotiation deepens but does not narrow live options through on-page choices. The finch moment and the ledger-closing gesture are micro turns, not reversals that foreclose paths. No visible price or trade-off is legible; the protagonist grants himself permission without cost. Under the accumulative lens one meaningful deepening is present, but lack of a felt sacrifice keeps this mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding the architecture of lies—is signaled early and drives each beat. One clear tightening occurs when the letters reveal the protagonist's father and aunt in the ledger, converting abstract investigation into personal betrayal. The final decision to partner with the engineer narrows options with visible cost: both men forsake deniability and safety by pushing off together. Agency operates through decision and endurance; coincidence does not resolve. Pressure coheres under the causal lens, though the engineer's conversion feels slightly compressed given the weight of complicity.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving ancient methods by decoding knot patterns—is signaled early but never faces a genuine obstacle or tightening. Each knot yields its lesson smoothly; no reversal or resistance forces a trade-off or narrows options. The protagonist's agency is limited to patient observation and transcription; the hidden splice that "resisted" is eased by humming and rhythm, not a difficult choice with visible cost. The fisherman's return at dawn and the tidied skiff suggest closure, but the protagonist's task concludes without escalation or a price that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—explaining the man's living absence so the woman can "sit at the table without drawing a second cup"—is clear. Pressure accumulates through the ritual (four names, thread song, bridge-walk), but no reversal or tightening forecloses a live option on the page. The man's confession ("the shape of their street would not let him breathe") arrives without resistance, and the woman's acceptance feels inevitable rather than won. Cost is signaled (future navigation, ongoing absence) but not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—reawakening beauty by hatching the egg—is signaled early and sustained. The prince's assembly of the cradle provides one on-page action sequence that narrows tactical options (scavenging, tuning strings to stalactite sighs), and the egg's crack constitutes a meaningful tightening. Agency reads as attention and caretaking (fasting, speaking lullabies, opening gates) with conceptual cost (renouncing conquest, accepting the creature's autonomy). However, no reversals test commitment; the path from hypothesis to hatch proceeds without setback or forced trade-off. The cost is felt in the final image but not dramatized as a choice that forecloses an alternative path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—proving scars can sing, teaching the boy through ritual—is signaled early and deepens when she lets the coin touch water and speaks her name and father together. The boy's arrival adds a secondary pressure, and the grafting act narrows her tactic from passive listening to active teaching. However, the boy's conflict is muted (he nods, he smiles) and his scar-listening does not resist or test her method; the escalation reads as accumulation of gestures rather than a choice under pressure that forecloses a path. Cost is present but diffuse: she carries the tide-engine, measures days by songs, but no single beat forces a trade-off that makes the price vivid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—liberating trapped memories—is signaled early and coheres across beats. Pressure tightens when the water woman counsels sidereal patience, then when the broker offers a quick flood; Ilias's refusal forecloses the easy path and commits him to slow work. The broker's departure and trickling fountains show consequence, but the cost remains largely conceptual and future-oriented rather than a visceral, on-page forfeiture that narrows Ilias's immediate options. One meaningful deepening is present; escalation is modest but consistent with the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: share light without fire, break the inherited cycle of scorch and fear. One meaningful tightening occurs when travelers arrive exhaling heat and the narrator must tell "a longer story with the garden itself," triggering the petal rain and switching off the ships' burn. The choice to place the gear in the child's palm narrows options (generational handoff) and the captain's head-lowering signals acceptance. However, escalation is illustrative rather than agonistic—the travelers comply without true resistance, and the cost (eternal repetition for the narrator) is felt philosophically rather than pressed on the page as a trade-off. Agency is present but not tested under competing pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—discover the shape of collective grief without breaking it—is signaled early and tightened through the father's kite-poem choice, the storm that spares seedlings, and the final spare curve. Agency appears in measured choices: chisel depth responding to the father's steadying, softening syllables where butterflies land, retracing curves wasted by haste. One meaningful deepening when the father asks how the carver bears so many names and receives the ribbons-keep-moving answer. Cost is felt but not maximally legible on the page; the father's steadying and the carver's nightly returns imply endurance without a sharp forfeiture moment.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake signaled early: "restore shared balance after months of drift." The tightening occurs at pendulum-pause, where past injuries surface and the winder must act ("coax a binding arbor," "oil a pivot," "whisper names") rather than retreat into mechanical precision. Agency is decision and renunciation: he withholds correction of the fisherman's lateness and invites collaboration ("ask him to carve one more line"). The cost is visible: public pride relinquished, isolation ended, future visits promised ("each face to visit later bearing bread"). The pause itself is high-pressure situational constraint—"stretches thin as hot wire"—and the fisherman's presence at story's end tests the repair. One meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens: the inscriptions shift from private tally to shared ritual. Minor note: the story could escalate pressure by showing the fisherman's skepticism or resistance before acceptance; his cooperation arrives cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the widow's hidden truth—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation is more accumulative than causal: the gardener moves from tapestry to earth to poplar without facing a live choice that narrows options or raises cost. The discovery of the faked burial and smuggled lover arrives through documents rather than a decision under pressure. The final act (planting poppies, writing her name) is generous but lacks a visible trade-off or felt price that alters the gardener's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: seed innovation within a constraint to prevent "sprawl" and "flatten dwellings." The narrator pursues this through modeling iterations that narrow options (tower, burrow, canal → hinges), constituting one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. Agency is present in micro-decisions (placing hinges, drafting workshop constraints), and the final lines articulate the reweighted calculus. Cost is conceptual—responsibility, fear of misuse—but not embodied in a forfeited path or visible sacrifice on the page. No antagonist required, but the pressure never forces a trade-off that alters the narrator's prior stance.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—teaching dust to tell stories—is signaled in paragraph five and sustained to closure. One meaningful tightening occurs when the broadcast asks for "payment in kind": a promise to carry tempo forward, which the protagonist grants, narrowing future action to perpetual curatorship. Agency reads as attention and endurance rather than confrontation; the protagonist's tapping pencil and careful notation enable Cinder's voice to take form. The resolution enacts Earned Stasis with visible cost: sleeping by ember light while keeping time, stories continuing without the protagonist claiming autonomy over them. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through density increase and cadence shifts in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—crystallizing love-versus-fear without pointing to the bruise—is signaled early and tightens when Mother grants permission ("take what you need") and again when she offers the chair. The gallery sequence escalates by showing visitors trembling and a boy forgetting to breathe, proving the piece's emotional accuracy. The chair's final rock under the skylight forecloses safer silence; Mother's wrist-squeeze and the acknowledgment of "surviving without a witness" make the cost undeniable. One on-page deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (preserving methods versus the factions' narrative wars) and tightens when the noon flood forces a choice: parade the cog or save lives. The protagonist's agency drives the escalation—walking them out, using the cog as tool, retaining it after proving its worth. The reversal at the sluice (the cog fits, the wheel catches) narrows options and forecloses the factions' claim with visible cost (they speak softly, their authority damp). The flood is a credible constraint, and the resolution avoids luck: the narrator's months of chalk marks and hydraulic knowledge earn the save. No explicit antagonist, but the competing factions and the silt provide coherent pressure under a Situational lens accent.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—braiding divided voices into harmony—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Rafi and Ola face each other and the rosette is placed between them, and the performance deepens the pressure. However, escalation reads as serial rather than causally compounding: each beat adds texture but does not narrow options or impose a visible trade-off. The ending offers closure without a legible price paid on the page, which keeps the cost conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: create something beautiful from ruin, signaled early and deepened through pruning choices that edit collective memory. The alignment tightens urgency (once-in-a-lifetime window), and each pruning beat narrows options by shedding fragments (classroom, birthday, councilor's ordinance). Agency is clear—protagonist's ritual and invitation drive the ending—and cost appears in defiance of the ordinance and the vulnerability of public gathering. One meaningful deepening (pruning as editing the past) rather than multiple reversals; pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: restore the drone lattice to revive city function and preserve wonder. The matchbox riddle provides one meaningful pressure point—Mara must solve it to pass—and the reveal of the hidden tray tightens options by making the restoration possible. The climb and calibration sequence raises physical and conceptual stakes (drones reciting coordinates, screens brightening). Cost is visible: the keeper relinquishes the hidden box and abandons the solitary toll role. Agency is present but slightly passive during the tower sequence; Mara performs the technical work while the keeper listens. Escalation is sufficient for this length but not sharp enough for high band.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding house aliveness—is signaled immediately and tightens through three escalating encounters: alive-for-story, mimicking-life, alive-through-patience. The third house provides meaningful deepening when displaced objects "gathered to speak" and the narrator finds the beetle tin, a micro-turn that reweights method from observation to participation. Agency is attention and return (replacing the tin "exactly where the grain fit it"), an act of renunciation that forecloses detached study. The cost is conceptual (the narrator must now participate, not merely catalog), legible but not viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—welcoming nuance into certainty—is signaled early and tightens through Oris's decision to thread the ampoule to the breach. The scholar's recoil creates immediate opposition, and the act of breaking the ampoule's tip releases time "not forward, but wide," a clear pressure point that forecloses the simple-truth path with visible cost. Agency is continuous: Oris listens, follows, threads, breaks, and waits, each choice narrowing options under the Accumulative lens. The final stitch and patience-building constitute meaningful escalation with felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: capturing the texture of a missed opportunity before it drifts into smooth forgetting. Pressure tightens when the rupture offers direct access to the moment, forcing the choice to step through or preserve its fabric. The narrator's refusal—"to step through would flatten what I seek to keep"—forecloses the path of resolution and earns the final stance. Agency is renunciation with cost: the seam remains "not healed, not lost, precisely remembered." The dice ritual and proof-drafting constrain tactics throughout. One meaningful deepening: the dice stop on edge, balance achieved by damage, enabling the final seven steps.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: proving strangers remember kindness. The piece accumulates evidence (folded notes, coins, moth, orange, weeping strangers) and the neighbor's arrival provides a tightening when he shows his paint-marked palms and reveals he has continued the message. However, the escalation is more confirmation than complication—Lina never doubts or confronts a counter-pressure that tests her commitment. The resolution (brewing tea, speaking without words) feels like validation rather than a choice with visible cost. One meaningful deepening occurs, satisfying the accumulative lens, but agency at closure is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—rescuing dying arts while avoiding becoming "embalmer rather than nurse"—is signaled early and tightens when the lens is revealed to select what survives, raising the curator's responsibility to "unbearable." The bread-baking method introduces a meaningful choice (feeding while recording), and the climactic vow ceremony forces the community to "chew their own initials and swear to remember another person," forecloses the option of passive preservation, and shows visible cost (vulnerability, "our courage felt edible and breakable"). The stranger's late arrival and the beekeeper resolution feel somewhat convenient, lowering pressure slightly, but the curator's final commitment (seasonal return) is protagonist-driven and credibly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    One dominant stake ("to step beyond fate's design") is signaled early and tightens through puzzle-solving beats, hunger stone activation, and the vision of alternate timelines that shows the keeper's death as cost. The protagonist's agency drives escalation: offering blood, aligning gears, and ultimately choosing to let the yoyo climb. The final renunciation is motivated by the keeper calling his name and forecloses the supernatural door with visible emotional cost. No reversals feel arbitrary; coincidence complicates (the keeper's call) but does not solve.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is clearly signaled: "to trick fear into revealing its weakness." The sequence escalates through entry, paradox-writing, summoning the shadow, and forcing its confession. The final tightening—aiming the camera at fear rather than the narrator—narrows options and the shadow's confession ("unswerving attention is the solvent it fears") delivers new knowledge. However, agency is split: the advisor engineers the plan and operates the camera while the narrator follows instructions. Cost is conceptual (the ongoing debt, the sealed mouth) but lacks a visible forfeiture that the protagonist pays on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: survive the gale by transforming obstacles into instruments. Pressure tightens from cloud interpretation to tower construction as the storm "mouth" widens. Agency is continuous—dubbing, striking, stacking—with visible cost (Zaya enlisted, swarm summoned, net hauled aboard). The net-of-knives complication adds a second pressure wave that the protagonist resolves through the same motive logic (dub as Sistrum). One clear escalation: mouth in cloud → tower of beats → lull → net hazard → final passage. Cost legible in labor and tactical pivots.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: answering the watchers to resolve hunger and her mother's disappearance. Pressure coheres through pattern-reading (bleached limpets, tide knots, lattice of dots) and tightens when the protagonist decodes the ledger and the watchers respond by "altering their spacing." The corridor of glare narrows options to a stark choice: retreat or be measured. Cost is visible on the page—she understands her mother became "a unit of distance" and chooses the same fate. Agency is renunciation with eyes open.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—rescue truth versus honor noble lies—signals early and tightens through accumulation rather than reversal. Each artifact (struck word "passengers," tulips matching strike story, compass needle vs. southbound ledger) narrows the interpretation and raises moral cost. The piece lacks a sharp on-page turning point where choice forecloses an option under duress; instead, the narrator's stance crystallizes through layered reflection. The ending gesture (copying names, delivering the ledger) demonstrates agency with felt cost—publishing methodology to prevent "method…mistranslated into malice"—but the escalation reads as deepening conviction rather than pressure-tested transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—to witness and map abandonment rather than restore—is signaled early and sharpens through the surveyor's ritual: wresting the door, placing notes, copying names from the water-bitten program. One meaningful tightening occurs when the surveyor rejects rescue or recognition ("I do not wait for rescue or recognition; I wait for the moment when what is gone accepts my witness without shame"), narrowing the task to solitary testimony. Deduction: no visible cost or trade-off; the surveyor completes each step without opposition, making escalation more rhythmic than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake signaled early: "trace honest origins in a city that has forgotten how to sign its name." The blackout is not mere backdrop—it removes ambient hum, allowing "proof [to] stand out from rumor." Pressure tightens through a chain of discoveries: news bill predates official timeline → council minutes show imports not weather → registrar's margin proposes "we were lowered, not lost." Each stamped document narrows interpretive options and raises conceptual cost. Agency is sustained through micro-choices (pull drawer, press stamp, test citations backward). The ending forecloses broadcast in favor of proximity ("keep it near the words"), a renunciation with felt cost. One clean escalation loop under the Accumulative lens, no coincidence rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake (reconcile with the lost shadow) is signaled early and pressure coheres under the accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening occurs when the shadow's hand touches his chest and "loosens" rather than returns, narrowing options with felt cost (he laughs, accepts the ache's release). Agency appears as patient craft (polishing, folding, releasing) and final acceptance. No reversals complicate the path; each ritual step unfolds without setback, flattening escalation. The cost is legible on the page (shadow remains apart, protagonist adjusts stance), but the lack of a middle complication or trade-off caps the band below 7.0. Under the accumulative lens one deepening suffices, yet a second pressure point would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—finding where unused potential pools—is signaled early and tightens through perturbation sequences that narrow the search to a basin. The protagonist's agency (running the sequence, perturbing current, marking coordinates) drives escalation under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the final vow to "remain awake" and the recognition that "pooling in me keeps my heart from burning up," though the price feels more conceptual than visceral; no sharp trade-off forecloses a concrete path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: decode the frequency of belonging. One meaningful tightening occurs when the algorithm is adjusted to "read silence as a letter," enabling the climactic message. The pilgrim's hand trembling "above the paper as if it were a pond" and the whispered idea that "letters might be waiting for a story" register pressure, but the resolution lacks visible cost—both characters walk away improved without forfeiting a live option. Agency exists (adjusting the algorithm, guiding drones), but the final agreement to return feels additive rather than renunciatory.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether to confess the forgery and face the withheld truth—tightens through Mara's arrival, her demand to "return to origins," and the shore excavation that narrows options with each plank discovered. The watch hand's reappearance and Mara's revelation ("he saved the boy...that boy was you") force the narrator's confession with visible cost: the archive burns, one page kept as penance. Agency is clear and the price (professional identity dissolved, public memory rewritten) forecloses the old path. One escalation beat feels slightly telescoped when the fourth plank is discovered, but pressure coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: complete the prisoner exchange without violence or collapse. The tightening occurs when the second trade snags on a misremembered raid name and "tempers climbed the steps," forcing the protagonist to intervene with the drawer pull speech. Agency is decisive—the negotiator's choice to show the tarnished brass and invoke shared loss directly earns the resolution. Visible cost: the protagonist must stand alone in the cold afterward, the recurring task unending ("the metal cooled"). The escalation is modest but sufficient for this length, driven entirely by protagonist decisions under the inferred causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—align heart and action—is signaled early ("I wanted to align heart and action, that I was tired of steering one way while pulsing in another") and tightens when the boy's need forces the narrator to choose between retreat and re-engagement. The escalation is Accumulative: the poles' hum, the boy's question ("if I was a real navigator"), and the father's shame converge to narrow options. The cost is legible on the page: "I pressed the astronomical compass to my sternum like a seal unbroken at last," foreclosing the penance loop with visible emotional price. Agency is clear: the narrator "could have said ask the Coast Guard" but instead invites the boy aboard, a micro-choice with immediate consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether to leave cleansed or stay and serve—is signaled early and tightened once when the baseball warms and forces confession. That single reversal narrows options: after speaking the worst truth, the protagonist can choose departure or ferrying. The cost is implied (staying means ongoing "useful ache") but not vividly shown in a forfeited opportunity or immediate price paid on the page. Agency is present in the final choice but lacks a felt trade-off that would elevate the band.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—reforging the bond with Mira—is signaled immediately and tightens when the narrator realizes "my metamorphosis is the coin." The pressure accumulates through spice-conjuring, the beasts' approach, and Mira's half-formed arrival, then deepens at "Let me in, or let me go," forcing the narrator to choose transformation. The cost is made explicit: loss of plain speech, becoming "more passage," with the price visible in the shift from solitary beast whisperer to shared breath-keeper.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (reclaim lost maternal time) is signaled early and braided with guilt. Escalation is accumulative: pilgrimage → chamber discovery → ritual confession sequence, each narrowing emotional options. Agency is enacted through deliberate ritual acts with visible cost: "For the night my daughter coughed and I only listened, I pressed my palm into the cloth and spoke water." The final vow—"I would unfasten every future knot with both hands"—is protagonist-driven renunciation that forecloses easy forgiveness. One tightening at the chamber where "I could not seize it, only atone" redefines the quest with felt limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (unlock the dimension) is signaled early and tightens through the balance constraint: too light or too heavy seals the lock. The greenhouse shadow-work beat narrows options by requiring self-integration before approach. Peak escalation occurs when the door "tasted my balance and my grief, and asked for a story paid in breaths," forcing the protagonist to offer oral testimony rather than mechanical force. Closure choice (seal with a promise, not locks) forecloses the conquest path with visible cost: perpetual tending and solitude. One clean reversal when the chamber reveals seeds rather than a weapon redefines the mission with immediate ethical weight.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: orchestrate safe evacuation without spectacle or myth-making. Pressure coheres through accumulative placement of bottles and arrivals, then tightens when the mountain exhales. The fisherman's prophecy mention and Mara's embarrassment add a secondary friction (vanity vs. utility) that inflects but does not split the core conflict. Agency is decision (bottle placement, freeing fireflies) and renunciation (disavowing heroism). Cost is conceptual and relational: she cannot escape being named in the elders' thanks, foreclosing her wish for anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—spark a silent revolution—is signaled early. Pressure coheres but does not escalate: the blackout grants opportunity rather than narrowing options, and Rhun's appearance could tighten stakes but resolves with a single nod. No visible price is paid; the revolution succeeds without friction or loss. Agency at closure is present but the cost remains conceptual and unfelt.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (rescue the brother) is clear and escalates through one meaningful tightening: the spiral-door opens, but staying open requires the eel herder's sacrifice. The protagonist's agency drives the ritual collaboration and the final acceptance of the herder's terms. The cost is visible and irreversible on the page. The brother's passivity (he can only aim, not stop) slightly undercuts joint agency, but the protagonist's choice to "brace the aperture" and accept the exchange sustains pressure through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—"to understand the cartography of scars"—is signaled early but never meaningfully tightened. The poet arrives, listens, traces a map, and declares understanding without facing a live choice that narrows options or imposes cost. The caretaker's revelation about the teacher is pure exposition; the poet does not have to trade, endure, or forfeit anything to receive it. No reversal or deepening changes the poet's tactical options; the storm "rolls nearer as if listening" but does not force action.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—decoding the sundial to find the destination—is signaled early and tightens through Rook's challenge, then the fencing duel narrows options with visible physical and conceptual cost. Agency is clear: the protagonist's mechanical-arm parry and decision to "step into his line" and speak the invitation shifts the standoff from combat to treaty. One meaningful escalation occurs when Rook lunges at the map and the protagonist blocks, then offers passage terms; the "three signatures" requirement makes the cost of inclusion legible and forecloses pure victory.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (forge beauty from anarchy before the next molting) is signaled by line 15 and sustained. The accumulative lens allows escalation to read as density increase and cadence shift rather than causal reversal: volunteers arrive, poems are clipped, the map is revealed, the door clicks shut. Agency is present in micro-choices (sorting, wiring, reading pennies aloud) but the final "practice until dawn" lacks a visible trade-off or foreclosed path; the resistance blooms without palpable friction. One meaningful deepening occurs when the map is opened and addresses revealed, reweighting the scope of the project.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—"surprise fate with an unplanned encore"—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens: the pianist climbs into the arbor, tunes his steps to the compasses, winds the broken clock, and plays against the station schedule until the train delays. One meaningful tightening occurs when "the film hissed" and the announcement breaks, proving the encore reached the timetable. Agency is clear (he chooses to play, modulates by compass tremor, does not stop), and the final hush reconfigures the station's rigid patience. However, the cost remains conceptual and atmospheric—no personal path is visibly foreclosed, no specific relationship or future altered on the page—keeping the stakes from landing with full embodied weight.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—plant the seed where the island still listens before monsoon erases memory—is signaled early and tightens through the dream count, Iru's arrival with the conch, and the seed's pulse matching village numbers. One meaningful deepening occurs when Iru asks "if the stories feared drowning or erasure" and the narrator answers "Both," immediately raising the conceptual cost. The planting choice is protagonist-driven, and the tree's first leaf "glinted the village roofs and the braided wind, intact again" shows visible consequence. The monsoon "waited" feels slightly convenient, but the closure image—rain as "punctuation, not erasure"—reweights the stake with felt relief and persistent obligation ("Work remains").

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—finding the color of unspoken apologies—is signaled early and tightens through the lace-map walk to the cove where words were swallowed. The protagonist's agency is renunciation: abandoning storm-caging for responsive pruning. Cost is conceptual but legible: "no more shaping storms into bonsai just to admire how quiet their cages looked" forecloses the old pedagogical stance. Pressure accumulates rather than reversing, fitting the accumulative lens. The tightening is meaningful but the peak moment lacks a visceral tradeoff beyond thematic repricing, keeping it just below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake is internal conflict between dramatic models and gradual observation, escalating through Mara's agency in sweeping, tracing, and adopting a new discipline.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes are clearly signaled as internal—finding where unused love is stored—and escalate under the accumulative lens through protagonist agency, using the camera obscura and Kwan Yin's tear to deepen knowledge. A meaningful tightening occurs when the past life memory surfaces, forcing a stance crystallization with cost legible in the breath rhythm shared with the man. The resolution is earned by the protagonist's alteration, foreclosing paths with visible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens, with cost legible in emotional weight (e.g., testing the bowl on the diver). One meaningful tightening forecloses options, though pressure is gradual rather than sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes escalate under the Accumulative lens through deepening understanding rather than external conflict. Protagonist agency drives the progression from following codes to aiding the mentor, with cost legible in the shift from stealing to returning. One meaningful tightening occurs, but the internal focus slightly limits pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation is driven by Arlen's agency under the accumulative lens, with stakes in creating safe zones deepening through his narration and glassblowing. Cost is legible in the physical thaw and emotional shift, as "the heart thaws when given purpose." One meaningful tightening occurs when he tests the air with a narrated voyage, reweighting the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake of proving vulnerability as power escalates through protagonist's agency in decrypting notes and climbing to the roof; cost is legible in the emotional risk of confrontation and the braiding of terror and trust at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.4)
    Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency, as the oracle's method of summarizing silence deepens the stakes, leading to the courier's change of heart. Cost is visible in her bleeding fingers and his forfeiture of orders, narrowing options meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation under accumulative lens is driven by the robot's agency in each loop, narrowing options and deepening stakes. Cost is legible on-page in the "mundane mysticism" of practice, with a meaningful tightening that forecloses paths through endured repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.4)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under causal lens; stakes of mistrust tighten through eavesdropping and public confession, with cost legible in the narrator's vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.5)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, as the maze's objection forces a confession that deepens stakes. Cost is legible in the reconciliation and the vine's decision, narrowing options meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (mantas' return and proving sideways time) escalates under the Hybrid lens through Jae's agency, from building the probe to inverting fields. Cost is unmistakable in the surge tides and the "delayed selves" at closure. One meaningful tightening occurs when the lever pull triggers the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (unraveling the ghost's code) escalates under the Accumulative lens through protagonist agency, with meaningful tightening in beats like finding the portrait and conducting silence. Cost is unmistakable in the transformation and resolution, driven by choices that narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stake of witnessing is signaled early; escalation occurs through environmental pressures (flood, mushrooms) under accumulative lens, with cost legible in adaptation and renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes of emotional connection escalate under accumulative lens through music and eclipse totality; protagonist's agency in holding the locket deepens cost. One meaningful tightening forecloses isolation with visible relief.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (preserving stories) escalates under the accumulative lens through the historian's agency—probing diaries, finding the disk—culminating in a cost-legible deepening. The final reconfiguration narrows options, foreclosing dreams in favor of echoes, with the cost felt in the bronze quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens, from receiving specs to projecting the message; cost is legible in the town's acknowledgment and the agent's blank microdot; stakes tighten meaningfully, though the social cost is subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (preventing possession and neighborhood tilting) is signaled early and escalates through Ilario's agency using rhetorical devices. Cost is unmistakable when the whisper evaporates, and escalation is driven by protagonist choices under the causal lens. The final reconfiguration narrows options with visible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—how Mara will respond to loss and recalibrate her relationship to work and disaster—is clear and coherently held. Pressure “escalates” texturally rather than causally, through accumulating observations and the arrival of neighbors shifting her from solitary contemplation to communal, methodical action. However, conflict remains very low-key: no option is truly foreclosed, and her new stance faces little resistance or real risk. The result is thematically rich but somewhat low-tension for an elite market.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—how to handle dangerous proof against a rival who already tried to kill the narrator—is clear and sharpened by the decision not to go purely punitive or purely self-erasing. Pressure escalates from reflective return, to divinatory reading, to concrete recognition of the rival and his chain of debt, to a high-stakes plan that risks public confrontation. The cost of their midpoint/annealed answer is legible: continued vulnerability, slow justice, and relinquishing simpler, safer options. Because all opposition is off-page and physical threat remains abstract in the current scene, the conflict sits more in ethical calculus than visceral tension.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether meaning and emotional communion can survive after noise becomes impossible—comes through clearly and deepens via the failed first attempt and its consequences (“lilies blistered in sympathy”). Escalation is mostly internal/technical rather than overtly dramatic, but the algorithm rewrite and the weighting of forks with specific leaves register as real adaptation under pressure. The on-page performance shows the revised method working while still carrying risk (avoiding “cheap drama of misread sadness”), and the cost is an ongoing, meticulous effort rather than a single sacrificial moment. It’s a quiet but coherent tightening consistent with the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—transforming the dead’s unending distress into a permanent, peaceful address—is clear early and threads through every beat. Pressure escalates from eerie disturbance to the concrete threat of the mantled thing testing the dome and the warning that a broken lens can “miscall storms,” adding genuine risk to his continued ritual work. The main turn is his decision to ignore the warning and keep aligning shards until the signal redefines “home,” which reads as earned and consequential. The stakes are metaphysical rather than visceral, so the conflict feels intense but meditative rather than harrowing, which slightly softens impact in a high-competition field.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes—survival under sanctions and protection of donors’ identities/dignity—are clear from early on and remain coherent. The key tightening is the patrol confrontation, where Mara’s stance and the community’s secrecy are tested under potential arrest or exposure; afterwards, tactics sharpen (weaving runs between sleep cycles). Conflict is more situational and ethical than combative, but fear of raids and “lists somewhere” keeps tension humming. The only limitation is that we never see a concrete loss or partial failure on the page, which would have pushed the escalation into an even higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether she will continue hoarding love or risk letting it flow—is clear but remains largely interior and low-intensity. Escalation is nonetheless present: ingesting the tear, confronting the past-life self, and then choosing to “send out the portions I never spent” each deepen commitment and narrow her stance. The brief encounter with the man on the arches nicely tests and confirms this new practice in a social context. Still, there’s little sense of genuine jeopardy or trade-off beyond metaphorical cost, keeping the conflict band solid but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator can engage time/grief without being frozen in retrocognition—tightens through each intensification of the shard’s power and the garden’s transformations. Escalation is largely internal but concrete: the fire returns more embodied and costly, the geometry becomes more impossible, and the underwater vault stages a direct confrontation with alternative rooms (unburned library, child-self) that test his desire to rewrite loss. His ultimate choice is not to seize a fixed past but to accept the present as fading, signaled by welcoming the cost “if I can read its texture” and stepping onto the ring-lit path. The pressure is coherent and cumulative, though it remains quieter and more contemplative than agonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—securing and exporting seeds before she’s stopped—is clear early and tightens when the enforcers enter and again when she must leave the arrow behind and flee into the crowd. Escalation is more about narrowing options than reversals: the noise window will close, the enforcers cut free, and her route constricts to flight with burden. The impeding maneuvers (jamming gears, toppling shelves) are tactical responses that visibly alter options for both sides. The only limitation, at this tier, is that the enforcers’ threat remains mostly functional rather than deeply personalized, so the pressure is high but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—can the narrator meaningfully capture trust before it breaks, and thus change how people engage with rupture—is signaled early and deepened as they move from abstract research to the diver’s grief to their own betrayal. Pressure escalates conceptually rather than through overt confrontation, culminating in the bench scene where they risk reopening an old wound to refine the work. The final choice to embed the pattern into devices for others is clearly a stance with cost: it means accepting foreknowledge without control. Stakes remain more internal and philosophical than visceral, which may feel slightly cool compared to the intensity of the world-building.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—can she answer her mentor’s summons and ethically resolve the debt of failed “stolen” light—is clear and tightens as she decodes the bouquet, breaks into the room, and confronts the blank negatives. Escalation is more conceptual than peril-driven, but the turn where he asks “Teach me… how to reinterpret the debt” sharply deepens pressure by inverting their teacher–student dynamic. Her choice to unstopper the jar and reframe their craft constitutes an earned resolution, though the price is mainly internal rather than dramatically contested on the page. A bit more friction or potential failure around the negatives’ revival could have heightened the sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Arlen can genuinely establish a safe, alive space for inquiry in an abandoned, once-dangerous site—is clear, but escalation is subtle. Pressure grows through his physical exertion, the kiln’s brightening, and the imagined future gathering, culminating in his explicit renunciation of a prior fear. There is a meaningful tightening when he shifts from solitary craft to planning for others and re-shelves the bookmark, effectively committing to care-with-risk rather than retreat. Still, conflict remains mostly internal and never faces a concrete external challenge, which keeps the tension moderate rather than high.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stakes—identity, moral responsibility, and whether to confront/join the brother—are clear early and deepen as the protagonist chooses to enter the library, solve the cipher, and climb to the roof. The decoding sequence and lock combination are good pressure points that require active choice rather than passive reception. The final plan to “return the credits and keep the courage” crystallizes a trade-off, though the professional and physical consequences are projected more than viscerally felt. The conflict remains mostly internal/relational, with external dangers hinted rather than fully testing them on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether fear and erasure will govern the valley’s memory, or whether a different way of relating to night can be carried back—is clear and coheres. Pressure escalates modestly but distinctly: from his derision, through the charged listening experiment, to his confession about burning records, to the binary of obeying orders vs. accepting a new, riskier charge. Her decision to stay and finish the map while he leaves with the booklet forecloses safe options for both. The conflict remains primarily internal and ethical rather than physically acute, which suits the piece but slightly softens felt jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—how the janitor will relate to second chances and the origin of thoughts—is clear but remains largely internal and philosophical. Escalation comes through density and reweighting (each loop adding notes, schedule paradoxes, and the generator failure) rather than sharp reversals, which fits the accumulative lens but keeps pressure gentle. The clearest tightening is the recognition that the program amalgamates errors into meaning and the generator’s failure, yet these do not force a painful or narrow trade-off so much as an adjusted understanding. The cost of accepting repetitive practice is present but understated, softening the sense of hard conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether mistrust festers or is thawed through shared truth—is clear and signaled early. Pressure escalates from private suspicion and hoarded evidence to a public, high-visibility confession that could cost the registrar his role and status. The internal and external conflicts braid well, with his fear of what silence will “let rot” directly feeding the choice to act. However, the resolution’s smooth communal acceptance slightly undercuts the sense of paid price; the risk feels sharper than the consequence that follows.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    The pressure centers on whether his blend of manipulation and reverence will be acceptable to a sentient maze that measures luck, culminating when the hedges “hiss” and the dials spin in judgment. Escalation is subtle but real: his minor rituals give way to a direct ethical test at the fountain, where he must narrate his lie and accept its cost. The maze’s eventual acceptance and the vine’s “enough” create an earned tightening rather than a convenient reprieve. Stakes remain primarily conceptual/emotional, but they are clearly articulated and not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—rescuing the mantas while testing his sideways-time hypothesis—is signaled clearly and escalates through the risky activation of the coils and the mapping/inversion of the nexus. The use of the lever as a point of no return, followed by the delicate tuning of fields, gives a credible tightening. However, on-page pressure remains fairly gentle: we’re told about surge tides and anxious hands but never inhabit a moment where catastrophe feels near or where Jae must trade between, say, station safety and mantas’ lives. The resolution is earned and coherent, but the sense of real cost or narrowed options is more implied than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator can decode and answer the ghost without being claimed by the same drowning—is clear and steadily tightened, especially once the code threatens “drowning again” as the price of disobedience. The key escalation arrives when instructions shift from reading (low risk) to physical obedience (stepping only on reflections), forcing a genuine test of commitment. The internal tension between fear and “a pilgrim’s curiosity” is present but could be sharpened slightly at the crossing moment to heighten felt risk. Nonetheless, the final decision to conduct silence rather than flee is a coherent, earned resolution of that pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—can the narrator externalize the swallowed diagnosis-lie and alter their relationship to it—is established early and tightened through embodied tests (holding the gentian, balancing on the platform, confronting the scale). Pressure escalates not via reversals but through deepening: starting with oblique admission about a lie, then specifying it as a diagnosis and finally naming it aloud under ritualized scrutiny. The cost (reliving the loved one’s dissolution, risking collapse of their coping structure) is evident in the physical tension and the storm’s arrival. Escalation remains mostly internal and guided by the oracle; a brief moment where the narrator nearly resists or backs away would heighten felt risk.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether his father’s death was shaped by a deliberate act and what that truth costs to face—is clear early and steadily tightened. His decision to turn the valve, wait, listen, then increase pressure constitutes a purposeful escalation that risks confirming a banal, heavier explanation over the comfort of a ghostly or conspiratorial one. Internal and external conflicts interlock: his skepticism versus the town’s ghost story, his need for proof versus the cost of knowing “normal means are heavy.” The only limit is that the pressure is almost entirely interior, with no secondary practical peril or relationship confrontation to sharpen the risk further.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—can the narrator maintain nonjudgmental witness as the archive and world erode—is clear, and the rising river provides the most concrete external tightening. The key turn is the decision to follow the swan’s instruction to burrow to the obsidian room, which reframes the flood as survivable and deepens the relationship to regenerative silence. However, much of the conflict is atmospheric rather than sharply escalatory; pressure whispers more than bites, so options never feel truly narrow. The cost of the final endurance stance is implied (ongoing isolation, relinquished intervention) rather than viscerally felt in a single pressured beat.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stakes—whether Ada can risk opening her grief in this communal, liminal moment and whether the narrator can truly “nurture wonder” without trivializing loss—are clear and grow with the approaching totality. Escalation is marked by specific turns: inviting stories, Ada opening the locket, the narrator asking to hold it, and letting it hum on the guitar during totality. The cost is emotional exposure and reconfiguration of the locket from purely private shrine to shared instrument, which feels proportionate to the scale. Conflict remains primarily internal and situational, but tension hums steadily rather than spiking dramatically, which is appropriate yet keeps it just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether and how meaning can persist in a post-dream world, via his attempt to listen for and record what rooms remember—is clear but largely conceptual. Escalation appears as deepening rather than overt conflict: from reading diaries to discovering the tapestry’s warning, then the brass disk’s skewed map, to the realization that the axis unseated dreams and trapped stories, culminating in his commitment to act as absorber and teacher. The price is subtle (becoming “porous,” taking on stranded stories, reorganizing his world around a new gravity) rather than viscerally dramatized, so tension remains low-grade rather than gripping. Still, within a lyric mode, the progression of discoveries narrows options toward his final stance, which feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether and how to expose what everyone already knows—emerges early through the etiquette of not-looking and the dangerous content of the specs. Pressure escalates as the protagonist chooses not to pass the specs along the spy-chain but to repurpose them, then commits fully by collaborating with the keeper and literally feeding the fortunes into the lens. The key tightening is the decision to broadcast “You already know” town-wide, foreclosing the safer path of continued performative ignorance. The conflict remains quiet and conceptual rather than sharply oppositional, but for this mode it still registers as a real, irreversible stance with communal implications.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central stake—Mara’s autonomy and the neighborhood’s metaphysical stability—is explicit and present from the outset, with the time pressure of “before the possession completes” hanging over the ritual. Escalation comes through Father Ilario’s successive rhetorical strategies (anaphora → chiasmus → antithesis) each provoking a deeper reaction from the voice and from Mara. The crucial tightening is when he extracts the story of the contract and then offers the “one step…out of the deal,” forcing Mara into an active stance. The conflict remains largely internal and ritualistic rather than physically dangerous, but within that mode the pressure and cost are clear.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator can “conduct what cannot yet be heard” without destroying the cherished hush—is clear and threads the whole piece. Pressure escalates texturally as more elements (wind, ice, sirens, memories) join the proto-orchestra and the narrator shifts from writing cryptic fortunes to diagramming breaths. However, the conflict never quite crystallizes into a hard trade-off or visible loss; exhaustion is mentioned as a ticking clock but doesn’t force a decisive sacrifice beyond ending the “first movement.”

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—how the narrator will relate to their power and cyclical instant—is signaled early and tightens as they commit to the puddle-path and confront alternate timelines. Pressure escalates toward the middle arch, where continuing to defy gravity versus surrendering to ground becomes a meaningful choice. The final decision to lower and walk, coupled with erasing the tablet’s seed, forecloses the option of repeating the same transcendent mistake. Stakes remain largely internal and abstract, but they are coherent and carry a felt, not just stated, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Mara’s fear of emotional deadness and of failing her students—is established early and escalates as the backward music begins to “rub frost from the bones” inside her. The key deepening is the shift from abstract numbness to a concrete, bodily re-thawing via the experiment. However, there is little sense that the attempt might not work or might exact a sharper price; conflict stays largely one-directional toward success. Introducing a clearer risk—personal, pedagogical, or relational—at the experimental beat would raise the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.0)
    The core stake—integrity and truthful mapping versus institutional control framed as “protection”—is legible early and tightens via the pigeon threat and the official’s demand. The narrator’s choices (sending a coded confession, offering decoys, moving laterally out of sight) are clear exercises of agency that narrow paths: open confrontation is foreclosed in favor of a riskier, subtler resistance. Internal and external conflicts are well interwoven, especially in the “quarantine is care” exchange. The main limitation is the relatively low felt physical peril on the page, which keeps the stakes powerful conceptually but slightly muted viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether he can confront scent-based grief without being destroyed by it—is apparent early and escalates meaningfully when the UV reveals the amberhorn etching, then again as the ambershade opens. The pressure is internal but real: opening the vial, staying as the flower blooms, and allowing his tears to be collected all foreclose his prior avoidant stance. The cost (voluntary exposure to collapse-inducing memories) is legible and feels paid on the page. Stakes are intimate rather than high-drama, and one slightly sharper moment of near-withdrawal could have heightened the turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether he can encounter the “texture of time” without doing harm and without evading his own complicity—is signaled early and returned to at the mirror. Pressure escalates conceptually: from fascination with time, to witnessing the prison of clocks and impossible choices, to confronting his own “knots” and needing to grant himself consent to go on. Agency at closure is real (choosing to braid rather than cut away his past), and the cost is accepting a less-heroic self-image. Still, conflict remains mostly internal and rarely feels contested or risky; the energy being never truly opposes him, so tension is more meditative than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—whether and how the narrator can “unbind the silence” and find beauty in the unfinished—stays clear, and the decision to treat the gathered fragments as a map toward “halves and almosts” is a meaningful deepening. Pressure operates situationally and internally, accumulating through the hush, the community’s losses, and the children’s questions rather than via overt reversals. The closing choice to practice “magnificent simplicity” and follow the unresolved “song” into evening feels like an earned stance crystallization. The subtle escalation may read too gentle for the very top band but is coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Rhea can ethically integrate empathy into her work without self-erasure—is clear and engaged from her first explanation. Pressure deepens as the counterfeit takes hold, moving from abstract talk to the concrete act of her taking and wearing the petal, which commits her to a path of changed practice. Conflict is primarily internal and relational, with no sharp reversal; escalation is a steady thickening rather than a spike. That restraint fits the piece but keeps the felt cost and narrowing of options in a quieter register than top-tier tension.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether invisible labor will be named and honored—is clear and steadily deepened from private intent to public act. The main tightening occurs when Mara decides to bring Hideo’s story and the Ledger out after the symphony, moving from safe recordkeeping to visible ceremony. However, opposition remains mostly conceptual: “recognition can be risky” is stated but not really tested by concrete pushback or misstep, so tension stays gentle. As a result, escalation feels more like widening inclusion than hardening pressure, strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator can re-anchor community ritual and thus belong—is evident and escalates through the failed image-hunt for the tag into the more profound realization that the “tag” is a posture enacted together. Pressure is quiet but real: the loss of the old arbor, the town’s tentative disuse of gathering, and the narrator’s ache for connection all tighten into the decision to dedicate their practice and integrate old shards into the new frame. The cost is subtle but present: they accept ongoing responsibility and a belonging that doesn’t erase their ache. Still, tension remains more contemplative than urgent, so the pressure never fully bites at a visceral level.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—accessing and depicting the birthplace of echoes without abusing time or trapping the creatures—is legible from early on. Pressure escalates as the narrator widens the oval by borrowing more from the giant’s nap, then recognizes both the ethical stakes (not pinning the larvae) and temporal cost (bells warning of debt). The turning choice to let one larva go and then to seal the oval, accepting repayment of borrowed seconds, is clearly a narrowing of options that forecloses deeper interference. The conflict remains largely conceptual and aesthetic rather than visceral, so while it’s finely wrought, the felt danger never becomes as sharp as it could.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether he can reframe his sister’s absence into livable “coherence”—is legible early and tightens as he moves from contemplation to action (placing stone, addressing eyes, threading rope, tying it to stalactite). The escalation is primarily internal, but clear: from questions to theorem, from watching to leaving a piece of himself (the eyes) behind and taking the rope. There is a felt price in accepting longing as a “variable” rather than solving it, which reweights his future. Still, the pressure never quite bites; no genuine alternative path is dramatized or threatened in-scene, so tension stays elegantly low-grade.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stakes are modest but clear: will he manage to help the girl—and, by extension, honor his vow to be “visible to those who need you”—without burning himself in the lantern of fear? Pressure tightens credibly when he discovers she is physically present and distressed, forcing him from passive listening into a riskier, tool-mediated intervention. The cost is quiet but legible: he sacrifices the chance for direct recognition in favor of structured, anonymous service. Escalation is more emotional/ethical than dramatic, but it reads intentional and sufficient for the scale.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—how to tend (plants and people) under ongoing disruption—is signaled early and coherently tightened as storms undo her efforts and the town’s anxiety mounts. The meaningful turn comes when she starts keeping a ledger of what she has not forced and later articulates this stance at the community hall; she forecloses the path of command/control as her primary caregiving mode. Internal and external pressures (weather, customers, town expectations) are interwoven, though never explosive. Because the conflict remains mostly contemplative and never quite corners her into a painful live trade-off, the escalation feels strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stakes are primarily emotional and spiritual—grief, trust in the island, and the risk of giving up the gnat’s “tiny held storm”—and they escalate from solitary insomnia to a shared ritual that may summon the dead. The key tightening is the mother’s request for an exchange they can bear, which forces a choice and a price. Tension is quiet but real; the decision to accept the cost and make a long-term pact with the island reweights both characters’ futures. Some conflict beats could carry sharper resistance or fear to heighten the felt risk of the supernatural bargain.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—who will be chosen by the pearl, and what that means for the village and the guide’s role—is clear and threads the scene. Escalation arrives when the pearl rolls toward the pilgrim, the narrator attempts to intervene, and unseen forces overrule her, narrowing her options and foreclosing her expected path. However, tension stays gentle and contemplative rather than truly pressured; the loss of authority and the ethical question of taking vs. sharing are not pushed into sharper conflict. The resolution feels earned but a bit low-intensity for elite-level stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the harbor can relearn a structure for return—is clearly signaled and gently tightened as the woman asks the archivist to “hearten the harbor,” leading to the window-tapping experiment and the decision to treat the valve as a metronome rather than a summoning instrument. Escalation is accumulative and tonal rather than dramatic: the dockworker’s pause, others glancing up, and someone humming all signal the stakes becoming communal. The archivist’s choice to focus on intervals and practice, not performance or monuments, forecloses a more grandiose, one-time solution in favor of sustained, modest work. The pressure never becomes sharp, but within this lyric mode the deepening is coherent and sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central conflict—whether to remain governed by safe, rigid patterns or to risk listening to unspoken truths—tightens credibly through the dare, the train journey, and the confrontation with disappointed faces. The decisive escalation comes when the mouth returns the punch and demands the protagonist keep their patterns, forcing a genuine internal trade-off. The cost is emotionally implied (facing harm done by silence, loosening the discipline that has defined them) but not tied to a sharply delineated external consequence. As a result, tension feels deeply real but a bit abstract compared to the best work at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—can the narrator create a space for reflection that honors truth without collapsing into mysticism—is clear and engaged by Lio’s need for his mother’s voice. Pressure meaningfully tightens when they agree to use the tile with Lio’s shell, when the mother’s nickname appears unexpectedly, and especially when the narrator chooses to sit in the “room” and speak their own losses. The cost is emotional exposure and a partial surrender of strictly rational distance, but resistance and friction remain gentle; there are no sharp reversals or truly threatening alternatives. Escalation feels appropriate for a quiet piece but stops short of bracing confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—forcing the universe to reveal what happens after goodbye, with Lio’s past farewell as crucible—is clear and present from early on. Pressure escalates as the fragment activates, the “spatial mutiny” manifests, and the corridor made of unsaid farewells exacts payments of memory and unforgiveness. However, tension is primarily intellectual and lyric rather than viscerally fraught; the protagonists never feel in serious danger or forced into a wrenching trade-off. The final turn to shared purpose and softened resentment is earned but arrives with a relatively gentle sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—getting Arman to asylum as a form of fair trade—is clearly established and tightened through the director’s inspection, the alarm reset, and the brief, risk-filled corridor to the van. Escalation is subtle but effective: the knock at the door, the bolt left hanging, the camera cycling off/on, each constricting their margin. The narrator’s choice to take incriminating numbers instead of money and to trust legal channels heightens moral stakes at the end. The only limit is that external resistance remains relatively smooth; nothing truly threatens to derail the plan once the director leaves.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure is quiet but real: the town’s evacuation and silence create the need to respond, and the narrator’s self-imposed discipline generates a sustained internal stake. Escalation comes through intensification of his practice (from charting hum to refracting light to writing tailored histories) and through environmental shifts (frozen basin, weakening lamp) that make his work more fragile and urgent. The central tension—between honoring silence and rewriting absence with “invented histories”—could stand one more sharply dramatized moment of friction to lift stakes. Still, the ending crystallizes his stance as a costly endurance, which reads as a credible resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether he will remain a ghost or force a reckoning with his erasure—emerges early and tightens as he moves from passive listening to targeted investigation to confronting the widow. The overheard cleaners and the mechanic’s partial recognition are credible turns that deepen pressure and narrow his options. The final choice to leave the label and walk away, rather than reclaim his life or accept her narrative, forecloses paths with a clear emotional and existential cost. Escalation is quiet and mostly internal, which keeps it below the very highest band but still strong.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—decode a “universal riddle” before the tide drags the answer away—is clearly stated, and pressure accumulates as the hums deepen, the compass responds to thoughts of failure, and the listening “page that never closes” steps from the wind. Escalation is mainly qualitative: texture and density of response increase rather than options visibly narrowing. His key act is choosing to answer the riddle with a crooked, playful bow and collaborative playing, which yields the redefinition of what the riddle was about. Still, the felt price or foreclosed alternative (what it would mean to cling to certainty instead) remains abstract rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the carnival community can shape gentrification instead of being erased—is clear early and tightens as fences appear and the consortium’s liaison demands guarantees. The escalation is driven by Nessa’s agency: she proposes the experiment, risks using the old console, and literally rearranges the city, foreclosing the option of passive endurance. Cost is credibly scaled: they gain a season, not salvation; the threat of eventual sale remains, and her relationship with her brother must bend. Some crucial beats (negotiation, potential failure) are summarized rather than dramatized, which slightly softens moment-to-moment tension.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—capturing proof of the last glacier moth at the precise “hush” of dawn—is signaled early and tightened via the countdown of blue, then ochre, then white flames. External and internal pressures braid well: the impending dawn, the moth’s single emergence, funding requirements, and the narrator’s private need to say goodbye. Escalation is subtle but clear under an accumulative lens; there’s no sharp reversal, but each timed flare increases urgency until the shutter decision crystallizes everything. This gentleness keeps the stakes from feeling feral-level high, but for a quiet piece the pressure is well calibrated.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—guiding the freight cars into safe coupling before the maiden voyage—appears early and tightens credibly when the fog thickens and the second car starts to “slant.” The second-car wobble and momentary failure of the bowl ritual are real escalations that demand new tactics (rain basin, live code patch). However, the sense of possible loss stays relatively abstract; the artisans’ high competence and the smoothness of the correction undercut any visceral fear of catastrophe. The price paid is primarily cognitive effort and strain, not a truly felt sacrifice or lasting mark.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—discovering and honoring the true origin of the rivers—remains coherent and tight throughout, and escalation is present in the move from interior experiment to exterior exploration to physically opening the valves. The key tightening is the decision to speak the phrasebook prayer and turn the wheel, initiating “singular convergence” and risking the ethical worry of taming what he studies. Conflict is primarily situational and internal; external jeopardy (cold, ice, under-hill space) is more implied than dramatized with concrete loss. This keeps pressure modest, even as the thematic and conceptual stakes are rich.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.4)
    The core stake—whether a fragmented, abandoned community will risk returning into shared rhythm—is consistent and legible from the outset. Pressure does deepen from solitary tuning to communal walking to the repaired bell, and the mother’s decision to return and neighbors’ curiosity provide modest social tension. Still, escalation is gentle; there are no real reversals, and little is visibly at risk for any individual beyond mild discomfort and memory of past quarrels. The ending asks for an ongoing practice, but the cost of refusal or failure is more implied than felt in the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stakes (crew’s survival vs. narrator’s risk under depth/time pressure) are signaled early and escalate coherently as the corridor narrows, visibility collapses, and air runs low. A key tightening is the moment of panic in the silted corridor where she must choose stillness over instinct, followed by the surge that tries to tear her loose just as the signal takes—each reversal costs composure and time. Agency drives the resolution: she positions the transmitter creatively with the vial, rides the hush outward, then decides to leave, hauling the line back. The only constraint on an even higher score is that internal moral/psychological conflict (beyond fear vs. duty) remains relatively simple compared to the richness of the worldbuilding and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—how he will position himself in relation to the imminent discovery of bodies and his family legacy of false alarms—is clear and sharpened by the impending boat. Escalation is subtle but real: the initial return to the lighthouse → discovery of the prison interior and speaking tubes → meeting the woman with the lying compass → revelation of the drain with “answers that were not yet bodies” tighten moral and narrative pressure. His final choice about how to speak to investigators is an authentic narrowing of options rather than an abstract epiphany. The conflict remains primarily internal and meditative, so some readers may crave a slightly more concretized external risk, but for this mode it’s sufficiently taut.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the keeper can truly wake the orchard without misusing the key or awakening grief—remains coherent and is tightened when she demands his promise and later teaches the six-syllable cadence. Escalation is primarily conceptual and emotional: the bead’s first activation, the orchard’s “reply,” and her progressive fading as the debt nears repayment. The cost of success (losing her) is clear, but there is little sense of alternative tactics or live options beyond obedience and endurance; we never see a serious temptation to break the promise. As a result the conflict feels profound but relatively low-friction for a piece aiming at the absolute top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—transforming the town’s relationship to a dying harbor and dangerous labyrinth—is legible early and tightened as Sera rejects the safe precedent of leaving offerings and retreating. Pressure escalates through concrete risks: entering a place that has claimed many lives, confronting votive nets for the lost, and using a banned object in a sacred mechanism. The key turn is her refusal to follow precedent (“Precedents say leave offerings and retreat”) in favor of an invented ceremony that binds the community via the tethered names. The conflict is more situational and ritualistic than adversarial, so tension is quieter rather than knife-edge, but it maintains coherence and culminates in a costly, agency-driven act.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.3)
    The stakes are primarily internal—can she repair her faith in place and ancestry—but they are clearly signaled early and steadily tightened. The key deepening comes when she and Sami choose to rebuild the sundial not “for timekeeping but to ask time to notice us again,” which crystallizes the conflict between interrupted and restored journeys. Her final decision to remain and tend the orchard is an earned resolution of that pressure. The escalation is quiet rather than sharply turned, but for this lyric mode it still reads as a meaningful narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—finding a name and delivery mode that protect the addressee’s reconfigured identity—comes through clearly, with internalized pressure around getting it right and not rushing. Escalation is more deepening than tightening: decoding the chalk, hearing the violin, and recognizing one’s own mark all reweight the task rather than introducing new external constraints. The brief live clock (“before a letter is mailed,” “listen for the right minute”) adds some temporal pressure, and the final refusal to drop the letter immediately is an Earned Stasis choice. Still, the stakes remain mostly conceptual; a slightly sharper sense of what could be lost by a wrong decision would intensify the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—uncovering a conspiracy before a coup, with the risk of the fool being blamed—is clearly implied and deepens as the whisper reveals falsified routes and the narrator continues to manipulate dangerous knowledge. Escalation is mostly conceptual and tonal: the cloth opens a throat, the whisper hardens into speech, the coup’s rehearsal becomes explicit, and blame is prophesied. The narrator’s choices (to keep loosening threads, to erase the ash drawing in vain, to carry the embroidery away) enact a kind of quiet endurance rather than a sharp, pressured trade-off. This makes the tension refined and resonant but also somewhat low-key compared with a more visibly foreclosing choice.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    The primary conflict—between the narrator’s reflex to flee before causing harm and the risk of staying present with Mara’s wanting—is present from the first mention of “failed the kindness of that hinge” and tightens steadily. Pressure escalates through the spirits’ question, the shard-as-plumbline ritual, the glass’s admonition about wanting, and the spoken apology practice. The cost of the resolution (choosing to return home without a decision, relinquishing the “safety” of unilateral action) is legible and scaled to the piece’s scope. The only limit is that external stakes remain largely internalized; there’s no on-page resistance beyond the narrator’s own fear.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stakes—whether the translator can “bring something back” by bridging a divided family while the boy’s surgery looms—are clear and emotionally grounded. Pressure deepens as the narrator moves from private decoding to risking a specific narrative with the mother and uncle, and then offering the coral to be left with the boy. The reconciliation is quiet but earned; their shared attention to the boy’s drawings and the tentative use of each other’s words is a credible, costly softening. The external medical stake resolves a bit conveniently and offstage, keeping the escalation more emotional/textural than truly knife-edge.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—will she meaningfully recover and reanimate the lost joy of the harvest festival—is present and escalates as the film’s damage is revealed and then collaboratively repaired. The turn to the knowledge network and the communal performance of gestures constitute a clear deepening rather than a static mood-piece. That said, pressure remains primarily emotional and aesthetic, with relatively low visible cost or risk if she failed; the piece leans into lyric accumulation more than sharp jeopardy, limiting the intensity of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—how to restore without erasing, and whether to cling to certainty—is signaled early and deepens as she uncovers successive mural layers. Pressure escalates internally, most sharply when she is asked “what I would rather not know” and later when she confesses her fear about perfect restoration; these are real narrowing points for her stance. The wall’s “amused” response and compromise (keeping underdrawings whispering beneath the gleam) constitute an earned, if quiet, resolution that follows from her articulated values. The conflict remains low-key and contemplative rather than sharply agonistic, which may limit impact for a top-tier slot but is structurally sound.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes—freedom to think without financial punishment—are signaled early and escalated through concrete pressures: audit towers, drone umbrellas, permit threats, and finally collectors entering during the concert. The protagonist’s agency meaningfully tightens things when they invoke the rehearsal clause and orchestrate the garden-message performance; that choice redefines the conflict from secrecy to public defiance. However, the resolution feels somewhat frictionless: the officers laugh and inadvertently nullify the levy, with little pushback or visible price beyond risk. The internal/moral calculus (risking everyone to exploit a legal technicality) could be shaded more to heighten felt danger.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—finding a livable, non-devouring way to live with pain and insomnia—is clear, and the textural pressure of doubt (“stubborn seed of storm weather”) offers a credible counterforce. Escalation is modest but present: her repeated, imperfect messages lead to a concrete threshold when the Gardener arrives and requires a vow “to stop confusing sharpness with safety.” The actual cost of that vow and any risk in accepting it could be sharpened; resistance softens quickly once the emissary appears. Still, the reconfiguration from solitary vigilance to shared tending reads as earned by the accumulation of prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—saving the memory within the cracked chime and thereby upholding her vow—is clear and tight. Pressure escalates modestly but effectively: the wind warns of imminent loss, the repair sequence becomes a delicate high-wire act, and the balcony release tests whether her work has succeeded. Cost and risk remain mostly internal and conceptual rather than visceral, which fits the mode but slightly softens tension. The final self-check adds one more tightening beat, though it’s quiet rather than sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether trust and collaborative work can be restored without repeating past harm—is clear from early on and tightens as she moves from private composition to placing the pages and inviting Lio to “test the promises.” Escalation is quiet but effective: the risk level rises from internal resolve, to summoning him, to letting him voice each movement and then co-author the coda. The price is vulnerability and the abandonment of silence-as-shield, with a specific new obligation to “confess doubts aloud” and plan “rescue” for meaning. The conflict could be sharpened slightly by one more moment where refusal or backsliding feels like a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stake—how water, rock, and competing districts will share power—appears early and stays coherent, with a clear tightening when the child’s evidence reveals both sabotage and forbidden love. The discovery of the hidden sluice and the decision to align the gates with the chain’s catenary create a genuine trade-off: a politically risky compromise rather than a partisan victory. Internal and external conflicts interweave effectively, especially in the choice to protect the lovers’ anonymity while confronting systemic bias. The resolution is a touch too unopposed—the council’s acceptance comes quickly, softening the sense of price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will risk trusting another artist with her music—is clear early and tightens convincingly. External pressure (the attic being cleared, skylight shuddering, gusts threatening the birds/messages) dovetails with internal fear, culminating in specific agency: cutting the phrases, balancing the birds with the meteorite, opening the hatch, climbing to fix the latch, and sending Lark to the violinist. Cost is emotional but felt: she risks repeating prior exploitation and lets her curated paper trails out into the world. The conflict is quiet rather than dramatic, but escalation is nonetheless tangible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—whether to close the distance to the father or redefine that distance as sacred—emerges early and tightens as the terrace reveals progressively more (codes aligning, seam, orchard, scarecrow). Pressure escalates from abstract longing to an explicit, actionable moment when a path downward appears. The story’s peak choice is quiet but consequential: refusing to descend, accepting loss as the price of articulated love. The conflict is primarily internal and could feel low-key to some readers, but within a lyric design the stakes read as sufficiently sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—earning a form of belonging the city consents to, before sunrise—remains coherent and is tested through the need to “captivate the sentinel algorithm” and answer its question honestly. There is a meaningful deepening when the city shifts from guarded to hosting, reconfiguring the narrator’s understanding of what she’s after. However, escalation is gentle; there’s little sense that failure to sync with the algorithm or archive would materially harm them beyond disappointment, so options never feel truly foreclosed. The result is strong internal pressure but relatively low external or moral cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why the path disappeared and how to respond—is clear and resolved through a meaningful turn when the subterranean “newborn sentence” is revealed. The protagonist then chooses to honor the land’s request and create an alternate path, a gentle but genuine trade-off between convenience and safety/reverence. However, pressure never feels acute; the beast is cautious rather than threatening, and the “deadline” and community needs never generate real tension or visible risk. Escalation is thus more intellectual than visceral, keeping stakes modest.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether the performer can convert a routine inter-act lull into authentic, transformative serendipity—intensifies via the janitor’s grief and the precarious bishop-on-coin moment. The pressure is subtle but real: will this stay a trick or become a genuine shared beat of meaning, and will the bishop become souvenir or remain tool. The tightening occurs around the janitor’s confession and the bishop’s almost-gift, foreclosing one path (relinquishing the piece) in favor of a more ethical, principled stance. The stakes stay small-scale and quiet; for a lyric piece this works, but escalation remains more nuanced than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central stake—creating and carrying a forbidden verse in a surveillance state—is clear and thematically potent. Pressure escalates primarily through intensification of the ritual (one dot, then a sky, then oath and projected risk of patrols/sea payment) rather than concrete opposition, which fits the accumulative lens but keeps tension relatively low. The narrator’s agency (choosing to proceed, to weaponize the cartographer’s body as harbor/compass, to accept future risk) is unmistakable. However, the absence of any immediate interruption or hard choice on the page softens the sense of price paid in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—how to respond to redevelopment without erasing the harbor’s soul—is clear and threaded throughout. Pressure escalates mainly through conceptual deepening (cranes coughing, “before everything shifts,” the boy’s future in the new building) rather than concrete obstacles or reversals. The pond sequence serves as the one main tightening, shifting him from vague intention to specific, somewhat costly plan (reusing ferry boards, insisting on inclusivity and mist). Because the architect, investor, and mayor remain offstage, the conflict stays more contemplative than contested, slightly muting felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    The central stake—how to bear and share the children’s loss—is articulated early and steadily tightened: from solitary burden to the risk of handing the box over, then to joint reconstruction and public-facing responsibility. Escalation is quiet but real: her arrival and request to open it together narrow his options, forcing him to relinquish some control over the pain he “translated.” The cost is emotional rather than external, but legible in his non-forgiveness and in their decision to engage with other children. The only slight limitation is that the conflict never truly threatens to break or rupture the relationship in the scene, keeping tension more atmospheric than volatile.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—finding a workable “equation for hope” to revitalize a numb village—is clear early and tightened as more selves arrive and the gauge searches for a new posture. Pressure escalates texturally via increasing complexity of patterns and a “chorus of me,” culminating in the unexpected steady angle on the gauge. However, the process is notably frictionless: there are no meaningful setbacks, competing imperatives, or visible risks to balance, so the protagonist’s commitment is never really tested. The result is beautifully meditative but somewhat low in felt cost or hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will truly shoulder the house’s inherited guilt/legacy rather than produce “pretty symbols”—is clear and coherently pressured by each new revelation. Escalation is quiet but present: the negative’s glimpse, the hopscotch test, and the unsent letter successively intensify what it would mean to accept or refuse the vow. Agency is expressed in attention and ritual play, then crystallized in binding the negative into the ledger and mapping “notes that sounded like forgiveness.” The one limitation is that external jeopardy remains abstract, so tension stays more contemplative than knife-edge.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator can shift from a death-saturated self-image to one that can host possibility—remains clear and is tested through the mirror exercise. Pressure escalates as the painter demands specific, structured songs (“the tune of stay…if…unless”), moving from abstract desire to a concrete, failure-possible task. The key tightening is when the narrator must sing to the disgraced king’s mirror, forcing their desperation into disciplined form and yielding the citrus road/future hands vision. Because the conflict is purely internal/ritualistic, the sense of jeopardy could be made a shade more acute, but for a quiet lyric it still lands.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central stake—whether the “forever war” can be materially softened through this negotiation—is clear and under continuous pressure. Escalation is quiet but real: from symbolic offerings to clashing philosophies of redemption, then to the concrete needs voiced by children, culminating in the shared ritual choice around the casings and the decision to reconvene annually. The protagonist’s agency drives the key turns (letting arguments burn out, reframing redemption, invoking children, redefining the casings as witness), and the cost is the acceptance of long-term, unglamorous work rather than a clean victory. The conflict is mostly ideological/emotional, so readers seeking a sharper on-page reversal might wish for one more concrete point of near-failure.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—can he transmute his harm into preserved echoes and a kind of nearly-forgivable record—is clearly articulated and tightened through the ritual. Pressure escalates as he chooses the oculus, activates the chamber, cracks the egg, and feels both release and exposure in the shuddering structure and his watering eyes. The cost is conceptual and moral rather than survival-based, but it’s legible: the more he “keeps” echoes, the more inescapable his guilt becomes. The conflict remains largely interior and ritual, so the escalation is profound but quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—liberating the city’s speech under a repressive, surveilled palace—is clear and escalates via the limited window and approaching guards. Agency drives turns: deciding to enter, harvest echoes, descend, and rethread the looms are all active, goal-directed moves. However, tension remains more conceptual than visceral; we’re told guards near and time shrinks, but there’s no on-page setback, injury, or sacrifice, and success comes relatively smoothly. The cost is largely offstage and inferred, which softens the sense of true risk despite the lovely tonal “alarming serenity.”

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether and how they can practice “ethical storytelling” without theft—is clear early and carries through. Pressure escalates when the woman whose story was used enters and claims authority via the stick, forcing the narrator to put their new ethic into practice rather than keeping it theoretical. The cost is primarily moral and social (ceding control, exposing the troupe’s own glibness), so the tension is cerebral rather than visceral. Still, the reversal of power between performers and subjects, and the commitment to reverse any harmful scene, read as a genuine narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—how to honor erased caretakers and disrupted ecological cadences—emerges early and is tightened by the arrival of the last monarch, which concretizes extinction and witness. Escalation is subtle but present: from small signals to a “longer signal,” from ambient quiet to the hawk-shadow interruption, then to the protective repositioning of the wing and the deliberate stillness at the end. Agency manifests as choice of method and attention rather than overt confrontation, and the hawk beat gives the only clear interruption of stakes-as-usual. This internal, lyric pressure is coherent but never quite sharp enough to feel like a genuinely costly test of the narrator’s commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.5)
    The primary stake—recovering and preserving forgotten names as an act of repair—is clear, and pressure accumulates as the braids are adjusted, the horn begins to speak, and the protagonist’s own name surfaces. Conflict is largely internal and procedural rather than oppositional; the ritual unfolds without a major reversal or real risk of loss. There is a meaningful deepening when memory of the miscast wedding bell reframes the current act. The resolution feels earned but low in overt cost, reading more as a successful completion of a delicate task than a choice that sharply forecloses alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether to remain bound to decaying directives or to “transcend” them by accepting a chosen path—is clear and tightens as the storm advances and the archive reanimates. Escalation comes through increasing environmental pressure (stormfront, bunker humming) and revelation (the archive remembering “to shepherd,” the map stabilizing), culminating in the concrete choice to open the door and leave. The conflict is primarily internal/philosophical, so the lack of strong external opposition keeps it just shy of maximal intensity, but the trade-off between safety/obedience and uncertain agency is still felt. The resolution emerges from the protagonist’s actions, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will bind himself as steward to this encoded, godless covenant—is clear and progressively tightened by each discovery and test (the note, the urn, the map’s request for a steward). Escalation is subtle but real: from curiosity, to uneasy reverence, to being explicitly asked for commitment, to inscribing his faint name in the square. The cost is conceptual and practical (oil, hours, anonymity, long-term duty) rather than immediate peril, which keeps tension low-key but thematically apt. A slightly sharper moment of hesitation under that weight could push the pressure even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Rell will keep letting resentment structure his body and life—is clear from his entrance (“spine learned to quarrel with waking”) and tightens via the embodied memory of his mother and the factory. Escalation comes through the sanctuary’s increasingly intimate manipulations, culminating in the factory scene where he must actively gather and release the breath/years he’s hoarded as blame. His final acceptance of the mute box as compass and his changed inner “machine rows” constitute an earned, costly shift. The conflict is largely internal and lyric, but it maintains coherent pressure rather than drifting.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preventing the district from losing its tether to the waking city by recovering the dream—is clear from the outset. Escalation arrives when the dream thrashes, Noor’s breath shakes, and the corridor threatens to collapse, forcing Ilen to actively ground her and recalibrate their approach. However, the threat of failure never quite bites as hard as the language suggests; the dream comes to rest somewhat smoothly once the cradle-room is offered. The conflict is convincing and coherent but operates at a relatively soft, lyric pressure rather than a sharply escalating one.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes—reviving a choked spiritual ecosystem and reconfiguring a broken fatherhood—are clear and thematically braided, and they tighten as the ritual begins and the bell rings. The orchard’s overburdened limbs and clinging vows give a tangible sense of something at risk if nothing changes. However, there is minimal on-page resistance or real possibility of failure; the plan works smoothly once attempted, so escalation feels more like graceful unveiling than pressure-driven struggle. The emotional cost is present but quiet, centered mostly in the decision to wait on the tin rather than a hard trade-off under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stake—risk of being rewritten by forbidden causes/effects versus the pursuit of forbidden knowledge and connection with his aunt—is clear and coherent. Pressure escalates once, meaningfully, when he must choose whether to obey his aunt’s silent urging and eat a fruit, with the risk of self-alteration now explicit. However, his decision comes with relatively little on-page resistance or real-time struggle; fear is noted (“hands shaking”) but not deeply worked through as a conflict between incompatible imperatives. The cost is mostly conceptualized after the fact (“the orchard would claim them in return”) rather than felt as a hard trade-off in the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes—finding the library and rescuing the apprentice from the mountain’s forgetfulness—are clear and escalate in a gentle, lyric way. The rescue decision, the negotiation with the bookstore’s geometry, and the shared speaking of “failure pronounced kindly” are meaningful tightenings of pressure. However, tension remains largely conceptual and benevolent; there’s little sense that failure would carry a concrete or painful cost beyond continued forgetting, which keeps the conflict from fully biting. The story reads as serene and inevitable rather than truly fraught, which slightly limits its peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether to reclaim the garden/forgotten names at the price of the chimera twin self—is clear and steadily tightened from the moment the bargain is voiced. Escalation is internal but real: the jar labeled with a possibly-their name, the rule that each spoken name costs a twin, and the final decision to wake solace without recapturing the specific lost name. Stakes remain mostly conceptual rather than viscerally painful, which may read cool to some editors. Still, the renunciation of total “recapture” in favor of an open, costed future constitutes a credible, earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether and how absence can be translated back into institutional continuity—is clear and escalates from oddity (mislabeled box) to active experiment (knotting the rope) to direct engagement with a liminal staircase and ledger. The main tightening comes when his manipulation of the rope visibly widens or dims the doorway, making his method consequential and testable. Still, the danger level remains low: the risk of stepping through is acknowledged but not felt as a sharp dilemma, and there’s no meaningful sacrifice beyond time and composure. The result is intellectually tense but emotionally gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—preventing the caves’ maps and structures from becoming “useless echo” and finding a quiet that can hold both species—is clear and threads the piece. Escalation is present but gentle: from destabilized stone to close proximity with overfull beings to the risky act of planting the bloom of hush. Because the beings cooperate quickly and no attempt visibly fails or exacts a sharp price, tension feels controlled rather than urgent. The resolution is fully protagonist-driven but comes with minimal sense of foreclosed alternatives or near-loss.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—turning the dead beacon into a live signal that can reconnect scattered survivors and validate the narrator’s belief in meaningful coincidence—is clear and escalates from solitary work to communal consequence. There is a meaningful tightening when the missing constellation appears in the hush shard and they choose to alter the prism, and another when they commit to the first lighting. However, antagonistic pressure is gentle: there’s no real resistance, reversal, or serious risk of failure beyond implied loneliness, and the hard part of the puzzle (star map, dream call) arrives conveniently with Lio. The resolution feels earned in a thematic sense but light on palpable on-page cost or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the protagonist can claim an individual identity within a collective—is clear early and tightens as her fear of being “only a binder” intensifies. Escalation is primarily internal but structurally legible: doubt → symbolic lightning intervention → high-cost experiment of offering a personal, intimate memory. The cost of vulnerability and self-exposure is felt, and her act reconfigures the archive’s meaning. The pressure could be fractionally sharper if an external counterforce (institutional norm, implied prohibition) pushed harder against her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—lifting a community out of starless hopelessness via a risky performance—is clear and escalates from planning to execution. Pressure intensifies as they map wind, lay mortars, and finally light the cord, but the sequence reads as assured ritual more than genuine jeopardy. There’s no substantial threat of failure or backlash on the page, so the emotional cost of the attempt feels relatively safe. The resolution is earned by the protagonist’s agency, yet the conflict never tightens into a moment where a live option is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether to leave the coast for an inland life with the beloved—is clear early (“You were asking whether I would go inland, away from the tide”) and tightens through the quiet but escalating inner projections of possible futures. The pressure is situational and internal rather than plotty, but it deepens meaningfully as each imagined year and potential regret is considered. The decisive “Yes” forecloses real options with visible cost, and the relationship’s tenor shifts from uncertainty to shared passage. The tension stays gently modulated; an added on-page snag or sharper fear might have yielded an even more acute sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—reconciling the narrator’s need for breathable space with the father’s concept of safety—remains clear and tight. Pressure escalates texturally: from sampling many silences for herself to actively hunting the specific one her father might accept, then risking it in his bunker-bound environment. The final turn, sharing gilded hush and prompting him to redraw entrances, forecloses a prior path (sealed-corridor thinking) and opens a costed new one. The escalation is subtle rather than harrowing, but for this mode it’s well calibrated.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether silence can become comfort rather than a cliff, particularly for this passenger—is established early and tightened when she reveals the grief-predicting equation that fails her at the level of touch. Escalation is subtle but real: the singer’s suicide raises the cost of failure, the traversal through different acoustic zones tests his craft, and her decision to stop computing the sway and close her eyes in the echo marks a concrete stance change. The operator’s agency (re-tuning routes, slowing the gondola, modulating light and exposure) actively shapes the conditions in which this shift can occur. Stakes remain intimate rather than dramatic, but the risk of repeating the balcony’s void is clearly felt.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—reach the stairway and decide the throne’s fate before sunrise—is signaled early and followed through to a clear peak choice at the throne. Escalation is primarily procedural and conceptual (decoding murals, discovering the inverted stair, rethinking “ascension”) rather than oppositional; there is no real resistance beyond time and puzzle-solving. The final choice to leave the throne unbound and share stewardship is a real narrowing of options, but on-page cost is more implied than felt. As a result, tension remains consistently interesting but never truly sharp or punishing.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator can guide suffocating “pieces” to breathe and cross without self-erasure—is clear and tightened as the student appears, hesitates, and learns. Escalation comes through deepening: from solitary ritual to joint use of the knocker, to the breath-counting practice, to the ethical calculus of burning bridges without destroying crossings. The final test (she returns breathing and crosses alone) credibly resolves that tension with a felt cost: the keeper must both relinquish control and remain available. Stakes stay mostly internal and symbolic, which mutes some visceral urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—preventing catastrophic failure while honoring a metaphysical promise of value—is clear and escalates as gauges redden and texts warn of “predatory ideas.” The protagonist must choose between safe inaction and risk-laden responsibility: turning the chamber, installing the bolt, and especially signing their own name on the console. Internal and external stakes braid effectively, with the past scam trauma complicating the pressure to trust a “quantum promise.” The only limitation is that material downside (if this fails) remains mostly implied rather than concretely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—how to carry or refuse the legacy of a deliberately ended dynasty—is signaled early and tightened progressively by the revelations in ash. Internal and external conflicts interweave: the protagonist’s shame collides with the ancestors’ rationale and the implicit threat of a “plague of power” if the line persists. The decisive turn is the reinterpretation of “end the house” as strategic mercy and the consequent vow to build ovens, not a throne. Still, the pressure is mostly contemplative; we don’t see a strong on-page test of wavering or resistance that would heighten the sense of risk at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—what kind of future and self he will choose, and whether he can unsnap his martial vows—is established early and tightened as he moves from tentative entry to the kernel’s demand that he choose one possibility. Escalation operates texturally: the orchard’s responsiveness to his steps, the proscenium forming, the visions of divergent futures all increase pressure and narrow him toward the choice. The cost (releasing all other miracles, abandoning the war identity) is conceptually strong though not confronted in a sharply agonistic moment; his decision, while quiet, is clearly a renunciation with weight. This earns a charged, not explosive, resolution that suits the piece’s lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the archivist can honor emancipated youths whose official stories have ended—is clear early in “Most files here belong…” and sharpens when Micah’s box and the button appear. Pressure escalates as each new clue (dust stippling, scratches, overlapping crescents, counselor’s prints) raises the emotional cost of inaction, culminating in her decision to amend the record and prepare the envelope. Stakes remain internal/ethical rather than external, but the story credibly frames inaction as a kind of moral failure, so the choice carries weight. The conflict is quiet yet coherent under a textural lens, with one meaningful tightening rather than multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring erased voices against institutional indifference—is signaled early and coherently escalated as Mara moves from private anger to active sabotage. The meaningful tightening is the activation of the hidden program and the opening of a line to the museum, with the police siren and her deliberate killing of the lights hinting at real but off-page risk. Internal and external conflicts are nicely braided, but the internal side lacks a real moment of doubt or moral trade-off; she never has to sacrifice something tangible beyond safety she was already willing to hazard. As a result, tension is strong but not quite knife-edged at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—preventing the prophecy from completing and drawing predatory listeners—is clear and present from early on. Pressure escalates in a quiet, lyric way: first lines form, attention from “things with more hunger than patience” gathers, then a colder line naming a beloved city forces adaptation in register and technique. Agency is continuous but mostly iterative; the protagonist adjusts embouchure, register, and whisper to meet each threat, culminating in a maintained hush rather than a new, harder choice. The cost and narrowing of options are felt but stay mostly implied rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—properly decoding and grounding the arbor’s message so the world is “steadied”—is clear, and the hush provides a temporal window of pressure. There is one meaningful tightening: the phrase “Emerges transformed always” arrives as instruction, compelling her to alter her method by building monuments from seeds themselves. However, resistance, risk, or competing options are minimal; she accepts and executes the instruction without significant friction. The result is a beautiful but relatively low-conflict arc with limited sense of price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the tinkerer will cling to rigid planning or risk a relationship with uncertainty—is signaled and coherently escalated. External pressure (fire, hidden passage, dangerous waterfall) nicely mirrors and catalyzes internal pressure. The meaningful tightening arrives at the waterfall and the choice to cross and then to accept the admiral’s charge and build a water clock. The price and danger feel more conceptual and symbolic than viscerally perilous, so tension stays intellectual rather than fully gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator can meaningfully redeem the mistake and rebalance the “ledger” of names and matter—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates via successive experiments (weighing names, confirming the pattern, then risking the furnace ritual) that narrow emotional options from denial toward costly acceptance. Agency is entirely the narrator’s: they choose to speak the names, sacrifice the button and hair, and press the coin into the alloy, foreclosing the fantasy of Mara’s physical return. The conflict remains internal/ritual rather than overtly dramatic, which slightly softens the visceral sense of jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—guiding lost, laughter-wounded voices toward some form of release—is set early and sharpened when the woman appears, fearing that laughter will betray her again. Pressure escalates not through danger but through intimacy: her reluctance, his secret about laughter as a “key,” the experimental plucking that produces a “crooked chuckle” that changes her stance. The decisive cost is his obligation to let her go once her laughter has reconfigured itself, accepting his role as midwife rather than companion. The conflict remains largely internal and gentle, which fits the mode but slightly softens the sense of risk compared to the highest-stakes short fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—whether she can define and commit to an ethical limit that prevents becoming an instrument of torture again—is established early and tightened through the forest’s unforgiving honesty. Pressure escalates as remorse intensifies (“my chest tightens and the forest flares”) and the equations begin extracting ratios of intention to harm, culminating in the decisive act of knotting the strap as a sworn boundary. The cost is moral and psychic rather than situationally dire, but it’s legible and scaled appropriately. The only slight limit is that external stakes (the valley torturers) remain mostly projected, so tension leans heavily inward.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator can retrieve and restore an erased name from the painting—is clear and does intensify: curiosity → intuitive tug → bodily possession → act of naming with the painter as witness. The key tightening comes when the narrator feels the “anchors of intuition” and commits fully, letting the painting “borrow my lungs” and then actively gathering and speaking the letters; after that, the choice to inscribe the name rather than commodify the canvas resolves the core tension. However, the opposition is relatively soft: the painter’s shrug that story is “only texture” is more mild resistance than true obstacle, and we never feel the possibility of failure bite very hard. The result is a beautifully shaped but low-temperature conflict, appropriate to a lyric piece yet shy of maximal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will expose and rectify the ringmaster’s theft of time, releasing the ghosts—emerges cleanly and tightens as evidence accumulates. Pressure escalates from atmospheric curiosity to a moral/ontological choice once the meaning of the mainspring is clear (“To engage the mechanism meant admitting the debt…”). The decisive act of winding the barrel backward and accepting the barrel as receipt resolves the conflict through his agency rather than coincidence. Stakes remain mostly conceptual rather than viscerally dangerous, which slightly mutes felt jeopardy but fits the contemplative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    The central conflict—whether to allow a clause that compresses eternity into a moment at the risk of destabilizing or sinking the library—is clearly established and escalates elegantly. Pressure tightens via the seam through the atlases and the cloud sea lapping at the roots, forcing the operator to choose between personal longing and systemic survival. The printed moment with the mother is a meaningful price, not a free miracle, and the resulting “orchard law” forecloses the path of unexamined perfection. Stakes remain legible and coherent throughout, even in the lyric register.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central conflict—who gets to define the vanished court, tyrants or communal artisans—is established early via Ledger’s stance versus the narrator’s, and it tightens meaningfully through petition, public readings, and the high-stakes council storm. The protagonist’s agency (devising the ritual, insisting on mirror coverings, demanding a storm in the hall) drives the major escalations. Stakes are conceptual but real: control of memory, academic authority, and the narrator’s access and credibility. The price paid skews toward emotional and ideological (revolution still failed, shard cracked) rather than materially crushing, which slightly softens the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring light versus the personal cost of collateral and perpetual mending—is clear from early on and sharpened by the rule that light will only stay if people listen. Escalation arrives in the covenant’s demand for price, the protagonist’s confession, and the final choice to surrender his shadow and accept open-ended duty. The trade is morally textured (tethering to listening rather than ownership) and the cost persists beyond the page, visible in his “lighter by a shade” body. Conflict resolution leans slightly gentle—negotiation never truly threatens to fail—but remains solidly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether she can face grief and uncertainty without forcing explanation—is signaled early and coherently deepened through the psychometry visions and familial reveal. Pressure tightens meaningfully when the compass shows the earlier expedition and she realizes the widow is her mother and the dead man her father; that reweights every subsequent choice. The external danger (lagoon, dark, past death) mostly serves as a frame for the internal conflict rather than an active threat, so escalation is more emotional than situational. The quiet resolution—keeping the scarf, marking the ledge, and walking home “lighter”—is earned but could bear one slightly sharper on-page cost or foreclosed option to hit the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—how to move through storms and uncertainty without conventional markers—emerges clearly and deepens as she commits to building a gate instead of simply sheltering or passing by. Escalation is mostly internal and textural: the storm’s threat, the intensifying magic of the slide, and the increasingly specific collaboration with ancestral/future figures. Agency is present in each turn (lighting the lantern, accepting the figures’ guidance, constructing the gate, stepping through, vowing), but resistance and risk feel low; the storm’s danger doesn’t truly pinch or force a trade-off. As a result, stakes are conceptually rich but only moderately tense.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is an interior one—whether she can meaningfully answer why flowers bloom at night and translate that into her art. Pressure deepens once (the hinge moment in the loft where scent, glass, and hush align to spark the mural) and again at the pavilion when her grandmother’s prophecy crystallizes that pursuit. However, escalation is mostly intellectual and aesthetic; there’s little tangible risk or foreclosed alternative path on the page. The story earns a resonant shift in understanding, but the conflict never quite feels fraught enough to generate a strong sense of price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—retrieving and fixing erased civic truth—is established early and escalates as the narrator moves from archival work to bodily/psychic risk at the lagoon and moral confrontation with buried officials. The retrocognitive trap and the scalding reverie heighten pressure, and the parley with the clerk introduces a concrete counterforce (complicity and shame) that must be negotiated. The resolution via affidavits and stenograph punches is earned and forecloses the option of quiet forgetting. Conflict is somewhat one-directional—the system never pushes back with much active resistance on the page—which keeps the stakes powerful but not maximally tense.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—reviving a wish-addicted ghost town through accountable labor—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates in a quiet, accumulative way: from Iria alone against apathy, to testing her ideas with the sailor, to publicly renouncing wishes and asking people to be “ready to be accountable again.” The main limitation is the near-absence of concrete resistance or loss; no one opposes her, and the scattered townsfolk accept her stance quickly, so the “price” of her principles isn’t strongly dramatized. Still, the crystallization of a new authority model (shared, witnessed labor) is a meaningful tightening of stance.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    The central conflict—whether to record a dangerous prophecy—is sharply framed and tightened by the specific consequences for both orchard and child. Escalation is credible: what begins as routine archival work becomes a personal warning from the narrator’s own future voice. The final choice to “trust unrecording” is a genuine trade-off between vocation and compassion, with visible cost to the narrator’s identity as a scribe. Because the pressure is almost entirely internal, a touch more external resistance or friction could amplify tension even further.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator can receive and return the vortex/seasons without “keeping” them—is clear and does tighten as the vortex expands and demands a name and a song. Escalation is mostly internal and conceptual, expressed through increasingly potent images (memory engine, stepping through seasons, city tipping toward spring). The narrator’s decisive agency (accepting Return, learning its method, then planting it) earns the resolution. The main limitation is that direct opposition or risk never feels sharply present, so pressure remains gentle rather than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central stake—whether and how to warn three towns and a ferry—is established early and tightened through the approaching corridor, institutional pressure, and the live possibility of panicking people unnecessarily. Escalation is primarily internal and textural rather than event-heavy, but the passage from model’s red lattice → waiting → bell vs siren is a clear narrowing of options with a genuine moral/professional trade-off. The cost (risk of under-warning, being judged indecisive) is present but somewhat cushioned by the storm conveniently “sidling away,” which softens the sting. Still, the crystallizing choice at zero hour is unambiguously protagonist-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—how to live with hurt and obsolescence by finding meaning in attention—emerges early and is tightened by the meteor burst and blackout. Those external pressures force him into specific responses (lighting the lantern, tracing arcs on dead glass, speaking names) that deepen his relationship to the station and ghosts. The cost is largely internal—accepting a “small life” and a path of waiting and watching rather than escape—and it’s felt but understated. Because the conflict remains so inward and contemplative, escalation reads more as deepening than as sharply narrowing options, holding this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether he will accept an ethically costly role as custodian of unspeakable loss—is clear and escalates when the queen-ghost arrives as the “other party” to the covenant. The wind delivering her, her question about whether the archive can “hold heat,” and his decision to fully open the box all mark a meaningful tightening. The price (accepting his complicity and ongoing duty, plus immediate physical pain) is felt rather than merely declared. Because the conflict is primarily interior and situational, the sense of narrowing options is strong but not quite brutal, keeping it just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—how to live faithfully in time once numbers have failed—is legible early and pursued consistently. Escalation is quiet but real: solitary puzzling gives way to risking public signals (garage sale posts), then to a shared ritual that redefines timekeeping for the community. The meaningful tightening occurs when the capsule awakens and the walked letter restores the childhood New Year pulse, forcing the narrator to choose between clinging to a job-as-metrics and embracing a communal, sensory calendar. Because the conflict is largely philosophical and low-friction, the felt price of that shift could be rendered with slightly more bite.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—what to do with a small but piercing loss—is established with the kite snapping and the boy’s stunned reaction. Pressure escalates appropriately for a quiet story: the hush is broken, the boy’s distress tilts the world into “loud asymmetry,” and the poet must choose how to respond. His ritual (writing, shared pen, raft) reorients the boy rather than fixing the kite, making the visible cost (kite truly gone) integral to the outcome. While there’s no sharp reversal, the deepening is clear and the emotional trade-off is well-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes—using limited time to remodel the sanctuary into a shared, respectful ecology before death—are clear and carried through. There is meaningful deepening as the caretaking broadens from personal work to community council, then to surviving a storm, and finally to the caretaker’s increasing fatigue and last ritual act. However, opposition is mostly soft: fishermen’s “suspicion” dissolves quickly, the storm costs only “a branch,” and the council agreements arrive without friction, so options never feel truly threatened. The cost (the caretaker’s life and dwindling strength) is real but rendered with such calm that tension remains more contemplative than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether return can be designed without falling into hollow ritual or nostalgia—is clear and steadily pressured as the narrator moves from skepticism into participation. Escalation comes via deeper stages of the ceremony (offering the amber, the basin reaction, the ascent to the window) culminating in a reconfigured stance. However, tension stays largely internal and conceptual; there’s little sense of what’s truly lost if they reject or accept the experiment. The result is elegant but emotionally low-intensity for elite-market conflict standards.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether a genuine living concord can replace conquest—remains clear, but the pressure on it is gentle and largely ritualistic. There is a credible deepening when he follows the birds’ revised map to the pit of bayonets, transforming literal weapons into a trellis and thus enacting a visible trade-off. However, there’s little sense that failure or alteration is possible tonight; no option is dramatically foreclosed beyond continued neglect. The result is thematically rich but low in felt jeopardy, which keeps tension from fully matching the ambition of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—reaching the sister and testing whether distance can be bridged—is clearly signaled and tightens as the narrator moves from memory to experiment to an on-foot journey to the relay under a setting sun. Escalation is accumulative rather than dramatic, but the race against dusk and the possibility of silence create real, if quiet, pressure. The resolution is earned through the narrator’s agency in using the leaf and cylinder rather than coincidence. The main limiter is that external risk is low; the emotional stakes are strong but the story never forces a hard trade-off beyond vulnerability and deferred reunion.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.0)
    The conflict is primarily internal—how to live with having caused a blackout to save lives, and how to navigate when “true north” itself is moving—but it’s clearly framed and pressured by the shifting stars. The key tightening comes when the constellations drift and the narrator realizes they cannot fix the world to a single point, forcing a choice between clinging to old methods and inventing a new axis. Stakes remain intimate (orientation, memory, moral self-concept) but feel real and cumulative. The escalation is subtle rather than dramatic, yet it coherently narrows options toward the earned stasis of their final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—resetting weather/sky without repeating the wardens’ harms—is clear and coherently tied to each move on the board. Pressure escalates as the protagonist uncovers ethically fraught secrets (feast-protecting drought, hoarded warmth) and must respond with counter-promises, culminating in the queen’s letter and the unpaid commitment to future mending. The conflict is primarily moral/philosophical rather than bodily or social, which suits the piece but leaves the sense of “what could go terribly wrong” a bit abstract. Still, the final acceptance of an open-ended obligation functions as a genuine narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—wresting the record of crisis from “spectacle” and official scripts to small, embodied kindnesses—is clear and consistently pressed. Pressure deepens through the sequence of words (water → stay → hear/here → thanks → hush) and the rumor of an incoming regency, which raises the cost of being an unsanctioned historian. The narrator’s choice to leave only chessboard and lantern and vanish is an earned stance crystallization with a real conceptual cost. Still, escalation is more tonal than oppositional; no specific threat or counterforce tightens options in a concrete way, so tension remains relatively low-key.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will confront the shame that silenced their mouth in order to reconfigure “home”—is present early and steadily tightened. Key escalations include the feather enumerating forgotten syllables, the vision triggered by the stone exposing the precise act of self-burial, and the seer’s reality-substitution physically upheaving the store as talents surface. The price of change is the painful recognition of complicity in their own erasure and the reorganization of inner architecture (moving the “shame-encyclopedias” aside). The tension is more spiritual/psychic than oppositional, and while it stays coherent, a slightly stronger sense of risk or potential refusal in the middle would sharpen the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—earning self-forgiveness by undoing harm without repeating old patterns—is clear and sharpened by the on-page choice between instant release and gradual, tutelary restoration. Pressure escalates as each tug on the threads risks wrongness, invoking memories of the burned kingdom and making the work feel ethically fraught. The hinge at “either I could release the village entirely… or I could let their time return in careful increments” is a genuine narrowing of options with a moral calculus. If anything, external stakes remain modestly understated, but the internal cost is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preventing a ritual that steals a single voice by transforming how forgiveness is priced—is established and sustained, with a clear tightening when the canyon itself names new terms and the question of the child’s payment arises. The artist’s decision to pay twice and surrender the gold of his mentor’s last morning is a credible, costly choice that resolves the conflict. However, the imminence of danger (the ritual as direct threat) remains somewhat abstract; the keepers arrive only after the new pattern is in place, so tension never reaches full knife-edge. Still, internal and external conflicts (guilt vs. communal risk) interweave effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—can he build a device that wrests truthful meaning from loss without being consumed—is clear and present early. Pressure escalates through the painstaking matching of pockmarks, repeated cistern plunges, and the micro-risk of installing Mira’s charm as the final, unplanned piece. The engine’s activation and its refusal to resurrect her but to “name the hour when she fell and did not land” mark a strong deepening of the conflict between desire and reality. The only constraint is that external jeopardy (the acid sea, structural failure) remains more atmospheric than actively narrowing tactical options in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the painter will keep the hidden promise to enter and paint the inside of the sea rather than continue making safe copies—is clear and present early. Pressure tightens at the oasis mirror-pool and peaks in the corridor, where the narrator must choose between over-claiming the space or adding only “a breath” of paint and then leaving. The internal conflict between fear, longing, and the temptation to stay inside the revelation is strong, though it remains a quiet, lyric tension rather than a sharply agonized crisis. The final choice to walk away from the corridor and not repair the mirror registers as a real, felt trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—guiding the freighter safely while proving the efficacy of quiet, intentional guidance—is present early and sharpened by the prior near-accident. Escalation comes through the decision to abandon conventional methods (horn, letters) for the risky, intangible beckoning by scent and hum. The external conflict resolves in the freighter’s safe, humbled passage and the internal/social one in the mentor’s partial conversion. The cost is more conceptual/emotional than visceral; minimal sense of genuine risk to self limits the ceiling slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—how the narrator lives with Mara’s loss—emerges early and tightens as they move from passively obeying midnight instructions to actively leaving the station and performing the compass ritual. Escalation is primarily internal but still clear: the beacon’s inland point forces a painful confrontation with the shared past; the censer-foot ritual concretizes the decision to reframe loss rather than seek return. The cost is evident in lines like “This compass…does not lead me to Mara; it leads me with her,” which foreclose a path of reunion fantasies. A single sharper moment of hesitation or risk on the journey could have intensified felt jeopardy, but tension remains credible for this lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stakes—protecting the contraband keeper and sustaining a non-destructive form of honesty—are clear early and tighten meaningfully when the inspectors arrive mid-storm. The protagonist’s inability to lie forces a nuanced tactic (truthful invitation plus physical occlusion of the eye) that directly faces the surveillance threat. The external resolution leans slightly on coincidence (the storm helping dissuade the patrol), which softens the sense of paid cost, but their choice to keep meeting under risk restores pressure. Internal and external conflicts braid well: the fear of “catastrophic empathy” is concretely tested by the first use of the eye.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—to decode and honor the stranger’s final gesture—remains legible throughout, and pressure deepens as the keeper moves from abstract belief (“the tide keeps its own ledger”) into a concrete test of that belief (fitting the flower, reading the notch, sending the signal). The key tightening is the recognition that the gesture mirrors the girl’s long-ago code, turning a simple puzzle into a two-way promise between living and dead. Stakes are quiet but real: his self-concept as witness is on the line, and his decision to treat the faint answering light as enough is a meaningful, not cost-free, stance. The escalation is more contemplative than dramatic, yet it coheres under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to remain in observation or step into active, risky choosing—is clearly signaled and tightened by the time pressure of the rising creek and the appearance of the seam. Escalation is mostly internal but well-marked: hesitation at the cavern, empirical testing of the seam, contemplation of retreat, then the commitment to step through overlapping reflections and cross via the living ant bridge. The refusal to leave the chip, making future access harder, foregrounds a real trade-off rather than a free upgrade. The conflict stays relatively quiet and interior, which keeps it just shy of maximal intensity but still fully functional at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether she remains a conventional sovereign or risks unmaking herself to confront the dreams—is signaled early and steadily tightened. The climb structures escalation, with the ember grotto, bleeding pool, and final stone double each raising the conceptual price of continuing. The key pressure point is the wanderer’s warning that waking the stone self will determine “who rules when you go back, and who you will not be able to forgive,” which reframes her quest from curiosity to a moral/political choice. The conflict stays mostly internal and quiet, but it does not feel static or cost-free.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—whether they can “capture the density of presence” for the friend’s vulnerable secret—is clear and thematically potent. Pressure escalates as the pocket sun moves inward, knots of tension are transferred into the curl, and they risk reconfiguring how they inhabit time together. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional (foreclosing a careless way of moving through moments), which suits the mode but keeps the conflict gentle. A slightly sharper sense of what might be lost if they failed would lift the stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether he can find a livable stance toward his own death and shattered chronology—is clear and deepens as nostalgia becomes pursuit and then a bargaining partner. Pressure mounts from seeing the grave to the aerial funeral, to the feral nostalgia guarding syllables, to the need to “make a paragraph behave.” The key tightening is the bargain and the alignment of dates, which forecloses resurrection fantasies and forces acceptance of continuity-as-trick. The conflict remains mostly internal and lyric, so the escalation is more conceptual than visceral, but still coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether fear around this birth can be steadied and made bearable—is clear early and deepens with the reveal of the previous baby’s breathing crisis. Pressure escalates texturally: fog → silent entry → admission of labor → confession of past terror → moment of handing over the repaired clepsydra and then the long implied wait. Agency is quiet but present in the narrator’s choices to guide touch, name the repair honestly, and frame “holding” as a verb learned from water, which reweights the father’s options for how to endure. The costs remain emotional and could be slightly more sharply dramatized, but they read as real.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—completing the rite within one held breath to reframe her scars—is signaled and maintained cleanly. Escalation comes through time and bodily cost: the lungs burning, heart knocking, and the need to finish all three runes before she can breathe. Internal conflict is mostly between fear/shame and the desire to face and name those memories, but this tension is more lyrical than sharply dramatized. The cost is clear but modest and largely interior, keeping this strong but not maximal in pressure for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stakes—securing Mara’s forgiveness and making reparations to the living via the orchard—are clear and intertwined. Escalation comes when Mara’s simple “Forgive” is followed by the peach drawing, shifting the demand from private absolution to public action and forcing the narrator to risk her career by outing the money trails. That turn narrows her options credibly, and the choice to call the foreman is a meaningful act rather than a symbolic gesture. Some of the external consequences feel implied rather than viscerally dramatized, slightly softening the sense of cost at peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—to confront and reconfigure cosmic illusions and the narrator’s role relative to history—is clear and oriented early. Pressure escalates in a textured way via the walk along the spiral, naming illusions, and interacting with the lectern, culminating in the realization about being a “hinge” and the revised margin note. However, conflict remains largely internal and contemplative; there is no moment where a concrete alternative path is nearly chosen and then foreclosed. As a result, the tension feels profound but low in jeopardy, keeping this just below the strongest band.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to treat Basin Three’s lag as an error to be corrected or as a meaningful “boundary event”—is legible and introduced early via the foreman’s doctrine of counting backwards. Pressure tightens as the anomaly resists easy correction, the narrator cuts themselves, and the beacon’s blink coincides with the basin’s hesitation, compelling a re-interpretation rather than a simple fix. Agency is clear in the key moment: choosing to frame and report the event as something to preserve, not erase, crystallizes the internal conflict between obedience and inquiry. What keeps this in the low 8s is that the stakes never move beyond the philosophical/occupational sphere into any felt external risk or irreversible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake is Mara’s attempt to reconceive security while testing whether she can “let go” in a live system, and this is signaled early and sustained. Pressure deepens rather than spikes: the feral cat and the ruptured steam seal are modest but meaningful tests of her philosophy, forcing her to choose hospitality and inquiry over reflexive shutdown. Internal and external conflicts braid cleanly (her grief stance and the farm’s alarm logic are the same problem), and the final stance forecloses the fantasy of total control. The escalation remains low-key; we never feel a real possibility of disaster, which keeps the stakes strong-but-quiet rather than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—how she will relate to risk, her father, and her teaching after the heart attack—is clear early and tightens through the Martingale corridor and lantern/theorem discovery. Internal conflict between inherited ruinous gambling and her love of probabilistic unknowns escalates to a concrete program for her seminar and a decision to bring this back to her father. The pressure is mostly quiet and internal, but there is a real foreclosure of the fantasy that she can simply be “safe” or purely rebellious. The escalation is more contemplative than sharp, which is apt but keeps tension from hitting the absolute top band.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stakes—Mara’s ethical/relational experiment and the child’s immediate danger—are clear and braid effectively at the emergency moment when she must decide how to respond. Escalation comes from the third-rail arc and emergency call, which force her to test her “estrangement” principles under real risk. The price is subtle but present in the small ruptures to Rojo and Flora’s rituals and Mara’s refusal to claim emotional contact with the child; still, the internal conflict could be slightly sharper to fully exploit the high-stakes beat.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—whether memory via “proximate causes” can recover or regenerate a broken covenant—is clear and deepens as they move from small details to the rupture and finally the tentative reunion. The main escalation is interior and textural rather than conflictual, with pressure rising through the layering of remembered minutiae and the woman’s embodied reactions. The late reappearance of the partner functions as a satisfying turn but sidesteps a fully agentive choice or trade-off, keeping the stakes from feeling as sharp as they might in a truly elite piece.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether loneliness can be practically “cured” via logistics of kindness—is clear, and pressure coheres around the rumored midnight train, the outage, and the ad-hoc relief work. Escalation is textural: the power failure is the key tightening, forcing the station to remember being “useful” and testing the union of reciprocity. The narrator’s late question and the favor-map they carry home crystallize a stance, but the conflict never quite bites; no choice feels genuinely costly in the moment. The piece succeeds on quiet situational pressure rather than acute dilemma, which keeps it a notch below top-band.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.3)
    The central stake—finding a stillpoint that will let the narrator relate differently to grief—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Pressure escalates texturally as the forest thickens, the musical trail sharpens, and the ring’s responses intensify, culminating in the sudden cold at the clearing and the choice to kneel and probe further. The cost is internal but legible: the stillpoint does not erase sorrow but forces the narrator to confront, map, and carry it, foreclosing the fantasy of escape. The conflict remains more meditative than sharply oppositional, which slightly softens felt jeopardy despite the strong arc.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central pressure—whether and how the narrator can “edit” their past mistake without merely cheating fate—tightens meaningfully once they decide to use the pen and Del actively joins the effort. The scene of drawing terraces under shifting gravity is the key escalation, blending internal shame with an external, risky experiment that could mis-shape the “field.” However, explicit costs of failure (what might go wrong with history, or with the narrator) are kept somewhat soft and thematic rather than sharply dramatized. The resolution is thus powerful but more contemplative than knife-edged in terms of felt jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Arin can create a music of silence that holds them when people do not—is clear and comes under focused test when they must “disrupt the obedient quiet” by ringing the bell. Escalation is internal and tonal: asking permission from the bell, sacrificing the map to the tide, and committing to carry the empty camera into the noisy city. The cost is accepting ongoing erasure and the impossibility of conventional proof (“camera stayed empty”), which the ending makes felt. Still, the conflict never quite bites as sharply as it could; the piece chooses a very soft-tension mode.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central pressure—whether her past destruction and present choices can truly safeguard memory and people—accumulates as she follows Miren’s trail and realizes the fire was an incomplete act. Escalation is primarily internal and conceptual, but there is a clear tightening from exploration to a consequential act (planting the punctuation seeds and accepting the city’s vow). Her final decision to rebuild a different kind of library is an earned stance crystallization with implied costs. The absence of an active opposing force or on-page risk keeps the conflict from feeling fully urgent, though it remains thematically potent.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake (reaching and reviving Mira within a hostile treatment regime) is clear and tight, with stakes escalating from illicit listening to a risky crossing to negotiating the intrusion of foreign memories. The decisive tightening occurs when the treatment “bares its teeth” and donors intrude, forcing the narrator to accept a concrete cost (“I would carry what did not belong”) to achieve the goal. Internal and external conflicts interweave well: institutional control, metaphysical risk, and emotional need converge on the lagoon bridge and crack. The main limitation is that institutional opposition never actively adapts or bears down in-scene; security arrives only after the key conflict has resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes—find the missing courier before he’s hurt and prove the superiority of whispers over shouts—are clear and coherent, and the storm disabling normal systems usefully heightens pressure. The challenge to Rade frames the conflict well, and the jammed gate is a satisfying, concrete late complication. However, Ivo encounters no serious setbacks and adapts with near-effortless mastery, so escalation feels more like a graceful demonstration of competence than a narrowing of options with visible price. The courier’s danger and any potential consequences for failure stay abstract, blunting tension.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator can re-engage with a site of trauma and take up a non-destructive relationship with darkness and grief—is clear and tightens as the guardian’s practices are revealed. Pressure rises as the mirror’s use moves from demonstration to the brother-focused shimmer and then to the narrator’s own wrists and palms. The conflict is largely internal but coheres: the brother’s earlier “refusal” of life is counterpointed by the narrator’s present refusal of the canal’s old pull. The resolution—accepting the mirror and leaving with the guardian—feels like an earned endurance/renunciation rather than a soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether a town can be gently re-trained to inhabit hesitation—is clear early and deepens through the shift from private coaching to public ritual. Escalation is textural rather than adversarial, peaking with the town-wide window questions and the deliberate mass stalemate. The cost is subtle but legible: accepting unresolved moves as a kind of earned stasis. The near-absence of friction or credible risk (no one resists, nothing threatens to fail) slightly limits the felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—whether the narrator will name themself truly so the island holds—is clear and escalates through the fog lifting, the island thinning, the crowd gathering, and the act of detaching the moorings. Internal and external conflicts interlock well: self-revelation vs. communal gaze vs. the island’s conditional existence. The decisive act (public self-naming and crossing) is earned by prior beats with the scrimshaw and whale song. Still, resistance from the world is gentle and the risk of loss is mostly implied, so the pressure never quite tightens to an unmistakable “no going back” edge.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—how to live with honest grief under a coercive happiness regime—is signaled early and tightened through specific pressures: inspectors, fines, mandated broadcasts, and the economic need for tokens. Escalation is quiet but real: the surprise inspection demands high-stakes performance, and later the narrator’s deliberate choice to cut the microphones and then to utter a subversive “true line” on camera advances the conflict. Internal and external stakes interlock convincingly, with the ethical quandary around the children adding a sharp edge. The cost remains more implied than directly repercussive on the page, which slightly softens the sense of acute risk.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.6)
    The central stake—whether this formerly banned collective expression can be embodied without collapsing back into fear—is clear and steadily tightened. Escalation is subtle but definite: from listening for permission, to shared breathing, to crossing the inlaid line, to the guard’s renunciation, to stepping onto the lake’s ice. Agency is centered in the poet’s invitations and the group’s incremental risks, with visible emotional cost in leaving the safety of the old law and roles. While the conflict remains primarily internal/ritualistic, it never feels static.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stakes are quiet but real: will Ivo’s awakening repair his failing sense of color, and what will he lose in barter and identity if it does not? Pressure deepens as he moves from desire (coming to the market) to risk (offering his best brush and unique jar of smoke) to outcome (the reed’s partial answer and his choice to stay). There’s a clear tightening around the moment he plays the reed and discovers a different, less expected sense has awakened. The conflict is more contemplative than adversarial, but it coherently escalates under that lyric, accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether sound can create an honest, reparative “pilgrimage” of connection after collective outage—remains present and is modestly tightened when the grieving volunteer intervenes. That moment, where the ferry bell refracts his brother’s death into an unexpected sandbar, is the clearest escalation of emotional pressure and illustrates sound nudging grief toward a “different tide.” However, conflict largely stays internal and situational rather than confrontational; nothing decisively forecloses options beyond the narrator’s ongoing commitment to this gentle methodology. The stakes are sincere but kept in a contemplative register, limiting peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether she can transform her collapsed craft and grief into a sustainable, honest practice—emerges early and tightens as she moves from solitary experiment to guiding others’ rituals. Escalation is quiet but clear: the pattern of uncertain attendance, then the high-pressure encounter with the mother and dead child’s tattoos, raises the emotional stakes of her chosen role. Her agency—creating the origami invitations, offering wire-tracing rituals instead of “cures,” staying in the observatory—is what resolves the pressure into an earned stasis. The only limit is that the conflict remains entirely internal/relational, never confronting her with a true temptation to abandon the work once it begins.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are largely conceptual—how to live and help others in a post-crash city—rather than focused on a single sharpened dilemma, which flattens escalation. There are local pressures (the kid’s dangerous route, the historians’ lost mural, the woman’s scattered bandmates), but each resolves or crystallizes without visibly raising the overall cost or narrowing options for the protagonists. The dominant drive is learning and practicing a method, not confronting a moral or practical limit. As a result, tension is steady and interesting but never truly biting.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—how to engage “forbidden knowledge” without corrupting self or city—is signaled early and tightened as the archive tests the narrator (tempting mirrors, tablets offering to purify, the compass pointing to a mistake, the dangerous names). Escalation is more ethical and conceptual than physical, but it coheres: each level demands a clearer stance, culminating in the litany of names and the decision not to publish. The cost is internal and reputational rather than dramatic, yet it’s felt in the trade-off between career reward and moral responsibility. A slightly stronger sense of external jeopardy could sharpen tension, but pressure still meaningfully deepens.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.3)
    The core stake—whether Ilen can be reunited with his shadow without unbalancing the library—is clear and steadily sharpened. Escalation is gentle but definite: from the mere fact of separation to evidence of long-term strain (decades of footage), through the partial fix with the stone, into the crisis where the library refuses to release the reels. Mira’s bargain, paying with her own dreams, is a real narrowing of options that forecloses a path for her. The conflict remains mostly externalized in mythic terms; a bit more visceral sense of risk or fear in Mira, as the vines tighten and she chooses to pay, would intensify stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stakes—saving the chameleon and deciding how to respond to institutional betrayal—are clear early and remain coherent: will she let her convictions die with the con, or risk further exposure to rebuild honestly. There is a meaningful tightening when she chooses decisive, painful actions: amputating the tail, stripping away visitor-pleasing ornaments, and composing a letter that explicitly names those who profited and refuses to beg for forgiveness. Internal and external conflicts interweave well, especially in how financial ruin tests her ethics. Escalation is more deepening than sharply turning, which fits the lyric mode but leaves a slight sense of plateau rather than knife-edge at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—what to do with the misplaced miracle and the pain of “opening wounds” in others—appears early and coherently intensifies toward the tunnel decision. The key tightening is the choice to leave the tower’s safety, descend into the site of trauma, and perform an irreversible act (breaking the hourglass and burying its sand in Mira’s fossilized coffee ring). Internal and external conflicts interweave well, with the plants’ voices and human grief in tension. The conflict remains mostly one sustained slope rather than multiple distinct reversals, which keeps it powerful but a bit low in dynamic variety.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake is conceptual/emotional—locating unused love and making sense of its cost—and it’s signaled early and tightened as she moves from anonymous letters to her own shelves. Escalation is subtle but real: the pressure rises when the warehouse resolves into motive-labeled aisles and then narrows sharply at the row bearing her name and the key to an aged-into-shyness conversation. Her final agency is quiet (listening, then writing and reclassifying “goodbye”), but it clearly reweights options around leaving vs. staying. Stakes remain mostly internal and reflective, so the tension is more meditative than gripping, which keeps this just below top band.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity to relieve both the artists and the narrator—is clear and threads through the piece, with stakes becoming concrete via the sculptor’s “marble lungs” and the city’s dimming. Escalation is primarily textural: repeated circuits, heavier instrument vs. feathered when listening, culminating in the seventh circuit and the door opening. The visible payoff with the sculptor and the widening windows gives one satisfying tightening, but failures and costs (“stars scratch wrong,” “sometimes I fail”) stay more gestural than dramatized in specific turning points. The pressure could be sharpened by one more moment where success genuinely feels in doubt or a real loss is incurred.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.4)
    Within an accumulative/lyric lens, pressure coheres around a stake: keeping the archive from erasure and coaxing it into stable, generative form. Escalation is subtle but real: from a humming, evasive archive “occasionally everywhere” to a negotiated “game” and finally to tangible spores that alter the train’s nature. The guard’s agency—choosing the shortest bottled night, not looking too soon, distributing spores—drives each intensification and forecloses alternative paths (e.g., letting the archive remain arithmetic, letting the train decay). Stakes stay somewhat abstract and cosmic rather than viscerally personal, but the match “against erasure” keeps tension present across the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central pressure is the hum’s shift “from counsel to ache,” which credibly compels him to act rather than continue to drift; that escalation is clear and well-motivated. The main tightening comes at the clock-tree when he must choose between preserving ruin and risking repair, a choice that alters his knowledge and stance. Subsequent descent to the shelter extends rather than intensifies tension, turning more reflective once the key decision is made. Stakes remain largely internal and intellectual, with limited sense of real peril or sacrifice beyond conceptual risk.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.4)
    The primary conflict—whether the narrator will finally claim her unused courage—tightens steadily through the ferry offer, the ridge vigil, and the instruction to walk bends that resemble old fear. Her initial reluctance (“I do not reach, not yet”) adds a real micro-stall that makes the eventual reach meaningful. The cost is implicit rather than dramatized in concrete consequences, but the refusal of past leashes and the commitment to “row by choosing” register as a foreclosing of old avoidance. A slightly sharper external pressure could have heightened escalation further.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether and how to live under “absolute safety” that confiscates music—is clear early and tightens as the narrator submits to training and learns to read pain and radiator codes. Escalation is quiet but present: from orientation and acquiescence to a more active interpretive agency when the radiators’ Morse becomes legible and the choice to remain is consciously taken. The cost is conceptual and bodily (enduring taxed silence, nerve pain, and the risk of soft resistance rather than open defiance), which fits the mode. Conflict stays largely interior and atmospheric; a single sharper scene of enforcement or near-transgression might have made the stakes more viscerally immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.9)
    The central stake—unmasking a pretender and forcing a reckoning with stolen legitimacy—is clear and steadily tightened as Serane moves through the curated books and the rune compresses time/context around her. Escalation is quiet but real: from subtle implications to the restored comma to the ink literally rewriting her name on her skin. The decisive act—her voluntary withdrawal of her claim—flows credibly from the mounting textual and magical evidence. The one limitation is that resistance feels brief; her laugh and swift capitulation keep the conflict from peaking as sharply as it could at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—reconciling deadly disappearing paths with shifting coastal geometry—is established and carried through, and there is a clear deepening when the narrator discovers the rhythmic encoding and reinterprets the atlas as schedule. Protagonist agency drives the key escalations: pressing Assemble, decoding the taps, and convening the villagers to walk the corridor. The cost is conceptual and communal rather than visceral: they must accept a road that cannot be fixed, only followed in time. Tension runs more as intellectual and atmospheric pressure than as acute danger in the climactic beats, which keeps it a shade under the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes—locating the Lark / father and reorienting the rebellion—are clear and grow as she chooses to engage increasingly deeply with the bay’s dormant system. The main tightening is her decision to “risk waking whoever had silenced” the circuits, moving from private divination to a publicly consequential broadcast. However, that potential danger remains abstract; we never feel a concrete consequence or counterforce testing her choice on the page. The escalation is thus persuasive but somewhat muted, leaning on implied rather than dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether tradition will be fixed, imposed, or consciously evolved—is clear early and coherently pressed by the council’s insistence on waiting versus Lida’s urgency. Escalation is primarily ethical and situational rather than peril-based; the council’s refusal forces Lida into open transgression, which is a meaningful tightening of options. The main limitation is that opposition poses little active resistance once she decides to act; there’s no serious on-page attempt to stop her, so tension peaks more as moral risk than concrete jeopardy. Still, her act notably forecloses the path of passive preservation and commits the community to a new, costed route.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—whether Rafi can live with trauma while making genuinely hopeful, durable care—is clear and tightened by the helicopter-triggered freeze and the gull rescue, where he must use his tools under duress. The later conversation with the niece about the photograph and his work extends that pressure into a conscious stance: “optimism meant doors, not denial.” Escalation is internal rather than plot-driven, but the beats build persuasively from avoidance to engaged, costly openness. If anything, the conflict remains very gentle; no options are violently foreclosed, though the emotional cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she can reorient her dimmed inner “eye” by restoring the literal light—is clear and tight, with the secondary stake of the lighthouse’s survival under storm. Pressure escalates as the storm thickens, the tower “anticipate[s] collapse,” and she discovers the failed wick, forcing her to improvise using the threads/cards rather than retreat. Her agency drives the turn: choosing to descend, to interpret the keeper’s redesign as a message, and to repurpose the threaded system into a new wick. The conflict remains primarily internal and atmospheric, so the danger never feels life-threatening, but the emotional stakes land.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will perpetuate or dismantle the commodification of crisis-time—is clear and tightens as they move from observation to entering the hut to confronting the metronome’s “offer.” The escalation from reading patterns to physically entering the chamber of fear and facing a seductive throne of pauses works well, with the refusal functioning as a decisive choice. The cost is present but somewhat conceptual (forgoing global power and embracing partial self-erasure) rather than viscerally dramatized. Even so, tension between their skill, history with the mentor, and refusal gives the conflict satisfying weight at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether to risk using the letter to subvert a surveillance-obsessed city—is clear, and pressure coherently tightens from curiosity to ritualized hesitation to a timed, irreversible act. Internal and external stakes are braided well: the desire to provoke an “unspoken conversation” conflicts with the demands of silent preservation. The midnight reset and use of dormant conduits provide a clear escalation and narrowing of options. Stakes do remain somewhat conceptual; we feel the risk and potential upheaval, but no specific, tangible loss or reprisals arrive on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake is whether blame will calcify into vengeance or be rechanneled into continuity, signaled early via the tower’s fall and the father’s ambiguous act. Pressure coherently rises with the trio’s arrival naming “the tower, the dead, and the debts,” then focuses through the rose ritual where debt/mercy are explicitly paired. The central “turn” is subtle but effective: the potential for confrontation is reconfigured into collaborative naming and planting, at the cost of leaving blame unresolved and the father absent. The conflict is more ethical/emotional than perilous, so the escalation is felt but intentionally low-flash.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—restoring a coastline devoured by silence via the goddess’s echo—is signaled and developed, with a clear tightening when she demands her name back from the sleepwalking constellations. Entering the aisles, facing the three constellations as “elders,” and planting the spike in the dune all escalate the ritual rather than meandering. However, the pressure remains largely conceptual and meditative; there’s no strong sense of what failure would feel like beyond continued abstraction. The final choice to “let the map spill back into the tide” is meaningful but more serene than costly, which keeps tension in the strong-but-not-searing band.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central stake—whether the device truly nudges headlines and what to do if it does—is clear early and sharpened by the heiress’s wager to shutter the lens. Escalation is well-managed: the quiet suspense of waiting, the caretaker’s near-victory smile, then the emergency light and systemic stalling create a satisfying turn. Agency is strong: her logical gambit and later funding ultimatum both foreclose paths and accept responsibility. The main softness is that resistance from the board and the institutional cost are resolved briskly, muting some potential pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether and how she can answer the old guilt by listening and staying—is established early and tightened through the arrival of the letters, the awakened recorder, and the sleepless mother with the “untethered” baby. The key external pressure (the baby’s relentless cry) dovetails with her internal conflict about past refusal, and her choice to tattoo the glyph on herself is a credible, costly escalation. Tension is primarily existential and emotional rather than suspense-driven, but it deepens consistently under the accumulative lens. A slightly sharper on-page glimpse of what “leaving that room” concretely cost might have raised the felt stakes even more.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—finding meaning in mess without false smoothing—is clear, and the main tightening occurs when the bearded man belittles his doubt and the narrator decides to interject. That choice shifts the circle from surface banter to real pain (the daughter he cannot comfort), which then enables the tile’s use and the hush’s personification. However, conflict remains relatively gentle; opposition never seriously threatens failure, and the group moves toward insight with little friction once the key turn occurs. The cost of “staying messy” is implied more than dramatized, which keeps tension from fully spiking.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—whether to convert justified anger into punitive naming or into restorative labor—is clearly established and deepens when the boy reveals the men “who fed the fire.” Pressure coheres around the impending “trial” as the plaza becomes a tribunal, and the narrator’s choice to resist “the easy echo” is a credible tightening. The escalation is mostly ethical and imagistic rather than confrontational; the men’s compliance and the crowd’s potential for violence are underplayed, slightly softening the felt cost. Still, the renaming of the four men into burdensome roles (Bearer, Tanner, Chisel, Watch) is an earned resolution that forecloses simpler vengeance.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—tending a fractured timeline and helping the ghost seek encore without collapsing into despair—is clear and coherently maintained. Escalation arrives when the fracture becomes visible (“a crack across the air where another night falls through like confetti”) and the chorus bleeds through, prompting the ghost’s panic and request to “anchor the Star.” The narrator’s response with the coin and marquee letters is a real tightening choice that re-stabilizes the situation and slightly advances their shared project of letting go. However, the conflict stays emotionally low-intensity and nearly always under control; we rarely feel that failure is a live, dangerous option in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether they can approach painful memories without being overwhelmed—is clear and signaled early. There is one meaningful tightening when misread somatic signals and the static shock briefly threaten their fragile method, and a later deepening when Mara confronts the brother’s last words without flinching. However, escalation remains low-grade; their process succeeds with relatively little resistance or risk of genuine failure, and no hard trade-off is forced. The result is emotionally affecting but not maximally pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—earning and honoring a nonhuman contract—remains clear, with the external pressure of the storm and tide giving that abstract stake a concrete test. Escalation arrives when the emotional “spikes” in the chamber meet the sudden storm surge, forcing her to physically protect herself and decide how to reposition the fossil. Her agency in choosing to re-house the fossil and mark it as resident crystallizes her stance and forecloses a path (keeping the token as a personal object). Still, tension is mostly contemplative, so the sense of risk never quite feels as sharp as the language allows.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether prophecy remains a closed script or becomes collective, living possibility—is clear and carries through to the ending. There is credible deepening when the narrator chooses not only to open the echo-jar but to invite the village and keep the warehouse open, foreclosing the old custodial secrecy. However, pressure is relatively low-key: resistance from elders and the potential cost of breaking taboos are stated but never bite in a concrete, oppositional scene, so escalation feels more like graceful unfolding than a test that truly narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Ansel can reclaim a place in the network and in himself without betraying core loyalties—is signaled early and tightened by Len’s conditional offer to “vouchsafe one truth” if Ansel proves steady. Pressure escalates as the pillbox is opened and the ring appears, shifting the scene from technical exchange to moral-emotional choice and forcing a trade: microfilm to the sea, ring and renewed trust kept. Internal and external conflicts (duty to headquarters vs. underground loyalties, self-protective exile vs. re-engagement) align well, but the sense of external danger (patrols, consequences of losing the microfilm) stays relatively low-key. The conflict lands more as a quiet but meaningful deepening than a sharp crucible, which fits the piece but slightly mutes tension.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether they can transform a map of risks and inherited fear into a navigable, braided path—is clear and threads the whole scene. Escalation is subtle but present: the ferry’s midpoint struggle and his memory of hauling “sorrows like lumber” provide the one real tightening, with Wren’s touch and their collaborative stitching as the answer. The cost is primarily internal (accepting that fear and burden remain but can be reconfigured), which fits the lyric mode but keeps tension relatively low-key. A slightly sharper external consequence or narrower option set at the midpoint would heighten the felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are primarily conceptual and emotional—can she meet a place’s resistance to change with adequate gentleness, and will the oasis stay dead or respond? Pressure coheres and subtly tightens as she moves from observation to expenditure: using her last water, cleaning the frames, singing until the thrum responds, and finally crafting and placing cups in each timeline. The main turn is her realization that the place is “phototropic to kindness,” which reconfigures her tactics and anchors the final choice to leave the cups and carry the practice onward. The tension is intentionally soft; what keeps this out of the very top band is that risk never feels truly precarious, more meditative than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake is whether the narrator can and will rekindle a darkened lighthouse as an act of care for the living and a response to parental loss. Pressure escalates coherently from the promise at the rosebush to the cold stone and corroded lock, to the fragile match and brittle wick, culminating in the risk that the light might not take. The main cost is emotional and ongoing—choosing to keep tending light despite grief—rather than a sharp on-page sacrifice, and there’s little external resistance beyond environment. That gentleness of opposition keeps the conflict from feeling fully knife-edged, even as it remains satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—maintaining a livable equilibrium between solitude and the demands of the extinct voices/library—is clear and tightens when the stone circle “coughs” and shelves drop. The narrator’s agency in angling the sundial, opening the atlas, and choosing the herd song drives the escalation and resolution. The price is subtle but present: they reaccept the role of listener-custodian, trading simple isolation for a charged, responsible independence. Because the conflict is largely metaphysical, tension feels more atmospheric than visceral, but the central tightening beat is effective.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes—whether the lovers will find a way back to each other and whether the narrator can “find the thread that connects all things”—are clear and intertwined. Pressure does tighten through the staged convergence at the bowl and the public reading of the private letters, which is a meaningful escalation of risk. However, the sense of possible failure remains muted; the piece reads as confident that the ritual will work, so suspense is more contemplative than fraught. The cost is largely emotional exposure rather than a hard trade-off or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the community’s emotional tempo will be externally orchestrated or self-owned—is clear and sharpened by the election backdrop and the dean’s pressure for “neutrality.” Escalation is steady: from eerie pattern recognition to realizing campus groups are being synchronized, to direct psychic contact with the trickster wave and its bribes, culminating in her risky subsonic “countersigns.” The price is subtle but legible: she forgoes easy power and prestige, accepts slower, messier discourse, and commits to an ongoing, unglamorous custodial role. The only limit is that physical or social peril never feels acute; tension remains primarily conceptual/ethical rather than viscerally dangerous.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—asserting negotiated order with a mutinous city to retrieve and use the forbidden key—is clear and tightened by the unstable alleys and the Council’s ban. Escalation proceeds through distinct beats: calling the city, imposing the triangle, diving into the silt, threading the key, then confronting the Observatory lock. Internal stakes (claustrophobia, loyalty to grandmother vs obedience to Council) interweave with external logistics, but resistance from the environment is relatively low once the ritual works, so cost and danger feel more atmospheric than acute. The final realization transforms understanding more than it closes off a concrete peril.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—what can still be done for Mara (and others) when a case is cold—remains clear, and pressure deepens as the narrator uncovers the ribbon, phone case, and perfume, each complicating the assumed story. However, the conflict is largely internal and contemplative, with no opposing force on the page and minimal risk beyond existential frustration. The key tightening is the realization that the blue ribbon contradicts the fox-mask legend and may imply a traded identity; that reorients the investigation but doesn’t significantly narrow options or force a painful choice. The ending resolves through stance (painting/letters) more than escalated tension.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stakes—liberating the exiles and reclaiming the ancestor’s intended refuge from a punitive system—are clear early and tighten well as the librarian moves from decoding to direct action and confrontation. The key escalation is the choice to insert the copper nail and thereby irreversibly alter the system, followed by the moral clash with the director. The cost is more conceptual and systemic (defying authority, destabilizing a regime) than personally painful on the page, and the director’s power feels blunted quickly. Nevertheless, tension builds coherently and resolves through the protagonist’s agency, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—can she countermand the ledger and bring him back—is readable early and deepens as she uncovers the shard and descends toward the bridge. Her decision to play “the measure that forgives” under the gaze of a “listening” system is the clear tightening, with the cost sitting in the implied danger of invoking that ledger and potentially taking on debt. Internal and external conflicts align well, though the threat of the system remains more conceptual than viscerally pressing. Slightly clearer articulation of what she might lose would sharpen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stakes—holding onto the train-as-memory versus yielding it to investors, and believing in mappable escape versus recurring circles—are legible and deepen over time. Pressure escalates via investor demands and rapid growth into a fall, culminating in shutdown and the narrator’s solitary walk. The conflict remains more conceptual and atmospheric than acutely dramatized, with little on-page confrontation or hard choice besides the quiet decision to close and stay. Still, the final reconfiguration of “paths” and “signs” feels like a clear tightening and cost under an accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether decoding the temple will remain a solitary, purely technical endeavor or become a shared, vulnerable practice—is clear and does tighten once Mara arrives. The main pressure point is the decision to open the telegram and then to invite Mara’s live response into the reading, which forecloses the safer path of solitary, clinical decoding. Escalation is subtle and almost entirely internal; there’s little external resistance or real risk beyond emotional exposure. For elite publication, a slightly sharper sense of jeopardy or cost in the central experiment would strengthen the pressure curve.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stakes—recovering the confession and whether truth can be isolated from lies—are clear early and paid off with the confession’s partial consumption and the mayor’s exposure. Pressure escalates via widening circles, the “cold thread,” and the tense passage of the seed through the hooks of frozen words, culminating in the public moment of reckoning. However, the retrieval itself feels almost frictionless once the method is engaged: the seed obeys, the lake cooperates, and there is little sense that failure or serious backlash is possible. The emotional and social cost lands, but the tactical risk and adaptation under duress could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether to submit to the eclipsed covenant or renegotiate the relationship between people, garden, and future—is legible early and tightens through the scar-link, the talking hedges, and the path that forces them toward the gardeners. The key escalation comes when they step onto the living maze and then refuse the gardeners’ demand for restoration, choosing a braided vow instead. Internal and external conflicts are well-braided, but the price of defiance and of binding themselves anew remains largely conceptual; we don’t see a concrete loss or harm beyond stepping into uncertainty. Tension is steady and texturally rich, but never quite knife-edge.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—reshaping a boy’s sold destiny and paying some personal price—is clear, and there is one meaningful deepening when the Weaver demands “a destiny that refuses you,” reframing the task. Agency is strong in the choice to give the boy her name, to risk using the card, and to sacrifice the grandmother’s stories. However, resistance from the world/Weaver/ritual is minimal; things unfold almost too smoothly, so tension doesn’t quite crest before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether he can maintain professional detachment or let memory and meaning into his work—is legible early and tightened through the encounter with the singed scrap. Escalation is primarily internal but effective: his “facts first” mantra frays as his embodied recognition of the object mounts, leading to the pressured choice to treat it as more than commodity. The cost is implicit but clear: he risks his fragile sense of competence and opens old grief by naming the memory-load on the form. The conflict remains quiet and could arguably bear a slightly sharper on-page hinge, but for this length it works.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.5)
    The main stake—reestablishing harmonic guidance so trunks don’t rub and spark—is clear, and the narrator’s haunted ambition provides an internal counter-pressure. Escalation is more deepening than tightening: the hum returning, night and lightning, and then the planting and split of the seed gradually increase charge. However, the process unfolds with relatively little resistance or genuine risk of failure; the rituals work as intended, keeping the conflict from feeling sharply tested. The cost lands more in conceptual reorientation than in on-page sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether identity can be held or remembered within a world of tidal erasure—is clear and localized in the woman’s need to “hold her shape.” Pressure escalates as the narrator must choose a method (metallurgy bells, creel-words, acceptance of contradictions) to resolve her multiple cards before the tide turns. However, the conflict remains largely conceptual and serene; risk and cost are beautifully implied but never bite sharply enough on the page to feel fully consequential. The resolution feels earned but more like a graceful deepening than a hard-forced trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—validate isolation vs inaugurate communion—is clear early and tightens when the directive appears “during the heartbeat of a hesitation.” The decisive turn is the choice to crown the spire instead of simply stamping the bunker, and that act visibly forecloses one professional path. The pressure is mostly internal and ethical, so the cost skews conceptual (regulations vs vow) rather than viscerally felt, which keeps the stakes a shade abstract. Still, escalation under the accumulative lens is strong and the final stance crystallization is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can renegotiate her guilt and relationship to the river—is clearly signaled and escalates as she moves from symbolic spaces (station) to literal disaster sites (sluice, shallow). Each step narrows her options from observation to physical participation, culminating in stepping into the exact place her brother’s body drifted and surrendering her controlling “number.” Internal and external conflicts interweave well: professional failure, fraternal loss, and spiritual reconciliation all converge at the shallow. The only slight limit is that opposition remains purely internal and environmental, though it’s handled with enough tension not to feel static.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stake—whether she can find the library and earn the right to send the second letter—is clear and coherently pressured by the risk of “silence hardened.” Escalation comes via the threshold’s demand for patience, the deciphering of the watch, and the ultimate commitment to burn the first letter and accept an echo-based return. However, the conflict remains mostly contemplative; there’s little sense that failure would concretely alter her world beyond remaining inarticulate, which slightly softens the felt cost. The tension is real but more spiritual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—whether to hand the violin to the empire or let it melt in live performance—is signaled early and sharpened by the noon deadline and the heat pressing on the dome. Pressure escalates cleanly as dream, promise, plant warnings, and coffee augury converge, narrowing his options until playing necessarily destroys the object. Internal and external conflicts interlock: his desire for security and institutional approval versus his belief in living propagation, framed as ethical calculus rather than abstract rebellion. The only minor limitation is that the museum’s threat remains offstage and atmospheric, not personally embodied, which slightly softens direct opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving one intentional echo from her mentor before oblivion, within ethical limits—is established early and coheres throughout. Escalation comes via the chip’s activation, the first brush-tap sound in the static, then the brief, fragile line of actual speech that might fail to arrive. Pressure is mostly internal and atmospheric rather than sharply conflictual; there is no real chance she will abandon the attempt, only that it may not yield anything. The cost is clear at the end—accepting that this is only a shimmer, not resurrection—but the tension seldom bites as hard as it could.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether and how she can locate a “source of contentment” without clutching—is signaled early and tightened by the need to use or surrender the hairpin. The key turn is her choice to insert the pin into the wall and then to assume the caretaker role, culminating in accepting the loss of the object as the price of a new belonging. Pressure is mostly internal and textural, so moment-to-moment tension is gentle rather than gripping, but it does deepen toward the realization that contentment lies in cyclical tending. The story could bear one more concrete moment of resistance or doubt to sharpen the sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether to confess morally tainted but life-saving bribes before an election—is sharply drawn and present early. Pressure coheres and deepens as the chimes yield three conflicting imperatives, with the unexpected third option meaningfully narrowing and complicating the field. The ultimate stance (confess, return money, name names, change tax policy) clearly forecloses easier paths of silence or self-exonerating martyrdom. The only thing keeping this just below the very top is that Lark’s resistance to the chosen path is implied more than dramatized, slightly softening moment-to-moment tension.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the narrator will relinquish their insistence on being persistently seen/known—is clear early and steadily deepens. Pressure escalates via knowledge withholding (questions about the hum, the researcher’s condition), the trance’s unsettling imagery, and the ethical dilemma in the village vision where the narrator’s persistence is a “dam.” The decisive internal turn—agreeing to “release, to step aside, to be gone without leaving”—is earned by prior beats and carries a conceptual cost. Tension is more meditative than sharp, so while effective for this mode, it doesn’t quite reach a feeling of inexorable squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—can the narrator learn to navigate without moving by finding the wandering pulse—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates texturally as the hum wakes the canyon, the birds’ patterns intensify, and the pulse “chooses a path through me,” culminating in the decisive act of casting away the arrowhead and embracing stillness as travel. Agency is strong but quiet: they renounce their usual tools and accept a new, less tangible, more vulnerable way of moving. Stakes remain largely internal and metaphysical, so while the arc is coherent and satisfying, the sense of risk never quite bites as hard as it might.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—preserving non-commodified imagination and finding a viable role within an automated culture—is clear and coherently pressured. Escalation is mostly internal and textural: the climb and risky experiment with the keystone tighten into the later decision to take the light’s hush back to the city and to refuse ownership. The cost is conceptual rather than dramatic (accepting endless apprenticeship and service instead of mastery or profit), which fits the mode but keeps the tension relatively low-key. Still, the decisive renunciation and changed practice provide a solid, earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—will the narrator manage to genuinely discover and keep a color of sound, rather than borrow it—is clear and is tightened by the revelation that silver must be earned through patient listening, not simply taken. Pressure escalates quietly as the hum gains shade, the vows’ purpose shifts from luck-charm to ear-training, and the lamplighter must choose to leave a binding vow of their own. The “price” is a lifelong discipline of attention and service, convincingly tied to their role and to the library’s ethic. Still, the conflict remains largely internal and meditative; there are no sharp tests of resolve or competing external demands, which keeps tension in a high, but not maximal, band.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether meaning/purpose can be drawn from cosmic noise and chance—emerges early and is pressed by doubt versus ritual action. Escalation is textural rather than plot-twisty: each step of fulfilling the backwards prophecy (blind toss, turning the dome, distilling noise) tightens the commitment to this method of decision-making. The key internal conflict (faith vs. brittle faith; control vs. surrender) culminates in the narrator embracing their role and its paradoxical certainty, which reads as an earned stance. The lack of more concrete external jeopardy keeps the stakes somewhat rarefied but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether he can give a shape and name to Miren’s nameless fear (and by extension to others)—is clear and is subtly but definitely tightened. Pressure escalates from generalized naming to confronting the personal failure with Miren, forcing him to risk re-opening that wound to stabilize Shoreless. The resolution is his deliberate act of focus and naming, which forecloses the option of remaining a passive archivist of loss. Stakes remain intimate and conceptual rather than visceral, which keeps the tension refined rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Efan can meaningfully counter the cosmic/tidal imbalance and thus the famine—is clear early and maintained. Escalation is subtle but real: the time constraint before the sun clears the chimneys, the gathering pattern in the numbers, and the fisherman’s hunger all tighten the pressure. The main turn is his shift from passive observation to active reconfiguration (threads, reed metronome, constellation names), which leads directly to partial restoration. What holds this just below the very top tier is the relative gentleness of on-page cost; the conflict never bites quite as hard as the premise allows.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the town’s memory will be quietly “expunged” or actively held—is signaled early and tightened by the bureau’s directive and the resurfaced hazards. The photographs operate as escalating pressure, pulling him into the avoided intersection and then to the upstream grove, forcing a stance on his role. His decision to summon former residents instead of complying passively is a clear turn that forecloses the option of purely neutral enforcement. The cost (potential institutional backlash, emotional exposure) is implied more than dramatized, which keeps stakes strong but just short of searing.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Iri will resolve her logic/intuition split before the “final transformation”—is clear but stays mostly internal and contemplative. Escalation comes through tightening symbolic and temporal pressure (the “hour had ripened,” the theorem’s last clause, the waterfall’s six moods, the frozen starlings) rather than overt jeopardy. Her key choice is to forgo using her formulas, keeping flame small and crystal cold, which forecloses the hyper-rational path. The tension is gentle, so while it works for a lyric piece, the pressure never bites quite as hard as elite competition might demand.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stakes—physical survival and the restoration/preservation of trust—are clear early and consistently pressed. Pressure escalates from uneasy observation of the whirlpool clouds to altered approach, then to the blister of air that nearly upends the ship. The narrator’s decisions (changing lantern color, revising the course, modulating the rope) drive the key turns rather than luck resolving them. Cost is primarily emotional and relational but feels concrete, especially in the remembered failure and the sense that the debt between them remains unpaid.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dual stakes—custody of the brain and the narrator’s battle with numbness—are signaled early and braid together by the end. Pressure deepens as training fuses Neri and Rae’s opposites and the narrator’s private communication with the jar reframes the test from ownership to “circuit,” culminating in the joint-custody choice that forecloses unilateral claims. Escalation is more a steady intensification of pattern and insight than a sharp reversal; conflict never quite bites as hard as it could on the page between the claimants. That softness of external friction keeps the stakes from feeling fully maximal despite the elegant resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will use the seed to create a meaningful but risky new experience instead of chasing spectacle—is clear. There is a modest deepening when she considers concrete pressures (landlord’s demand for louder profits, inspectors, investors) and answers with a design that deliberately limits revenue. Yet the conflict remains largely internal and anticipatory; no antagonist actually pushes back on the page, so escalation feels cerebral rather than pressured. The choice carries conceptual cost, but the story never forces her into a moment where an alternative must be abandoned under real, immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—can he coax laughter back into a grief-struck house—arrives early and narrows as he commits to the ritual, risks emotional exposure, and endures physical cost (reddened knuckles, solitary labor). Escalation is textural rather than plot-twisty: machines tune, air macerates sorrow, drafts reach the house, misfiring chuckles evolve into a foundational shift. His agency drives the deepening (pulling cords, adjusting tempo, catching and placing the squeal), and the price is his continued anonymity and the acceptance of “repaired silence” instead of triumphant catharsis. Stakes are felt, though they stay on a quiet, lyrical register.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the narrator can belong without certainty—is clear and present early. Pressure tightens meaningfully when the guardian asks “what I will give to stay” and again when she asks about the thaw, forcing the narrator to commit to waiting and to a future posture toward loss. Conflict is primarily internal and philosophical, but the pendant’s test and the offered tithe concretize it enough to avoid abstraction. Escalation is subtle and mostly textural rather than sharply reversing, which limits the sense of overt narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether he will truly sever himself from guild doctrine and accept the risks of creative destruction—is clear from early on and coherently escalated. Pressure intensifies in a quiet but tangible way: from tentative adjustments to the furnace, to feeding in the crozier’s splinters, to the apparition of the frond demanding a decision, to snapping the crozier and stepping through the gate. Internal and external conflicts are tightly braided; the external ritual keeps posing higher-commitment tests of his internal resolve. The tension is more contemplative than harrowing, so while the escalation is effective, it never becomes viscerally fraught enough for the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—giving endings a beginning that honors them without erasure—is clear and tightened by the deadline-like lunar perigee and the city’s initial refusal. Pressure escalates as more dead stations manifest and articulate their needs, culminating in the stylus/record transformation and the hidden stair/engineer’s note. Agency is present in discarding assumptions, tuning dishes, placing the star fragment, and using the hush shard on the mast’s wound. Still, the conflict remains mostly metaphysical; the piece gestures at danger (“keep the fall below you”) but never makes failure or cost viscerally felt on the body or in irrevocable loss.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the ferry (and the narrator) will remain endlessly vanishing or accept a configured permanence—is established and escalates via the increasing strangeness and specificity of the radio instructions and grotto passage. The broom-drawn patterns, helmsman’s compliance, and door selection all mark tightening beats tied to his agency. The cost is felt but somewhat abstract; there’s room to sharpen what he risks losing if the experiment fails. Still, the pressure coheres and meaningfully deepens by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether he can ethically “build” connection and repay his debt to trust—is coherent and gradually deepened as rooms test his methods. Pressure escalates from private experimentation (walls breathing) to involving another person (the visitor triangle) to a shared, ethically framed act (the bridge that holds only if they trust and persist). However, the cost of failure or success remains largely conceptual; anger and debt are named but not strongly dramatized in consequences or risk. The result is intellectually tense but emotionally muted compared to truly top-tier pieces.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—how to navigate and orient meaningfully in a starless, lamp-bright underwater world—is clear and deepens as alien concepts intersect with human practice. There is an escalation when the narrator chooses night crawls and then uses edge geometry to answer the aliens, reweighting the conceptual stakes. However, conflict remains largely internal and philosophical; no concrete option is visibly foreclosed, and there is little sense of real risk if the communication fails. Tension is strong for a quiet, lyric piece but never becomes sharply acute.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—preventing old grief from drowning the living by finding the caller’s “mother”—is clear and tightens effectively when the narrator leaves his desk and when the apparent goal (find the mother) inverts into a different rupture (the man’s unresolved grief and the child’s search). The key turn, that “he is the one who called, though he did not mean to,” raises the emotional complexity and reframes the problem from locating a dead person to bridging the living. Agency is present in the narrator’s decision to disregard efficiency, follow the pulses, confront the man, and broker the call. Stakes remain primarily emotional and ethical, not structurally perilous, which keeps the conflict from feeling fully knife-edged despite its depth.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stakes—physical survival in the cave/tide and moral reparation toward the forgotten team—are signaled early and woven together well. Escalation is subtle but real: tunnel squeeze and panic → lock failure risk → emotional peak in reading the names → the ethical decision to give up the fleck and leave before drowning. The final choice clearly forecloses an option (keeping the talisman and her old stance), and the tidal deadline keeps a quiet but constant situational pressure. The conflict remains largely one-directional (no direct counterforce beyond environment and guilt), which slightly limits the sense of reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator can meaningfully atone for, or at least re-understand, their catastrophic error—remains clear and tight. Pressure escalates from private rumination to direct accusation from the ghost (“You left the sky disordered”) to the concrete, risky attempt at recalibration and defragmentation. The key tightening is the choice to act technically (recalibrate/defragment) rather than merely self-flagellate, and then to let the mentor-voice fade, choosing their own stance. Stakes are largely internal but do not feel abstract, though the lack of any tangible external consequence beyond the recovered data keeps them in the high-strong, not brutal, range.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether and how a dead/dying language can be made to “travel again” without unacceptable sacrifice—is present early and steadily sharpened. Pressure rises via the canyon’s resistance around law and war and peaks when the tunnel demands “payment in voice,” forcing the protagonist to offer a name and then to remain as caretaker. The conflict is more contemplative than combative, but the escalation from experimental listening to binding contract with the curse is clear. The one limiter is the relative smoothness of the narrator’s acceptance; we don’t linger in agonized hesitation before the sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will remain a detached undercover researcher or commit to being the garden’s keeper—is legible and culminates in a clear choice with cost. Pressure escalates via increasingly uncanny phenomena and the phone’s instructions, culminating in the descent and the naming root. However, the conflict is relatively low-friction: the narrator moves toward yes with minimal resistance or competing tactical options on the page, and the herbalist offers guidance rather than real opposition. The stakes land conceptually and emotionally, but a sharper moment of doubt or a harder alternative would deepen the sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—risking punishment to awaken the orchard and city—is signaled early and tightened when the statutes approach and the crowd gathers, turning a private act into a public confrontation. The protagonist’s agency drives the escalation: adjusting the softness of playing, adding the locust shell, persisting when a statue reaches for her wrist. The tension between being silenced vs catalyzing a larger awakening is clear, though the story stops at the first opening rather than dramatizing a concrete repercussion or specific loss. That keeps the pressure strong but just shy of brutal.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.3)
    The central stake—whether he will remain a rule-bound courier or allow his “respectful rebellion” to actively mend fractures—is clear and sharpened by the presence of the jar and Mina’s offer. Pressure escalates through his decision to stay, the storm’s revelation, and the redirected delivery to the boy, which tests his values against institutional expectations. The dangers around him (drones, bullets, checkpoints) are mostly atmospheric rather than directly tested on the page, keeping the conflict more ethical/emotional than visceral. Still, his final choice plainly forecloses a safer, more detached path.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the train/carousel will wake into a new kind of life—is clear and escalates from technical failure to a deeper, almost spiritual challenge. The key tightening is the realization that mechanical fixes and power wiring are insufficient, forcing the risky, identity-altering choice to sing. Stakes are quiet and interior, with little external opposition, but the piece maintains tension through accumulating imagery and the possibility of failure or emptiness. The only constraint is that the personal cost and risk of singing remain understated, keeping the pressure more lyrical than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—pursuing the hyperbolic path to where stories live versus staying anchored to her library and patrons—is clear and quietly escalated. Pressure tightens when the air “sharpens” and the path reawakens, forcing the choice to step through and then, more crucially, to turn back with news instead of remaining in the borderless reading room. The cost is an earned stasis: she foregoes full entry into the origin-country of stories in order to maintain her custodial role, leaving with only “weather” and pockets that “keep their tide.” Tension is more conceptual than visceral, which may limit intensity for some venues but is coherent for the piece’s aims.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to capture, decode, or release the runaway dream—is clear and faces meaningful tightening when the sea demands a price on waking. The pressure escalates gently but distinctly through the journey to the sea, the negotiated light, and the act of photographing the dream’s flight, then deepens again when the ciphered routes reveal a set of “routes only a fugitive heart would choose.” The final choice to let the dream go, and to look away as it brushes the shoulder, forecloses possession at a conceptual cost. The conflict remains primarily interior and textural, which is fitting, though not quite maximal in felt jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.0)
    The primary stake—whether the narrator will dare to free and voice the feared idea—is clear from the outset and tightened when the locksmith demands an embodied test (singing). Pressure escalates via the move from house to “shadowed nexus,” the mirrors’ disorienting revelations, and the explicit challenge to sing despite the belief in a “cracked vessel” voice. The key turn is the decision to sing anyway, which forecloses the safety of silence and reconfigures the grief-door metaphorically. The only limitation is that resistance feels somewhat low; success seems likely once the ritual begins, which slightly softens tension.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—recovering tithed memories by risking a painful truth—is clear and deepens when the ring demands “missing truth,” forcing a moral/emotional trade. The tightening beat is her confession about valuing work over love, which narrows her options and exacts immediate cost in vulnerability. Internal and external pressures interweave nicely, but physical jeopardy (dive danger, time pressure) remains more atmospheric than truly constraining her choices. The result is a strong, if primarily internal, escalation arc.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the library will be forced to relinquish its “shards” and thus its function—is clear from the decree onward. Pressure escalates via the impending trial, the archivist’s preparations, and their choice to use the child, dusk, and tea as risky proof of concept. However, resistance from the council stays relatively mild; once they drink the tea and witness the reflections, their shift feels quick and lacks a genuinely contested moment. The emotional cost is convincing (self-exposure, potential failure) but the external conflict could bear a sharper on-page test or near-loss.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes—whether the valley forgets why apples “tasted like first light”—are clear and thematically weighty, and the child’s problem concretizes them. The pressure escalates modestly through the introduction of the tired apples and the jar, leading to the tactical choice to plant the seed in the seam between flagstones. Still, conflict remains largely unopposed; Miren encounters no serious resistance, and the cost of her choices is conceptual rather than experienced as loss or danger on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—grounding restless fisher spirits so masks and sea can rest—is clear and steadily addressed through the knotwork ritual. Pressure escalates modestly via resistant knots, surfacing of horror/joy memories, the snapped line and near-fall, and the discovery of the locket, each deepening the emotional weight of the task. However, there is little sense that failure is truly possible; the narrator’s competence feels nearly unassailable, so tension is more contemplative than fraught. The resolution is earned but serene, with limited visible cost beyond exertion and exposure to grief.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether and how to confront and reinterpret the chapel’s silence—is clear and develops from private curiosity to communal responsibility. Escalation is real but quiet: the discovery of the seam, the eerie breath through stone, the decision to involve the village, and the collective opening of the door. The narrator’s agency drives each turn, and the choice to frame the map with the tear visible feels like a considered, ethical stance rather than a neutral detail. However, opposition remains soft (the verger’s reluctance is mild, there’s no serious risk of harm or rupture), which keeps tension relatively low for the stakes aimed at.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes—physical safety/time versus the drive to listen and understand “letting go”—are clear and intertwined. Pressure subtly tightens via the tug on the line, the meter’s ticking, and the implied decompression/air limits, culminating in the decision to take the snow globe and ascend. The cost is mostly conceptual and emotional (accepting drift, accepting the limits of what can be saved) rather than dramatized through sharp reversals. For elite publication, the escalation could benefit from one more concrete, on-page test of the narrator’s priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether suffocated, unseen needs (of city and ghost) will be recognized and acted on—is clear and ties internal and external conflict. Pressure escalates through the oncoming storm, the ghost’s increasingly legible “need,” and the decision to construct the bolt-plate harp and encode a body-map that prompts real changes (vents opened, water shared). Agency is present but understated: the narrator’s choices facilitate others’ decisive acts, and their acceptance of an ongoing, liminal role provides a quiet cost. The main shortfall is that the danger and potential loss (what happens if they fail) remain more conceptual than viscerally felt, so tension never quite tightens into urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—how to retrieve and interpret Mirek’s encrypted diary so as to steward others’ pain—intensifies as each floor complicates what “retrieval” means, culminating in the discovery of the shelves of unsent letters. The story’s escalation is primarily internal and thematic: learning that the encryption is “against despair” and that the shelves hold “absences folded small” forces the narrator into a new ethical stance at the end. However, there’s little in the way of concrete jeopardy or narrowed options; the narrator is never at risk of failing in a tangible sense, which softens the felt cost of their final choice. The result is a beautifully shaped but relatively gentle arc of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stakes—safely rejoining the parent ship and proving her way of reading the sky—are coherent but remain emotionally and physically low-intensity. Pressure does build (the squall line, the radio’s initial silence, the risk of drifting), yet these moments feel contemplative rather than truly narrowing options or forcing hard trade-offs. Her key agency lies in choosing to navigate via emotion-taxonomy and in how she records the night, which is thematically rich but lightly dramatized. The ending feels earned but could gain from one sharper, less-symbolic point of real risk or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stakes—capturing a sky that can outlast the building versus the ticking demolition clock—are clear and tighten effectively via the countdown and the foreman’s brief extension. The internal conflict (testing personal and material limits) is interwoven with the external time pressure, particularly in the beats where the artist pushes the blue until it fractures and then adjusts. Escalation is subtle but real: searching and decoding give way to a race to finish the mural before implosion, with the demolition as an inescapable endpoint. The resolution is earned through the artist’s sustained agency under pressure, accepting the building’s death in exchange for the mural’s survival.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—freeing the trapped light/dawn and successfully mapping it before it disperses—is clear, and pressure coheres around whether the apprentice can decode and act on the pattern. Escalation arrives in the approach to the glowing swath, teeth-humming static, and the decision to wake the helmsman and risk steering into it. However, the sense of danger and possible loss (to ship, town, or self) stays lyrically muted, so the cost of failure never quite bites. The figure-eight maneuver is a satisfying tactical beat, but the conflict never becomes truly knife-edge.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—restoring the misfiled, mis-timed library—stays coherent, with a meaningful tightening when the mirrors show snowfall instead of his face and the clocks “shiver” at his approach. The unstoppering of the cedar bottle is a genuine pressure point that shifts his options and allows progress. However, the conflict remains largely frictionless: there is little sense of risk if he fails, and his competence is rarely challenged beyond gentle problem-solving. The price he pays (leaving the wheel, being changed by the library) is conceptually rich but emotionally underleveraged as tension.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes—survival, water, and whether fragmented people can act as “one orchard”—are clear and escalate meaningfully through the shard-caused emergency and then the choice to leave for the nebula. The rescue sequence is an effective tightening, pairing skills and forcing coordinated risk under Lio’s guidance. The final departure is thematically weighty but its concrete danger is a bit soft; we feel fatigue and uncertainty more than a sharp, specific price. The conflict remains mostly external-plus-communal; adding one sharper, morally fraught trade-off would heighten the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—buying the world a bit more time/mercy—is clear and present from early on, and pressure tightens as the needle leans and the pane “thrummed with brittle fear.” The decisive internal turn is the choice to respond not with further technical adjustment alone but by singing the mother’s lullaby into the pane as a vow. Conflict is mostly internal and metaphysical rather than situational, but the linkage between global unrest and the lighthouse’s strain keeps it from feeling static. The main limitation is that alternatives or trade-offs remain abstract; we feel the cost of delay but not sharply differentiated tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—get mother and child out before frost or risk them being claimed by the orchard—is clear and tied early to a concrete time limit. Pressure escalates via the early arrival of frost, the patrol change, and the need to use strange methods (walking in one trace, coaxing doors, the nut as key). The final stance—that he must always find travelers before frost or be reclaimed—is a strong Charged Poise that marries inner and outer conflict. Still, the journey feels largely controlled by his competence, so the sense of real risk, reversal, or near-failure never fully peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—how to live with and respond to the harm she helped create—is signaled early and tightened through her refusal of courtroom confession and choice of the ravine as crucible. Pressure escalates as observation yields to obligation: the river’s motifs force a conceptual and ethical turn toward polymers that “listen, loosen, and rejoin,” culminating in her commitment to change plant practices despite legal and reputational fallout. Internal and external conflicts (guilt vs. career, mentor, sister, corporate demands) are braided effectively, with the final decision clearly foreclosing the easier path of silence or inaction. The conflict is mostly internal and contemplative, so the tension is more moral than kinetic, but it remains coherent and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—gaining access to and negotiating with the place where stories begin—is clear and does deepen as the narrator moves from rumor to door to apple to offering. Escalation is quiet but real: first mapping and counting, then the test in the chamber, then the requirement to sacrifice tangible tokens of regret and incompleteness. However, opposition is more conceptual than pressured; there is little sense that failure or refusal would meaningfully harm the protagonist beyond lost opportunity. The cost is intellectually strong but emotionally soft, keeping this just below the very top band for conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.3)
    The central stake—whether and how to take on and transform stored remorse—is signaled early and coherently escalated by the blue sand, the pavilion’s touch, and the decision to cook. The warning about emotional contagion sets a real cost, and the act of letting the filament “lick” his palm is a clear tightening that narrows options. The conflict is mostly internal and ethical rather than suspenseful, so tension stays quiet, but it does deepen meaningfully through the cooking sequence and the keeper’s changed bearing. A slightly sharper sense of jeopardy or potential failure in the cooking could have intensified the pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—transforming a siloed town into an interconnected community via rehabilitating the elevator—is clear and coherent. Escalation is mostly a gentle increase in scale (one bridge, then two, then three) rather than pressure that forecloses options or forces sacrifice, and there is virtually no opposition. Mara’s agency drives events, but her plan succeeds with an ease that softens tension and diminishes any sense of risk. The result is emotionally satisfying but lower in dramatic intensity than the premise could bear.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator can engage abandoned dreams without drowning or erasing themselves—is legible early and escalates through the successive pulses and physical reactions of the canyon. The meaningful tightening comes when the canyon seam opens and “rearranges” the narrator, forcing acceptance of being changed as the price of continuing the work. Agency is present in enduring and calibrating rather than overt refusal or confrontation, and the cost is the loosening of prior control. The pressure is more meditative than sharp-edged, so while effective, it lacks the sharper trade-offs that would push this into the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the archivist can retrieve and reconfigure “forgotten combinations” to give the city a new kind of patience—is clear and grows under the time constraint of the inversion hour. Pressure escalates through successive tests: crowns that mostly fail, the iron band that changes perception, then the safes that demand disciplined, counter-habitual attention, culminating in the choice to take an unseen “final corridor” under a ticking clock. The cost is largely internal and conceptual (foregoing more direct power, accepting a role as latent influence rather than overt savior), which fits the mode but stays somewhat cool emotionally. Still, the narrowing of options and the charged renunciation at the end feel earned and appropriately scaled for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how to give voice to a silent world—is clear, and there is a meaningful tightening when the narrator realizes “the grove does not want a symphony; it wants a pulse.” That realization forces a concrete renunciation: surrendering cleverness and performance in favor of a modest, sustaining heartbeat. Pressure here is mostly aesthetic and ethical rather than dangerous, so the escalation stays subdued but coherent. The lack of sharper consequence or genuine risk keeps this just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—how to let beauty and play survive within a covenant of stillness / exile—is clear and grows as the narrator risks involvement rather than remaining an observer. Pressure deepens with the discovery of the hollow, the decision to place the basalt stone, and the implied risk of violating or reshaping the elders’ covenant. The clock of “before the next phase of moonrise” adds a gentle temporal squeeze, and the impending judgment by the girl’s family is a believable external consequence. The cost is mostly internal and conceptual, but the text makes it legible: he endangers what little social safety he has to alter the valley’s terms.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.3)
    The central stake—opening the clasp and deciding how to carry Anya’s unfinished work—is clear and gently escalates via the impending fireworks and the fragile ethical method. The tonal and procedural tightening around the resonance experiment provides a real, if understated, pressure point culminating in the “click.” Cost appears as the emotional and ethical weight of inheriting a promise rather than any external threat, suiting the accumulative lens. The conflict remains very interior and never quite bites as hard as it could, which keeps it just shy of higher-band intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring serenity in a motion-sick village by embracing a taboo bloom—is clear and threaded from early ambition to the council’s climactic stillness. Pressure escalates via mounting communal unease and the social/spiritual risk of planting a corpse flower at the bridge’s heart. However, opposition remains mostly atmospheric and murmured; no concrete challenge or near-failure sharpens the planting or blooming beats. The cost is real but felt more as a brave acceptance of stink and grief than as a hard trade-off under acute external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—discovering the source of resilience for the orchards within the brief inversion hour—is clear and coherently pursued. Pressure escalates in a soft, accumulative way: rumors, the eerie cathedral of arches, the resin spindle, and the fusing act all deepen the quest rather than throwing hard obstacles at it. The protagonist’s agency drives key turns (choosing to trust the arrow’s pull, to connect and then relocate the heart), but there is little real threat of loss or failure beyond missing an opportunity. As a result, tension feels contemplative more than urgent, limiting the sense of high-stakes conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—getting the helicopter down safely in a treacherous, recently lethal microclimate—is established early and tightened as the pattern of singular convergence becomes clearer and the generator deadline appears. Escalation is more in the intellectual and procedural deepening than in reversals, but the shift from abstract mapping to the child’s urgent report and the incoming chopper supplies a clear pressure spike. Agency is strong: the investigator’s choices about corridors and offsets genuinely change the outcome. The one limitation is that the voice’s calm mastery slightly cushions felt jeopardy, keeping tension impressive rather than harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—unfettering an unsung sound and thereby proving wonder’s necessity—is clear, and there is a discernible tightening at the first synchronized strike when the cavern reorganizes. Subsequent beats do deepen the ritual (more colors, more precise chiseling, the figure emerging), but the sense of risk or potential failure remains muted. The internal doubt beat about the city of noise provides the sharpest tension, yet it resolves quickly through reassurance from the amber sheet. As a result, conflict feels contemplative rather than pressured, limiting escalation despite a strong conceptual aim.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether he can repair or at least responsibly re-engage the breached threshold—is signaled early and tightened when the flute “finds the seam” regardless of his will. Escalation is subtle but real: from testing a note, to being compelled to follow it, to confronting the empty market and ledger of miscounts, to altering his weaving technique with visible effects on the world. The cost is primarily moral and professional—owning shortcuts and accepting a slower, humbler practice—which registers in his decisions and the partial, fragile restoration. The conflict remains mostly internal/technical; a bit more palpable risk or potential for fresh harm on this attempt would further heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake is the narrator’s ethical and emotional struggle over using transposed empathy and ambiguity to handle grief, signaled early and deepened via the couple’s request. Pressure escalates when she applies her method to a real, raw grief, which in turn forces her later self-confrontation. The core conflict is primarily internal but credible; the “price” is surrendering a long-standing self-defense and stepping into a more exposed, accountable role. The stakes stay a bit abstract at times, but the final reorientation toward a “salvaged future tense” provides a meaningful narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—the courier enabling a brief, risky reconnection between widow and dead husband under his mentor’s shadow—stays coherent and tightens as the ritual progresses from hum to corridor to inevitable thinning. Escalation is quiet but present: once he commits to the ritual and their breathing synchronizes with the ridge, the only way forward is through, and the cost of overholding the miracle is explicitly acknowledged (“should not be kept past their flavor”). His agency in holding the pitch and then letting the corridor go constitutes an earned stance with visible emotional cost. The pressure remains more contemplative than fraught, which keeps it just below the very highest tension bands.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central stake—whether the mystic can demonstrate that objects store emotion, and whether Mara can bear believing in that—is clear from early on and coherently deepened. Pressure escalates with the move from abstract claim to concrete frost mandala to the prism revealing Mara’s personal grief, each step narrowing her emotional options. The story earns a felt price when Mara’s former resolve to suppress a name collapses under the ritual’s pressure. The conflict remains mostly internal and interpersonal without a strong sense of irreversible external consequence, which keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—reaching her brother across an impossible distance—is clear and present throughout, and the cost of “less remaining” as she weaves gives the conflict weight. Escalation is primarily textural: the weaving deepens into a quasi-ritual, culminating in the fabric’s departure and his on-page reception. Her agency in choosing to recommence whenever doubt cuts the thread foregrounds endurance as the crucial decision. Still, opposition remains mostly atmospheric rather than concretely tightening, so the pressure feels profound but not razor-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—whether the town can stabilize its world enough to rebuild—is present from the quake-shattered opening and tightens around Iven’s three-night bargain. The storm with “grit and blue fire” supplies a clear escalation, and Iven’s decision to proceed despite danger, paying with personal memories and physical pain, gives the climax weight. External and internal conflicts interweave: his quiet defiance versus fear and communal doubt. However, the stone’s compliance feels relatively assured once the ritual begins, so the sense of possible failure is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—discovering and bearing the truth of the failed evacuation—is signaled early and escalates as she moves from revisiting the bay to confronting the specific moment of REDIRECT. The central tightening is strong: realizing that the child in the log is herself forecloses the fantasy of external blame and forces an ethical choice between erasure and integration. Internal and external conflicts braid well: her mapping ability and inter-universe travel are both a gift and the mechanism of her original harm, so her final decision to “redirect the lost” carries visible cost without facile absolution. Some of the material consequences of the REDIRECT remain abstract (we don’t tangibly feel any single loss), which slightly softens the immediacy of the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—can a fragile network of anonymous care maintain safety’s illusion when the literal light fails?—is clear and steadily tightened. The lamp’s failure mid-storm is the main external escalation, which pushes the narrator deeper into the letter/stone ritual and exposes the emotional cost of guardianship. Internal and external conflicts braid effectively, though the piece remains gently pressurized rather than sharply cornering the protagonist into a painful, binary choice. The cost is nonetheless felt in her endurance and the myth of the drowned previous keeper, which narrows her available emotional paths.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—how to carry forward guidance/meaning after the collapse of print—remains clear, but pressure stays mostly conceptual and atmospheric rather than sharply escalating. The arrival of the prophetic child is the one clear causal tightening, raising both responsibility and possibility, and the later description of their joint “publication” in beams is a deepening rather than a reversal. Agency is real but quiet: steering light, choosing what memories to feed the storm, training the child in storm-speak. The lack of a more acute test or threatened failure keeps stakes from feeling fully pressurized, even as the piece maintains a rich, low-frequency tension.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether and how to hold others’ stories without harm—is clear and sharpened when borrowed tales start to burn on the widow’s sleeves. Escalation is subtle but present: passive observation grows into an active ethical choice to diffuse stories via “indigo steam.” However, the pressure never feels truly urgent or binding; the danger of harm is more mythic than viscerally dramatized, so the price of failure is felt in concept more than in gut. The resolution is an earned stance crystallization rather than a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.3)
    The stakes are primarily internal (how to hold grief and what to do with what trees witness) but are legible from early on and tighten as the narrator moves from private, slightly absurd experiment to contact with a vast archive of sorrow. The key escalation comes with the tower’s hush and the pin’s fall, which compel a shift from routine maintenance into transgressive investigation, culminating in excavation and reading of the tags. The cost is more conceptual than visceral—opening oneself to decades of storm, sparrows, children, etc.—and there is no sharp on-page dilemma, which keeps the pressure quiet. Nonetheless, the progression from passive caretaker to active archivist is clear and the resolution feels earned rather than coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—rekindling a dying realm by weaving a new dawn—is clear and present early via the ledger’s recipe constraint. Pressure deepens meaningfully when the narrator realizes that intact mornings are impossible and that they must instead braid voices and include the mirror world, which tightens the tactic space. The secondary social stakes (fraying communities, specific quarrels like fisherfolk vs. rooftop gardeners) are tied into the loom and given partial, thematically apt resolution. Escalation feels more like steady deepening than knife-edge risk; the ritual’s success rarely feels truly in doubt, which limits felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the narrator can ethically remain close to someone they’ve harmed—is signaled early and tightened when the other reader is revealed to be the estranged friend. Pressure deepens through the shared recounting of the same night from opposing angles and the decision not to default to apology but to expose motives first. The price is legible: they gain understanding but forgo an easy reconciliation, accepting a permanently altered relationship. Escalation is mostly internal and conversational but coherent and sufficient for this length and mode.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stakes are fundamentally ethical and internal—whether to normalize civic erasure or to engage in slow, reparative attention—and this is clear from the Grackle Street bakery anecdote onward. Pressure tightens meaningfully when the cashier appears, confronting the narrator with the human cost behind their abstractions about “creeping normality” and confirming that their rituals are witnessed. The conflict never becomes sharply agonistic; there’s little risk of concrete loss beyond self-contempt and ongoing responsibility, which keeps the tension relatively quiet. Still, the choice to commit to ongoing, non-miraculous tending at the end clearly forecloses the easier path of forgetting.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the archive of vows will survive the end of an age—is present early and intensifies as wind, silence, and “illusion fading” threaten the stacks. Pressure deepens with the near-shattering pledge, the impossible readings, and the library’s own directive demanding a final costly vow. The decisive act is the narrator’s choice to bind themself into the system, trading personal autonomy for the archive’s continued breathing. The escalation is more lyrical than visceral, and the sense of a truly narrowing set of options could be sharpened with one more explicit moment where refusal is tempting but rejected.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    The primary stake—Lark’s desire to capture a rare sound without breaking herself against the market’s danger—comes through and escalates via her deliberate social manipulations and the unexpected cutpurse complication. The hush rule raises the ethical and practical cost of any open confrontation, and her decision to act physically (thwarting the theft) triggers the brittle fracture she’s seeking. The story could make Lark’s personal risk or moral queasiness a shade more explicit at the peak, but the chain of pressure is coherent and tight for the length. The resolution is an endurance/acceptance rather than a victory, with justice framed as another kind of breaking, which keeps the conflict live at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is the narrator’s stance toward the weatherbearers’ logic—will they remain a remote skeptic or step into the quorum. Pressure does deepen when Mirelle invites them to walk during the “final count,” and the internal barometer of tastes (citrus, ash, honey) registers risk to memory and companionship. However, conflict remains very low-friction; the narrator never seriously considers refusing or challenging Mirelle, so escalation feels more like continuous revelation than a tightening vise. The final choice carries conceptual weight but only a softly implied cost, keeping tension strong-but-not-bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will answer the underground calling and reclaim their earlier, riskier art—is established early and tightened by the broken lock’s resistance. Escalation is modest but clear: descent into the cave, confrontation with the box, the failure of memory/knowledge alone, then the inventive use of charcoal portraiture to solve the problem. The conflict is primarily internal but embodied through concrete obstacles, and the final decision to change how they present their work aboveground is an earned resolution driven by the narrator’s agency. The price is more conceptual than visceral, but the story makes the impending labor, exposure, and loyalty to Vera’s vision feel real.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—how candor is handled in a brittle, resource-scarce city—is clear and escalating: from a single dubious dedication to discovering systemic redirection, to an economic/moral boycott, to a public forcing of the archive’s opening. Her refusal to gild, then to process any leaf-post, forecloses comfortable complicity and forces the postmaster’s hand. Internal and external conflicts braid well: her bodily revulsion to lies powers a collective action with ethical ambiguity about unleashing stored confessions. Escalation is compressed but coherent; a touch more friction or near-failure at the hatch scene could sharpen the cost further.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central conflict—Keepers’ urge to archive the shard vs. Iri’s drive to preserve wonder—is clear and personalized. Pressure escalates with their arrival and peaks when she angles the shard and one Keeper nearly touches it, then withdraws, reweighting their initial demand. The stakes remain conceptual (truth dissolving vs. truth hardening) rather than viscerally perilous, which softens the sense of risk. Still, Iri’s refusal to relinquish the shard, and the Keepers’ renunciation of their claim, read as earned, meaningful trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stakes—preventing the dome’s system from self-destructive overwatering while the caretaker seeks an internal resolution—are clear and organically twined. Pressure escalates from subtle tilt to system malfunction to the roses’ threatening overgrowth, culminating in the deliberate violation of “systems” via the miniaturized burn. The risk is conceptually legible (disobeying design parameters, risking damage), though the sense of immediate catastrophe if the experiment fails could be sharpened a touch. Still, the tightening around that central choice and its cost to both roses and caretaker is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stakes—solving the mailbox mystery and proving that listening heals in the face of external development pressures—are clear and converge at the opening of the box. Escalation is quiet but definite: the layering of increasingly painful stories and the arrival of news crew/developers sharpen the need for a different kind of response. The decisive move (using the hairpin in concert with the “choir” of the neighbors’ stories) feels like genuine agency under the chosen lens. The costs are more spiritual and communal than sharply dramatized (no hard loss or irreversible sacrifice), which keeps this just shy of a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—free the locked names/memories without triggering the Warden—is clear and threaded from early on. Pressure escalates when the Warden pulses a warning and their bodies must “answer in the negative space,” and then tightens again when Mara formulates the key as a question, forcing a conceptual risk the Warden “could not forgive.” However, danger remains mostly atmospheric; we never feel a concrete near-capture, trade-off, or irrevocable loss, so the price of success is more implied than viscerally tested. The resolution does arise from their chosen tactics rather than coincidence, which keeps the conflict meaningful even in a quiet, lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—regaining a piece of the sister and understanding where lost memories go—is established early and tightened as the phenomena escalate from eerie (slackening ropes, forgetting names) to actionable (salt chambers archiving softness, buried memory sheet, corridor of memories). The protagonist’s decisions drive the key escalation beats: going to the chamber, choosing to dig under the whale, using the sheet, and selecting one memory to carry back. The cost is emotional and conceptual rather than catastrophic, but it is real: the world’s gravity remains feral, and the narrator accepts the ongoing burden of path-keeping rather than a neat fix. Conflict is primarily internal/situational, not adversarial, yet tension persists sentence-to-sentence through uncertainty and strange physics.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—preventing an “iron noon” future—is clear and escalates when the code “balks at vanishing,” tightening into a concrete obstacle. Pressure functions mainly at a conceptual/ritual level, with the key turn being the summoner’s shift from general working to targeted attention at the “seam where time had snagged and raveled.” The resolution is earned by that focused, patient agency (“not pulling, only offering direction through stillness”), and the future’s options are reweighted on the page. However, the stakes remain somewhat abstract and emotionally cool, so the felt cost and tension never quite reach maximal intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether and how to engage with the city’s “agreed upon lies” and the ethical weight of listening—is clear but remains largely internal and philosophical. Escalation arrives via density rather than reversals: the first lesson about lies, the architect’s story, and the rooftop scene progressively deepen the cost of listening. The key tightening is the narrator’s decision to interrogate the tutor and accept the seal, which forecloses a more naive, purely curious stance. Still, the lack of a more concrete or contested on-page price keeps the pressure somewhat soft for elite-level short fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether to assume the quarantined memory’s burden or let the garden keep replaying it—is clear and deepens as the child asks to have its winter archived. Pressure escalates through the ethical trade-off: keep something that “once belonged to the sea” vs. condemning the space to repetition, with the protagonist’s skepticism complicating any easy sacrificial gesture. The transfer itself is a solid tightening beat where abstract stakes become somatic (“winter in my chest”). The price is conceptual rather than dramatic, but it is explicit enough to charge the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—how to respond to the mentor’s unfinished, too-merciful text and the narrator’s own treason—is clearly signaled and then tightened as she opens the case and confronts the scrolls. The pivotal pressure point is the implicit choice whether to “complete” or forgive the unfinished, culminating in the decision to leave a margin blank and not turn mercy into another law. Cost is felt through renunciation of power and verdict, not through overt jeopardy. Escalation is primarily internal and textural; it works, but remains quiet enough that tension never fully peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central stake—understanding why some voices echo and what that implies about Lio’s own life—is clear from the outset and tightens as they realize entanglement and debt are the hinge. Pressure escalates via Lio’s decision to “test the echo with questions that do not flatter my hope,” which risks disproving a comforting pattern and leads to harsher answers (the stone’s refusal to breathe). The conflict remains mostly internal and conceptual, but the moment of kneeling in the shallows to sing the pot song underlines a felt emotional risk: inviting the mother’s echo and accepting responsibility. The final promise to be a knot-maker closes a live dilemma rather than merely summarizing a thought.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stakes—truth for the drowned vs. the temptation of blunt exposure—are clear, and pressure meaningfully tightens when the narrator chooses a slow, communal unveiling over simple accusation. Escalation is more accumulative than sharp: the discovery of the globe, then the courtroom-like gathering, then confronting the company foreman all deepen rather than radically turn the conflict. The ethical trade-off (gentle blade vs. cracking the ice) is legible and gives the climax quiet moral tension. The relative lack of direct jeopardy or reversal keeps tension from reaching the highest band, but for a lyric piece the pressure holds well.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the town will learn to perceive and honor invisible effort—is clear and present early in “promising to show them effort’s invisibility.” Conflict escalates as the councilor’s skepticism meets the narrator’s quiet insistence, culminating in the crowd participating in mending instead of clamoring for spectacle. The price is social and temporal: they give up fireworks and easy applause for humble, uncomfortable work. Still, the tension remains contemplative rather than biting; no choice sharply forecloses an option, which keeps the stakes more gentle than their premise could support.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—unmasking the mechanism behind a supposed curse to keep the orchard alive—is signaled early and escalates through the storm observation, the tedious reconstruction work, and the recalibration before the next storm. The narrator’s agency clearly drives turns: choosing to investigate the shredder, stay overnight, teach the caretakers, and refuse the diamond. The price is more philosophical than visceral, and conflict with the caretakers remains understated rather than confrontational, which slightly mutes tension. Still, the tightening from rumor to hard design and the test of the new configuration in the final storm are very effective.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator’s weatherwork can redirect hunger and allegiance—is clear, and pressure does build as more people (Brin, the mayor, priest, town) are drawn in. The radio’s prophecy of a non-existent child and the barometric “prophet” pointing cityward are genuine escalations. Still, the protagonists rarely face a hard trade-off; they accept each new instruction and opportunity without visible loss or renunciation, and external opposition (the mayor, the town) softens quickly. As a result, tension is intriguing but seldom genuinely knife-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether grief and generational distance can be translated into shared sound—is clear, and the discovery/activation of the music box is a real tightening of pressure. The escalation from solitary practice to communal ceremony works, with the widow’s relationship to the melody adding tension. However, conflict remains largely internal and situational, with minimal sense of real risk to the protagonist or open resistance from others. The resolution unfolds quite smoothly; it’s lovely, but not sharply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.7)
    The dominant stake—preventing the stone’s misuse to ransom the coast—is clear and early, and the major tightening comes when the seeker arrives and hears the stone. Marek’s decision to “adapt, not defend with force” gives the conflict an ethical contour, and his use of sonic absolution to redirect her need is a coherent, character-driven resolution. However, the confrontation is relatively low-friction: the seeker’s conversion is quick, with minimal resistance or near-failure, and the world-scale stakes never quite bite in scene. The cost feels more conceptual than viscerally pressured, which trims escalation impact.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—how to respond to looming change and communal fear without surrendering to rage—is clear and tightened when the messenger asks her flint-edged question and later when the worried men arrive. Escalation is mostly quiet: it deepens through additional pressures (girl, then men) rather than big reversals, fitting the “patient revolution” concept. Agency is real but understated: the narrator’s key choices are answers and assignments, which re-route potential panic into purposeful work. The cost of this path (what is forfeited by not choosing a more immediate, disruptive response) is implied rather than sharply dramatized, which keeps the pressure from fully peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the deaths are written off as individual error or acknowledged as preventable collective failure—is clear early via the algorithm’s “preference.” Pressure deepens as empirical evidence accumulates (no alarms, salt-locked drains, the missed nod) and as the lantern braids the workers’ and father’s deaths, making complicity personal. The significant tightening comes when the radios “hiss again” and she chooses to turn them off, then explicitly documents the system failures against institutional expectations. The conflict is primarily ethical and internal, but it escalates coherently and lands with a visible cost in her decision to report upward against algorithmic convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Jonah can begin to live in a way that earns his freedom to himself—is signaled early and coherently threaded. Pressure deepens rather than twists; the key tightening is the chaplain reframing from “fixing” Jonah to inviting him into ongoing choice, accompanied by the mechanical thorn’s removal. The conflict is primarily internal and ethical, which suits the length and tone, but it never quite hits a sharp moment where a real alternative (e.g., comforting platitude vs. costly honesty) is visibly refused on the page. As a result, escalation is persuasive but gently contoured rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—getting the bell to ring—is signaled early and returned to consistently, with the clear tightening of the twenty-ninth dawn and the algorithm taking initiative. However, the opposition is mostly abstract (resistant resonance) and summarized, so pressure feels more like a textured effort than a true escalation with hard trade-offs. The key turn is the recalibration to “hunger” and allowing the algorithm to choose its own speed, which credibly precedes the switch’s activation. Cost is present but soft (time, effort, emotional vulnerability rather than a concrete sacrifice).

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether to preserve sanctioned oblivion or resurrect a “deleted” person’s voice—appears early and tightens through the illegal access decision and discovery of policy lies. The lie to the access bot is a strong escalation, and the final choice to post Driftwood at real personal risk gives a credible climax. External resistance (legal, corporate consequences) stays off-stage and somewhat soft, so pressure feels more ethical than visceral. Still, internal and situational conflicts weave together into a coherent, escalating throughline.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether the orchard keepers and fishers can move from blame to a shared, enacted responsibility—is clear and present early. Pressure escalates through revelation of the child’s death, the controversial proposals, and Matilde/Harun’s pointed questions about fault and oversight. The narrator’s agency drives the key turn (offering a “wheel of tasks, not a pit” and choosing to remain), but the scene stays relatively decorous; we never see anyone come close to walking away, refusing, or making a high-cost counter-move. The stakes feel important, yet the conflict plays out more as thoughtful negotiation than as a truly knife-edge ethical test, which tempers the intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake — whether the narrator continues toward euthanasia or finds a different relationship with endings — is clear and steadily pressured by events at the marina. Escalation is quiet but real: from reflective listening to concrete crisis (the child’s fall), to communal preparation for a storm, to the personal climax of the clinic’s confirmation call. The protagonist’s agency is decisive in the rescue, in storm-readiness, and finally in choosing to delay the appointment, but tension remains more meditative than acute. The cost is felt, yet the conflict never quite hits a sharp moral pinch point that would push this into the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—whether she can choose a way of loving that doesn’t erase herself—is clear and increasingly pressured as the map, “destined mismatches” note, and letter fragment come into play. Escalation is subtle but distinct: from simple wayfinding help to emotional confession to the concrete, risky act of rewriting the terms of the relationship. The sentinel’s offer of the knife and twine creates a clear tightening: she must commit to cutting and binding in a new configuration rather than simply fleeing or submitting. The price—risking his rejection by naming rivers as her priority—is present even in the conditional hope of the final map.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—preserving legible echoes against forgetting and wind—is clearly established and tested, with a meaningful tightening at midday when the gust threatens to “scatter vowels” and the duo must adapt by “sew[ing] calm into the air.” The later proposal to widen the clearing if they “trust its margin” adds a second, more conceptual deepening of risk that reconfigures how the work can proceed. Because costs remain mostly implied (loss would be catastrophic but never glimpsed), and no single turn dramatically forecloses an option on the page, escalation feels beautifully textured but still somewhat soft-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.6)
    Conflict is gentle but coherent: can the narrator orchestrate a ritual that helps a wounded town reconfigure its relationship to past harm? Pressure deepens as people begin sharing vulnerable memories, see themselves in the mirror, and then must walk the improvised corridor and offer a word about what they can still give. The stakes—collective emotional risk and the possibility of remaining stuck—are felt, especially in the mayor’s nervousness and the trembling “places we have not named.” However, escalation remains low-intensity and largely unopposed; there’s little sense that the process might fail or backfire, which trims the upper range.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—how to respond to a world where no new dictionaries will be printed—remains clear, and pressure accumulates as he moves through Sprout, Scar, and Orchard toward the impending noon appointment. The internal conflict between his reticence and the demand to testify provides the main tightening, culminating in his decision to speak through the crystal rather than with his voice. However, escalation is mostly tonal and conceptual; there’s little sense of risk that this testimony might fail or entail real loss beyond discomfort. The stakes feel high intellectually but only moderately sharp in lived, immediate terms.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—how he will live with inevitable forgetting of his own future—is coherent and present throughout, and it meaningfully tightens as the tide starts to rearrange the driftwood. His agency is quiet but clear: choosing to trust the altered compass, kneeling to invite the echo, and then resetting the markers for a future self who won’t know them. Escalation is more deepening than reversal, and stays somewhat abstract, which keeps tension lower than it might be in a more scene-driven piece. Nonetheless, the acceptance at the end forecloses an imagined path of control over memory, giving the internal conflict a credible, if subtle, sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether they can capture the Moon’s subtle post-meteor “exhale” despite quake damage—is clear and threads the piece. Pressure escalates as the quake’s consequences manifest (spinning chronometer, smeared photons), forcing the narrator to commit to a full restructuring of the instrument stack rather than cosmetic fixes. The key turns (identifying the whisper-misalignment, rebalancing optics, loosening the collar, sanding the burr) are all protagonist-driven and culminate in a successful but fragile capture of data. The conflict is primarily technical and philosophical rather than morally or personally sharp, which keeps the tension beautifully low-key but also somewhat soft.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—facilitating a meaningful goodbye before death—is clearly established when we learn Mr. Ramos has “hours, maybe a day.” Escalation proceeds through a single, strong tightening: the therapist calls the son, transforming abstract regret into an on-page confrontation and shared singing. Agency is mostly quiet but real: the therapist’s call, the son’s choice to stay, and the father’s decision to hand over the shard with its lesson about joy. The cost is emotional and relational rather than plot-twisty, but it is unmistakable in the narrowing options as his breaths “thin to whispers.”

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—learning where shadows go at noon and what that means for loss—is clear and pursued throughout. Pressure escalates via increasingly committed actions: winding the key, stepping through the shadow-doorway, tracing and closing the loop, and signing the contract. However, opposition and risk feel largely abstract; nothing on the page suggests concrete danger if she fails or if noon is imported, so tension stays meditative rather than fraught. The conflict is thus thematically rich but not sharply pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—how to respond to the town’s false resolution and Ari’s blamed absence—remains clear and coheres through the drive to either shore up or subvert that substitute body. Pressure escalates quietly but firmly: from ambient town suspicion into the intimacy of the maze, then sharply up when Ari emerges injured and confesses to planting the body. The key tightening is the narrator’s shift from investigator to accomplice/advocate, choosing a story that will cost them social capital. The only brake on a higher score is that external consequences remain deferred to “tomorrow,” so the sense of price is more anticipatory than immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—creating a gentler, non-destructive light for a fire-traumatized community—is clear and present early. Pressure escalates texturally: from solitary, almost meditative polishing to communal anticipation on the cliff and the lived test of whether this new “star” calms or harms. Agency is evident in the protagonist’s choice to stay, to adopt and refine the old woman’s method, and to present it publicly as a replacement for torches. The cost is mostly in renunciation and endurance, not a sharp on-page dilemma, which keeps the tension strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether and how they renegotiate intimacy and narrative after a public betrayal—is clear early and coherently pressures the scene. Escalation is quiet but real: anticipation in solitude, the arrival and mutual inventory, the refusal to be an “arena,” and finally the decision to bury the pendant with explicit mutual commitments, which forecloses the path of spectacle/silence. The cost is mostly emotional and relational, but legible: she surrenders a cherished object and the chance to retaliate theatrically; the filmmaker relinquishes using the narrator as material. The only limiter is that sentence-level calm can slightly smooth over what might otherwise feel like sharper moment-to-moment tension.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether to submit to market expectations or honor a more difficult, plural hope—is signaled early and deepens as the nexus offers emblems that demand a stance. Pressure escalates when the narrator wades into the contrary river to “solemnize” a pact, raising the implied price of refusal or dissolution. The decisive tightening comes with “I chose the river,” which commits to one path and closes off the ladder-of-triumphs alternative. The conflict is entirely internal and quiet, and while thematically potent, the on-page sense of loss or risk could be rendered a shade more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the community can repair its relationship with land/spirit by restoring rites—is established early and coherently carried through to the harvest-moon ritual. Escalation is primarily textural: the approaching deadline, the collective practice, and the increasingly responsive environment intensify the sense of pressure without introducing overt opposition. This yields a persuasive but gentle arc; there’s no real risk of failure dramatized in moment-to-moment choices, and resistance (internal or external) is minimal. The remedy’s success therefore feels a touch inevitable rather than hard-won, which trims the sense of cost and constraint at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—breaking global stasis to give people a way out—remains legible and focused throughout, with the orchard’s refusal to surrender anchoring it. Escalation is quiet but clear: from listening to choosing a trunk, to committing starlight, to physically traversing the hazardous terrain and altering the fissure. The cost is primarily conceptual and resource-based rather than visceral danger, but his limited starlight and the risk of failure under a frozen sky provide real pressure. Internal conflict (duty vs. personal grief) is more implied than dramatized, keeping the tension sophisticated but restrained.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake is conceptual—can he devise a way to reliably store and later retrieve wonder/memory via echoes—and this is signaled early and developed through his technical experiments. Pressure does escalate in an accumulative way: mapping the cave, repairing the timer, discovering the hollow, and successfully retrieving a softened story all deepen commitment and narrow the project from idea to functioning system. However, conflict remains low-intensity and largely unopposed; failures are felt (the slipping spring) but resolved smoothly, with little sense that options might meaningfully close or that he might have to abandon or significantly compromise his goal. The ending’s cost is more philosophical than pressured, keeping this in the strong-but-quiet range rather than fully taut.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central stake—can the narrator learn to carry and name burdens without being destroyed by them—emerges early and tightens through successive, heavier griefs. The joint effort on the soldier’s name and the relapse/calcification moments provide genuine deepening rather than mere repetition. The climax around the narrator’s own fear is a clear escalation in both intimacy and cost, resolved through an on-page reorientation rather than a magical fix. Pressure remains internal and contemplative, but for this mode it coheres and meaningfully narrows their options (accept duty vs. flee vocation).

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—how she will live with being “here and gone” from her husband, how to grieve without being consumed—is clear and focused from early on. Pressure escalates in a lyric mode: the advancing kettle, reaching the knot, the droplets’ “crystallized time,” and especially the decision not to restore the tag’s name all deepen the conflict between preservation and letting go. Her final choices (to accept the scar, keep the absence, open the window, and treat the bundle as a new ring) show a crystallized stance and an earned cost. The tension is intentionally quiet; for elite markets this is fine, but the escalation remains mostly internal and could feel understated to some readers.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—reaching and bargaining with the ghost self—is signaled early and steadily tightened by concrete steps: climbing via rumors, braiding stories into a bridge, offering the camera wheel, then paying in verbs and changed habits. The key escalation is the ghost’s demand for specific actions (admit, forgive, rebuild, stay), which forces a trade-off between old, plundering ambition and a slower, craft-based existence. The resolution is earned by the narrator’s choice to remain and retool their salvaging, closing off the carousel’s call. Pressure is largely internal and textural rather than overtly dramatic, but it does deepen decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—can an abandoned terminal be reoriented into a functioning, compassionate space—is clear and pursued through concrete engineering choices. Tension rises modestly as the narrator moves from solitary tinkering to negotiating intentions with the janitor and serving an actual mother and child. Escalation remains gentle and mostly problem-solving; there’s little direct opposition or sense that failure would seriously harm anyone yet. The result is quietly satisfying but not as pressurized or costly as the premise and theme might support.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stake—whether he can make peace with the abandoned city-of-bells dream—is clear early and returns at key beats. Pressure does deepen: his vow to “write no clocks today” raises internal stakes, and the finch moment plus apology forces him to confront the dream directly rather than orbit it. However, escalation remains low-intensity and largely reflective; there is no sharp narrowing of options or on-page reversal, just a graceful intensification of listening. The ending’s renunciation-without-rejection is satisfying but arrives via steady accumulation more than a felt crucible moment.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—exposing the city’s engineered lies—is clear and present early, and the discovery of the box is a solid tightening beat. However, the retrieval itself is almost frictionless, and there is little sense of immediate risk (physical, legal, or relational) opposing the protagonist. The confrontation with the engineer is quiet and cooperative, more reflective than conflictual, so the pressure profile remains gentle. As a result, escalation feels more intellectual than suspenseful, limiting impact at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving ancient methods and proving worthy of the secret weavers’ trust—is clear and present. Escalation is subtle but discernible: the resistant splice, the need to hum and “let the harbor rock” to ease it, and the test with fir seeds all deepen the sense that this vigil must earn something. Agency is quiet but real: the narrator chooses patience over force, chooses to translate and then to apply the lessons to living seeds. The cost and risk feel mostly conceptual rather than viscerally pressing, so tension reads as strong for a lyric piece but not maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—can her living loss be made livable?—is signaled early and kept tight. Pressure deepens meaningfully when the narrator crosses the “bridge of presence” to confront the man and learns he has “died to the shape that confounded him,” which complicates any simple blame and makes the explanation harder. The cost manifests in both their positions: his self-exile in pursuit of breathable life, her acceptance that he may never return but can be re-held differently. It’s a quiet escalation rather than a sharp reversal, so the tension is more meditative than taut, but it remains coherent and steadily intensifies.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the prince can midwife a new, non-mechanical form of life and thereby reorient his world’s trajectory—is clear and present early. Escalation comes through the construction of the cradle, the deepening attunement between palace and egg, and the storm-night test that culminates in Dawnspoke’s emergence and the prince’s public renunciation of conquest. Agency is strong at key points (rescue of the egg, cradle assembly, offering the wind, declaring caretaking), and consequences are visible in the altered behavior of mills, engineers, and palace. However, antagonistic pressure is mostly abstract or atmospheric; no character or system meaningfully pushes back on his project, so the conflict never quite tightens into genuine risk.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—whether she can transform inherited fire into a practice of healing and prove scars can “sing”—is clear and threads through each beat. Pressure deepens at the lagoon as she invokes her father, includes the boy, and literalizes “grafting” with the seedling and thread, narrowing her stance toward this gentler, slower response to danger. The conflict is primarily internal and ethical rather than event-driven; it escalates via density and resonance more than through explicit reversals. The piece could reach higher if one choice visibly foreclosed a tempting alternative (e.g., harsher response to the boy) on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring names/memories without destructive flooding—is clear, and it tightens meaningfully when the broker offers tankers and “easy relief.” That encounter is the main escalation, forcing Ilias to choose between speed and fidelity to the woman’s counsel, with some conceptual cost. The geese’s pause and return provide a quiet temporal pressure that informs his waiting, though tension remains mostly low-key and philosophical. Overall, conflict is thoughtful and coherent but never quite reaches a sharp, gut-level pinch.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether destructive, inherited “fire” will be replaced by non-devouring light—is clear and sharpened once the travelers arrive with heat and expectation of torches. Escalation comes through the demonstration sequence (petal-rain, sonar, confession, gear transfer) which slowly reweights their assumptions. The cost is more implied than felt: we sense lifelong vigilance and emotional labor in the narrator’s role, but no acute on-page sacrifice or jeopardy forces a wrenching trade-off. As a result, tension is steady and thoughtful rather than gripping at a level top venues often require.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the narrator can hold others’ grief without hardening—is clear, and the arrival of the father at dusk tightens it beautifully. Escalation is quiet but real: initial solitary ritual → shared poem selection with the father → storm that threatens the sanctuary → ongoing accumulation of stones and spectral corrections → timed completion as the migration ends. The cost is primarily internal and conceptual (accepting endless work, living within grief’s movement rather than closure), which fits the mode but may feel low-pressure to readers expecting a sharper external test. Still, the father’s repeated visits and the narrator’s deliberate adjustment of her carving style under his gaze and her mother’s corrections give the climax genuine weight.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—repairing the fracture between precise timekeeping and communal/elemental rhythm—is clearly established and tightened by the decision to halt the pendulum at apex. Pressure deepens as the pause stretches “thin as hot wire,” forcing simultaneous mechanical triage and moral inventory; the risk of misalignment or failure is palpable even without overt catastrophe. The key turn is internal but concrete: moving from control via screws and oil to sharing agency with the fisherman through carving and coordinated launch. The conflict is mostly interior and quietly resolved, but the ethical calculus and the relinquishing of unilateral authority feel credibly costly.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—uncovering the truth and “the shape of intentions” behind a missing grave—is clear and escalates from abstract listening to concrete discovery and ethical implication. The main tightening occurs when the tapestry reveals a missing grave and he chooses to disturb the asters and the earth, then to follow the map to the poplar, culminating in his decision to honor the truth with a new marker and planned poppies. Pressure is mostly contemplative rather than sharply oppositional; the cost is felt but gentle, so the conflict never quite bites as hard as it could at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central conflict—how to “seed innovation within a constraint” without flooding or ossifying the city—is clear and threads the whole piece. Pressure deepens as the narrator moves from abstract modeling to naming fears of greed and exclusion, then building in remedies (stewardship, rituals, tide school) rather than abandoning the project. The decisive hinge/canal choice forecloses the seductive extremes of tower or burrow and accepts the risk of misuse, which is a credible cost. Escalation is contemplative rather than nail-tightening, so tension is high-grade but not maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—rekindling story through dust and sound—is clear, and pressure deepens when the pirate broadcast arrives, begins to change the physical space, and finally asks for “payment in kind.” The key tightening is her choice to answer Cinder’s request and accept an ongoing duty, which reweights her work from private coping to communal stewardship. However, the conflict remains mostly gentle and one-sided; there’s little resistance or risk beyond implied exhaustion and secrecy, keeping escalation in the strong-but-quiet range.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether and how to expose family danger without naming it—is clear and sharpened by the need for the mother’s tacit consent. Escalation is mostly internal and textural (from private kit and letters to public gallery and spectral rocking), but there is a real tightening when visitors arrive and start projecting their own ghosts, proving the piece’s risk. The final beat, where the chair rocks “from a draft that no one can find,” crystallizes both the danger and the cost of making it visible while still survivable. The only limit is that explicit pushback or resistance never surfaces on-page, keeping conflict intense but psychologically rather than dramatically pitched.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—preventing the lower quarters from flooding while resisting the factions’ uses for the cog—is clear by the midpoint and tightens with the ticking noon deadline. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: choosing not to stall in “agonizing,” coercing them to follow, and physically repairing the sluice. The cost is modest but legible: risking their credibility, refusing all three power blocs, and keeping the cog as method instead of trading it for safety or influence. Conflict between rational method and ideological narratives is well interwoven with the immediate physical danger.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether this fractured group can inhabit genuine harmony rather than inherited hostility—is clear and steadily pressured. Escalation is subtle but present: initial wariness, visible tension between Rafi and Ola, the tentative trust around the rosette, and finally the high-exposure performance before skeptical families. The rosette catch and offering are the key tightening beat, where interpersonal risk and possible rejection focus. Costs are implied more than dramatized; we feel the years of injuries and the risk of failure, but no single consequential failure or loss is staged on-page, keeping the tension strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether healing through memory-food can emerge under a regime that forbids it—is clear and thematically potent. Pressure escalates via the planting/pruning sequence and the illegal soup gathering, with the ordinance and omen framing the act as a risk. However, conflict is mostly internal and conceptual; no concrete counter-force ever appears on the page to test this rebellion in a scene-level way. The result is strong but somewhat gentle tension, aligned with the stated “gentle rebellion” yet stopping short of sharper, visceral jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring the drone hives and, by extension, the city’s ecological and civic rhythm—is clear and escalates once Mara appears and the hidden box becomes relevant. The key tightening is the choice to reveal the tray/box and climb, folding the narrator’s ritual/wonder ethic into the practical crisis. However, opposition is mostly implicit (urgency, forgetfulness, the city’s desire for “comfort of repeating”) rather than personified or sharply obstructive. As a result, tension is more conceptual than visceral, holding the piece below top-tier pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes are quiet but legible: the narrator’s need to distinguish living from dead houses and to avoid misreading them. Pressure escalates texturally via the sequence of houses: a receptive first, a resistant second, then a third that actively “speaks” and forces a reconfiguration of understanding. However, the narrator is rarely forced into a difficult trade-off or visible loss; their agency is attentive rather than embattled, so the sense of cost remains mostly abstract. This is strong accumulative deepening, but not yet at a level where tension feels inescapable.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—the ethical choice between numbing certainty and delayed, nuance-preserving response—is clearly signaled and tightened by the scholar’s recoil and renewed certainty. Escalation is subtle but present: once Oris decides to act on the ampoule, each step (threading, passing through the founder, breaking the tip) commits more deeply to re-infusing the city with hesitation. However, the pressure rarely feels risky or dangerous in a concrete way; success seems likely, and the ethical cost is more intellectual than painful in-scene. This keeps the conflict from achieving the knife-edge sharpness that would push it into the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—what to do with the missed opportunity and its charged memory—is clear early and tightened by the rupture, which offers a concrete chance to re-enter or flatten the moment. The refusal to step through and the decision to “start shaping the corridor into a remembering instrument” is an earned stasis/renunciation with conceptual cost: the narrator knowingly forgoes an apparent escape. Pressure escalates texturally via increasingly intense metaphors (gaps, hunger, the crack), though stakes remain primarily internal and abstract. Because the conflict is so interior and lyric, the sense of narrowing options is strong but not quite razor-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether kindness leaves a trace and whether Lina’s practice matters—is clear early and deepens when her insomnia and doubt are invoked. Escalation is quiet but present: from stalled canvas and private experiment to the city’s collective response embodied in the neighbor and the map. Her agency is mostly endurance and attention rather than a sharp dilemma, but the choice to keep painting in this charged, quasi-ritual way despite doubt is reaffirmed at the end. The lack of a more pointed on-page trade-off or loss keeps the pressure from fully peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether these people’s crafts and names will survive erasure as anything but dead exhibits—emerges early and tightens through the lens’s selective power and the community’s dependence on the narrator’s choices. The bread ritual is a strong escalation, turning curation into an embodied, risky act, and the waterfall scene makes the vow to remember another person a concrete sacrifice. The late arrival of the stranger and truth about the beekeeper resolves the murder-rumor somewhat gently, but it still deepens the emotional field rather than deflating pressure. Conflict remains primarily cultural and ethical rather than peril-driven, yet the cost in burden, grief, and responsibility is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—whether to step beyond fate’s design or remain bound to human and temporal constraints—is signaled early and steadily tightened. Escalation comes through the unlocking of the yoyo, the stone’s radiance, and especially the vision of alternate threads, which make both reward and collateral damage (the keeper’s death) concrete. The final choice is a genuine trade-off between transcendence and relational/ethical responsibility, not a foregone conclusion. The only mild limitation is that external opposition is almost entirely metaphysical, but the internal conflict remains strong enough to carry the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—wresting a weakness from fear to secure the narrator’s existence—emerges clearly and tightens as they move from threshold to the paradox-writing to calling fear out. The funhouse mirrors, cursed photography, and paradox dictionary meaningfully deepen conflict rather than being lateral ornament, and the confrontation with the shadow-fear is a concrete pressure point. The protagonist’s agency drives the key turns (writing the paradox, voicing their core fear, choosing not to blink during the flash). The main limitation is that the physical or emotional price they might pay if they fail never feels fully teeth-bared, so escalation reads intense but not quite harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—keeping the orchard afloat through the gale—is clear from early cloud-reading and tightens through the storm’s mounting “mouth” and the sudden knife-net threat. Escalation proceeds through distinct turns (anticipation → first contact and beam-drone → tower of crates → knife-net hazard), all solved by variants of the protagonist’s core tactic. The protagonist’s agency is central, but the conflicts resolve without visible loss or significant compromise; the transformations work almost too smoothly. As a result, tension is strong but never harrowing, and the cost of success feels more conceptual than viscerally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—seeking an answer from the watchers about their gaze and the mother’s fate, under the pressure of a starving city—is signaled early and coherently maintained. Escalation is clear: from setting off, to the crack/tag, to the ledger’s revelation, to the watchers’ corridor that literalizes the cost of questioning. The main tightening is internal but consequential: she could retreat and warn the city, yet chooses instead to be measured, sacrificing that option. The stakes remain more existential than visceral, but they are legible and scaled appropriately to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether to exhume painful truth or accept inherited noble lies—is clear and signaled early. Pressure deepens as the narrator uncovers evidence (especially the “shipments/passengers” correction) and realizes the stationmaster’s complicity and partial resistance. The final choice to publish and to frame the stationmaster with nuance constitutes an Earned Stasis: a firm stance that forecloses the path of silence or accusatory simplification. Still, escalation remains mostly contemplative; there’s little external resistance or concrete price beyond anticipated grief.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    The conflict is quiet but real: his desire to act on a drowned past without violating its integrity, resolved as an ethic of hidden witnessing rather than overt restoration. There is some tightening—the move from exterior survey to interior underrooms to “deepest room” and finally to the last slip and marked waterline—but the pressure never sharpens into a painful on-page tradeoff. Still, the endurance choice (“I do not wait for rescue or recognition”) and commitment to keep returning constitutes an Earned Stasis with cost in solitude and anonymity. A more acute test of his method or belief would raise stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the official narrative of the flood is true—is clearly signaled and deepens as documents contradict one another. There is a meaningful tightening when the registrar’s margin note reframes the flood as deliberate “lowering,” and Ossa’s decision to stamp and track these origins crystallizes her stance. However, pressure remains largely intellectual; no external counterforce or immediate risk sharpens her choices beyond the abstract danger of knowledge. The final act of hiding the stamp is a form of earned stasis, but the price of that stance could be more concretely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how he can reconfigure his relationship with the lost shadow/grief—is clear and present from early on. Pressure escalates through deepening rather than reversal: first through the childhood vision and rupture, then through the painstaking crane-making, and finally in the offering scene where the shadow actually manifests. The cost is that the shadow does not fully return, only loosens its hold on his life, which is a credible, bittersweet resolution. The escalation is more contemplative than sharp, so the sense of narrowing options is felt but not intense.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake is the narrator’s attempt to locate and interpret “unused potential” without becoming complicit or emotionally annihilated, signaled early and carried through. Escalation is subtle and textural—shifts in breaker cooling time, sky color, and the geode’s pain culminate in the moth-colored light sequence and the appearance of the “basin,” which forces her to act (running the sequence, sending coordinates, vowing to remain awake). The pressure is primarily internal and ethical rather than confrontational; no direct antagonist appears, but the commander’s expectations and the war-machine context supply implied opposition. Because the external consequences remain offstage, the stakes, while resonant, stay slightly more abstract than they might under a more dramatized test.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—finding or tuning a sense of belonging—appears early and is consistently pressured by the reappearance of “missing pieces” in maps and printouts. There is a clear deepening when the blanks are reinterpreted from errors to rests and the algorithm is adjusted, which narrows options conceptually and unlocks the final inscription. However, the conflict remains mostly contemplative; there’s little sense that failure would cost them anything beyond continuing alienation, and no moment where a genuine alternative path is foreclosed on the page. The escalation is effective for lyric fiction but stops short of a truly bracing test.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether he will face and expose the truth of his forgery to Mara and the city—is clear early and tightens through the walk to the beach and the slow sift through driftwood. Escalation is primarily knowledge- and conscience-driven: the sequence of planks culminating in the shared surname and Abel’s heroism narrows his options until confession is unavoidable. The final choices (abandoning the forged planks, burning the archives but keeping one page, agreeing to republish true names) carry palpable moral and relational cost. Conflict remains quiet and internal, but tension is sustained at the sentence and scene level.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—conducting the exchange without reigniting hostilities while salvaging some future gentleness—is established early and sustained. Tension meaningfully escalates when the second trade snags on misremembered raids and the soldiers’ breath-holding tightens the space. The narrator’s choice to reframe the conflict via the drawer pull and shared history is the key turn, resolving a live risk of breakdown. The conflict remains relatively contained and quiet, but that deliberate narrowness fits the story’s scale.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether he will remain paralyzed by regret or risk acting as a navigator again—is clear and sharpened when the boy appears. Pressure escalates coherently as his internal fear of failure collides with the external need to free an aground boat before the tide drops further. The choice to help, to take the boy aboard, and to guide the father back into the channel are all agentive and tied to his deepest wound. The external danger is fairly contained (no acute life-or-death crisis), slightly softening the sense of irreversibility, but cost and narrowing options still register.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—what the protagonist will do with his partially erased guilt and capacity for empathy—is clear from early on and tightens through the descent. Pressure escalates at the baseball test and confession, where he risks his remaining self-image and confronts his complicity in hollowing out the city’s empathy. The final fork (leave “with cleaner hands” vs. stay and keep paddling others across) is a genuine trade-off with felt cost, not a free redemption. Conflict is largely internal and philosophical but remains grounded in concrete, time-pressured choices.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—reforging a bond with Mira versus the cost of metamorphosis—is clear early and tightens as the price becomes the narrator’s own transformation. The key turn occurs when the orchard articulates a price and the narrator recognizes their metamorphosis as the coin, leading to the choice to “let her in.” Internal and external pressures (Mira’s half-formed presence, the beasts as witnesses, the orchard’s arithmetic of grief) are well braided. The escalation is more deepening than reversing, but the final decision forecloses the path of remaining unchanged with a visible loss of “plain speech” and prior solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—atoning for time lost to motherhood’s overwhelm—is clear early and steadily intensifies as she moves from abstract guilt to naming specific missed gestures. Escalation functions via deepening rather than reversals: reaching the chamber of stalled seconds, then having to place a card on each mote and confess a concrete failing, meaningfully raises the emotional cost. Her agency drives the key beats: deciding to make the pilgrimage, to perform each confession, and finally to accept perpetual perplexity instead of demanding reassurance. The conflict is primarily internal and lyric, so tension is more atmospheric than suspenseful, but it remains coherent and tightening under that lens.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—opening the locked dimension by achieving an emotional-weight balance—is clear and escalates through increasingly demanding inner work and a timed-feeling lock test. Pressure builds as miscalibration threatens closure ("If I floated too far...if I sank..."), and the choice to lean with "forgiving weight" instead of wrenching is a meaningful, thematically charged resolution. The stakes remain more metaphysical than visceral, which softens felt jeopardy slightly but not fatally.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—protecting the village from a dangerous eruption or at least its panic—is clear and translated into a concrete tactic: transforming prophecy and fear into a calm, rehearsed evacuation. Pressure escalates as more people are drawn by the light, the volcanologist confirms the mountain is “practicing restraint,” and the story moves from private arranging to communal choreography just in time for the mountain’s sideways exhale. Agency is quiet but present: Mara chooses to listen more than push, to line the safe ridge instead of seeking spectacle, and to free the bugs at the end. What keeps this from the top band is that tension stays consistently low-key; the risk never quite bites on the page beyond implication.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—remaking the fort from blinding spectacle to listening hearth—is clear and thematically strong. There is one main tightening when Captain Rhun appears in the doorway, but his challenge is brief and yields quickly, so the pressure never quite bites. The protagonists meet no serious setbacks; their competence and the blackout smooth the path, leaving cost largely implied rather than dramatized. As a result, escalation feels more like steady progress through a plan than a genuine testing of resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—rescuing the brother without losing him again—arrives early and tightens steadily as the costs of manipulating the corridor emerge. The meaningful turn is the revelation that to keep him, the herder must take his place, forcing a rescue-vs-sacrifice calculus. Agency is sharp: the narrator chooses to accept becoming part of the patterns, the herder chooses to go, and those choices foreclose alternatives. Internal and external pressures interlock so that the emotional and magical stakes escalate together.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—daring to confront and read the city’s and the poet’s own scars—is clear and deepens as the caretaker reveals the teacher’s history and the map’s implications. Escalation is mostly conceptual and emotional rather than situational, with the key tightening coming when the poet’s scar aligns with the constellation path. There is agency in choosing to start/stop the timer and in voicing forbidden poems, but no hard trade-off or visible loss beyond interior cost. The pressure is coherent, but for an elite market it remains on the gentle side of crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central pressure—can they extract and then choose to use the encoded destination without the courier—is sharpened by Rook’s arrival and the physical duel, giving a satisfying because/therefore escalation. The duel, Rook’s attempt to lunge at the gate, and the narrator’s block form a clear tightening of options leading to the choice to enter. The cost is conceptual rather than visceral, which suits the piece but softens the sense of risk on the page. Overall, conflict is coherent and escalates once in a meaningful way, but remains more elegant than harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stakes—saving/rebuilding the outlaw library and seeding a “blooming resistance” before the narrator’s next molt—are signaled clearly and followed through. There is a real deepening when strangers begin to arrive and the map’s pattern reveals a wider field of repression, turning a private project into communal action. However, escalation is more in density and radiance than in narrowing options or visible costs; nothing truly threatens to stop them on the page once they begin. The result is emotionally potent but low-suspense, with conflict that remains mostly conceptual and atmospheric rather than sharply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central stake—whether he can nudge fate’s schedule—arrives early and tightens as he climbs, chooses to perform, and discovers that the last train is held. The key escalation beat is the announcement that the final train is delayed, confirming that his encore has actually interfered with the timetable. Conflict is primarily internal and situational instead of adversarial, yet the tension between timetables and improvisation is sustained and sharpened. The on-page price remains modest (no catastrophe or personal ruin), which keeps pressure strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—preventing the island’s collective memory from “bleaching” before the monsoon—registers early, and pressure ratchets cleanly as the bruise of rain nears and the island “grows evasive.” The key tightening is the discovery of the listening hollow and the decision to plant now, under time pressure, testing the narrator’s luminous doubt against imminent erasure. The cost is primarily conceptual and vocational (redefining the narrator’s role, accepting provisional truth-curation) rather than visceral, which fits the mode but keeps the stakes slightly airy. Still, the conflict between fallible myth-keeping and catastrophic forgetting feels coherent and escalates enough for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central stake—whether the narrator will continue to live inside unspoken regret or risk changing by voicing apology—is clear and sharpened by the compass/lace instructions. Pressure escalates as they obey the ritual, arrive at the cove where they failed before, and must decide whether to finally speak. The decision to speak “not to summon forgiveness, but to find the color” and to alter their teaching approach is a credible, costly shift. The conflict remains primarily internal and quiet, so the sense of jeopardy never becomes intense, but for this mode it’s sufficiently tight.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Pressure is primarily internal and intellectual, fitting the Accumulative/Textural lens. The tightening occurs as Mara rejects the "drama" of the storm in favor of "quiet decay," a choice that narrows her future tactics. While the arrival of neighbors dissipates some immediate physical isolation, the internal stakes regarding her work remain taut and resolve clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.1)
    The stakes are clear and personal, balancing physical survival against artistic integrity and reputation. The escalation moves cleanly from the memory of the attack to the decision of exposure, though the lack of an on-page antagonist lowers the immediate pressure, relying heavily on the memory of the threat rather than an active confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=3.9)
    Tension is virtually absent from the scene itself; the audience arrives, the machine works perfectly, and everyone leaves satisfied. The only friction occurs in the flashback summary of the "wrong readings," meaning the protagonist faces no resistance or risk of failure in the dramatized moment. Without a tightening of options or a live test of the protagonist's skills, the stakes feel theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.0)
    Pressure escalates cleanly from the initial arrival of the package to the physical manifestation of "chased stillness." The climax turns on a decisive risk—ignoring the manual's warning about storms—driven by the protagonist's specific trait. The resolution is not a battle won by force, but a reconfiguration of the rules of engagement, satisfying the "rest" stake with a tangible price.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the stakes of survival are clear, the central conflict dissolves due to external circumstances (the changing season) rather than protagonist agency. The tension dissipates rather than snapping through a decisive on-page choice, resulting in low causal payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=3.7)
    Stakes remain abstract ("where the remainder goes") and face no concrete opposition; the "memory that tries to hide" surrenders immediately to the breath technique. The arrival of the stranger acts as a thematic validation rather than a test or complication, resulting in a flat trajectory without escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.9)
    Emotional stakes are high and clearly defined around the processing of grief, escalating effectively as the memories of the fire become more intrusive. While the external pressure is somewhat abstract, the internal cost is paid visibly in the final image where the protagonist accepts the transience of the "continual photograph."

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.2)
    The conflict with the enforcers provides necessary external pressure but is resolved too easily via the arrow/gear interaction, lacking a sense of visceral risk or sacrifice. The escalation feels slightly mechanical, serving to move the plot forward rather than truly testing the protagonist's limits or forcing a difficult trade-off. The "cost" is largely conceptual (labor/duty) rather than immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.4)
    Conflict is largely retrospective and conceptual; the antagonist is a past memory rather than a present force. The resolution comes through a ritualistic success without significant on-page resistance or the possibility of failure, keeping the narrative tension low.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.4)
    Conflict is low-voltage; the protagonist faces no active antagonism or difficult trade-offs until the final moment, and even then, the choice is immediate. The pressure is atmospheric rather than causal. While the resolution provides a sense of completion, the lack of escalating opposition limits the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is minimal; Arlen faces no significant opposition from the cold, the glass, or his own limitations, succeeding in every task with smooth competence. The escalation is purely procedural, lacking a moment where failure feels like a genuine possibility to test his resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.4)
    Tension escalates effectively through the puzzle sequence, leveraging the narrator's fears against the need for answers. The stakes (identity, safety) are high, though the "men with knives" remain abstract, and the conflict dissolves somewhat too easily into a cooperative planning session at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.3)
    The external conflict (burn vs. save) is established clearly but dissolves somewhat softly through shared epiphany rather than active struggle or escalating cost. While the stakes are high, the courier’s rapid capitulation reduces the tension of the inciting threat.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    Pressure accumulates steadily through the loops, shifting from observation to interaction to synthesis. While the stakes are internal (understanding vs. erasing), the progression is distinct and the cost—a commitment to the eternal "yesterday"—is legible. The ending achieves a Charged Poise, balancing the monotony of the task with the miracle of attention.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.2)
    The central conflict is clearly defined (curator vs. troupe), but the escalation is dampened by the ease of the resolution. The opposing forces offer no resistance to the truth, and the "mistrust" dissolves too smoothly, robbing the climax of genuine tension or high stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.9)
    The conflict is clear and the stakes (authenticity vs. luck) are well-defined. However, the escalation is somewhat gentle; the "pressure" of the maze is resolved by a single moment of honesty without deeper complicating obstacles. The cost is paid in pride ("penance"), which works for the tone but limits tension.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.1)
    Pressure builds coherently through the mystery and the physical danger of the "surge tides." While the resolution is driven by competence, the lack of a sharper, more costly antagonist or a moment of potential failure keeps the stakes slightly lower than the highest band. The cost is largely internal and atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clearly articulated ("obedience means not disturbing sound, disobedience means drowning again") and escalate appropriately as the protagonist moves from the pit to the dangerous under-stage. The tension is palpable, though the conflict is more atmospheric than interpersonal, fitting the ghost story genre.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Pressure escalates effectively from the accidental smudge to the deliberate exposure of the lie. The stakes are internal but rendered physically urgent through the balance test in the wind, leading to a felt release at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are deeply personal and escalate clearly through the tactile interaction with the valve. The tension shifts from the supernatural "ghost shift" possibility to the crushing reality of industrial murder-by-negligence. The cost is felt in the weight the narrator carries out—a burden of truth that offers no comfort.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    The conflict is primarily situational (Man vs. Nature/Entropy), which fits the "witness" theme but limits dramatic escalation. The "tightening" occurs when the river rises and the swan dictates the burrowing, but the resolution comes relatively easily once the magical room is reached. The cost is somewhat abstract ("judgments loosen like old laces") rather than a visceral or irreversible price paid on the page, keeping this from the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are low and predominantly thematic; while Ada's grief provides texture, the narrator faces no significant obstacle or potential for failure. The conflict is resolved through a gentle, adaptive process that feels more like a successful procedure than a dramatic struggle with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.0)
    Conflict is largely abstract—the historian versus silence/entropy—lacking immediate narrative pressure or opposition. There is no tangible threat forcing the protagonist's hand until the final realization, and the stakes remain philosophical rather than viscerally felt. The "terror" of the walls is described but does not imperil the protagonist directly.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.0)
    The escalation is present—the narrator breaks the town's stasis—but the conflict is almost entirely conceptual, lacking an active antagonist or significant immediate risk. The protagonist faces no resistance from the Keeper or the environment, making the "tightening" feel inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.5)
    Pressure is linear; Ilario applies his methods until they work without facing a moment of genuine failure or reversal. The stakes (neighborhood stability) are high, but the protagonist's path to victory is too smooth, lacking the friction or sacrifice required for higher tension.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.0)
    Pressure escalates effectively through the layering of environmental responses (wind, ice, sirens) under the Textural lens. While the stakes remain primarily internal and aesthetic, the tension between the silence and the "unheard symphony" tightens perceptibly until the dawn forces the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.9)
    The stakes are high—breaking a cycle of eternal recurrence—and the cost is the loss of the protagonist's "gravity defier" identity. The escalation through the visual timelines raises the pressure effectively before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.3)
    The stakes are internal and clear, but the external pressure is low; Oko is a willing facilitator, and the "surgery" proceeds without snag or failure. The "cost" of the transformation is emotional vulnerability ("grief without speech"), which fits the lyric mode but lacks a sharp, foreclosing trade-off. The escalation relies on the intensity of the imagery rather than rising narrative friction.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are clear (integrity of truth vs. authoritarian control), and the tension escalates with the watcher's entry. However, the conflict resolution lacks visceral pressure; the antagonist accepts the protagonist's nod and fails to react to the "lateral" movement, making the escape feel too easy. The "cost" is largely abstract (loss of solitude) rather than an immediate tactical trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure accumulates effectively through the dual anticipation of the flower's bloom and the opening of the vial. The internal cost—the painful confrontation with the "absent smell"—is legible and pays off the buildup, though the external stakes regarding the lantern delivery remain low.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes remain intellectual and symbolic throughout. The "fear" of the final layer is stated but resolved instantly with a "warmth of consent," lacking the friction of a true dilemma. The cost of "forgiving the version of me" is asserted rather than dramatized through struggle or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is muted; the "chronic hush" acts as a passive condition rather than an active force of opposition, resulting in a ritual that proceeds without significant risk or obstacle. There is no moment where the narrator's goal is genuinely threatened, leading to a linear progression lacking a distinct tightening or reversal. The stakes remain theoretical and atmospheric rather than immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    Internal stakes are high and effectively dramatized through the physical manifestation of "nerves bright enough" to crackle. While the external conflict is quiet, the tension builds coherently under the Accumulative lens until the shared spark marks a decisive shift in the client's state.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=2.4)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; stated risks ("recognition can be risky") never manifest in scene. The project succeeds immediately, the mystery is solved by midnight, and the climax is a frictionless speech, resulting in zero felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.4)
    Conflict is mild; the town cooperates immediately, and the search for the tag faces no significant opposition or failure states. The resolution relies on a shared realization without a visible trade-off or high-stakes cost, making the victory feel somewhat inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are high and tangible within the scope of the story; the tension comes from the environmental pressure (the giant's breath) and the metaphysical cost of the magic. The escalation is steady, moving from observation to active interference, culminating in a moment of choice ("uncage") that carries visible weight.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.7)
    The stakes remain largely philosophical ("coherence" vs. "ambiguous loss") with low immediate pressure. The central conflict is resolved through an internal epiphany rather than a forced trade-off or external consequence, making the narrative feel more like a meditation than a story with urgent drive.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.1)
    The stakes are relatively low and the pressure is gentle; the "outage" conveniently lowers the barrier for the magic to work rather than complicating the protagonist's task. The resolution feels inevitable rather than hard-won, as the obstacle (finding the book) is solved instantly by the tape revealing a location the protagonist already knows.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict dissipates rather than resolves; the opposition (the storm and the plants' wildness) capitulates instantly once Mara changes her mindset. The lack of a "bad outcome" or sacrifice—no plants die, the town applauds her—renders the stakes theoretical rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.0)
    The conflict is low-friction; the keeper, the island, and the ghost all cooperate immediately without testing the protagonist's resolve. While the final exchange (gnat for warmth) implies a cost, the negotiation is effortless, making the stakes feel more decorative than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are stated but the on-page conflict is minimal; the guide's primary action (reaching to stop the pearl) is blocked by "unseen forces" rather than a character-driven complication. This renders the protagonist an observer of the climax rather than an active participant, lowering the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.7)
    The stakes of cultural amnesia and personal erasure are clear, but the on-page conflict is low-resistance as the woman and narrator align immediately in their goal. The escalation is rhythmic and atmospheric rather than oppositional, which fits the mode but limits the palpable tension of the "tightening" beat. The resolution relies on a refinement of method rather than a forcing of difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is largely internal and symbolic, with external pressures (the conductor, the mouth) yielding instantly to the protagonist's actions. The stakes are high in concept but low in execution, as the protagonist faces no genuine dilemma or difficult trade-off to achieve the goal.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes remain low because the conflict between reason and magic is not vigorously tested; the magic simply works, bypassing the need for a difficult decision. The resolution comes through external supernatural alignment rather than a high-cost human trade-off, making the "courage" feels asserted rather than demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clearly signaled—the desire to move past stasis—but the external pressure remains largely atmospheric. The "spatial mutiny" is intellectualized as a "union strike," a witty metaphor that unfortunately deflates the tension of the "cursed" artifact by recasting cosmic danger as a labor dispute. The cost is paid in memories and grudges, but the payment feels like a declared toll rather than a forced sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are immediate and life-altering, with pressure escalating naturally through the director’s intrusion. The tension is palpable, though the resolution relies slightly on the "open gate" routine rather than a forced tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes—preserving the town's memory against entropy—are clear, and the weakening hum introduces a subtle tightening of pressure. However, the conflict remains largely internal and abstract; the protagonist endures rather than confronting a sharp, active opposition on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    Tension escalates cleanly from the initial whisper to the physical confrontation. The stakes are raised not by loud threats but by the quiet, high-pressure exchange of knowledge. The cost is legible: by giving up the label, he trades the possibility of legal resurrection for the power of haunting, a trade-off that feels earned and significant.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.7)
    The stakes are largely metaphorical ("tide drags the answer away") and lack visceral urgency or potential for loss. The conflict is resolved through cooperation with a manifested entity rather than a high-stakes decision or trade-off. The tension dissipates gently rather than snapping shut with narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clearly established as the loss of home and culture. The escalation involving the VIP fences and the liaison is strong, though the antagonist's capitulation to the "numbers" immediately after the city shifts feels slightly rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clearly established (funding/preservation vs. erasure) and escalated via the visual countdown of the colored flames. The pressure is coherent and rises naturally with the approaching dawn. The resolution offers a successful outcome (proof obtained) balanced by the felt conceptual cost of the moment's transience.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.7)
    The stakes are clear (maiden voyage coupling), and the fog provides functional pressure. The escalation is linear, and the resolution comes too easily via a quick patch and a new water bowl, lacking a visceral sense of risk or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are intellectual and atmospheric rather than visceral; the environment "whines" but yields easily to the protagonist's actions. The conflict lacks a moment of genuine doubt or a high-cost trade-off, reading more as a procedural execution of a ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.4)
    The conflict is primarily conceptual (sound vs. silence) rather than interpersonal or internal; the town offers no genuine opposition to the tuner's efforts. The mother's "wariness" evaporates almost instantly, and the "arguments" that broke the town are relegated to backstory. Escalation is present in the increasing number of participants, but the stakes feel low because success appears guaranteed once the ritual begins.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are clear (crew survival, dwindling air) and pressure escalates appropriately through the environment. The resolution of the panic beat, however, is dampened by the repetitive use of the "instinct" phrase, which simplifies the struggle into a momentary reset rather than an escalating complication.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.0)
    The approaching boat creates effective situational pressure that forces the protagonist to act. However, the ambiguity surrounding the "bodies/answers" softens the specific stakes of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clear and personal, balancing the waking of the orchard against the loss of the guide. The "Trader" beat provides a necessary, if brief, external test of the protagonist's commitment, reinforcing the choice to value the "unbroken quiet" over commerce.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.1)
    Conflict is low-tension; the "forbidden" labyrinth yields immediately to the protagonist's skills ("wall loosens a breath") without pushing back. The stakes are declared ("salvage or surrender") but the obstacle is overcome with a single ritual action, lacking a sense of genuine danger or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=3.4)
    Pressure is minimal throughout; the protagonist faces no resistance from the environment, Sami, or the task. The repair process is smooth, lacking the friction, trade-offs, or narrowing of options required to generate dramatic stakes or earn the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are clearly defined (a letter must be named to be safe) but the pressure feels low and atmospheric rather than urgent. The obstacle is internal perfectionism ("test names the way dentists test nerves") rather than external opposition. The resolution arrives via environmental serendipity (the music) rather than a hard choice that costs the protagonist something concrete on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.7)
    Tension is maintained through atmosphere and the "ticking" of the heavens, but the protagonist's competence is never truly tested by the antagonist forces. The stakes (the coup) are high but distant, and the personal cost (blame) is accepted too easily to generate peak dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes are personal and legible: the integrity of a relationship versus the safety of emotional withdrawal. The escalation is largely internal and atmospheric, deepening the memory rather than forcing external clashes, which fits the lyric mode well. The cost—the shame of the "hoarded tenderness"—is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the stakes of peace and health are clear, the conflict dissolves without a meaningful trade-off or escalation. The "guards" mentioned are absent from the interaction, and the deep-seated enmity melts instantly upon seeing a child's drawing, rendering the pressure low and the victory unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.0)
    Tension is low; the dominant stake ("rediscovering joy") remains abstract and faces little genuine opposition. The complication of the damaged film is solved immediately by the collective without a visible trade-off or cost, resulting in a smooth procession rather than a pressured escalation. The story lacks a moment where failure feels possible.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.8)
    Tension is coherent and escalates through the interrogation of the mural's layers, shifting from technical challenges to existential vulnerability. While the external antagonist (the curator) is off-page, the immediate pressure of the wall's "questions" forces a stance crystallization that carries genuine emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clearly established through the "audit towers" and the threat to the permits, creating coherent pressure. The escalation works well, though the climax pivots on a legal trick that, while clever, resolves the conflict with intellectual satisfaction rather than a heavy visceral price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=3.2)
    Escalation is virtually absent; the protagonist waits, performs a ritual, and succeeds without adapting tactics or facing genuine setbacks. The mentioned "doubts" are immediately smoothed over by "reef-shadow joy," leaving the stakes abstract and untested by concrete narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure is consistent but low-stakes; the conflict is primarily man-vs-entropy without active opposition. While the "heartbeat falters" suggests internal difficulty, the obstacle is overcome through procedural competence rather than a painful trade-off or high-risk decision, limiting dynamic range.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake of restoring trust is clear and escalates through the ritual, but the external danger (the "perilous tonic" or "awakening") remains largely theoretical in this scene. The resolution relies on a smooth emotional pivot rather than a sharp, costly trade-off, though the "confessing doubts" clause adds necessary weight.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are declared high ("water must flow," "rock must sleep") but face no on-page resistance; the Council and guilds capitulate immediately to the narrator's solution. The "forbidden love" discovery acts as a magic key that removes all opposition rather than escalating the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are well-defined: the preservation of art and the personal risk of trust. The tightening of the screw via the bookseller's announcement provides necessary external pressure to force the protagonist's hand. The cost is felt in the final release of the "mars stone" counterweight, a tangible sacrifice of safety.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clearly established as a tension between the hunger for connection and the father's philosophy of distance. The climax resolves this tension with a visible cost—the refusal to descend—which effectively escalates the emotional pressure into a lasting thematic stance.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are established ("rip tides," "uninvited hopes") but feel low in the moment because the environment offers immediate consent rather than resistance. The "sentinel algorithm" is bypassed with a single shared exhale, and the protagonists leave with their key item safe, resulting in negligible tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.4)
    Tension is low; the investigation proceeds linearly without setbacks or significant cost to the protagonist. The "deadline" is described as atmospheric decor ("polite ghosts") rather than a pressuring clock that forces difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.2)
    While the stakes are low-key (breaking monotony), the narrative builds effective pressure through the precise timing of the "trick." The janitor’s grief raises the emotional stakes, transforming a game of chance into a moment of shared vulnerability, satisfying the requirement for meaningful deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.4)
    Conflict is primarily thematic and abstract (memory vs. ban) rather than urgent or present in the scene. While the "verse" is an act of resistance, the lack of immediate obstacles or active pressure from the "patrols" keeps the narrative tension low.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.1)
    The conflict is primarily thematic (history vs. development) rather than urgent pressure. While the "winter of deals" establishes a backdrop of gentrification, the on-page obstacle is internal and contemplative. The resolution—a decision to incorporate old boards—is satisfying conceptually but faces little immediate resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—reconciling with the damage caused/spared—is tightly braided with the interaction. The emotional cost is palpable in the dialogue and physical reactions ("voice a cracked cup"), creating a legitimate deepening of the relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.4)
    Conflict is abstract and lacks escalation; the protagonist faces no active opposition, resource scarcity, or internal barrier. The solution is achieved through a smooth procedural progression, missing a pivotal "tightening" beat or any risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.8)
    Escalation is present but low-voltage; the stakes are largely abstract ("legacy's burden") and the opposition is theoretical. While the sequence of discovery moves the plot, the protagonist's choice to accept the weight feels inevitable rather than a hard-won victory over genuine temptation to flee.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stakes are deeply felt on an internal level (hope vs. despair), and the pressure escalates appropriately through the ritual. While the external conflict is low-key, the conceptual risk—that mirrors "turn reckless when sung to without measure"—provides sufficient tension for this fable-like structure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (peace) is clear, and the tension of the "razors of distrust" is well-established early. However, the climax—where the delegates' anger softens immediately upon hearing the children's wish for "water that tastes like rain"—resolves the conflict too easily. The opposition melts away rather than being negotiated through a harder, more earned trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the stakes of absolution are clear, the pressure remains atmospheric; the "lull" acts as a clock, but the protagonist faces no active opposition or dilemma that endangers his goal. The conflict is largely retrospective, rendering the scene a procedural enactment of a decision already made.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are declared ("panic," "guards") but never felt, as the protagonist faces no effective opposition; the guards pause automatically when the ritual completes. The conflict is theoretical—conformity vs. freedom—rather than a visceral struggle with consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes of ethical integrity are clearly established ("pickpockets of grief"), providing strong initial pressure. However, the tension dissipates in the final act because the success of the new method is summarized rather than tested in a granular, high-stakes moment on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes remain abstract and theoretical (memory vs. entropy) without immediate physical or relational pressure on the protagonist. The "hawk shadow" introduces brief tension, but the narrator faces no genuine risk or difficult trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    Tension is maintained through the fragility of the process ("hands know where not to push") rather than external opposition. While the "impossible" plan proceeds without significant on-page setbacks, the high stakes of potential failure and the weight of the backstory keep the pressure felt and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure is maintained through the approaching storm, creating a ticking clock that forces the protagonist's hand. However, the stakes remain largely philosophical ("discover why some paths choose their walkers") rather than immediate or visceral, dampening the impact of the final risk.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.6)
    The stakes are primarily internal and conceptual—maintenance against entropy—but are felt through the "currency" of attention and oil. The pressure escalates through the puzzle-solving process, culminating in a choice that forecloses other paths (power/grandeur) in favor of stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are internal (resentment vs. release), but the conflict is resolved largely through the omnipotent "shifting grace" of the sanctuary rather than protagonist struggle. The environment "adjusts... until the body says yes," which removes the friction of the obstacle. The narrator's sacrifice of the box is a good beat, but the lack of resistance makes the victory feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation is sharp and legible; the dream's resistance creates immediate physical and structural peril for the mirrors. The protagonist’s agency is central to the turning point, where Ilen actively steadies the rhythm to shift the engagement from force to care.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clear and escalate appropriately through the "thickening" of the orchard's intent. While the conflict is primarily atmospheric and internal rather than antagonistic, the pressure of the "rotting vows" forces a necessary intervention. The cost is paid in the use of the daughter's ribbon—a relic sacrificed for the graft—which lands the emotional stakes effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clear but the external pressure remains low; the "hazard" of the orchard is navigated with relative ease via the aunt's guidance. The climax is a moment of discovery and exchange rather than high-tension conflict, fitting the tone but limiting escalation intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes feel low because the world offers no resistance; obstacles are overcome instantly by poetic gestures without visible trade-offs or failure risks. The rescue of the apprentice lacks tension, as the solution (speaking grammar terms) is abstract and arbitrarily effective.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are clearly articulated ("lose the twin you tried to discover") and the pressure escalates as the protagonist descends into the ship. The final choice involves a visible, felt cost—letting go of the ledger—satisfying the requirement for a decisive trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.0)
    Tension is minimal because the antagonist is an abstract concept ("absence") that yields instantly to the archivist's skills. The stakes (lost scholarships) are stated but not intimately threatened in the scene, and the mechanism offers no active resistance to the protagonist's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.6)
    Pressure builds adequately through sensory escalation ("ribs clatter"), but the conflict is resolved via a competence-based success rather than a hard choice or sacrifice. The cost is strictly physical endurance, lacking the visceral or relational price required to push the stakes into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.4)
    Conflict is muted; the central obstacle (the broken prism and missing chart) is resolved almost immediately by the traveler's arrival and a quiet epiphany ("realization arrived quiet as frost"). The story violates the principle that coincidence should complicate rather than resolve; here, coincidence provides the solution, stripping the narrative of the pressure and struggle necessary for a high-band score.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clearly defined around the tension of erasure versus individual assertion, and the pressure escalates steadily through the interaction with the monuments. The resolution is earned through action, though the felt cost is somewhat mitigated by the lightning’s explicit reassurance, which softens the risk of the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.9)
    While the "gravity of hopelessness" provides a clear conceptual stake, the story lacks a distinct tightening beat or tangible obstacle; the preparation and execution proceed without failure or complication. The cost paid is largely metaphorical ("filtered the burned smell"), limiting the visceral impact of the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central conflict (stay vs. go) is clear, but the escalation is purely internal and somewhat lowered by the resolution. By reframing the move inland as just "new littorals" to document, the narrator rhetorically removes the sting of the sacrifice, resulting in a Conceptual Repricing that feels a bit too tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—defining a livable form of safety—is signaled early and escalated through the physical risk of the climb. While the father's capitulation is aided by the magical element, it represents a meaningful surrender of his rigid worldview, satisfying the requirement for cost.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure is subtle but sustained, centered on the mathematician's inability to reconcile logic with grief. The escalation is quiet, tracked by the storm glass and the conversation, resolving in a meaningful cadence shift where the passenger accepts "absence" without trying to solve it.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure is coherent but linear, driven by the sunrise clock and physical barriers that are bypassed with relative ease. The climax relies on a philosophical decision that, while thematically sound, lacks a visceral on-page cost or sacrifice to heighten the drama.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are clear and the pressure of the "fading threshold" creates a functional ticking clock for the lesson. The conflict is resolved through a steady escalation of the teaching beat; while the cost is described ("old scars wake"), the resolution feels slightly smooth given the density of the buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clearly escalated via the alternate-dimension texts, creating a personal pressure cooker. The cost is conceptual but felt—the risk of "predatory ideas" and the weight of legal/spiritual responsibility signed on the console.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are high but largely retrospective, as the dynasty was already ended "last winter"; the scene functions as emotional ratification rather than active struggle. The conflict lacks a moment of acute risk where the outcome is in genuine doubt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clear—capture possibility or "drown in a statistics of miracles"—and escalation is steady as he ascends the orchard. The opposition is primarily abstract/internal, which fits the fable mode but offers less visceral friction than a direct antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.2)
    The conflict is primarily internal and thematic (memory vs. erasure), which fits the quiet tone but lacks immediate external pressure or risk. The investigation proceeds without obstacles—the clues are found and interpreted easily. A stronger sense of resistance or a higher cost for the "addendum" would have elevated the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.2)
    Escalation is minimal; the protagonist encounters no significant resistance from the committee or the environment. The police siren acts as a token obstacle that is easily baffled, leaving the central victory feeling inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are clearly established (the city "used up like salt") and effectively escalated when the prophecy names a city the protagonist loves. The shift in tactics—from general disruption to cancelling a specific pairing with a lower register—demonstrates agency under pressure. The cost is visible in the physical and emotional toll of the "vested hush."

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.0)
    Conflict is largely atmospheric, lacking visceral urgency or high stakes. While the arrival of the "hush" provides a shift in pressure, the cost of failure remains abstract ("haste only scatters"). The "tightening" is procedural rather than a test of character mettle.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.8)
    Conflict is internal and low-stakes, lacking significant external opposition or the risk of tangible failure. The protagonist moves from one discovery to the next with minimal friction; the "cost" is philosophical rather than felt, making the escalation read as gentle curiosity rather than urgent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    The central conflict—human grief versus material reality—is brilliantly externalized through the trembling scales. Escalation is clear as the narrator adds variables (names, hair, button) to force a resolution. The cost is felt in the final renunciation ("I do not believe she will walk back"), though the pivot to resolution happens somewhat rapidly in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.3)
    Conflict is minimal; the ghost's resistance ("feared laughter would betray her") is overcome immediately by the narrator's explanation and a montage of "testing." There is no moment where the outcome is in doubt, nor is there a felt cost to the protagonist for this success, resulting in low narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.5)
    External pressure dissolves in the second half; the forest becomes a benevolent teacher and the Caretaker offers wisdom without demanding a visible price. The conflict remains largely abstract ("seeking mathematics"), and the resolution lacks a sharp, dramatized trade-off or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake (saving a name from oblivion) is noble but the immediate dramatic pressure is low. The painter offers only passive skepticism ("shrug," "amused"), and the magical retrieval requires "patience" rather than a difficult choice or sacrifice. The protagonist succeeds through established competence, lacking a moment of genuine jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure is coherent but relatively low-stakes; the conflict is an external puzzle (solving the ghosts' trap) rather than a personal crucible with immediate danger or difficult trade-offs. The "weightless burden" is felt, but the protagonist faces no active opposition, making the climax a procedural execution of a solution rather than a tense confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.9)
    Pressure escalates cleanly from the frost's temptation to the physical rupture of the library. The choice is a clear trade-off: perfection (sinking) vs. wobble (survival), dramatized vividly through the printing press mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clearly defined early on—the historical memory of a civilization—and escalate naturally from an academic dispute to a public tribunal. The pressure mounts effectively as Ledger moves to strip the narrator's access, forcing the high-risk demonstration in the council hall. The cost is felt in the final sacrifice of the shard, ensuring the victory isn't cheap.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are established early and escalate clearly from the watchman's obstruction to the entity's demand for a price. The resolution relies on a conceptual trade (shadow for light) that feels weighty and earned, though the antagonist itself remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.0)
    The tension escalates cleanly from the initial descent to the visceral vision of the father's death. The dominant stake—resolving the mystery of the "hush" vs. the factory's hum—is resolved through a sacrifice that carries unmistakable weight.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.9)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the storm "unspools" cooperatively as the protagonist builds, and the driftwood fits perfectly ("mortises finding tenons in air"). Without resistance or the risk of failure, the stakes feel theoretical rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.2)
    There is virtually no conflict or opposition. The Verger is helpful, neighbors bring soup, and the work proceeds without failure or doubt. The narrative lacks a counter-force to test the protagonist’s resolve; the "struggle" is merely the passage of time and labor, resulting in low tension throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are clear and high: the erasure of history versus the pain of remembering. The "parley" scene serves as a distinct, earned turning point where the protagonist actively extracts the truth rather than passively witnessing it.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clearly established—the survival of civilization itself—but the conflict is largely man-against-entropy rather than active antagonism. The "cost" is shown in labor and patience (broomstrokes, arguments), which is effective, though the lack of acute, moment-to-moment jeopardy limits the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are raised effectively through the prophecy and the personal connection to the "pin in the breath." However, the tension deflates at the resolution when the established threat (the orchard dropping its fruit) fails to materialize despite the scribe's refusal. The ending feels like symmetric satisfaction, lacking the "felt cost" required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are abstract and environmental (entropy/winter) rather than personal; the protagonist overcomes the obstacle with instant competence, lacking a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.7)
    Escalation is present via the approaching storm and Reni's anxiety. The resolution—the storm simply "sidling away" in response to the bell—removes the threat too easily, mitigating the felt cost of the decision to ignore the siren.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.4)
    External pressure is mild; the power outage functions more as an atmospheric shift than a test of agency, resolved largely by waiting. The climax relies on an internal epiphany rather than a difficult trade-off or active struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.8)
    The arrival of the Ghost Queen introduces immediate, coherent pressure that forces the protagonist to confront the source of his guilt. The stakes are raised from mere observation to painful participation ("tolerable stings"), with a felt cost that validates the covenant. The tension holds steady under the Situational/Accumulative lens, resolving in a deepened commitment rather than a tidy victory.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are largely conceptual; while the premise of &quot;living faithfully&quot; is noble, there is minimal active opposition or rising pressure. The central obstacle—opening the capsule—is resolved through passive waiting, and the arrival of the ally is frictionless. The story lacks a moment where the protagonist must pay a tangible price to succeed.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are relatively low and the conflict (the boy's grief) is resolved instantly by the poet's intervention without significant obstacles. The lack of pushback from the boy or cost to the poet results in a flat escalation arc.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict is minimal; external obstacles (suspicious fishermen, gulls) are resolved instantly with tea or gentle redirection, and nature cooperates without resistance. The stakes of the illness are stated but not felt as an active antagonistic force in the scene work, resulting in a low-tension narrative where success feels inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.5)
    Pressure is minimal; the promised clash between "ritual" and "inquiry" dissolves as the protagonist follows instructions without resistance. While the accumulative density builds adequately toward the window reveal, the lack of obstacles or genuine risk limits the emotional payload of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation works well under the Accumulative lens, moving from broad maintenance (spreading seeds) to a specific, symbolic intervention (uprooting bayonets). While immediate dramatic opposition is low, the thematic pressure of the &quot;narrow vastness&quot; and the weight of history provide sufficient tension to sustain the short form.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.7)
    The conflict is low-pressure; the antagonist is the abstract concept of "distance," and the protagonist faces no active opposition or significant cost beyond the effort of the journey. The stakes feel personal but lack immediate danger or a forcing mechanism that necessitates a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clearly internalized, with the struggle to "fix the world to a single point" providing adequate pressure. However, the physical stakes remain somewhat abstract, relying heavily on the interpretation of the headache and the drawing rather than tangible external resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes are globally high ("the sky is wrong") but the immediate pressure is low, as the ritual of swapping pieces proceeds without active resistance from the antagonist/board until the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.5)
    Tension is low and purely atmospheric; the participants cooperate without friction, and the external "regency" poses no active threat on the page. While the emotional intimacy deepens, there is no moment where the narrator's goal is genuinely at risk or where a hard trade-off is required. The stakes remain theoretical rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are clear and the internal cost of "buried talents" is felt, but the external pressure is mild; the mountain "approves" readily, and the ritual's price (stinging feather) offers low resistance. The resolution feels slightly smooth, lacking a moment of desperate trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    Tension is sustained effectively by the physical resistance of the frozen world and the moral weight of the tutor's past. The climax offers a meaningful agency-driven choice—efficiency vs. care—that recontextualizes his "exile" and gives the resolution a palpable ethical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.0)
    While the stakes are established as high (loss of voice), the execution deflates this pressure; the "impromptu poetry" session meets no failure or pushback, and the canyon accepts the new terms immediately. The cost paid by the collective (a single memory/hue) feels disproportionately light compared to the established threat, undermining the gravity of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are immediate (dissolving workshop) and emotional (grief). The pressure escalates naturally through the physical toll of the environment ("sea gnaws the pontoons") and the precision required by the task. The climax—fitting the charm—feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stakes are primarily internal and artistic—the fear of "vanishing into copies"—yet they are made visceral through the physical danger and magic of the cave. The escalation works well, moving from the initial anxiety of the broken mirror to the tempting stasis of the oasis. The climax involves a clear agency: the decision to "leave it" rather than succumb to the perfection of the magic. The cost is subtle but felt—the loss of the perfect world in exchange for the honest, broken one.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.6)
    The internal stakes (validation of method) are clear, but the external threat (the freighter) feels somewhat distant and easily managed by the magic system. The cost paid is abstract ("patience," "open throat") rather than a hard tactical trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation is primarily internal and situational, driven by the completion of the device and the compulsion to follow it. While external obstacles are minimal, the emotional pressure mounts effectively as the navigator nears the site of trauma. The stakes—navigating the void of loss—are clear and resolved through the final conceptual shift.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    The central constraint (involuntary truth) elevates the stakes of a standard patrol encounter into a complex tactical puzzle. The tension escalates cleanly as the protagonist must navigate the interrogation without lying, and the "cost" is felt in the terrifying exposure of the group to the inspectors.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes are intimate and felt, centered on the burden of witnessing a final wish. While the external conflict is low-key, the internal pressure to "decode" the silence is maintained, though the resolution comes a bit too easily through the memory vision.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    The rising creek provides effective physical urgency that forces the protagonist's hand, braiding well with the internal fear of stagnation. The stakes are clear, though the external pressure (the storm) feels slightly convenient as a pacing mechanism rather than an organic complication of the quest.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are established early (sovereign's unmaking) and escalate through the climb and the wanderer's warnings. The tension holds, though the cost of the final choice, while stated ("choose who rules"), remains slightly cerebral rather than viscerally demonstrated in the moment. However, the pressure on the protagonist is consistent and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.7)
    The stakes are primarily conceptual—capturing "presence"—but they are treated with sufficient weight to sustain the short narrative. The tension is maintained through the calibration of the ritual ("We do not kiss; we calibrate"). While the conflict is subtle (man vs. abstract nature), the cost of attention and patience is felt in the pacing of the experiment.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are high but primarily metaphysical; the tension escalates effectively through the dream sequence. The climax—a bargain trading envy for continuity—provides a legible cost, though the abstract nature of the trade keeps the pressure intellectual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no true obstacle in the repair, as the customer provides the perfect part immediately. The stakes are external (the labor) and resolved via text message, leaving the on-page action devoid of significant pressure or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are braided effectively: the physical danger of the storm escalates alongside the emotional difficulty of the memories. The progression from a burn scar to an interpersonal failure (the apology) deepens the conflict from physical to moral. The pressure is consistent and forces a clear crystallization of the protagonist's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from a personal desire for apology to an urgent external crisis (the orchard's destruction). The climax involves a legible, high-stakes trade-off where the narrator burns professional capital ("the column I had never dared write") to achieve a moral victory.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—unifying history versus falling into the echo—is clear, and the reweighting of the mission serves as a meaningful tightening. However, the conflict is largely intellectual and resolved with gentle acquiescence from the setting rather than high-pressure agency.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure accumulates effectively from the initial anomaly to the physical cost of the cut finger. While the stakes are primarily philosophical, the physical danger of the "razor edges" and the professional risk of the final note provide sufficient concrete urgency. The escalation moves cleanly from observation to action to consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.8)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal, which fits the quiet tone but results in negligible external pressure; the "threats" (a cat, a leaky pipe) offer little resistance to force a harder choice. The goal to "revolutionize detection" feels disjointed from the low-stakes maintenance actions shown on the page. Escalation is minimal, relying on a smooth glide toward acceptance rather than a crucible of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—reconciling the father's reckless legacy with the protagonist's need for control—is clear and poignant. The pressure of the recent heart attack effectively frames the narrative. The resolution, however, feels slightly "gifted" by the discovery of the perfectly placed note, lowering the sense of active, earned confrontation with the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.5)
    The climax lacks sufficient resistance; the characters resolve the crisis instantly through "humming" and "counting" without facing failure or complication. The victory feels predetermined and low-cost, as the rescue succeeds via competence that is never truly tested by the pressure of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clear, but the escalation is linear and low-resistance; the woman accepts the archivist’s method immediately, and the conflict dissolves upon the partner's arrival. The narrative lacks a moment where the protagonist is forced to make a difficult trade-off or pay a visible cost to achieve the result.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.2)
    Pressure is coherent but soft; the stakes (loneliness vs. comfort) remain abstract and the resolution (neighbors arriving with soup) lowers the cost rather than exacting a sharp, visceral price from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure is coherent and escalates through sensory intensity and the "ache" of the ring, though the physical path offers little resistance (the fern helps, the notes line up). The stakes are high and the cost—accepting the "planet the size of an ache"—is legible and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.4)
    Tension escalates well from the signal to the ritualistic editing. However, the protagonist's agency is slightly undercut at the decisive moment when Del guides their hand ("guiding my hand so the lines would not cross"), softening the earned nature of the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.2)
    Pressure is minimal; the environment and the advisor cooperate fully with Arin's goals, removing the possibility of failure. The central action—ringing a bell—lacks a "felt cost" or significant risk, resulting in a flat escalation curve where success feels inevitable rather than fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.2)
    External pressure is virtually absent; the protagonist moves through the archive without opposition, time constraints, or risk of failure. The central conflict is resolved through the "analytically intuitive" trait, which removes the tension of the puzzle-solving process.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—Mira’s consciousness versus the loss of self—is clear and urgent. The escalation involving the intrusion of donor memories forces a tangible trade-off (accepting the "strangers"), though the antagonist force remains largely environmental and the cost is paid with relatively swift acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes are established early but lack pressure; Ivo dominates the scene with superior skill, never facing a moment of genuine risk or trade-off. The resolution is achieved without a "felt cost" or a tightening of options, capping the score under the 6.0 threshold for conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.3)
    The stakes remain largely internal and atmospheric; while the brother's death adds weight, the lack of active opposition or external pressure keeps the tension low. The pilot scene serves as a good escalation of the magical premise.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=3.8)
    Dramatic conflict is virtually absent; the opposition ("the habit of finishing too fast") is abstract and offers no pushback. The protagonist faces no risk of failure, and the stakes remain theoretical rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.4)
    External conflict is minimal; the anticipated opposition from the crowd transforms instantly into a "windless cheer," deflating the stakes. The "Great Pacification" premise removes the threat of violence, but the story doesn't replace it with sufficient social or psychological pressure to make the departure feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—maintaining a space for grief within a happiness mandate—is clear and escalating. The climax, where the narrator turns off the microphone to teach the child, is a distinct, earned moment of agency with felt risk. While the external antagonist (the inspector) is handled in flashback, the omnipresent pressure of the "feed" keeps the tension taut in the present.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.6)
    The stakes are clear (overcoming fear), but the conflict is extremely low-voltage; the potential antagonist (the guard) dissolves into tears immediately, removing external pressure. The escalation is purely atmospheric, lacking a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt or a price is paid for the transgression.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is minimal; Mira acts as a purely supportive facilitator, and the "trade" requires no hesitation, risk, or painful sacrifice from Ivo. The stakes remain abstract because the cost of failure is never felt on the page; he simply asks and receives, stripping the narrative of propulsive pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.8)
    Pressure is low throughout; the listeners and the grieving volunteer offer no resistance to the narrator's guidance, resulting in a smooth ritual that lacks visceral stakes or the possibility of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are internal and defined early, though the external pressure remains low; the conflict resolves through philosophical acceptance rather than a high-cost choice. The interaction with the mother provides a necessary focal point for escalation, though the resolution comes via explanation rather than action.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story operates on an Accumulative lens where stakes are thematic rather than urgent; the pressure is consistent but low-key. While there is a pleasing thematic deepening from survival (broken phones) to memory (mural) to identity (musician), the narrative lacks a moment of acute risk or high-cost trade-off for the protagonists.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.1)
    Conflict is largely theoretical; the archive offers "invitations" and "warnings" that taste sweet, but there is no sense of genuine danger or opposition. The protagonist’s success is never in doubt, and the "refusal to bargain" feels like a low-stakes philosophical preference rather than a risky trade-off. The climax (speaking names) resolves without visible resistance, keeping tension flat.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central conflict is clear, and the tightening of the vines provides a necessary escalation of stakes. However, the antagonist force (the library itself) activates late, making the pressure feel reactive rather than built into the scene's spine from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are clear, blending professional survival with moral integrity. The pressure of the "hollow accounts" and angry phones forces a high-cost decision: radical transparency over self-preservation. The escalation from the physical surgery to the reputation-risking letter is logical and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.1)
    Internal pressure escalates effectively as the anesthesia wears off and the protagonist approaches the trauma site. The "ritual of numbness" provides a unique, felt cost for the backstory. However, external resistance is minimal; the journey to the tunnel is unimpeded, leaving the conflict entirely internal.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes transition effectively from an abstract curiosity about "unused love" to a specific, personal confrontation. The cost—years lost to hesitation—is felt on the page, though the external pressure remains low.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=3.2)
    Pressure is minimal; the dominant stake ("trapped creativity") is abstract and the protagonist encounters no on-page resistance or possibility of failure. The escalation consists only of successfully performing a ritual, and the mention of failure ("Sometimes I fail") is relegated to summary. The resolution is earned through magical competence rather than struggle or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake (preserving the sparks/archive) is clear, and the pressure escalates through the "game against erasure." However, the protagonist's competence is so high that the conflict feels somewhat low-resistance; the "game" is won with a quiet gesture rather than a desperate struggle. The cost is felt ("clock has sweat a single tick"), but the peril never feels truly threatening to the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.2)
    The conflict is internal and low-pressure, centering on a vague "ache" without external stakes or urgency. The resolution is achieved through a mechanical fix that yields immediate positive results (insight, maps), bypassing the "risk" mentioned in the text and leaving the victory unearned by sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is minimal; the guides remove obstacles rather than creating them, and the &quot;old fear&quot; is mentioned but never dramatized as a force that genuinely threatens the protagonist's progress. The resolution feels unearned because the protagonist faces no significant opposition or cost; the environment and guides are too helpful to generate narrative heat.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.0)
    The conflict is largely internal and abstract (expression vs. safety), lacking a sharp external pressure point since the "enforcer" (bellhop) is sympathetic. The escalation relies on a time jump ("seventh week") rather than a tightening of immediate options, resulting in a low-tension climax resolved by realization rather than a forced trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes are high (a throne), but the on-page conflict suffers from a lack of active resistance; Serane "obeys" Lyr's guidance and folds immediately upon seeing the proof. A stronger pushback or attempt to deny the truth would have heightened the dramatic tension and made the victory feel more hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.4)
    While the stakes (drowning) are high, the conflict remains largely intellectual and atmospheric. The resolution comes relatively easily through intuition and cooperation, lacking a sharp moment of "near-miss" or visceral cost during the climax to heighten the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clearly established (truth vs. silence), and the "lull in rebellion" adds contextual weight. However, the escalation is linear; the opposition is passive ("cold circuits"), and the resolution comes without a significant setback or tactical pivot. The pressure remains largely atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes are clear (stagnation vs. evolution), and the risk of defying the council is established. However, the central conflict beat—the argument with the council—is handled in summary rather than a dramatized scene, which lowers the felt pressure. The resolution comes somewhat easily, with the community accepting the change immediately, softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are clear and the internal conflict (trauma vs. present) is compelling. However, the conflict resolution in the gull scene feels somewhat rushed, and the "niece" segment operates more as a thematic deepening than a pressure-cooker escalation. The "Storm season" transition diffuses tension rather than tightening it.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.9)
    The stakes are clear, and the pressure of the storm escalates effectively to force the central choice. The resolution comes perhaps a bit too fluently once the match is struck, but the cost—sacrificing the cards to feed the light—is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes (the commodification of crisis/time) are high and abstract but made tangible through the metronome mechanism. Escalation is clear, moving from observation to infiltration. The conflict resolves through agency—a rejection of power—fitting the established "tracker" archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tension between the repressive regime and the desire for expression is palpable and escalates well to the release. The stakes feel high, though the resolution—where the protagonist escapes all blowback—softens the "felt cost" of the rebellion.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.8)
    Tension is introduced with the knife, but the antagonists capitulate to the setting's atmosphere too easily, bypassing the need for a high-cost tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are established early (the coast is being devoured by silence) and escalate as the protagonist moves deeper into the garden. The confrontation with the goddess forces a clear trade-off: possession of the echo versus the restoration of the land.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are palpable and escalate smoothly from an intellectual wager to a real-world crisis (the stalling of the news). The climax forces a stance crystallization—moving from observer to active arbiter of the device's future.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.1)
    The external pressure of the crying baby creates a visceral, rising urgency that effectively forces the protagonist's hand. The translation mechanic ("I am untethered") tightly braids the external crisis with the narrator's internal struggle, leading to a satisfying release of tension when the "stay" command is revealed.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.5)
    The central conflict—the bearded man's resistance—is overcome almost instantly by the narrator's intervention and the tile, lacking significant pushback or escalation. The stakes remain low and contained within the workshop dynamic; the protagonist pays no visible emotional or social price for interjecting. The resolution feels too smooth, depriving the climax of necessary tension.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the stakes are high (justice/healing), but the opposition is passive. The antagonists ("men who fed the fire") arrive, kneel, and accept their judgment without resistance, reducing the scene to a ceremony. There is no moment where the protagonist’s goal is genuinely at risk.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is low-intensity; the "genteel panic" and "silver coats" read as aesthetic flourishes rather than visceral threats. The resolution comes too easily, maintaining the status quo without forcing the protagonist to make a painful trade-off or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.1)
    The internal pressure of grief and the procedural tension ("misread the rhythm") provide adequate stakes. While the "static shock" adds a layer of physical immediacy, the conflict remains largely low-key and cooperative; the escalation is subtle rather than driving sharp tactical shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure creates a clear arc: the need for connection is tested by the physical threat of the storm. The climax forces a trade-off (safety vs. the fossil/trust) that is executed cleanly. The stakes are internal and relational but dramatized through concrete physical danger, satisfying the demand for visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.7)
    The stakes of destiny versus agency are high in concept, but the external opposition is minimal; the elders remain abstract and the villagers accept the change instantly. The lack of concrete resistance or interpersonal friction keeps the conflict largely philosophical and low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are clear (redemption vs. exile) and the tension of the trade is maintained, but the conflict is relatively low-pressure as Len is essentially cooperative. The cost is paid (loss of the microfilm/leverage), but the immediate danger feels more atmospheric than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.4)
    Stakes are declared in high-concept terms ("everything that will drown us") but the on-page conflict lacks visceral pressure; the resolution is magical and immediate. The threat of the map is solved by the act of stitching, which feels like a symbolic shortcut rather than a tactical choice with consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the environment (the "opposition") cooperates immediately with the protagonist's desires. There is no escalation of pressure or risk of failure, only a smooth accumulation of successful gestures.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    The conflict is quiet but pressurized, pitting the protagonist against the physical resistance of the lock and the temporal pressure of the mother’s passing. While the external opposition is static (a lock), the emotional stakes are high and clearly defined. The escalation from the rowing rhythm to the delicate tension of the pick work holds the reader effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clear—the library's stability and the preservation of the voices—and escalate tangibly as the circle's hum turns to a "cough." The resolution requires an active, costly trade-off (invoking the painful herd memory to steady the present). The pressure is coherent and the release is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the lovers' estrangement is a premise that evaporates the moment they enter the installation. There is no on-page obstacle, no moment where the plan risks failure, and no visible cost paid by the narrator or the lovers for their reunion. The "careful bodies" move effortlessly onto the path, robbing the climax of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes escalate logically from professional bureaucratic pressure to a supernatural threat against free will. The climax centers on a meaningful choice, though the antagonist's defeat feels somewhat abrupt compared to the sophisticated buildup of the threat.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.3)
    The stakes are clear (fixing the city), but the opposition feels compliant; the alleys straighten and the door opens without exacting a significant toll or forcing a hard trade-off. The tension is largely atmospheric rather than urgent, and the protagonist's success feels inevitable once the correct tools are deployed.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes remain abstract and intellectual; the protagonist faces no active opposition or time pressure, merely the passive silence of the site. The conflict is internal interpretation, and the cost of the resolution is not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.8)
    Tension is primarily atmospheric rather than interpersonal or internal; the obstacle (the machine/Director) is overcome instantly with the nail, lacking a moment of true risk or sacrifice. The victory feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle, as the opposition folds immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.1)
    The stakes are clear (recovery of the lost), but the conflict is resolved through competence (playing the right note) rather than a difficult choice or sacrifice. The antagonist—the "mountain ledger"—capitulates too easily to the music, reducing the tension of the climax to an aesthetic performance rather than a struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.6)
    The conflict between memory (the train/ribbons) and commerce (investors/metrics) is clear, but the escalation is summarized rather than felt in the moment. The protagonist's agency is primarily expressed through refusal (tying ribbons), which is a valid form of renunciation, but the climax (market correction) arrives as an external force ("gravity") rather than a direct consequence of that choice.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.4)
    Conflict is low-stakes and abstract; the "resistance" of the inscriptions dissolves immediately once the method is applied. There is no meaningful escalation or moment where failure seems possible, resulting in a smooth but tension-free progression.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are clear for the client (mayor), and the escalation follows a logical investigative path. The tension holds well, though the protagonist's personal risk is primarily professional pride rather than visceral danger.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are conceptually high, pitting the gardeners' desire for restoration against the protagonists' new reality. The resolution feels slightly effortless as the antagonists capitulate to a verbal refusal, lacking a final intensification of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are high (a boy's future), but the on-page resistance is low; the Weaver is helpful and the boy compliant, making the central conflict feel like a smooth transaction rather than a struggle. The escalation lacks a moment of genuine doubt or danger, resolving via a "fiercely gentle" request that the magic system accommodates without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clear and personal; the pressure to perform professionally creates a strong counter-force to the emotional pull of the relic. The escalation is internal but legible, though the external pressure from Bowers is relatively low, relying almost entirely on the protagonist's self-imposed constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    The pressure is quiet but coherent, escalating from routine maintenance to a critical intervention to prevent the arbor's collapse. The "haunted ambitions" provide necessary internal friction that sharpens the stakes of the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.2)
    Dramatic pressure is negligible; the visitor’s problem is solved immediately by the librarian’s established competence and tools. There is no escalation, opposition, or forced trade-off; the stakes ("if the moon forgets her") remain theoretical and are never tested by immediate danger or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is thematic rather than dramatic; the opposition (regulations) is abstract and easily overcome by a single moment of intuition. The "heartbeat of a hesitation" serves as a safe space for decision-making rather than a pressure cooker, resulting in a climax where the protagonist succeeds without facing a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure escalates coherently as the coordinates lead closer to the site of trauma, forcing a confrontation with the physical reality of the water. The stakes are internalized but made visible through the physical ritual with the bellows and the immersion in the river.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are clear but pressure is low; the protagonist navigates obstacles (the door, the blank books) by simply intuiting the correct response (waiting, breathing) without failure or costly trade-offs. The conflict remains internal and abstract, lacking a moment of genuine jeopardy where the outcome feels in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clearly established: the preservation of an object vs. the propagation of its spirit. The arrival of the officers provides a concrete external threat that forces the internal decision. The cost is palpable—the destruction of a priceless artifact—making the resolution feel significant rather than easy.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure is subtle, relying on the fragility of the signal ("patterns in static") and the fading window of opportunity. While the stakes are clear, the lack of a significant external obstacle or sharp reversal makes the victory feel inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.8)
    External pressure is negligible; the environment aids the protagonist ("friendly rungs," wall opens easily) rather than resisting. The potential cost of sacrificing the heirloom is explicitly negated by the narrator ("felt no loss"), neutralizing the stakes of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clear and high (political scandal vs. city welfare), and the pressure escalates coherently as the wind rises. The cost is legible—she trades a safe cover-up for a risky public battle—though the "bribes for lifeboats" scenario is resolved relatively quickly once the chimes "speak."

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.1)
    The stakes remain largely abstract until the vision sequence, and the lack of an antagonist or internal doubt results in low immediate tension. The protagonist's easy acceptance of the revelation ("I agreed") bypasses the potential for a higher-stakes dilemma or felt cost in the moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are primarily internal and conceptual; the struggle is against the difficulty of the task rather than an opposing force. While the tension of "tuning" is well-rendered, the lack of external pressure or a moment of genuine risk limits the dramatic engine. The escalation is textural rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.9)
    The conflict between automated perfection and human messiness is escalated effectively; the cost is felt in the physical toll of the climb and the protagonist's social alienation.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.4)
    While the internal yearning is clear, the stakes remain largely aesthetic and low-pressure; the "tinderbox strapped shut" implies risk that never materializes. The cost—a vow of untiring attention—is conceptual and poetic, fitting the tone but lacking immediate, felt friction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.4)
    Tension is atmospheric and procedural rather than interpersonal or antagonistic. While the stakes ("usable silence") are somewhat abstract, the difficulty of the method ("ruinous to master") and the pressure of the contracting universe provide sufficient narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is distinct and coherent under the Situation/Causal lens, moving from general fears to the specific, unstable trauma of Miren. The pressure tightens when the figure refuses to settle, forcing the reaper to use his scythe—a symbol of death—to focus the light of understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes (starvation, cosmic imbalance) are high but atmospheric, lacking immediate, sharp opposition in the scene. The "clumsy rhythm" of the approaching day provides a mild ticking clock, but the protagonist faces little resistance; the resolution comes from competence and patience rather than a hard-won struggle against an active antagonist or agonizing choice.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes are legible (erasure vs. memory), and the pressure escalates through the discovery of the artifacts. The opposition (the Bureau) remains abstract, making the act of defiance feel low-risk on the page, though the emotional cost is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.1)
    Conflict is strictly internal and low-stakes; the opposition (timing/precision) is managed without genuine jeopardy or doubt. The escalation is procedural—waiting for the right moment—rather than a pressure cooker of narrowing options or forced trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation is coherent, moving from environmental warning to mechanical crisis ("blister of air"). The conflict is resolved primarily through competence, which is satisfying, though a sharper sense of active trade-off or cost during the "lean" would heighten the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are clear, and the tension escalates appropriately during the training and final test. However, the resolution—a "third way" of joint custody—feels intellectually satisfying but emotionally low-cost; the characters accept the judgment without significant resistance, softening the dramatic impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.5)
    Conflict is largely projected; the antagonist (landlord/market) is debated in absentia, making the stakes theoretical rather than immediate. While the decision to plant the seed forecloses the "profit" path, the absence of an on-page obstacle reduces the beat's kinetic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes are clear and the personification of Grief as an antagonist provides a tangible focal point for the conflict. However, the escalation feels somewhat mechanical, with the conductor's victory seemingly inevitable rather than imperiled by high-risk failure points.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.1)
    Pressure creates a focused arc of testing, with the weighing of the pendant acting as a clear tightening of stakes. The “tithe to belonging” establishes a concrete metaphysical cost for the protagonist’s survival. While the stakes are abstract, the on-page tension regarding the "boundaries of light" anchors them effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clear (destiny vs. freedom), but the immediate pressure is low; the ritual succeeds without distinct reversal or escalation of danger. The antagonist (the guild/bishop) is abstract, leaving the scene without immediate oppositional force beyond the process itself.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.8)
    Pressure is situational (lunar perigee), but the obstacles dissolve somewhat easily when the narrator simply decides to "stop naming." While leaving the items behind constitutes a material cost, the emotional stakes remain abstract ("tune your forgiveness") and the tension never feels truly threatening.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are clear—the commuters' "practiced hope" versus the delay. The escalation through the radio's voice to the navigational challenge is steady. The cost is conceptual but felt: the rejection of a painless "river without tides" for one with reliable struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.9)
    Tension is primarily intellectual, centered on the abstract success of the demonstration rather than personal cost or danger. While the final "triangle of waiting" creates a moment of focus, the stakes remain low-pressure and theoretical throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.7)
    The conflict is primarily internal and environmental, pitting the instructor's desire for truth against the city's comforting "lamps." While the antagonist (the council/fear) is passive, the physical stakes of the night crawl—"thudding against my thigh," "kick and reach"—provide necessary friction and cost to the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are intimate but clear: the need to resolve a child's distress against the bureaucratic "wasteful" warning. The pressure escalates quietly but effectively through the journey, culminating in the emotional pivot where the father's grief—not the mother's ghost—becomes the true center of the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are braided effectively: physical survival against the tide and the psychological need for atonement. The tension escalates naturally from the physical squeeze to the emotional weight of the log entries, culminating in the personal discovery at the terminal. The cost is felt in the protagonist's rationed breath and the relinquishing of her talisman.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are intimate and high, driven by the pressure of the "false aurora" mistake. The resolution relies on a somewhat standard technical fix ("recalibrate," "defragment"), but the emotional cost and the "staccato" physical pressure validate the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clearly established as the loss of a language against the resistance of the environment. The escalation is steady, moving from technical failure (birds scattering) to personal cost (giving up the name), providing a clear "felt" price for success.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.7)
    Escalation is consistent, moving from observation to interaction and finally to transformation. While the atmospheric pressure is high, the lack of a distinct antagonist or sharper external obstacles makes the conflict feel somewhat internal and soft until the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.5)
    Escalation is dampened by the ease of the protagonist's success; the threat of the statues is established but never fully dramatized as a force that forces a painful trade-off. The resolution arrives without a "felt cost" on the page, as the dropping of the shell is portrayed as a gift rather than a sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are clear but low-voltage; the conflict is primarily internal and thematic rather than driven by urgent external pressure. While the "drone border" implies danger, the actual obstacle is the abstract concept of "broken promises," making the escalation feel contemplative rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stakes are primarily atmospheric and aesthetic—the restoration of the train—rather than deeply personal or urgent. The conflict is resolved through a "soft reset" (singing activates the magic) without a visceral sense of danger or loss; the carpenter succeeds smoothly once the secret is found.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.1)
    Pressure accumulates through atmospheric density rather than sharp conflict. While consistent with the contemplative mode, the stakes remain somewhat abstract; the "risk" of the path folding shut feels theoretical rather than visceral until the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.7)
    The conflict between possession and passage is well-articulated, escalating from the fishermen's warnings to the confrontation with the sea. While the stakes are philosophical rather than visceral, the tension is maintained through the race against the fleeing dawn. The cost is felt in the accepted solitude of the librarian's role.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.7)
    The dominant stake is clear, but the escalation relies heavily on the locksmith's guidance rather than the protagonist's active struggle. The resolution comes relatively smoothly once the instructions are followed, making the cost feel more conceptual than viscerally paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.9)
    The internal escalation is solid, moving from physical preparation to the emotional cost of the confession. While the external pressure is largely atmospheric rather than antagonistic, the personal cost of admitting the "missing truth" provides sufficient narrative traction.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.2)
    The antagonist (Council) is a straw man that collapses without genuine struggle; they arrive, see a tea-leaf pattern, and leave. The conflict lacks grit or back-and-forth pressure, resolving through a poetic gesture rather than a test of will or resource.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes remain abstract ("failing memory") and the protagonist faces no active opposition or dilemma; the conflict is resolved through a smooth application of ability without risk. The narrative lacks a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt or where a significant trade-off is forced.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clear but the escalation curve is gentle; the "snapped line" offers a brief physical threat, but it is resolved instantly by the caretaker's grip without lasting consequence. The conflict remains atmospheric and procedural rather than urgent or costly to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story relies on curiosity rather than urgent pressure; the verger yields easily, and the door is merely "remembered as sealed" rather than locked. While the mystery deepens logically, the stakes remain abstract and aesthetic. The protagonist faces no significant risk or high-cost choice, limiting the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes are primarily internal and thematic ("understanding letting go") rather than urgent or external. While sufficient for a contemplative mood piece, the conflict lacks sharp on-page pressure; the "tug" on the line provides a necessary but brief moment of physical urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are clear and communal (thirst, breath), creating a situational pressure that escalates with the storm. While lacking sharp interpersonal friction, the environmental pressure is coherent; the resolution feels earned through the protagonist's specific labor rather than luck.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.2)
    Escalation is linear and mechanical (floors 1-10) rather than pressured; obstacles (the cipher, the cold) yield immediately to the protagonist's tools without forcing a trade-off. There is no moment of genuine doubt or risk of failure, leaving the dominant stake—retrieving the logbook vs. finding joy—without a testing crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes are clear but the tension is somewhat diffused by the narrator's philosophical confidence; the approaching squall dissolves rapidly into "gratitude," resolving the physical threat through internal perception rather than external struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.2)
    External stakes are high (demolition), but the protagonist’s navigation of the "limits" challenge is executed as a checklist ("I test... I test...") rather than a desperate improvisation. The letter removes the ambiguity of the task, lowering the decision-making stakes during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.0)
    Pressure is generated by the fleeting opportunity rather than active opposition or high stakes; the conflict is primarily internal and observational. The resolution comes without a significant trade-off or tangible price, keeping the dramatic tension relatively low.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.6)
    Pressure is low throughout; the threat (snowfall in mirrors) is abstract and resolved instantly by uncapping a bottle. The conflict lacks a true antagonist or escalating obstacles, resulting in a processional narrative rather than a dramatic one.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.4)
    High stakes (survival) are undercut because the solution is compliance with instructions rather than a protagonist-driven choice with a visible trade-off. The climax is resolved through competence and obedience, lacking a moment where the characters must sacrifice a want for a need.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are global and felt, escalating clearly through the "browning sky" and the machine's trembling. The resolution, while tonally perfect for a fable, relies on a broad, somewhat sentimental trope (soldiers pausing, riots stopping) that feels slightly less earned than the intimate struggle with the bent brass tooth.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation is functional, driven by the ticking clock of the frost and the patrol change. The stakes are clear, but the "forgotten blueprint" technique reduces the friction of the escape, making the external opposition feel slightly managed rather than desperate.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.5)
    The internal stakes (guilt, estrangement) are established early, and the cost of the new path (scorn, lawsuits) provides a felt price at the ending. However, the immediate on-page conflict is low-pressure; the river yields its secret relatively easily, lacking a moment of active frustration or failure during the observation phase.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict is procedural rather than dramatic; the environment yields easily to the protagonist's competence, resulting in low tension despite the stated difficulty of the method.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clear (emotional contagion), and the pressure escalates as they approach the pavilion. However, the Chef's magical expertise resolves the climax ("let me cook you") somewhat smoothly, reducing the felt desperation or possibility of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=2.8)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the townspeople agree immediately ("answer with si, yes, da") and the elevator confesses its desire to change without persuasion. Because everyone shares the same goal from the start, the stakes remain abstract and the victory feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.3)
    The stakes are primarily internal and abstract ("rearranging circuits of fear"), lacking a concrete external pressure or a risk of failure that feels palpable on the page. While the escalation of the pulses provides momentum, the cost of the transformation is metaphysical and stated rather than dramatized through friction or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are thematic and atmospheric rather than visceral; the protagonist faces the environment's constraints with such competence that the danger ("skulls endure pressure") feels theoretical. The rejection of the "crowns" offers a moment of choice, but the outcome feels predetermined by the character's established discipline rather than a test of will.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.1)
    The conflict between the narrator's initial desire for a symphony and the grove's need for a simple pulse provides a functional pivot. However, the pressure is mild; the "surrender" comes easily without significant resistance or dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes are primarily atmospheric and internal; the external threats (tourists, the returning family) remain abstract or deferred. While the textural escalation of the "hum" works well for this mode, the lack of immediate, opposing force makes the victory feel somewhat inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are theoretical rather than visceral; the "pressure" comes from the impending fireworks, but the central task (opening the clasp) succeeds via uninterrupted competence. There is no moment where failure seems possible or where the protagonist must sacrifice something to succeed, leaving the escalation flat.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.7)
    External pressure (shaking bridges) escalates clearly, but the opposition (neighbors' whispers) is mild and easily overcome. The resolution arrives somewhat conveniently through the flower's magic rather than a difficult tactical adaptation by the protagonist; the cost (the smell) is accepted too quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the stakes (orchard survival) are clear, the on-page pressure feels low; the pilot succeeds smoothly without facing a moment of genuine doubt or palpable cost. The environment provides friction, but the protagonist's competence lowers the tension, resulting in a linear traversal rather than an escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from a theoretical investigation to a life-or-death intervention. The tension is well-managed, though the momentary pause to explain the philosophy of vectors to the child slightly drags on the urgency of the incoming medical flight.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is minimal; the ritual's success feels inevitable from the start, with only a brief, easily resolved beat of internal doubt providing opposition. The stakes remain high-concept rather than visceral, and the protagonist pays no significant on-page price for the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes are clearly established (personal redemption, sealing a danger), and pressure builds as the protagonist opens the seam. However, the conflict is largely internal and environmental; the resolution comes relatively smoothly once the realization hits, lacking a sharp, externalized cost paid in the present scene to earn the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    The conflict is layered effectively: the couple’s grief provides immediate external pressure, while the protagonist’s struggle with their own "ambiguity" provides the internal engine. The climax—"forgiveness is a rotating mirror"—resolves the external layer while simultaneously cracking the protagonist’s internal defense. The cost is felt in the "cooling" of the fragment and the vanishing star, representing an expenditure of entropy/light. Escalation is coherent, moving from professional detachment to personal vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.7)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no external opposition or significant risk of failure, making the outcome feel inevitable. While the emotional cost of the mentor's absence is felt, the lack of a difficult trade-off or obstacle flattens the dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clear (proof vs. skepticism), and the cost (Mara's emotional exposure) is felt. However, the conflict is resolved primarily by the objects performing unambiguously—the frost showing movie-like scenes removes the interpretive ambiguity that would have heightened the psychological tension.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are established, but the conflict remains largely internal and passive; the obstacle of distance is overcome by ritual rather than escalating pressure. The cost of the magic is abstract ("latent sacrifice"), lacking a concrete on-page price paid by the character.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are clearly established (survival of the town), and the ritual provides a linear escalation structure. However, the conflict lacks visceral pressure; Iven appears fully in control throughout, and the "spare" wind at the climax feels like a convenient capitulation rather than a hard-won victory born of desperate agency.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake shifts seamlessly from the need to complete a map to the heavy burden of personal responsibility. The climax—realizing the child pressed the button—provides a decisive tightening of the narrative screw with visible, felt emotional cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes are theoretically high (a storm, a dead lamp, ghosts), but they are not operationalized in the scene; the protagonist faces no active opposition or difficult trade-offs. The potential conflict of the light failing is sidelined for a peaceful exchange, resulting in a flat narrative arc where the pressure does not escalate. The ending relies on a philosophical realization rather than the cost of a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the "melancholy sea" offers ambient tension but no active opposition, and the storm is an ally rather than a threat. The arrival of the child functions as a gift rather than a complication, resulting in a flat narrative arc where no meaningful price is paid and no difficult trade-offs are forced.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.6)
    Escalation is clear: observation transitions to active manipulation, which creates a dangerous excess (stories burning like ash) that forces a tactical change. While the stakes are somewhat abstract/aesthetic, the danger to the widow provides enough immediate pressure to anchor the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.7)
    While the internal tension is palpable, the external obstacle (following a sound, digging) yields easily to the protagonist's competence. The conflict is primarily atmospheric and thematic; a sharper moment of resistance or cost before the resolution would heighten the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are high and clearly defined, and the pressure escalates through the weaving process. However, the opposition is primarily entropic (lack of mornings) rather than active resistance, and the resolution—communities willing to give their debts and names—feels slightly smooth. The cost ("sharing scars") is stated conceptually but not deeply felt as a visceral price paid in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clear but intellectualized; the pressure comes from internal shame rather than immediate scene friction. The "tightening" moment ("I nearly stood to flee") is functional, but the resolution—mutual understanding through a magical book—lowers the visceral cost of the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.5)
    Conflict is largely internal and abstract (memory vs. apathy), with the environment providing only mild resistance. While the ritual of cleaning and sharing bread creates a gentle deepening of the stake, the lack of an active antagonist or difficult choice keeps the pressure low; the "cost" is philosophical rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    The pressure of the encroaching oblivion and the storm ("wind scraped sequins") provides a constant, escalating threat that forces the protagonist's hand. The stakes—the erasure of meaning—are abstract but made visceral through the specific mechanics of the library.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.1)
    Escalation is coherent under the Situational lens, but the protagonist functions largely as a manipulator with minimal personal risk. The felt cost of the climax falls entirely on secondary characters (the smuggler’s dignity), leaving Lark's agency high but her personal stakes low.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is negligible; the "storm" presents no immediate physical threat, and the intellectual debate is devoid of tension as the skeptic surrenders instantly. The stakes remain theoretical, resulting in a scene that feels like a lecture rather than a confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.3)
    The central obstacle (the broken lock) provides focus, and the pivot from memory (force) to art (portraiture) creates a functional beat. However, the stakes remain largely internal; the "cost" of opening the box is low on the page, resolving quickly through a magical flair rather than a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.0)
    The conflict escalates beautifully from a personal ethical stance to a city-wide labor strike, forcing a resolution. The stakes are clear and palpable: the trade-off between comfortable lies and necessary, if painful, truths. The protagonist's choice to withhold their craft exerts genuine pressure on the antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.1)
    The conflict is polite and low-stakes; the Keepers arrive, listen, and leave with a bow. While consistent with the "muted" tone, the lack of grit, hard trade-offs, or sustained resistance from the antagonists limits the dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    Escalation is clear: the magnetic shift creates an immediate, physical threat (roses hardening/drinking) that forces a decisive action. The stakes are personal (failure means losing the world) and the resolution requires sacrificing the protagonist's most engaged object (the tin).

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.1)
    The conflict involves high stakes (eviction, neighborhood erasure), but the resolution minimizes the threat; the &quot;outside world&quot; is defeated by a whimsical gesture rather than tactical agency. The antagonist offers no meaningful opposition, crumbling immediately upon receiving a letter, which deflates the tension rather than escalating it to a necessary breaking point.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.8)
    The stakes are abstract ("drowned names"), and the antagonist ("Warden Current") offers only token resistance via "blue warnings" that are easily evaded. The conflict is resolved through a "refusal shaped as a waltz" and a "question," evading any genuine tactical difficulty or trade-off. The climax lacks a sense of danger or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.5)
    The pressure is primarily environmental and internal, generated by the "mischievous" gravity and the risk of losing one's step or memory. While the external opposition (sleeping inspectors) is low-stakes, the conceptual cost of navigating the "feral" gravity and the specific task of retrieving the laugh provides sufficient tension to drive the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the conceptual stakes are high (dystopian future vs. organic peace), the on-page pressure is low; the antagonist (the code) resists briefly but is overcome with ease. The lack of a visible trade-off or painful sacrifice flattens the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are internal and philosophical, maintaining a consistent pressure regarding the "weight" of truth and memory. While effective for a quiet piece, the conflict remains low-key; the tension relies heavily on the narrator's passive receptivity until the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.1)
    While there is a clear objective, the obstacles are minimal; the "quarantined memory" yields to the narrator's method on the first attempt. The cost—"winter in my chest"—is explicitly minimized by the line "did not sting," which dampens the sense of risk and escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are primarily thematic and retrospective; the "city" and "law" are abstract concepts rather than active forces exerting pressure in the scene. Because the protagonist arrives with their mind already made up ("my purpose tonight is to forgive"), there is no active resistance or risk of failure to drive escalation on the page. The cost paid is conceptual (leaving the work unfinished) rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.6)
    Escalation moves effectively from abstract curiosity to personal implication, deepening the stakes with each "question" asked of the canyon. The silence of the stone provides a tangible beat of opposition that heightens the emotional cost of the final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation is steady, but the climax lacks resistance; the corporation surrenders immediately to the "metered hymn," rendering the victory poetic but dramatically low-voltage.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes are clear—spectacle versus appreciation—and the climax requires a tangible cost (the ruined sash, the surrendered whisk). While the pressure is coherent, the antagonist (the councilor) yields somewhat easily, reducing the tension of the central conflict, though the final exchange of the whisk adds necessary weight.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes escalate clearly from physical danger (the storm) to an ideological conflict (myth vs. maintenance). The resolution is earned through competence, though the caretakers' acceptance of the "wrench and metronome" is handled in summary rather than a fully dramatized confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are declared but the antagonism offers little resistance; Mayor Knoll capitulates twice without forcing a difficult trade-off. The resolution arrives without the hard payment the premise promised.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes remain abstract ("holding the air together") and the narrative lacks active conflict; the village accepts the invitation instantly and the magic works without error. The "cost" of emptying the jars is framed as a relief rather than a difficult sacrifice, sapping tension from the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=3.4)
    Tension flatlines at the climax; the antagonist arrives and is instantly pacified by the sound, offering no effective resistance or counter-move. The lack of a "pinch" point where Marek’s plan might fail robs the scene of necessary dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are declared ("cattle doomed") but never felt as a genuine threat because the opposition (the village men) capitulates instantly. The "revolution" faces no meaningful resistance, and the "cost" is abstract patience rather than a tangible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure escalates clearly from the vibrating assignment sheet to the supervisor’s chiming demands. The stakes are raised from a mere procedural finding to a confrontation with systemic negligence, with the protagonist paying a felt price in security to report the truth.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes are clearly defined as spiritual/emotional, but the conflict remains low-pressure and largely internal. The resolution comes relatively easily—the "thorn" is removed without struggle—making the escalation feel gentle rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes are primarily abstract and intellectual (proving a theory) with low immediate external pressure. The escalation is linear and summary-based (try, adjust, wait a month, succeed), lacking a sharp moment of risk or sacrifice that forces a difficult choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes (job vs. truth) are established early and the final choice carries stated professional risk. However, the escalation is mild; the obstacles (the team's shrug, the access bot, the password) crumble immediately upon contact, reducing the felt pressure prior to the climax. The cost is acknowledged but not viscerally paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.3)
    The stakes are clear and the escalation from "rasping throats" to a tense silence is well-managed. The cost is tangible: the protagonist commits to a season of labor. The conflict resolves through a shift in perspective grounded in action, not just words.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are visceral (life/death for the child, suicide/survival for the narrator). The pressure escalates coherently from the "hush" to the snapping buoy and storm. The cost—enduring the "noise" of life and the "fold in patience"—is felt on the page. A strong, thematic tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.5)
    Escalation is minimal; the traveler presents a problem, the narrator offers a metaphorical solution, and she accepts it instantly. The lack of resistance, misunderstanding, or failure creates a flat dynamic where the stakes—while stated—never feel genuinely threatened or tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clearly defined (preserving wisdom vs. the blare), and the midday wind offers a concrete escalation requiring the walker's specific skill. However, the conflict remains largely external and professional; the success feels assured by their competence, lacking a moment where failure feels genuinely imminent or the cost becomes visceral beyond fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are declared ("collective healing") but never tested; the town offers no resistance to the process, and the protagonist faces no risk of failure. The process glides over the complexity of grief, resolving tension with a joke and a mirror trick rather than earned confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.3)
    The stakes are high-concept (the end of language) but remain somewhat abstract; the pressure is intellectual rather than urgent or perilous. While the escalation through the cards works thematically, the "cost" of the final decision is low on immediate, felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes are existential and clear, but the pressure remains largely situational and internal. The "tightening" comes from the rising tide and fog, which is effective, but the conflict lacks a sharp, decisive turning point where options narrow dramatically on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are professional and abstract (capturing data), lacking deep personal risk for the protagonist. The Director serves as a strawman for "impatience," providing only mild external pressure that the protagonist easily navigates with superior wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dramatic tension is undercut by the ease of resolution; a lifetime of estrangement is bridged instantly upon the son's arrival without dialogue or resistance. The goal of a "flawless goodbye" is achieved too flawlessly, removing the possibility of failure or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are primarily philosophical, but the tension is maintained through the precision of the ritual and the resistance of the environment. The cost—a physical mark under the skin and a binding agreement—is legible, effectively closing the loop of the protagonist's desire with a permanent alteration.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clearly defined: the comfort of a false resolution versus the pain of the truth. Pressure escalates from the physical evidence (the tooth) to the living reality of Ari. The conflict is resolved through a physical act (bone setting) that mirrors the narrative choice, though the external antagonism (the town) remains a looming, rather than immediate, threat.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.2)
    Pressure is low; the central conflict (fire vs. safety) is historical rather than immediate, and the environment offers no active resistance. The story lacks a "tightening" moment where the protagonist faces a new obstacle or hard trade-off; the village simply waits and accepts the gift.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clear—the integrity of memory versus viral spectacle—and the "proffer" creates a focused moment of tension. While the resolution comes smoothly through ritual rather than sharp interpersonal friction, the cost of burying the past is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.2)
    Tension is low because the environment and secondary characters are entirely cooperative; the mist opens, the ghosts offer gifts, and the shell guides. The "market" acts as a distant straw man rather than an active opposition. The stakes remain theoretical ("dissolve entirely") rather than felt or visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=2.8)
    Stakes are abstract and the central conflict (restoring rites) meets no opposition; the village follows instructions obediently and the ritual succeeds without peril. The potential internal conflict of "doubt" is dismissed via simile ("wandered off like a fed dog") rather than tested, leaving the story devoid of narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clearly defined (survival/escape) and the environmental pressure is constant. The resolution is earned through the protagonist's skill and endurance, though it lacks a severe cost or painful trade-off to push it into the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.6)
    Conflict is primarily internal and procedural (ordering the chaotic/ephemeral), which fits the fable mode but keeps immediate pressure low. The "slip" of the timer provides a necessary beat of tension that anchors the abstract harvest in physical difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clearly articulated as the risk of calcification, and the escalation from the widow to the soldier to the self provides a solid trajectory. The resolution relies somewhat heavily on the established magic system ("orienting properly") rather than a difficult choice, but the emotional cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.6)
    The kettle functions effectively as a ticking clock, providing necessary structural pressure to the otherwise quiet internal conflict. The stakes are legible, with the decision to leave the wood "scuffed" serving as a meaningful micro-turn that carries the emotional weight of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.5)
    Conflict escalates clearly from a desire for a "bargain" to a demand for "authenticity," forcing the protagonist to pay a real price in "admit, forgive, rebuild, stay." The cost is felt on the page—the dismantling of the "penny city" pride is a specific, resonant loss. The resolution is earned through this emotional payment rather than a magic trick.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict is largely atmospheric; the building and the janitor yield to the protagonist's interventions without significant friction or cost. The "headaches of functioning mercy" are stated as a future cost rather than dramatized in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is entirely internal and lacks urgency; the "struggle" with the abandoned dream faces no concrete obstacles or external pressure. The resolution involves no visible cost or difficult trade-off, merely a shift in mindset that feels easily won.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pressure is minimal; the salvage operation proceeds without physical difficulty, and the antagonist (the engineer) capitulates instantly. There is no escalation or tightening of options; the "serene" approach flattens the stakes rather than testing them.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.0)
    Pressure is low throughout; the stakes remain abstract (preserving methods) and the antagonist (entropy/the knot) yields without extracting a significant price. The "vigil" implies endurance, but the narrative asserts patience rather than dramatizing the difficulty or cost of the wait.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are intimate but clear: the woman’s inability to live with unexplained loss. The escalation through the visionary "bridge of presence" provides a meaningful deepening of the conflict, resolving in a necessary, painful truth.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.6)
    External opposition is negligible; the engineers scoff but immediately assist ("lent him screws"), and the lightning conveniently aids the hatching. The lack of genuine resistance makes the victory feel inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.2)
    Tension is minimal throughout; the environment and the secondary character offer no resistance to the protagonist's goals. The central conflict—healing scars—is treated as a philosophical affirmation rather than a struggle, with the boy nodding along to the lesson instead of challenging it.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.5)
    External conflict is minimal; the antagonist (the broker) is introduced late and dismissed within a paragraph via a hallucinatory deus ex machina. The central struggle is framed as "waiting," which is summarized rather than dramatized, lowering the felt tension. There is no moment where Ilias is genuinely at risk of failing or paying a significant price.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.5)
    Conflict is thematic rather than visceral; the travelers' compliance ("the captain lowers his head") feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle. The stakes are declared ("flame births smoke") but never fully tested, as the opposing force surrenders to the premise without generating significant friction.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.0)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the father is steady, the spectral mother approves, and even the storm leaves the greenhouse untouched. The stakes remain abstract ("discover the shape of collective grief") because the protagonist never faces a forced trade-off, opposition, or a moment where failure is a genuine possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.5)
    The conflict between mechanical exactitude and human messiness is well-staged and escalates clearly during the high-pressure moment of the pendulum's pause. The stakes—community connection and forgiveness—are felt strongly. The resolution offers a meaningful release of tension, trading the safety of control for the risk of connection.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are low and abstract ("discover the shape of intentions"); the protagonist faces no active opposition or risk of failure. The tapestry yields to "kindness," the ground yields easily, and the mystery is resolved by reading documents, resulting in a procedural feel without escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.4)
    The intellectual conflict (freedom vs. constraint) is well-defined, and the pressure of the "Commission" is felt. However, the escalation lacks visceral danger; the doubt phase is brief and the solution (stewardship) arrives without forcing a painful trade-off or sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.5)
    Conflict is largely conceptual—silence vs. story—rather than dramatic. The interaction with Cinder is cooperative and smooth; the protagonist faces little resistance or risk in tuning the radio or accepting the charge. The stakes, while thematically high ("story famine"), feel low in the immediate scene because the cost of failure is not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.3)
    The central conflict—the need to articulate a traumatic past without destroying the survivors—is compelling but resolved largely through internal monologue and symbolic action rather than interpersonal friction. The mother’s capitulation is swift, and the "danger" remains abstract, which fits the theme but lowers visceral stakes. The climax relies on a shared quiet moment rather than a sharp escalation of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes are clear and high (drowning vs. survival), escalating naturally as the factions argue while the water rises. The pressure is coherent, and the protagonist’s agency in using the cog solves the immediate crisis with visible effort and risk.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.9)
    While the stakes of social cohesion are high, the escalation is mostly internal and atmospheric rather than causal; the "unlearning of hatred" happens with minimal on-page resistance. The cost is described metaphorically ("erasing judgments") rather than paid through difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict remains largely abstract; the Council's threat is dismissed with internal monologue ("My rebellion was gentle") rather than tested in scene. The stakes of the "once in a lifetime" alignment feel low because the process proceeds without error or significant external resistance. The protagonist faces no desperate trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.6)
    Conflict is mild; Mara overcomes the narrator's barrier (the riddle) immediately without struggle or trade-off. The stakes are declared (city blackout) but the on-page pressure is low because the solution is surrendered easily.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure is consistent but low-key, fitting the "quiet investigation" mode. The escalation comes from the varying responsiveness of the houses rather than urgent stakes; the conflict remains intellectual and atmospheric rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes remain largely abstract and ideological (nuance vs. certainty) without visceral risk to the protagonist; the antagonist offers minimal resistance before capitulating. The escalation is linear and lacks a moment of doubt or potential failure, making the outcome feel inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are established early and remain high: the struggle against "smooth forgetting" gives emotional weight to the surreal climb. The conflict escalates naturally from physical exhaustion to the metaphysical crisis at the rupture, where the cost of the protagonist's rigor is fully paid in the refusal to step through.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.5)
    Pressure is low throughout; the stakes are thematic (proving kindness) rather than visceral or urgent. While the arrival of the neighbor serves as a pattern break, it functions as a reward rather than a test. The absence of significant obstacles or a "felt cost" for the protagonist's success limits the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes escalate naturally from the loss of names to the burden of selection ("lens was not for seeing but for selecting"). The narrator's choice to bake the "question mark" and later to carry the names into the spray demonstrates agency with visible risk. The cost of responsibility ("sweet and unbearable") is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are clearly escalated by the visions within the radiance, transforming a puzzle-solving quest into a moral choice between selfish escape and tragic reality. The cost is legible on the page—the sacrifice of the "room of unbroken mornings"—satisfying the high-band requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)
    The stakes are existential and immediate ("fear owes me money"), and the pressure escalates from the physical entry to the psychological confession. The confrontation relies on a clever trap, but the cost—unbosoming a deep insecurity—is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure escalates coherently from the warning signs to the gale to the knife-net hazard. However, the protagonist's hyper-competence reduces tension; the "net of knives" is resolved quickly with the same method as the storm, making the victory feel slightly inevitable rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from the abstract risk of the "sunwashed dread" to the concrete warning of the mother's fate. The "deepening" occurs when the protagonist realizes the watchers are indifferent measures rather than benevolent gods, forcing a higher-stakes decision to proceed.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.1)
    Internal stakes are clear and escalate well from academic curiosity to a heavy moral burden regarding the grandfather's legacy. The cost is emotional and reputational, solidified by the decision to publish the method alongside the facts, satisfying the "emotionally rational" constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=3.9)
    There is negligible pressure or opposition; the river "loosens its grip" and the water "calms," removing external threats early. The physical obstacles (rusted door, stuck cabinet) are overcome easily, and there are no visible stakes or costs associated with failure. The narrative observes rather than struggles.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stakes are intellectual and historical—truth versus fabrication—but are dramatized effectively through the physical actions of the stamp and the ledger. The escalation works well, moving from general suspicion to specific, incriminating proof (the pumps/anchors). While the lack of active, present-tense opposition keeps the pressure "quiet," the conceptual weight of the discovery provides sufficient narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    The conflict is primarily internal but successfully externalized through the "rupture" of the vision and the shadow’s physical return. The escalation—from polishing lenses to folding steam to releasing the flock—raises the stakes of the ritual appropriately. While the opposition is abstract, the pressure of the "ache" is sustained until the final release.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation is internal but coherent; the discovery forces a stance crystallization (the "dare"). While external opposition is distant, the tension between the narrator's intent and the commander's utility sustains the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.2)
    The conflict is purely philosophical, and the stakes remain abstract ("belonging") without a visceral sense of risk or failure. The resolution comes through a shift in perspective rather than a forced trade-off or significant on-page cost, keeping tension low.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.3)
    The stakes of truth versus manufactured safety are clear and present throughout. The tension escalates well during the search, though Mara’s reaction—"tempered regret" rather than fury—resolves the conflict somewhat too smoothly, reducing the potential emotional cost of the protagonist’s years of deception.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are clear, and the "snag" on the name provides necessary escalation. However, the resolution creates a deflation of pressure rather than a tightening; the conflict dissolves via a speech rather than a costly trade-off or difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are legible, but the internal resistance is overcome with relatively low friction ("for once I did not retreat"), missing a moment of genuine struggle or cost. The external rescue proceeds without complication, which lowers the felt pressure of the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—the protagonist's conscience—is pressurized effectively through the baseball, which acts as a physical gauge for internal truth. The escalation is palpable as the ball heats up, forcing a trade-off between physical pain and the release of truth. The cost is legible in the "guilt returned as steam" and the forfeiture of the clean slate.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.3)
    The stakes are intimate but high—the total loss of connection versus the sacrifice of self-definition. The crisis moment ("Let me in, or let me go") forces a clear, irreversible trade-off, though the protagonist's reluctance feels slightly more narrated than dramatized in the beat before the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure escalates effectively from general malaise to specific, painful confessions (the cough, the unbraided hair). The cost is legible on the page: the mother must trade her desire for perfection for the painful clarity of admitting her failures.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.4)
    The conflict is primarily man-against-mechanism, but the resistance offered by the lock is overcome with relative ease through the established "calibrated gladness." There is a lack of visceral cost or a moment of "tightening" where the protagonist's method fails or requires a painful sacrifice; the "wolves" are mentioned but do not bite on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are high (survival vs. panic) and managed through a quiet, situational pressure that holds the reader's attention. The protagonist pays a subtle emotional cost by accepting the "vanity" of prophecy to ensure the village's safety, satisfying the requirement for earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.1)
    Stakes are declared but never genuinely tested; the arrival of the antagonist (Rhun) sets up a climax that immediately deflates when he joins the protagonist without argument or leverage. The absence of a difficult choice or sacrifice renders the "revolution" weightless, failing to escalate pressure into a meaningful closure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are high and the trade-off (a life for a life/destiny) is structurally sound. However, the protagonist's agency in the climax is overshadowed by the Herder's decisive sacrifice, and the narrator's agreement to the cost lacks the visceral hesitation or struggle that would heighten the dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story lacks genuine opposition or high-stakes friction; the storm is a cooperative backdrop, and the caretaker is a helpful guide who affirms the poet immediately. The "vigil" is a shared ritual rather than a test of will, and the protagonist faces no significant obstacles or difficult choices once inside the dome. The result is a scene of confirmation rather than conflict, lowering the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.5)
    Tension escalates cleanly from verbal sparring to physical combat, with the duel serving as a perfect externalization of the philosophical debate. The stakes are clear within the story's logic, though the abstract nature of the "prize" relies heavily on the reader accepting the fable's rules.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the conceptual stakes (beauty vs. anarchy) are high, the on-page conflict is muted. The opposition (police, city notice) is passive and easily ignored, meaning the protagonist's resistance is never truly tested by an acute obstacle in the scene. The escalation is textural (more people, more light) rather than pressure-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.0)
    The conflict between human art and mechanical time is established early, but the escalation is gentle and linear. The protagonist faces "resistance" from the clock, but the victory feels inevitable rather than hard-won; the stakes remain philosophical rather than visceral or risky.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.5)
    The approaching monsoon provides clear, coherent pressure that forces the ritual's timing. However, the conflict is largely external (Man vs. Nature/Entropy) with little friction in the execution; the protagonist and Iru perform the steps without a moment of genuine peril or hard trade-off, limiting the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure accumulates effectively as the protagonist navigates the landscape, culminating in the rising tides that force the confession. The cost is felt in the surrender of the "discipline" the narrator previously prized.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake of calibrating gentle change tightens accumulatively via solo-to-group escalation, narrowing to shared algorithm with felt cost of foregoing theatrics in "modest" plan that forecloses dramatic fixes.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (sound of trust breaking) signaled early, tightens texturally via bowl on diver then personal plate, narrowing to prelude hearing. Agency in imprinting tests commitment; cost felt in "rooms stopped collapsing" and gentler replication. Escalation coheres under Accumulative lens without reversal overload.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (hear destiny via summons) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through bouquet reading to jar-unlocking revival; agency in unstoppering jar forecloses failure with legible cost in mentor's state, reweighting craft under Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake of crafting safe inquiry vessels escalates accumulatively via embodied effort ("arms shook") narrowing to abandonment of fear; cost legible in "nothing brittle had to break for truth to pass."

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (vulnerability as power) signaled early, tightens via cipher deepening knowledge; agency in decryption/climb narrows options under lens. Cost unmistakable in breath break/reknit before planning; no coincidence resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake of mapping endless night tightens texturally when courier admits burn mission and space "opens where his fear had been," forcing renunciation with cost of torn sleeve and altered path.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (origin of thoughts via loops/practice) signaled early, tightens accumulatively as notes pile into "quiet mechanical blossom," narrowing to endurance with cost of reconciling mismatched schedules/generator failure. One deepening (errors amalgamate) forces stance crystallization; agency in attention/sweeping forecloses doubt, though pressure stays introspective without external reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (thaw mistrust post-failure) signaled early, textural escalation via doodle revelations narrowing options (curator shielded, not hoarded). Agency in projection/confession forecloses hiding path; cost legible ("decide if the ledgers deserve me"). Minor abstractness in "blame pulsed like a negative" softens visceral peak slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (prove garden reciprocity) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via objection and confession narrowing deception path; agency in explaining "why I had lied" forces trade-off, cost in relenting hedges felt.

    Dominant stake (save mantas/prove theory) signaled early, escalates via probe lattice tightening to inversion reversal under Accumulative lens; agency in Jae's field tuning forecloses lateral trap with repair cost; pressure coheres without reversal overload.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (unravel code without drowning) signaled early, escalates texturally via pattern-deepening (stains to score to baton); one tightening at reflection-crossing forecloses disobedience with felt fear/cold cost. Agency in obedience narrows options coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (weigh truth) signaled early and deepens accumulatively through oracle's exercises to verbal naming, forcing renunciation with shoulder-release cost; minor abstractness in initial lie withhold slightly mutes peak agency.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake to measure swallowed truth deepens accumulatively via wheel-turn agency against radio/echo interruptions; cost unmistakable in arms' weight foreclosing ghostly belief.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (nurture wonder amid grief) signaled early, tightens via Ada's story-to-locket progression under Accum lens, narrowing to shared totality with agency in guitar placement. Cost legible in Ada's persistent "question mark" grief, reweighting options.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake of collecting wall-stories tightens via disk discovery narrowing options to endurance as absorber; agency in rearranging forecloses old order with felt porous cost, charged in closing pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (transpose via open secrets) signaled early, tightens accumulatively to public projection narrowing hide/reveal options; agency in boiling/inking/feeding machine, cost legible ("night unfolded... everyone finally looked"; agent fooled).

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (prevent possession completion, avert tilt) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via loop density and rhetoric ("voice shivered"); agency in priest's layered inquiries forces whisper's exposure with visible cost (Mara "stepping into a photograph"). Escalation driven by on-page choices under lens.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake to conduct unheard symphonies signaled early, escalates accumulatively through memory notches tightening to breath-instructions, agency in shell-warming and wind-cueing foreclosing command-path with felt silence-cost in "orchestra I invented is only listening."

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (conquer labyrinth via retrace) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through tuned timelines and branch visions narrowing to message-driven lowering; agency in following pattern forecloses flight-path with on-page cost of "subtraction made room."

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (archive innovation within constraint) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through bead-threads to canal/hinges and fear-modeling reversal. Agency in micro-choices forecloses pure forms; cost felt in blind spots/misuse fear charging quill-lift.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (teach dust stories) signaled early, escalates texturally via lyric density to dust curling into letters; agency in copying/tapping forces trade-off of hidden glow for animation. Cost unmistakable in promise foreclosing open broadcast, charging poise. One tightening sufficient, coherent under lens.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake of honest art via incomplete info signaled early, tightens accumulatively through visitor tremors and chair's rhythm resuming pressure. Agency in scattering ash and installing chair forecloses direct confession path with cost of ambiguity. One deepening suffices; minor abstract stakes slightly tempers.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—cog as method vs. narrative demands—tightens via noon tide jam, forcing narrator's agency to lead and wedge cog, foreclosing parade/lie option. Escalation under hybrid lens: density to situational pressure culminates in shins-kissed cost, reweighting options undeniably. Moral calculus between competing goods (save cog, save quarters) sharpens peak.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake of braiding voices tightens texturally via Rafi/Ola flashes to rosette catch, narrowing relational options; performance taps coinciding forecloses hatred path with unclenching cost legible in fist image.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    Pruning's bitter saps ("unfinished homework") deepen stake under accumulative lens, narrowing to communal trade-off; council ordinance adds moral cost legible in sharing.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (understanding alive houses) signaled early, escalates accumulatively: first house shelters story, second resists (tightening via cold shard), third deepens with tin patience; agency in shard placement forces trade-offs. Cost felt in "hands trembled with the weight of tiny vows." Subtle, no sharp reversal, fits lens but tempers peak.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stake of nuance vs. certainty signaled early escalates accumulatively through scholar's recoil and Oris's threading agency, foreclosing certainty with delay's felt cost in bone-deep patience. One deepening cascade narrows to diffusion reconfiguration under lens. Moral calculus between stall and surrender sharpens peak.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stake to capture texture tightens texturally via rupture pattern break, forcing endurance; refusal to exit forecloses path, cost felt in preserved "fabric woven with pause."

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (rescue arts vs. embalming fear) signaled early, deepens via lens test narrowing options; agency in baking/ritual forecloses cold history path, but stranger's arrival borders coincidental complication.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake to transcend fate signaled early, tightens accumulatively via yoyo solve deepening to cost-laden visions (keeper's death thread), forcing renunciation agency. Escalation coheres under lens with one decisive cadence shift; moral calculus of threads forecloses options on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (trick fear) signaled early, escalates via agency (write paradox, photograph) under Accumulative lens, tightening to shadow's confession and cost-legible escape (clasp workaround). One decisive deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant survival stake signaled early via gale prediction, deepens accumulatively with fractal lattice and tower forcing trade-offs (deck tilts); agency in dubbing forecloses snapping paths with on-page cost like net hazard adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (question watchers/mother's fate) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via ledger reading that forces agency (third whistle note, step forward) narrowing options with legible cost in shimmer of thinned silence. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake of truth-rescue tightens via scrap pattern emergence, narrowing to admission over accusation; agency in charting forces trade-off, with cost felt in "truth without contempt" charging ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (archeologist of dreams) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening rooms and program find, forcing endurance of "interlaced absence." One tightening in deepest room narrows to "hushed blaze" restraint. Agency in note placements forecloses repair illusion with cost of isolation ("no one expects a voice"); legible in "history will not lower itself," charging final alight stance.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (tracing origins) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via deepening discoveries narrowing rehearsed truths. Agency in stamping forces trade-offs, culminating in hiding stamp with felt cost of isolation from doctrine. One tightening sufficient; band entry via option foreclosure in journal margin.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (fold grief via cranes to reclaim shadow) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through vision rupture and steam-bent wings that lift "shard of ache"; agency in transforming/brewing forecloses full return, with cost in loosened but absent weight felt at chest touch. Pressure coheres to Charged Poise without coincidence resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (hunt unused potential) signaled early, tightens texturally via basin unspooling and shoulder blaze narrowing to "coordinates... like a dare."

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (decode belonging) signaled early tightens accumulatively via algorithm shift reading silence as letter, forcing agency that narrows to resonant invitation.

    Stake of withheld truth signaled early, deepens accumulatively through plank discoveries narrowing to confession; relational cost felt in Mara's tempered regret forecloses false protection path.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (peaceful untethering) signaled early, tightens at snag where tempers climb, forcing defusal trade-off. Agency in speeches forecloses argument path with felt cost (shoulders drop). Accumulative pressure coheres to Charged Poise; one deepening sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (align heart/action vs. regrets) signaled early, tightens via agency when "nosed the kayak toward the boy" foreclosing retreat; cost felt in chest-burn/remembered map; lens escalation via density to crystallized poise.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (kindle empathy) signaled early tightens accumulatively to truth revelation and stay-decision, foreclosing escape with cost (useful ache). Agency in ear-guided doors, risk-payment paddle, and fork crystallization; moral calculus between cleaner hands or ferrying others viscerally felt. One deepening via machine exhale suffices under lens.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (safe extraction via orchestrated hush) signaled early, escalates texturally as strangers sync rhythms then crowd follows light, narrowing to collective poise. Agency in "urged them to stand where the sand remembered" forces trade-off (myth risk). Cost unmistakable in calm plume without panic.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (dim fort for town’s night) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via Rhun’s challenge forcing invitation with relational cost. Agency in "I do, I say" forecloses confrontation path. One deepening suffices; cost legible in captain’s throat-clearing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (brother's rescue via tide grammar) signaled early, deepens accumulatively through sequences narrowing options to her tethering; agency in agreeing and bracing forecloses chase with her cost. No live option left unpriced at door.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake of scar cartography signaled early, escalates accumulatively via timer presses, photo reveal, and scar-tracing tightening that narrows denial options with visible endurance cost. Caretaker's guidance complicates but poet's agency in timing and poem-speaking drives. Cost unmistakable in "courage would echo," charging poise.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (decode message to destination) signaled early; escalation via Rook's thesis-thrust and sundial rearrangement narrows to trade-off (lose/proceed). Agency in riposte and invitation to Rook forces stance crystallization. Cost legible in "faltered... invitation to lose and proceed simultaneously."

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (forge beauty pre-molt vs. demolition) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via people/strangers' integration and siren endurance, forcing stance crystallization in rebuild. Visible cost: shelves "stop shivering," door "click... promise," but molt fragments pressure. Agency in penny spill and reading narrows to practice.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.1)
    Encore stake escalates accumulatively through compass-guided chords to hymn/lullaby; protagonist agency in sustained play forces fate's yield, cost felt in station pull and earned hush.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake to plant before monsoon tightens via dreams to saddle then Iru's conch match; agency in pressing seed forecloses evasion with felt salt-memory cost.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (find color of apologies) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via lace reading and tide pull, narrowing to speaking with trade-off cost ("set them to drift" forecloses silence). Agency in obedience-then-renunciation tightens under lens; moral calculus between discipline and honesty sharpens peak. Minor abstractness in stakes slightly mutes visceral peak, but closure charges undeniably.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—can she read damage without melodrama—tightens when she chooses sweeping over mourning; each stroke narrows her options from rescue to calibration. Escalation is Accumulative: grime patterns replace starquake graphs, reweighting the stake with visible patience-cost. No external antagonist is needed; the flood’s residue is coherent pressure. The final plastic-sheet patch is a small, credible trade-off that forecloses full repair, paying the price on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—artistic integrity vs. survival—signaled in line 2. One meaningful tightening: realization that returning/destroying the ledger both fail; the annealed midpoint is forced. Cost is conceptual (reputation risk, exposure to guild) rather than visceral, but legible. Agency is interior yet decisive; coincidence absent.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—translate silence into shareable meaning—tightens when early “wrong readings” blister lilies, forcing him to true the algorithm. The middle beat of walking the riverbank to map frost-to-pulse visibly pays a cost in time & exposure, altering later tactics (leaf weights). Final performance forecloses the old audible world forever; silence remains, but meaning now travels temperature, not air—undeniable price under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—“give rest a permanent address”—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates from personal vow to civic infrastructure. The plankton rune and harbor lantern reply materialize the cost: he has traded his own mortality registry for the city’s, an irreversible tightening. Agency is continuous: every shard aligned is a renunciation of return. No coincidence resolves; the sea’s patience merely recognizes the new address system.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—community survival under sanctions—tightens through escalating night-runs, patrol proximity, and the arbor standoff; each bell-ring deepens knowledge that anonymity is life. Agency is distributed but coherent: Mara’s pairings, teen swagger, elder stories all feed the braid. Visible cost is legible: goat-chaff in snow, “fewer boots,” and the grandmother-knitting-rapper symmetry shows scarcity braided into care. One minor softness: no single protagonist’s option is irrevocably foreclosed on-page, holding it below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“where does unused love go?”—is signaled early. Escalation is breath-driven intensification rather than external opposition: each exhale narrows storage options until the body must open. Cost is visible: relinquishing the hoarded sweetness leaves the narrator hollow but river-fed; stranger receives transferable rhythm. No coincidence; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens. Could use slightly sharper external jeopardy to enter 8.5+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can grief be given exits without being devoured?—is signaled in blueprint memory and tightened when every exit reopens as mouth. Agency: each bridge taken is a conscious step into deeper retrocognitive debt; lungs fill with “pale roar” as visible price. One meaningful turn: acceptance of continual fading crystallized by swallowing halo-light; no off-stage rescue. Escalation is accumulative/textural: coral-like curves multiply density until the final image can no longer stabilize.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—liberate drought-proof futures—tightens when scavenger-enforcers breach, forcing her to spend the arrow and risk capture. A single meaningful turn suffices: the ticket-jam buys descent time and visibly costs her the arrow’s future use. Price is legible (chain as sling, seeds as weight), though the enforcers’ threat is brief; the wall’s roar supplies ambient but not personal cost. Meets 8.8 band; would need a sharper personal stake (injury, betrayal) to breach 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—capture the sound of trust breaking—tightens when the narrator realizes the fracture must be recorded *before* rupture. The diver’s grief becomes the first live test; the forgone lawsuit becomes the final blank plate. Cost is legible: the inventor must archive his own almost-betrayal, then gift the pattern away. One beat shy of 8.8 because the external antagonist (ex-partner) stays off-stage; pressure is memory-bound rather than interpersonal.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: can one “own” an illuminated moment without theft? Pressure escalates texturally: bouquet’s warning, disused track, locked door, blank negatives—each layer heightens consequence of mis-use. Protagonist’s agency is reactive until final jar-opening; prior steps follow mentor’s trail rather than force active trade-offs. Cost legible—mentor’s vanishing, thief’s vocation re-defined—but price is off-loaded onto mentor earlier, muting felt stake for narrator during ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes—crafting zones safe for inquiry—are signaled early and tighten when physical limits (no grid, only one fuel canister) force Arlen to breed heat from patience. Narrating mundane tasks becomes the only tool to hold terror at bay; each narrated beat raises the cost of failure. The final stance crystallizes when he abandons old fear, leaving the vessels as lived proof; price is legible in shaking arms and kiln’s dying ember.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—identity ownership—tightens when cipher demands literal body memory (broken-bone dates). Each decoded phrase narrows options until rooftop confrontation forecloses anonymity. Cost visible: shared name spoken = debts revive, knives await. Escalation is accretive, not causal, fitting lens; one meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can attention become thought?—tightens when the janitor trades broom for bow, risking streaks (failure) for resonance. Each loop deepens rather than widens: salt trail, donor plaque, generator failure incrementally raise the cost of attention. No coincidence resolves; the failing generator deepens the hush that forces the final renunciation. Price is visible: frost burns non-existent warmth into rime recordings.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can communal trust survive projector sabotage—tightens when each ticket-doodle narrows possible culprits. Mid-story reveal that troupe tested, not sabotaged, flips blame vector under causal lens. Registrar’s public confession is decisive pressure point; no off-stage rescue. Cost = loss of anonymous authority; plaza laughter stays gentle to protect fragile hush.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—garden’s recognition—tightens when the maze objects to the false marble miracle; escalation is the hedge-hiss and shivering dials. The protagonist’s agency is the kneeling confession, which forecloses the option to keep the deception. Cost is visceral: public admission, loss of “withered vine dresser” mystique, and the vine’s half-wither verdict. No coincidence rescues; luck only measures, never solves.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—recover the missing mantas—signalled in line 3; pressure tightens when surge-pull risks station blackout and personal erasure. Escalation is one coherent climb: missing flock → probe mapping → lever gamble → lattice inversion → homecoming; each step forecloses retreat. Price is continuously legible: frostbite, ozone cough, heart-beat reckoning, and finally the quiet admission that he too is drifting sideways. No coincidence; even the twilight nexus is pre-seeded by geomagnetic data. Agency is technologist’s: calculation, solder, invert field—yet the cost is flesh and identity. Sufficient for this length, but the ethical dimension (should time be bled?) stays latent rather than tested, keeping it shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake: break drowning-loop by conducting silence. Tightening occurs when score-of-rests appears; options narrow to “step on reflections only.” Agency is attention-based, yet price is off-page—musician leaves dry, loop broken by baton raise alone. Still, silence-as-bridge reweights stakes under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten from abstract guilt to embodied balance test; soot-marked fulcrum literalizes “sway” and forecloses avoidance. Oracle’s request to speak “from margins” forces public naming, cost felt via tremoring paper and storm onset—one meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—measure the weight of a swallowed truth—tightens when each quarter-turn raises literal pressure in the pipe, making abstract guilt tactile. One meaningful deepening suffices: the moment water rattles farther on, the narrator grasps that “normal means are heavy.” Agency is continuous; no outside coincidence intervenes. Cost is felt in shivering muscle and the decision to leave the valve open, forfeiting easy condemnation.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the motif of measurable weight—radio timestamps, iron grams, pressure gauges—until the closing refusal to measure guilt in sermons. Subtextual indictment of industrial cruelty stays implicit; the partner’s drunk whisper is never moralized. The final image reweights “tools” over “proof,” letting the wheel become a secular sacrament. No tidy forgiveness is offered; the town’s ghost shift keeps rattling, proving habit outlives conscience.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“witness without judgment”—is declared early and holds, but pressure never tightens; flood, alphabet rearrangement, and wall-collapse occur off-page or are absorbed without trade-off. No moment forces the keeper to risk complicity or partiality, so the oath remains untested. Escalation is textural (density of decay images) rather than option-narrowing; agency is observational. Cost is ecological and conceptual, not personal, keeping tension atmospheric, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake: can shared sound keep Ada’s grief porous? Pressure tightens once moon bite audible → temperature drop → locket passed to strings; Ada’s micro-choice to reclaim it steadied crystallizes the single meaningful turn with felt cost (her whispered request for a lower key).

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes—“collect stories before silence forgets their grammar”—are signalled in paragraph three and tighten when the historian realises the axis displacement unseated dreams themselves. The single meaningful escalation occurs when he rotates shelving along the new gravitational skew: this act narrows his future to lifelong custodianship, pays a physical cost (palms bitten, knees ground). No antagonist required; pressure is ontological and accrued through textured repetition. Coincidence is absent; escalation is purely agency-driven under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: can the narrator make the town acknowledge its own open secrets? Escalation is accumulative: each fortune cookie tightens the whisper-net until the lighthouse flash forces visibility. Agency is present—he brews ink, feeds the lens—but the cost is borne by others; his own flesh never pays. The tightening lands cleanly: “everyone finally looked,” a Charged Poise that forecloses the old etiquette of seeing/not-seeing.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“tilt and slide” of the whole neighborhood—stays abstract but is made visceral through Mara's bodily risk; one tightening suffices. The whisper’s attempt to anchor inside her provides coherent pressure; the decisive refusal is hers, not luck. Cost is the laugh that forgives nobody, felt on-page. Stakes could be even sharper if we sensed one concrete neighborhood consequence beyond the metaphorical tilt.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure tightens through density increase: each mapped memory raises the stakes of being heard until the protagonist trades control for reception. The visible cost is the cooled, sated shell—an instrument relinquished—signaling the foreclosed path of mastery-through-sound.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—personal integrity vs. state obfuscation—is signaled early and tightens once: surrender forged charts or risk capture. The sideways exit forecloses negotiation, paying the price of perpetual outsider status; cost is visible in the dusk-soaked bench left behind. No second reversal, but the single deepening is sufficient under Accumulative lens. The quarantine stays abstract, slightly blunting visceral jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can the narrator bear the absent scent—tightens when UV script surfaces, foreclosing ignorance. Escalation is textural: each sensory reveal (shadow-music, pollen silence, dawn-shard bud) ups the emotional tariff. The single bud opening acts as the decisive intensification; options narrow to stay or flee, and the promise to return costs future exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can one read time without breaking what feels—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates via each unearthed footprint that increases moral pressure (“ethics of change are playful or cruel”). The impossible-choice concept is dramatized at climax: mirror forgives or annuls; rope demands consent. Cost is visible: poet kneels, sees self as runner, accepts braided consequence. One decisive tightening suffices; agency remains internal yet active.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“will the hush yield to shared unfinished song?”—tightens as each object dropped into the bowl increases communal obligation. The single reversal is the tide pulling doors ajar: passive event reframed as invitation that forces the stance crystallization. Cost is visible: the violinist relinquishes the marble (keeps shell) and accepts “gentle obligations” that will require return visits. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict—only the collective decision to follow the footprints.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can insight fuse with empathy before charts harden—is signaled early and deepens through the scented ritual. Escalation is textural: each inhalation thickens the air’s “forgiving weight,” narrowing options until the only remaining act is surrender of the product. Agency is interior but decisive: the narrator chooses to let the counterfeit go, forfeiting control and ledger entry. The price is the loss of protective detachment; the static hum moves from sales tool to shared nervous system.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“uplift silent contributors”—is signaled early; pressure mounts modestly as townsfolk hesitate to inscribe names. The signing moment itself is the single decisive tightening that makes civic gratitude irreversible; cost is symbolic (public exposure of humility) rather than material, but legible. No antagonist needed; internal risk of “recognition can be risky” provides low-grade tension that plateaus rather than escalates further. Escalation is present but gentle, adequate for lyric/accumulative mode yet short of visceral punch demanded for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—access the pre-echo moment—tightens with each borrowed breath; options narrow from open sketching to a single slit of time the illustrator can hold open only seconds. Cost is visceral: forearms bruised by larval touch, bell-warning of repayment, final forfeiture of control. Agency drives escalation: he chooses to pinch steam-seconds, chooses to release the larva, chooses to accept debt. One micro-turn—sealing the oval—flips hunter-to-midwife; no external coincidence intervenes.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—coherence over reunion—is signaled in line 1 and sharpened when he “speaks the names he never could pronounce without shaking,” a tightening that forecloses magical recovery as option. Escalation is textural: each spiral of fruit and knot in rope adds density until the pendulum eyes make longing a visible variable. Cost is legible—he leaves the eyes behind, accepting perpetual unclosed watch as the price of gentler mathematics. No coincidence; every forward move is an experiment he performs on himself.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—remain unseen while becoming needed—tightens exactly once when the girl’s whisper of “mother” vibrates the tape, forcing the dweller to choose revelation-by-proxy. Cost is palpable: he forfeits the narcotic of total erasure, accepts future risk of detection. No external antagonist is required; the conflict is stance-vs-longing, and the narrowing is irreversible. Agency is continuous: every crawl, cache-open, and chalk-mark is an intentional tactic under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—control vs. listening—tightens through each gust and loosened knot. Agency is renunciation rather than conquest; the final trellis vow forecloses the old gardener identity with felt cost. Escalation is accretive, not causal-turn, but density increase reweights options legitimately under Accumulative lens. No coincidence; weather complicates, Mara adapts.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—who may carry the wonder outward—tightens once: the guide’s prophecy veto versus the baker’s open palm. The pearl’s roll is the visible turn that forecloses her path; cost is legible in her emptied certainty. Pressure accrues sonically rather than through new reversals; one meaningful deepening suffices, but a second tightening would lift it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: can the harbor relearn how to welcome without parades? Pressure escalates through accumulating absences—each staggered tap narrows the solution space from music to spacing to shared rhythm. The protagonist’s agency is precisely reactive: he refuses to compose, forcing the city to supply the cadence. Cost is the forfeiture of curatorial control; the final ledger entry “credits and losses speaking plainly” is the visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—“find the fortress of unspoken truths”—tightens when the dare demands payment “with patterns you understand,” forcing a trade-off between maps and access. Escalation is textural: each punched circle increases the audible rail-promises until the dare crystallizes options. Agency remains protagonist-driven; no outside force punches for him. The price is the maps themselves, now borderless, and the erased timetable—he can never return to prior certainty. Under Accumulative lens, density of punched holes finally reweights the stake from discovery to surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: can disciplined pattern-making create a habitable space for grief without supernatural surrender? Escalation is textural—each new pattern (logbook smudges, tile sums, whale arcs) thickens the silence until refusal to “traffic in ghosts” softens into co-creating the immaterial room. Tightening beat: placing the shell in the center square irrevocably fuses data and memory; refusal to claim magic while still occupying the room forecloses pure rational exit. Cost is perpetual custodianship of others’ unfinished stories.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“what happens after goodbye”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened when the corridor appears: each step is a syllable that never arrived, narrowing options to witness or retreat. Agency is contemplative but real: the narrator pays with frost-thick centuries, Lio pays with softened refusal—both prices legible in the final image. Escalation is lyrical, not causal: density of farewells accumulates until spatial infrastructure flips, a valid Accumulative turn. No antagonist is needed; the heart’s own bridge-building is the mutiny.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—“fair trade that cancels debts”—tightens when the narrator realizes the ledger itself becomes the bribe evidence, swapping moral purity for legal ammunition. Escalation is one continuous ratchet: each institutional sound (vent sigh, alarm chime) shrinks temporal safe space. Visible price: the warm table spot is scrubbed clean, erasing Arman’s living heat—felt loss that forecloses retreat to old identity. No coincidence; every narrowing is authored by micro-decisions under camera gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—whether silence will be broken or transfigured—tightens as each invented history forecloses the possibility of factual return. Escalation is textural: density of fables grows until the town’s real voice is irreversibly replaced. Narrator’s agency drives every deepening; no external coincidence. Cost is legible in the final alms-packing: gold, ink, and solitude spent without prospect of repayment.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can the erased man force acknowledgement of his survival without re-entering the bureaucratic net—tightens when he decides to deliver the label instead of confronting officials. The meaningful deepening occurs at the mechanic’s whisper: the shipment route becomes actionable intel, narrowing his options to private confrontation. Cost is felt (widow’s fear, clerk’s withdrawal), but because the protagonist risks no tangible penalty (guards already ignore him), the escalation lacks a visible price that alters his next moves—hence held below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—decode the universal riddle before tide erases it—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens through each harmonic probe. Escalation is textural: pattern of hums increases density until the sky’s stitched smile complicates options. Agency stays active—he turns the shell when it “bites,” he draws the crooked bow that invites the page-figure. Cost is the forfeiture of certainty: kindness, not proof, becomes gravity.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prevent privatised fencing—tightens when Nessa barters a season’s delay; the visible price is her chip’s symbolic patrimony pressed into corporate paint. Escalation is textural/accumulative: fences "look lost" as colour-coded crowd eddies reroute revenue, a pattern break the liaison must tablet. One credible loss: the brother’s divided loyalty is openly strained, supplying personal cost to political manoeuvre. No meaningful counter-pressure after the liaison concedes; stakes plateau rather than double-back.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—capture the final song before extinction—signals early and tightens with each colored flame. Agency is observational but still decisive: the shutter press forecloses rescue, paying undeniable emotional cost. Pressure escalates via chemical countdown and moth emergence, both legible under accumulative lens. Coincidence absent; escalation turns on narrator’s mindful endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single stake: couple freight before fog thickens further. Escalation is the fog folding thicker after first car settles, nullifying the water-mirror method. Artisan’s agency is relentless—she rescripts the drone’s buffer mid-air and physically points the final alignment. Cost is visible: the drone’s battery warmth against her wrist, the apprentice’s soaked sleeve, the depot’s audible exhalation—options narrow to “right two fingers” or catastrophe.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—record elusive headwaters without domesticating them—tightens via each condensation reading; final valve turn forecloses static mapmaking. Agency visible: protagonist turns wheel while speaking dialect prayer, pays price of endless following. No reversals needed under Accumulative lens; density and cadence shift suffice. Cost legible: perpetual itinerancy now required.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring shared balance—tightens through rhythmic entrainment: each paced measure forecloses abandonment and makes remaining cost time/seasons. No antagonist, but the dissonance inside stone and marriage is pressured until the bell’s soft chord reweights options; price is legible in the mother’s trembling story and the winter they must now keep time.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—crew air ticking—surfaces early and re-enters via gauge reminder mid-tightening. Escalation is density/cadence: narrowing corridor, scraping tank, silt swallow, then transmitter thrum—each beat adds acoustic or tactile pressure rather than causal twist. Protagonist agency: unsnarling line, exhaling tones, corking vial—all foreclose retreat. Visible price: vial becomes “small bell of collected silence,” emblem of risk assumed.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“trade false alarms for a truer bell”—is signaled early. Pressure escalates by accretion of sensory detail; the arrival of the boat is the first external complication, but agency remains internal (will he speak?). One meaningful tightening: placing lattice over drain surrenders the option to expose the bodies. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; the final hush forecloses confession.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake: can the keeper accept that awakening the trees demands perpetual self-wakefulness? Escalation is textural: each apparition adds density until silence itself becomes the tightening. The carved bead’s drop quivers graft scars—an on-page reversal that forecloses the option of remaining asleep. Cost is visible: he must guard the night orchard forever, trading personal dawn for theirs.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“salvage or surrender”—tightens when the wall loosens its breath and Sera must decide: retreat with plate or leave it as harbor seed. One meaningful deepening: the nets stop grieving once their names are sewn. Cost is the plate itself, surrendered to stone. Escalation is accumulative: each chalk crossing adds weight until the final sluice exhale.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure mounts by textured accretion: each chalk symbol decoded, each arch passed, narrows the option field until only one alias survives; the busker’s note is the visible price that crystallizes the stake in the body of the namer.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. survival—tightens when the whisper reveals forged star routes. One meaningful deepening: the jester-hat stitch turns the narrator from passive listener to active saboteur, foreclosing anonymity. Cost is legible—blood on cloth, future blame—yet the escalation is slightly abstract (no immediate physical jeopardy on page), keeping it just below the 9-band. Still, the accretive pressure under the Textural lens is coherent and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“to find the moment before deciding”—is signaled in line 4 and re-priced at the end when the moment is witnessed, not reclaimed. Escalation is textural: each spirit-sung phrase and condensation-letter tightens the ethical pressure to stop rehearsing escape and start rehearsing stillness. The decisive turn is the protagonist’s request “Bring me that hour” met by water’s reply: a slick page that forces honest look, foreclosing denial. Cost is palpable—the reopened palm, the shame spoken aloud—and alters tactics: practice answering ripples with stillness.</question>
    <question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme emerges through the repeating image of the hinge/pause: the heron “bright as a comma” and the final “white door” recast almost-moments as living syntax. Subtext resides in silence—not as armor but as shared breath the protagonist finally consents to inhabit. Epiphany is earned: “let silence not be armor” arrives via condensation letters, not authorial sermon. The ending’s resonant reconfiguration—time as breathable hinge—lingers without moral tag.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will shared anxiety drown or tether?—is signaled in the boy’s cartoon cloud stitched from both islands’ words. Escalation is textural: each decoded smear thickens the common bruise until the coral-turned-key punctuates the pause that forces mutual recognition. The tightening forecloses silence without guaranteeing peace, leaving felt cost in the uncle’s rain-soaked nod.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“rediscover lost joy”—is signaled early and deepens as damaged film threatens to erase the festival memory. One meaningful tightening: fog-bitten frames force the artist to cede control to the knowledge network, narrowing authorship from solitary brush to communal chant. Cost is present (fragile film, shared breath, fragment’s glow traded for collective image), but pressure stays lyrical; no irreversible loss beyond the original abandonment.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—freedom of thought—signals early; pressure tightens when towers sprout “new teeth.” One meaningful turn: the discovered clause that artistic rehearsal in public voids tax. Protagonist agency drives the garden-concert plan; cost is the laugh they extract from gray collectors, a social forfeiture of authority. Escalation stays coherent; coincidence (hornworm outbreak) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: convert vigilance into vulnerable rest without betraying memory. Tightening occurs at postcard-breath beat: insomnia vs. blossom armistice becomes binary, foreclosing middle ground. Cost is surrendered sleepless identity; price is legible in “I still wake often, but rise gentler.” Agency is interior yet decisive; no external antagonist needed. Escalation is textural: color, drip, glow intensify until stance crystallizes. Slight reserve: cost is emotional, not tangible—could use one physical forfeiture to reach 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—"never lose a name again"—is signaled in the flash-back to the rain-dial failure and tightens when the crack threatens to loose the memory into nothing. One meaningful intensification: the caretaker’s heartbeat "falters like a deer on unfamiliar ice" while sewing; the cost is the perpetual burden of perfect stewardship. Agency is caretaker-driven; no outside rescue. The escalation is textural—pressure mounts through sonic leakage and tactile tremor rather than external antagonist—but the cost is unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restoring trust after silence—tightens when the narrator risks composing the suite; each promise is a tangible test. Escalation is accumulative: density of musical metaphors increases until the room answers in overtones. Cost is visible: the stele’s hush still bruises; Lio’s lowered shoulders show release. One meaningful deepening suffices; no false reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—water vs ash—tightens once: discovery of the lovers’ tampered sluice narrows options to either exposed favoritism or a harmonic catenary gate. Protagonist’s agency drives the turn: only his residue test and chain measurement force council consent. Cost is visible—lifelong maintenance vow plus public naming of no names (social risk). Pressure stays coherent under Hybrid lens; no artificial coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—trust vs. theft of voice—tightens once: past betrayal → current parcel gamble. Escalation is textural: paper trails thicken, dust corridor narrows, Lark’s launch crystallizes risk. Visible price is the surrender of the meteorite shard and the exposure of the song; cost is legible. No reversal or external antagonist beyond memory, so pressure plateaus rather than spikes; still sufficient for lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—belonging without nativity—is signaled early and tightens through the breathing synchronization that narrows options to mutual consent or retreat. The burnt-feather insertion is the visible, irreversible act that raises cost. Escalation is lyrical rather than causal: density of light/tide images reweights the stake until the dome offers “charged poise.” Lacks a tangible, on-page forfeit (tool, air, memory) that would push into the 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—why paths vanish—announced early; pressure deepens through iterative visions showing shepherd turning away. Escalation is textural (accumulating images of self-erasing trails) rather than option-narrowing; no live dilemma confronts the narrator—he observes, conjectures, then respectfully reroutes. Cost is conceptual (loss of old trail) but never threatens the recollectionist’s safety or deadline, muting visceral tension.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: can calculated tenderness coax meaning from urban monotony without forcing applause? Pressure escalates through each “diagonal” wager—coins balanced, bishop tilted, father's silence mapped—until the janitor’s square-on-water choice crystallizes the cost. Agency stays with the performer; coincidence only complicates (wave steals coin). The tightening is singular but sufficient: renouncing applause forecloses his easiest income yet completes the serendipity equation. Visible price is the hush he accepts in place of claps.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—illicit memory vs. erasure—tightens when each dot forecloses retreat; visible price is patrol risk tomorrow. No antagonist needed; pressure is legislative ocean. One deepening: silence between dots becomes legible line—knowledge changes, options narrow. Cost paid on-page: dancer commits to permanent exile/clandestine life; cartographer bears visible mark patrols may read.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—“prove that the chipped railing already contains the promised view”—tightens when the ferry shutdown looms and the boy asks if a window can hold a family. Escalation is textural: each stone-thrown ring widens the obligation to rescue what cranes would scrap. The mayor’s ribbon-cut clock is external pressure, but the true narrowing is internal—accepting that clarity is a wage paid in breath, not spectacle. Cost is visible in the pocketed stone and the benches’ scars; agency is the decision to sand rather than replace, foreclosing cheaper options.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: translate pain into sharable language. Tightening occurs when mother appears—option to retreat or deliver; he stays, box offered. Cost paid: bargain shifts from debt to pathway, fingers still burned. Agency is renunciation of secrecy, not heroic rescue; escalation is emotional density, not event cascade.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—hope’s recalibration—tightens through pattern failures and needle tremors; each decorative balloon is a visible price in time/material. The meaningful turn is the gauge’s steady new angle: it forecloses private experimentation, mandates communal pedagogy. Cost is concrete: the mystic solitude surrendered. Escalation is accumulative density rather than causal reversal, perfectly valid under inferred lens; still, one beat short of 8.8 because the village’s asleep-at-noon peril is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will the walls consent to speak and will the listener bear the weight—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens through each artefact encounter. The hopscotch moment is the visible reversal: play ruptures floorboard, reveals letter, narrows options to “return and listen.” Cost is legible: name slides away, future mapped as footfalls not escape. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves tension.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—persuade mirrors to show futures instead of medical defeat—is signaled early and gains density through song-breath drills. One meaningful tightening: the glass fog lifts only when heartbeat syncs with drip tempo, foreclosing the option of passive looking. Cost is visible in the painter’s exhaustion and the narrator’s vow to “keep singing,” a persistent constraint. Pressure escalates accumulatively; no external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can ritual gentleness loosen war’s grip—tightens when the old soldier demands penalty and the woman demands horizon; the negotiator’s reframing (“redemption is priced by work shared”) forecloses pure retribution or endless prison. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each artifact added to the bowl increases the moral weight until the shared lift of casings becomes the visible price. No coincidence resolves; the hawks circle but do not strike, apprenticed to the same patience. Cost is legible—delegates must return annually, enemies’ sleep becomes their mirror—yet the concession feels distributed rather than personally lacerating.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—audible absolution versus ecological guilt—tightens when the egg cracks and powder falls; the option to resurrect life is foreclosed, leaving only echo. Agency is exercised in the deliberate “Release” and placement of speakers; these acts narrow future possibilities to playback, not revival. Cost is visible: egg lost, rain manufactured, reputation intact but spiritually vacant. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each archival hiss adds density until the hum achieves a payable price.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—liberate suppressed voices—tightens when patrol arrival compresses the “window between sigh and smile” to a pupil-shrink. Protagonist’s agency drives every escalation: she chooses to tug threads, quicken knot-work, descend grate, retune looms; coincidence never rescues. Cost is visible on-page: frost-burned knees, audible guards, forfeited anonymity. The reversal—guards lowering pikes—results directly from her sonic harvest, meeting the lens test.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of voice-as-rebellion emerges from concrete mechanics: threads of forgotten vows become literal cords that reweave palace speech into counter-chant. No moralizing line tells us “silence = oppression”; instead the image of snow accepting runes without complaint dramatizes complicity, then reprises as the city “learns slowly how to refuse and still sing.” Final image re-weights the premise: refusal does not destroy harmony but retunes it. Subtext in bodily poetic restraint—touch withheld to unlock voices—avows sensual power channeled into political act.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—ethical storytelling versus exploitative satire—is signaled in the first 120 words and tightens when the narrator’s own hand feels criminal. The meaningful turn is the stick-hand-off: it narrows future options from “satire as good” to “satire co-owned,” with visible social cost (no applause, only listening). Escalation is situational-accumulative rather than causal-domino, but pressure coheres under the dome’s echo chamber. Price is conceptual but legible: the troupe forfeits hero-narrative and surrenders authorship.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—honoring erased keepers—tightens once: from building disposable signals to risking the wing in resin, a shift that makes retrieval impossible. Pressure is situational and accumulative; no external antagonist, but wind, hawk shadow, and sunset compose a coherent threat. The tightening is single yet meaningful, satisfying short-form bar. Cost is present but sub-audible; a hairline shy of 8.0+ bandwidth.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserve forgotten names—signaled in line 2 and tightens when the caster decides the bells, not he, will retain them. Visible price: loss of personal custody and acceptance of endless winter vigil. Escalation is textural: each braid pull thickens the sonic texture from wind to vowels to full names. Agency remains caster’s throughout; no coincidence resolves the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—maintenance of cosmic listening without resource—is signaled in the opening ledger tally. Pressure tightens once: the water must equal the sums or the urn stays sealed; that single test forecloses failure and legitimates his vow. No antagonist is needed; the regime-change backdrop keeps threat ambient. Cost is visible: he gives away recognition, accepts endless gutter-mending, and the disk stops turning to lock him into service.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—teaching resentment to release—tightens once, when Rell’s ribs finally vibrate to the missing note; that silent music forecloses the option of hearing blame ever again. Agency is renunciation: he kneels to return unspent years to the floor, a visible price that alters his gait back into the street. Shifting grace supplies the pressure, but the escalation is poetic density rather than because/therefore linkage; under an accumulative lens this suffices. Cost is conceptual yet undeniable: he must carry a broken compass that will never sound forgiveness, only remind him to let silence ring.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—“capture the dream before the district dissolves”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when the corridor nearly shatters under the dream’s thrash; the visible price is the mirrors’ fear of shatter tasted on the tongue. One meaningful deepening: the task shifts from trap to teach-hold, foreclosing the option to chase. Accumulative pressure builds through frost-layered breaths until the orchard exhales; cost is felt as permanent boundary-softening rather than declared. Agency is renunciation: they release the corridor instead of sealing it, enduring the hazard of glory.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: restart the vow-shedding or lose both orchard and chance at generational repair. Mid-text tightening arrives when the ribbon knot must either snap (failure) or take graft (possible reunion), narrowing outcomes. Protagonist’s every cut raises stakes—bad pruning could drop fruit on Mira or snap rafters. Price is legible: he forfeits immediate reconciliation (tin stays sealed) to earn breathable future space.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—pursue forbidden knowledge—tightens when the tree demands lineage instead of voice, forcing him to stake his aunt’s blank cameo. The dullest fruit choice narrows options: once tasted, nonlinear inheritance rewrites him, visible cost in the warming shell and unfinished face. Escalation is accumulative: each fruit memory layers density until the final portraiture forecloses return to neutral curation.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—access the library—tightens once: silence must forgive failure. Escalation is textural (skipped encyclopedias, missing letter) rather than causal; nevertheless density accumulates until the protagonist’s stance crystallizes. No visible forfeiture (tool, relationship, time) is extracted on-page; cost is conceptual, limiting upper band. Pressure remains coherent but single-turn, adequate for 600-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—find the garden—remains coherent; pressure deepens via memory-slippage rather than external obstruction. Escalation is textural: each mirrored return reweights the cost of naming. Agency is lyrical—speaking history aloud—but the price (losing the twin) is announced more than dramatized, keeping the tightening just sub-threshold for 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore vanished treaty funds—is signaled early via ledger. One meaningful tightening: when twelve/nine/three rope-count forecloses wrong knots, doorway widens; cost is the archival act of renouncing further exploration. Escalation is causal under chosen lens; no coincidence resolves. Price is legible on-page: archivist accepts servant role, exits only to landing.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“find the quiet before maps break”—signaled in first 100 words. One meaningful tightening: the stone’s milk-thick glow narrows options to planting the bloom now. Cost is visible—ice cracks soften, caves’ song “steadied like a held beam.” Agency is attention/renunciation that forecloses future echo-storms; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—proving coincidences carry meaning—tightens when the missing constellation is found inside the shard, forcing the choice to cut silence into the prism. Escalation is textural: each alignment of mirror, pane, and star path increases density until the beam’s hum reweights solitude into fellowship. Cost is visible: the custodian trades private proof for public song, foreclosing the option to remain the lone watcher. No reversal, but the deepening of pattern is sufficient under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—whether the archivist can become a contributor, not merely curator—tightens when his own plum memory is demanded; the forecourt’s acceptance bends the shadow toward him, foreclosing eternal spectatorship. Escalation is textural (pattern of offerings) rather than causal reversals, but the final reconfiguration carries felt cost: exposure of a private, pre-loss sweetness to public archive, a visceral price under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—stay coastal or migrate inland while staying us—is signaled in line 3 and deepens through three envisioned futures that narrow to a single irrevocable “Yes.” Pressure escalates by accretion: each imagined year adds texture of loss until silence becomes unbearable. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict and relationship stakes suffice. Cost is legible: the coastline will bruise, arguments will compact, yet they choose anyway.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“collect a silence my father could understand”—is signaled early and tightens when the rare gilded hush must be rationed. The middle turn narrows options: too much and the narrator loses desire for doors; limiting exposure becomes a tactical necessity. Father’s softening under the shared hush pays the visible cost of abandoning blast-door absolutism. Pressure escalates by accretion rather than reversal, fitting the lyric/accumulative lens cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can silence be shaped into comfort? Pressure tightens texturally—each engineered hush (baffles, velvet, route-timing) raises the implicit cost of failure. No causal reversal, but the mathematician’s revealed grief-equation deepens emotional stakes, forcing operative to test his craft on a living subject. Final cost is conceptual: he forfeits schedule speed, accepting eternal transit as cradle—price legible in slowed drift and cleared vial.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—keep the fading threshold viable by midwifing breath—tightens once: the girl’s near-vanish becomes the test. Agency: denial of her vanishing (quiet stand-still) escalates tension under situational lens; cost is the chill that pours into bones and the ashes that stay bright to read. No reversal, but the single deepening reweights solitude into stewardship with felt price. Coincidence absent; pressure coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“keep the quantum promise or repeat the scam”—is signaled early and deepened by each backward-stamped text. One meaningful tightening: turning the chamber ninety degrees per the kindest-me text forecloses doubt and enables the diamond bloom; cost is the signed legal exposure on the console. Pressure accumulates through lyric density rather than sequential reversals, coherent under Accumulative lens. The price (donating the harvest) is visible but understated; a sharper visceral loss would punch harder.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—“end the house to spare the hearth”—is signaled in line 1 and escalates through each sonic beat: spring tightening, hum thickening, ash rearranging. One visible price: the protagonist forfeits his seal (red droplet against brown) to sign the vow in absence, foreclosing restoration. Agency remains causal under Accumulative lens: every vibration adds density until the ash sentence narrows options to “do not rebuild.” No coincidence; the blank disc was always the confession vehicle.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“capture the shape of possibility”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened to one kernel. Escalation is density-driven: each grafted star, humming equation, and nectar droplet narrows infinity to a single taste. Agency persists; he climbs, chooses, presses kernel to tongue, releasing other futures. Cost is the plural mornings he forfeits—shown in the reel he watches but will not enter. No reversal, but a deepening that changes knowledge: possibility is not hoarded but inhabited.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stake is dominant: can the archivist give Micah a history that matters? Pressure escalates through the breadcrumb beats: clean circle → diagonal swipe → stippled dust → button → folder → addendum → envelope, each beat narrowing the unknown and raising emotional cost. The tightening is driven by the archivist’s agency; no coincidence resolves the tension. Final price is legible—time spent, hope risked, heart reopened.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—restoring erased voices—locks in at caption erasure and escalates with each beat: discovery, traversal, broadcast. One meaningful tightening: when moths thicken into “soft bodies that spell… grammar,” the risk of detection becomes visceral, foreclosing retreat. Cost is implicit but legible—once the signal opens, Mara can never again be “harmless.” No reversal, but steady because/therefore rise satisfies causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—keep the prophecy unfinished—is signaled in line 4 and tightens minute by minute as each dewdrop letter forms. The protagonist’s agency is pure attention and micro-intervention: lower register cancels a city-naming clause; a lullaby loosens the final thread. Cost is conceptual but felt—the ring of absence he carries back into daylight—meeting the 8+ threshold, though the absence could be even sharper on the body.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—can the future be grounded before rumor flies—tightens when the leaf-phrase forces the sorter to build seed-monuments, trading passive decoding for active creation. One meaningful escalation: the shift from reading leaves to building from seeds narrows options and demands visible labor. Cost is legible in ash-dust hair and the arbor’s shiver. Under Accumulative lens, density and pattern-break suffice; no external antagonist required.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will the narrator relinquish control to irregular time?—tightens when cascade spray punishes miscount. One decisive reversal: abandons "rebuilding" for "letting breathe," cost paid by leaving oils and warm cinders behind. Escalation is continuous, lens-honest, with visible price; coincidence complicates but never rescues. Slight reserve: waterfall peril is briefly abstract before the step-timing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—can the ledger between proof and wonder stay open—tightens when the coin first dips at Mara’s name. Agency is cerebral: each calibration risks tipping the narrator into sterile closure; the final alloy renounces further measurement. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; the price (perpetual remembrance) is legible but not dramatically felt on the page, keeping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—retrieving laughter for the dead—tightens once when the woman hesitates, but escalation is largely atmospheric (voices “tripping like children”) rather than a narrowing of live options; the collector’s agency remains observational, so cost is felt more as lyric aura than tactical forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—find the mathematics of mercy before becoming an instrument again—tightens when each fluorescent letter demands bodily honesty. One meaningful deepening: the ratio of intention to harm is scraped from bark mid-stride, foreclosing the option to keep turning screws. Cost is legible in the strap left warming on the branch.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“to honor overlooked histories”—is signaled early and narrows to one child’s name. The tightening beat is the lens-touch that turns varnish into tidewater and fissures into cartographies; option space collapses from “any lost story” to “this one unnamed girl.” Cost is conceptual but undeniable: the painting’s price becomes “irrelevant” once the name is spoken, a social repricing that forecloses commodification. Under Accumulative lens, one intensification suffices; no reversal is required.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—balancing vertical duty against horizontal curiosity—tightens when the ceiling’s sag forces a choice: leave or engage the spring; the protagonist’s agency drives the turn, paying with the conceptual cost of admitting the ringmaster’s theft; escalation is single but meaningful, sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—buoyant survival versus perfect stasis—is signaled in line 4; escalation is one sustained tightening as each printed clause adds destabilizing mass until the eternity-circle offers a lethal taste of symmetry. The operator’s agency drives every beat: aligning type to frost, pulling the lever, sealing the rupture with asymmetry. Cost is visceral—library flinches, clouds forget motion, sand keeps falling inside the circle—foreclosing any future pursuit of flawless instant.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether ornament is domination or solidarity—tightens at each storm: first as rumor, then as shard evidence, finally as council verdict. The mirror-covering ritual is the decisive, visible tactic that narrows options (no echo, no distraction) and escalates public stakes—crowds grow, Ledger petitions, council forced to arbitrate. Protagonist pays iterated costs: childhood superstition exposed to mockery, shard eventually cracked, revolution stillborn. Escalation is causal, not additive: each public reading enlarges the coalition that ultimately re-weights the archive.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaim stolen light—signals early; pressure tightens when the covenant of rust demands a binding price, foreclosing the option of simple repair. Protagonist’s agency drives the escalation: he names the price (tether light to listening) and pays it (yields shadow). Cost is legible on the page: he feels “lighter by a shade,” and the city’s dawn is now conditional on human attention. One meaningful tightening suffices; no reversals required.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—failure as map—is signaled early and deepens when each psychometry flash proves memory unreliable. One meaningful tightening: the laughing-man memory collapses into the father id, forcing the narrator to decide whether to keep seeking maps. Cost is legible but conceptual (forfeited compass); a visceral price (cold, wet, risk) would sharpen 8.8+ eligibility. Escalation is accumulative: each scent/image layer reweights the stake rather than narrows external options.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—kinship vs. perpetual solitude—tightens when silhouettes invite the narrator’s hands; refusing solo escape costs the certainty of lone navigation. The gate’s completion is the visible price, foreclosing a life of mere passing-through. Escalation is accumulative: each salvaged timber ups the communal obligation until the storm pivots from threat to witness.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“will color consent to speak after dusk?”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens through each seasonal panel. One meaningful deepening: twilight incense draft converts abstract question into concrete pigment layout, foreclosing daylight compositions. Cost is visible in sleepless grind (“stay past midnight to polish halos”) and in public vulnerability of the amber-panel reveal. Agency remains accumulative rather than causal-reversal, fitting the lyric design; pressure accrues like layers of glaze rather than via antagonist clashes.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—public truth versus historical erasure—tightens when the diary refuses ink until the shoreline testimony is built, forcing the narrator to literalize archives in garbage. Escalation is Accumulative: each new debris-pattern increases density until the lagoon’s mirror traps the narrator in retrocognitive fire; cost is the blistering reverie that leaves them “half-trapped.” The clerk’s surrender of stenograph punches is a visible price—her bones “like shutters” signal lifelong complicity now broken. Final option reconfiguration: the city must speak the names aloud; silence is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake is clear: can a town live without miracles? Pressure tightens when Iria realizes wishes have ended and she must invent labor-based substitutes. The meaningful deepening occurs at “revival is not a performance but a rehearsal that never ends”—this reweights the task from miracle to perpetual discipline, foreclosing ease. No external antagonist is needed; the exhausted sky is the situational pressure, and her refusal of mercy is the agency that escalates cost.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—archive versus mercy—tightens once: prophecy forces the choice “record harm or refuse work.” Agency is active (shave wax, hum note, fold parchment); refusal pays visible cost (loss of future archive, city’s vowels). Escalation is conceptual deepening, not causal reversals, appropriate to Accumulative lens. Cost is legible on-page: “the orchard sighs… the future shifts.”

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“keep the spiral without owning it”—tightens once when Return asks for a name and again when the cap is planted, foreclosing hoarding. Escalation is lyrical/density-driven rather than causal reversals, but the single deepening (cup → wheel-hub → planted seed) visibly narrows options under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible: the city tips toward spring only if the keeper releases the whirl.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—protect the three towns without panic—is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful deepening: the model’s red lattice versus the bell’s soft vowel. The protagonist’s agency is to refuse the switch, enduring budget audit risk; this renunciation forecloses the sirens and forces the storm to “sidle away.” Cost is visible on-page: valley station mockery, the ferryman’s silent geese, and Reni’s shiver of intimacy. Under Accumulative lens, the single intensification suffices; luck does not solve.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: caretaker v. erasure—proving neglected things still warrant witness; pressure escalates via accumulating meteor squeals that map to ignored relays; the power outage is the single tightening that forces roof-open vulnerability; cost is the realized transparency—no longer hiding from grief—but the external station remains unchanged, so the price is internal and felt yet not materially irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure accumulates through density of silence rather than plot reversals; each day’s archive adds weight until the queen’s arrival forces one visible escalation—opening the lid fully. The tightening is singular but sufficient under the lyric lens: heat must be held, and the protagonist’s endurance becomes the only tactic left. Cost is felt in the tolerable stings that “thread the present to the archive,” a bodily price that reconfigures the stake from witness to custodian.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can communal non-numeric time endure—tightens when each new capsule donation risks fragmenting the fragile calendar of gestures; the narrator’s agency is to keep patching the seam with walked letters. One meaningful deepening: the childhood cricket-memory converts private nostalgia into shared method, foreclosing return to numbered hours. Cost is visible—each receipt-flavor, each walked footprint consumes stamina and secrecy. No reversal, but accumulation makes abstaining from numeric time irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—beauty found in incompleteness—tightens when the snapped string forces the boy into raw asymmetry; poet’s offer to “write what the wind is saying” converts loss into collaborative attention, visible cost in the empty spool and ink left unfinished. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes—mortal time versus ecological legacy—tighten when each copper loop forecloses alternative shelter-building or self-pity. The orchard’s answering hum is the deepening that reweights death as collaboration. Visible price: breath thins, afternoons vanish, diary is surrendered. Agency stays with caretaker; storms and gulls complicate but do not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can return be synthesized without nostalgia?—tightens once: the basin reaction forecloses ritual as answer, forcing stance crystallization. Pressure grows accumulatively: each droplet, breath, iron flake narrows options until the window re-maps origins. Cost is legible in the softened metronome pulse and the erased footprints—paths foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will the shore remember life instead of slaughter?—is signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is accretive: each fertilizing arc narrows the possibility of forgetting; bayonet removal turns weapon into support, foreclosing violence without erasing it. Cost is visible in perpetual return, empty sacks, and the “narrow as mercy” path that must be walked again tomorrow. No coincidence; pressure of salt, wind, and ghosted battlefield tightens choices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—translate distance into audible contact—tightens exactly once but decisively: the leaf must be lifted at the final sliver of dusk or the relay stays mute, and that window is named early and ticked down. Agency is present-tense: protagonist chooses to trade copper, chooses to ignite wax, chooses to stand until “the sun snapped shut.” Cost is the spent leaf and the swallowed darkness that follows; no reset, no second chance. No antagonist needed; pressure is temporal-environmental and suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—can the narrator forge a livable compass after becoming civic sin-eater—is signaled early and tightens through each slow-motion shell of sky. Agency is continuous: the decision to keep drawing, to date the blackout, to bless the candle line are all irreversible micro-acts that foreclose apology or re-entry. Cost is legible: social exile, headache, and the “emptiness of being right.” One meaningful deepening occurs when true north is seen to migrate, forcing the shift from magnetic to intentional navigation.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—restore the sky’s timing by risking his vow—tightens with each piece swap that forecloses a weather shortcut. Agency drives escalation: every substitution (pawn-hair roll, moonlight rook, window-frame bishop) costs certainty and progressively narrows safe options until the queen-letter demands total surrender. Visible prices accumulate: trembling hands, promised itinerancy, and the silence he accepts in lieu of payment. No coincidence resolves; the final bell coughs only after his last swap, crystallizing choice under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.1)
    Central stake: can un-spectacular kindness be archived before the next regime seizes narrative? Pressure tightens as each footstep narrows the available genre of record; the switch from writing “water” to “stay” marks the decisive deepening, foreclosing pure testimony in favor of communal endurance. Cost is paid in bodies: soot-cuffed boy, taped shoes, widow’s button—each pawn-position costs someone their anonymity. No off-stage rescue; the rumoured regency looms but never intervenes, keeping agency inside the gallery.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“will the mouth be reclaimed?”—tightens via stone’s warmth-feather sting-mirror corridor sequence; each step forecloses silence. Agency is accretive: endure enumeration, touch stone, read mirror, choose corridor, speak. Cost is visceral (barb sting, riverbed grit) and conceptual (lifelong self-policing exposed). One meaningful intensification suffices; no external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness vs. risk of repeating sacrificial logic—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightened when wrong tugs literally taste ash. Escalation is incremental but causal under chosen lens: each correct thread-pull narrows future options (some paths now barred by new anchors) and raises visible price (ash taste, squeezed ribs). No coincidence resolves; storm stays held as protagonist’s choice pends. Cost is legible but stays internal; a slightly stronger external forfeiture would push this into 8.8+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—who controls the price of forgiveness—tightens when the canyon demands a hue from every speaker, foreclosing silence as an option. Artist’s agency drives the escalation: he refracts confession into chorus, therefore the canyon resets terms, forcing him to surrender the gold memory. Cost is visible—the colored spire and his unclenched debt—satisfying the 8.8+ gate. One beat shy of 9.0: no credible loss alters mid-tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“conjure meaning from oblivion”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens through each failed bolt memory. The meaningful deepening occurs when the engine names the missing bolts: knowledge that forecloses fantasy of resurrection. Cost is felt in the solemn soldering of “tiny rivers of gold,” a tactile trade-off. Escalation is textural/accumulative rather than causal-reversal, fitting the lens, but one extra beat of visible consequence (workshop steadiness) keeps it just shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—keep the hidden promise vs. disappear into copies—tightens when the pool offers eternal return and is refused. Escalation is textural: mirrored images accumulate until refusal reweights stakes. Cost is the forfeited stay inside eternity; this forfeit is dramatized on-page. Agency remains painterly: one breath-curve added, then retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“prove whispers beat shouts”—is signaled in line 3 and tightened when the captain’s earlier shout almost carved his hull; now the narrator risks failure if scent fails. One meaningful escalation: the shift from paper letter (last week) to airborne perfume—this narrows options to non-verbal persuasion with visible cost of exposure (mentor catches the act). Agency is attention and endurance, not brute reversal; cost is the exposed tenderness the mentor now “hums” beside. No coincidence; wind answers only after scent is offered.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—mapping loss instead of coastline—tightens when the beacon locks inland, foreclosing the coast-return option; the censer foot’s weight and the narrator’s walk across mirrored flats pay a visible price in fatigue and exposure; escalation is steady but singular, not amplified by a second reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—collective psychological survival via honesty—tightens when patrol lamps force the occlusion tactic; the communal eye-ritual then forecloses isolation. Cost is visible: relic risked, laughter cracked, shared pain exposed. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal is needed under situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—deliver the stranger’s unspoken answer—tightens when the notch-letters are discovered; options narrow to “swing lantern or let silence win.” Agency is observational yet decisive: aligning stems, sweeping traces, choosing the obsolete code. Cost is legible: the keeper accepts perpetual custodianship of another ghost, paid with salt packet and page-fold. No coincidence rescues; the answering light is left genuinely ambiguous.</answer>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.8</question>
    <comment>Theme of reciprocal witness emerges through concrete recurrence: girl’s 15-year-old knocks → stranger’s inverted chest-tap → keeper’s lantern swing. Isolation is not lamented but repurposed into a quiet postal service. No moralizing; final paragraph’s “promise that can be borrowed but not owned” is conceptual repricing earned by the dock’s absorbed grief. Ambiguity lingers: is the harbor reply real or reflection?—yet the emotional ledger is undeniably balanced.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—“find the doorway of decisions”—signals early; tightens when seam exhales and mirrored futures overlap, foreclosing return to map-shop stasis. Escalation driven by protagonist micro-choices: following ants, pressing chip, removing it, stepping into overlap—each narrows options with visible creek-level cost. No coincidence; rising water is environmental pressure, not rescue. Price paid: wet shins, lost bridge-refuge, daily discipline of choosing now required.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—dream knowledge versus sovereign duty—is signaled in line 3 and tightens when the wanderer warns “you will choose who rules.” Agency is present at every ascent pause, yet the tightening is largely atmospheric rather than tactical; no material resource is lost or deadline imposed. The final integration does foreclose her return to unexamined power, satisfying the cost requirement, but the price is felt conceptually rather than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: can presence be weighed without dilution? Pressure escalates via density increase—each orbit of the spiral adds ballast until options narrow to “spend it carefully.” Agency is collaborative attention, not confrontation; the cost is forfeiture of haste and the shared burden of future vigilance. No external antagonist needed; the conflict is ontological—time itself must be re-priced. A sharper tactile loss (a spark burn, a shell cut) could have raised the visceral tariff, but the conceptual repricing still lands.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme emerges from the reframing of measurement itself—presence as metal, seconds as currency—without ever naming “love” or “time.” The nautilus’s logarithmic honesty becomes a quiet answer to the opening whispered doubt. Subtext operates in the un-kiss: intimacy is calibrated, not declared. Final image reweights the premise: ordinary steps become thresholds, a non-literal moral that feels earned rather than asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—distill chaos into narrative heat—tightens when jealousy literally sharpens the scroll edges and forces a trade: one syllable of continuity for surrendered envy. Agency drives the escalation: protagonist’s jealousy, not external antagonist, rewrites the dream-map. Cost is visible: envy consumed, continuity still a “trick river,” patrol must proceed on untrusted thaw. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals required under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake: can the narrator—and the father—reclaim time from terror and make it tender? Pressure tightens once: the cracked regulator hinge threatens total failure, narrowing options to a single salvaged screw. The turn is micro but decisive: the screw’s insertion fuses midwife past to expectant future, forcing both characters to re-cast time as breath, not deadline. Cost is legible—the father leaves with a clock that could still fail, the narrator with an unlatched door—yet the escalation is a single wave rather than a rising set.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transmute scars into readable runes before breath runs out—tightens via literal lung-burn countdown; each inscribed rune shortens remaining air, an on-page traded cost. No reversals needed; pressure accrues through situational squeeze (storm walls, evaporating breath) that force stance crystallization. Escalation visible when chest begins to burn after third rune; option to quit is foreclosed by ritual rule already internalized. Agency remains hers; luck complicates (lightning metronome) but does not save.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can a rumor be undone before it kills again—tightens when the narrator offers his own gossip-column scalp to stall the saws. The phone call is a single, irreversible escalation that trades career safety for partial restitution. Under the accumulative lens, each sensory return (jasmine, peach, iron) reweights the moral price until refusal becomes impossible. No further reversal is needed; the choice itself is the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“what clocks really measure” under solitude—tightens when the drip lags and the needle refuses obedience. Protagonist’s agency: quarter-turn of key, backward count, final refusal to correct; each action narrows options and raises cost (blood, risk of being found out). No coincidence; pressure is coherent, internal-external. Price is visible and alters tactics: the cut finger becomes the timing device itself.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—permeable security vs. absolute defense—surfaces in the first paragraph and tightens when the unlocked gate invites the cat. One meaningful deepening: the hiss from ruptured seal forces her to trace pressure backward, trading haste for listening. Escalation is accumulative: each bioluminescent pulse, spore-wave, and mesh gap re-weights risk toward hospitality. Visible price: she powers down the rig, surrendering omniscience for co-existence.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—Mara’s vow to teach endings without owning them—tightens when the elevator emergency forces her to test that vow. One meaningful deepening: routing the child’s call through her two regulars converts passive listening into active midwifery, visible cost is her exclusion from the uplift. Escalation is accumulative: the disc’s unprompted vibration marks the shift from ambient texture to ethical crisis. Agency remains hers; coincidence complicates (rail arc) but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake = can the covenant’s map be recovered before tide erases it; tightening occurs when photo background matches live rail—options narrow to reunion or permanent loss. Escalation is textural: accretion of recalled micro-moments (thermos, scar, joke) increases emotional density until external coincidence (his arrival) crystallizes stance. Cost visible in narrator’s self-exile and salted seal. Lacks persistent constraint that would shape future tactics, preventing 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—loneliness cured by reciprocity—is signaled early and tightens once: postcards cost “a memory, prepaid by whoever hugged you last,” a rule that forecloses casual participation. The trolley’s arrival is not coincidence but the materialized answer to that rule, turning abstract rumor into concrete social debt. No antagonist is needed; pressure is the growing queue of promises. The final applause is earned because every prior beat ladled soup or chalked a name, making the community the agent that resolves its own need.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—chart grief’s coast—stays coherent; pressure intensifies via narrowing sensory trail (notes → intervals → stillpoint) rather than external opposition. One meaningful tightening: ring’s abrupt chill signals the final harmonic north, foreclosing retreat. Cost is conceptual—grief remains but is re-mapped—visible in the finger-ache and the silent ring. Agency is attention/endurance under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—trading guilt for knowledge—signals early and tightens when the personal broadcast arrives. Escalation is accretive: each translation deepens the possibility that history can be edited, narrowing the narrator’s options to either accept complicity or refuse the gift. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable: the dated manifest proves someone (possibly oneself) has already altered the past, surrendering any claim to unedited innocence. No visible price is forfeited on the page, keeping it from the 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—can silence be translated without violating its absence?—tightens once: the bell-swing risks breaking the very hush Arin worships. That single deepening, under Accumulative lens, is sufficient for 600 words and carries visible cost: the camera stays empty, the map is erased by tide. No reversal is needed; the tension is whether silence will survive its own transcription.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—keep readers safe by keeping their names secret—tightens when the ledger of names is physically germinated; a new public text replaces the hidden one, foreclosing anonymity. Escalation is accumulative: each artwork adds density until the final sprouting reweights the stake. Cost is visible—soot skin peeled, seeds eyes-open—but could be sharper; “heart hammering” is the only embodied price. Agency persists throughout; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stake: awaken Mira before monitors reset. Pressure escalates through density—each drumbeat layers donor memories, narrowing options to “carry what does not belong.” The meaningful tightening is the lagoon’s demand for托管 grief; refusal would lose her forever. Cost is legible: narrator accepts lifelong tenancy of strangers’ memories, wrists offered like roses. Agency remains with drummer; coincidence never rescues.
    
    </question>
    <question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particularized images: whale letters, violin in brine, firewood-door laughter—entanglement as love’s real shape. Final image of “agreed awakening” reweights earlier ethical questions about donor splicing without moralizing. Subtext is coded in silence—cuffs clicking polite ceremony, nod blessing strangers inside. Resonance lingers: reader left hearing future dawns tapped for three names.
    
    </question>
    <question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person lyric retains coherent perceptual signature: narrator notices by sound first, star-taste second. Rhythmic control mirrors content—short percussive clauses during drumming, elongated fluid lines at lagoon. No head-hopping; donor memories intrude as sensory flares, not omniscient exposition. Compression (“the garden had already decided”) is pattern-taught early and pays off at closure.
    
    </question>
    <question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
    <comment>High information density: one sentence often sets scene, advances plot, and embodies emotion—“I knelt and tapped a rhythm that Mira would know, the pattern from our first winter.” Figurative language is patterned (sound = architecture) so density never feels purple. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Final third is clean, allowing 9-band consideration. Ear-test rhythm varies without algorithmic drumbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“whispers vs. shouts”—is signaled in paragraph 15 and tightened once when Rade’s men’s footfalls bounce back confused. Escalation is accumulative: each brass tap increases density until the gate acquiesces. Cost is conceptual: authority’s loudness is devalued; the port crews’ rhythm cleans itself in the hush. No reversal, but a single meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: can the narrator convert private grief into usable light without betraying his brother’s silence? Escalation is textural—each mirror flash thickens the emotional density rather than narrows external options. The decisive intensification is the beam becoming “a narrow road” the narrator must walk—an attentional commitment with felt risk (“the night bruises easily”). Cost is visible: he relinquishes the safety of withheld speech and accepts the mirror’s ongoing duty. Guardian agency drives every escalation; no coincidence taints the turns.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—slow the town’s reflex to decide—signals early. Escalation is textural: each window display adds density until the grotto stalemate crystallizes the refusal to finish. Agency is collective renunciation; cost is the forfeiture of victory and the embrace of uncertainty. No coincidence; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens. Persistent constraint—magnetic silence—shapes the final tactic of deliberate stalemate.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single dominant stake—will the narrator risk self-naming to make the island hold? Escalation accrues via textured refrain: each time the island thins, the whale call deepens, until the spoken name forecloses the option of perpetual disguise. Price is on-page: the public unmasking in front of barnacle-crowd whose “silence was heavy enough to crush careful lies.” Under Accumulative lens the tightening is the thickening of resolve, not a causal duel; still, the protagonist’s agency drives the final act and costs social safety.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—maintain unsanctioned grief inside mandatory happiness—tightens when inspector demands live laundry saga; narrator must perform or lose tokens. One meaningful deepening: turning off mics during dish lesson narrows options to gesture-only, visible price is potential demerit. Escalation driven by narrator’s own micro-choices (whittle, teach pause, blank face) under accumulative lens. Cost legible: bouquet petals fall like “clipped syllables,” signaling irreversible fragmentation.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—will collective voice risk re-opening?—is signaled early; pressure deepens via synchronized breath and the guard’s audible tear, narrowing options to cross or retreat. The lake’s audible crack is an earned micro-turn that complicates rather than rescues. Cost is atmospheric yet legible: the ban’s internalized fear thaws into shared vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—trading certainty for a new sense of beauty—tightens once: the reed is acquired, then used, then re-defined as listening rather than seeing. Pressure is lyric and accumulative; no external antagonist or reversal, but the stakes feel proportionate to a vignette. Cost is conceptual (loss of chromatic certainty) rather than visceral; a concrete forfeiture (the brush handed over) helps, yet the later “small cuts” are only mentioned in aggregate. Escalation is modest but coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—honest connection via sound—tightens when the volunteer confesses his brother’s drowning; the ferry bell suddenly refracts a live grief. Escalation is textural: each spectral ringing adds density until the crystal bell spills entire city maps, foreclosing passive listening. Protagonist’s agency remains calibrated—gentle propulsion, never coercion. Cost is visible: the endless tomorrow-tours imply exhausted but chosen servitude.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake = teaching “withering to bloom” for self and strangers; pressure accumulates as origami invitations go unanswered some nights. One meaningful deepening: woman’s box of temp tattoos projects child’s aurora—cost of parental grief felt on page. No external antagonist; tension is attendance vs. absence, answered by narrator’s continued vigil. Coincidence absent; escalation is density of shared grief inside dome.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—mapping survivable paths after economic collapse—tightens once when ribbon is tied to kid’s wrist and again when tape is stretched into dusk to reveal hidden mural; each multiplication forecloses fantasy of whole mural yet reopens walkable routes. Escalation is accumulative: each client adds fragment, density rises, but no single beat forces irreversible trade-off for narrator; cost is communal, felt but not individually priced, keeping score just below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—library’s claim versus shadow’s return—tightens once: Mira’s dream sacrifice forecloses her own unlived futures (“empty casing where her dreams had been”). Under Accumulative lens, the tightening is a density/cadence shift rather than causal chain, but the visible price (her bottled roads surrendered) is on-page and alters tactics. No reversals needed; one meaningful deepening suffices for sub-800 words.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: shelter’s survival / personal integrity after con. Pressure escalates via invoice glare, phone rage, donor flight; each increment forces deeper purge of toys, lies, tail. Single decisive turn: cutting the tail = irreversible cost that forecloses PR spin. Price is on the page: tiny blackened relic + signed confession letter.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—how to live with a miracle that saved the wrong person—tightens when the narrator learns the miracle mistook her for Mira; this deepens guilt and narrows options to renunciation or stewardship. Agency is exercised in the final beat: shatter hourglass, plant ivy, accept ongoing apprenticeship to green voices. Cost is immediate—the relic destroyed, no longer a shrine—and conceptual—she must “learn to read living scars.” No external antagonist needed; pressure is internal and moral. One meaningful escalation suffices for lyric-accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—“where unused love is stored”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened when she confronts her own named aisle. Pressure grows by texture, not plot reversals: each shelf-label intensifies the conceptual cost of neglected affection. Agency is renunciation rather than external victory; she forfeits the safety of voyeuristic expertise. The price is felt but modest; no prop or future path is visibly lost except her detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—“free trapped creativity before their silence buries me”—is signaled in the first 120 words. Escalation is accretive: each falling star traced removes one artist’s blockage, tightening the narrator’s own inexhaustible obligation. Seventh-circuit meteor opens the brickless door, the decisive intensification that forecloses retreat; cost is the endless circuits still ahead, felt on the final line. Luck complicates (meteor timing) but does not resolve; the sculptor’s laugh is earned by prior stardust transference.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake is preservation of possibility itself; the tightening beat is the guard’s decision to breathe into the shortest bottled night, narrowing infinite options to one deliberate seeding. Pressure is accumulative rather than antagonistic: each lullaby iteration, draft of “not yet,” and spore planted increases density until the archive collapses into locality. Because the archive never pushes back with differentiated will, the climax risks feeling like permission rather than struggle, keeping the score below the 8.8 gate. Still, the final tick of the clock provides a measurable, irreversible change that certifies cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: access to the forest’s grammar vs. the ache of incomplete time. Escalation is the hum’s shift from counsel to ache, forcing the gear insertion. Cost is the new knowledge of nightly translocations—no escape, only interior distance. Agency is attention/insertion; coincidence absent.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—finding unused courage—threads every beat; indirect routes and star-forks tighten options without external antagonist. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each bend walked converts abstract fear into concrete path, star-click serving as micro-yes cadence. Cost is visible: the skiff is no longer external but nested behind ribs, a permanent burden/choice. No coincidence resolves; the protagonist’s own feet and reached hand crystallize stance—Earned Stasis with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—understanding the cost of absolute safety—tightens when the radiator Morse confirms the choir’s return, forcing the choice to remain and “play easing.” Escalation is textural: each hiss, click, and frost trace increases the density of silence until the breath-drawn clef ruptures it. Protagonist agency drives the climax: sitting, breathing, releasing cached winter; luck merely signals. The price—nerves writing shorter letters, silence unforgiven but endured—lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“unmask the pretender”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when the ink brands her finger, foreclosing coronation. Agency is Lyr’s arranged mirrors; cost is Serane’s public identity. One meaningful escalation: the rune slides past/present until the decree with restored comma surfaces—no off-stage resolution. Pressure stays causal and coherent; coincidence only complicates (retreat of retinue is social consequence, not luck).

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will the keeper decode the vanishing paths before someone else drowns?—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightens when the console’s ribbon answers his taps, narrowing options to one living corridor. The reversal is micro but decisive: the path isn’t erased, it is time-locked; this reframes the red-lined atlas from lie to schedule. Cost is legible: perpetual nightly labor, “rewinding the recordings,” accepting impermanence. Under Accumulative lens the pressure deepens through pattern density (tide + lunar + tapping) rather than causal dominoes, satisfying the lens-specific escalation test.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—“where did the Lark go?”—is signaled by beat 4 and tightened when Mara stakes her skin against the stones. The escalation is accumulative: each hum thickens the density of possibility until the map’s projection narrows the colony’s options from rage to orientation. Cost is visible: she risks alerting the silencers yet forfeits secrecy to share the coordinates. No external antagonist appears, but the blockade’s shadow supplies coherent situational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.7)
    The dominant stake—who controls the future of the embryo—tightens when the council refuses and Lida acts alone. One meaningful deepening occurs: the amber softens only under live steam, forcing an irreversible on-stage act. Cost is visible (burn risk, social exile) but diffused into collective joy before the reader feels its sting.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—whether Rafi can stay present inside a life that keeps breathing storm and rotor noise—tightens through accumulative density rather than causal reversals. Each sensory echo (vent fans = rotors) raises the cost of staying open. The gull-release beat is a micro-turn that reweights stillness from symptom to tool, not a false resolution. No option is foreclosed, yet the bearing is irrevocably altered.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: save her eye from habitual dimming. Tightening occurs when she realizes the keeper’s threaded deck is a map she must physically enact; option to retreat vanishes once she descends the spiral. Price—accepting public guardianship—visible in ledger inscription. One meaningful turn sufficient for length; escalation coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—end the market that sells crisis-time—is signaled early and tightened when the ink spine reveals the metronome hut. Agency is continuous: seed vial, spill second vial, lie in ink, refuse throne—each action forecloses options. Cost is visible: self-outline erased, mentor’s fate recalled, bird must learn a song of absence. No coincidence; escalation is driven by pattern-reading and refusal. Could use one earlier glimpse of the algorithm to raise pressure above 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether the archive will keep or free the dangerous knowledge—is signaled in the first paragraph and tightens through each sensory layer. The single meaningful turn occurs at the midnight grid reset when the narrator feeds the letter into the dormant conduit; this irreversible act forecloses his professional identity. Cost is legible: frost blooms across the case “like a curtain call,” a visual forfeiture of certainty. Pressure accumulates rather than spikes, fitting the lyric mode yet still narrowing options to one seam in time.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether mercy can outlive collapse—is signaled in line 1. Escalation is textural: each new footprint, each sheathed knife thickens the density of “engraved quiet” until the trio’s planted names physically narrow future revenge. Protagonist agency drives every turn: her invitation to plant, her tying of the scrap, her final vow. Cost is visible when a knife is literally softened into soil; the path of vengeance is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—recover the goddess’s name to save the dissolving coast—is signalled early and tightened when the goddess demands the name be wrested from the constellations. Escalation is textural: each transliteration through the spike deepens the cost of listening until surrender is the only path. Agency remains the fisher’s throughout; the final letting-go forecloses personal hoarding in exchange for communal coastline. Cost is felt but could be sharper—no physical toll or irreversible loss is dramatized on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. control of headlines—signaled in journalist’s cracked call. Tightening occurs when shutter-closure wager forecloses retreat; cost legible in printer halt and exchange hiccup. Agency resides in her intervention, not coincidence. Persistent constraint: once shutter opens again, truth-publishing rules rewrite future editions.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—silencing guilt—tightens when the baby’s cry is translated “I am adrift,” forcing the tattooist to tether stars on another wrist, then his own. Escalation is density-driven: each sound-artifact (letter, recorder, amber) increases the frequency of ghosted voices until refusal is impossible. Visible price: he inks himself, tethering pulse to guilt forever. Coincidence is absent; pressure is accumulative and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake: can the group let pattern emerge without forcing meaning? Pressure mounts through micro-alterations to sand and chalk; the bearded man’s confession is the single visible tightening that widens the circle. No option is foreclosed—the grotto permits endless rearrangement—but the hush itself becomes the irrevocable shift, a collective renunciation of glib certainty. Cost is diffuse: individual stories are voiced yet left unresolved, a social credit spent for shared porousness.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can empathy survive after atrocity—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the boy’s mother needs a non-burning name. The renaming of the four men forces a public, irreversible trade-off: they receive social re-entry but only by accepting lifelong labor tied to their crime. Cost is legible on-page: the protagonist’s “arms of steel” tremble as the past loosens, and the plaza’s breath-held silence shows the crowd’s uneasy purchase on this aberrant mercy.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake: mutual caretaking of a fractured timeline. Pressure deepens by accretion—each echo, fracture, and spectral chorus thickens nostalgia’s weight rather than narrows options. No reversal, but one meaningful cadence shift when the orchard reconfigures passages, forcing literal and emotional step-through. Cost is diffuse but legible: perpetual return with no true release.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.8)
    One dominant stake—make memory survivable—tightens through each somatic marker and color pass; no extraneous reversals. Escalation is accumulative: static shock → misread rhythm → deeper breath → cobalt fix; each layer raises the chance of emotional overload. Protagonists pay with reopened grief and the geode’s spent glow. Agency remains joint but visible; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—exchange legitimacy with the unknown—tightens when storm surge threatens to erase the warm plateau; renunciation of the fossil forecloses retrieval, paying visible price. Escalation is situational, not causal: tide rises, options compress, stance crystallizes. Could use one earlier micro-loss (tool, time) to sharpen tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—who controls meaning—is signaled early (“script I was given read like a lock”). One meaningful deepening: the catalog method turns static prophecy into live, communal loom. Cost is legible: the protagonist loses sole guardianship, warehouse authority diffuses, cliff sentences literally enter villagers’ mouths. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens via button-echo pairings; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether Ansel can rejoin living network without theatrical suicide—signaled in pillbox history; tightening occurs when ring appears inside, forcing choice between past tool (film) vs future trust. Protagonist agency drives escalation: his finger-trace codes create the rendezvous condition; disposing film is active forfeiture that narrows exile to steady-burn path. Cost is legible—loss of microfilm evidence and public identity—forfeiture alters later tactics (no headlines, only whispers). Coincidence absent; Len’s arrival is scripted by snow alphabet.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: deliver the palimpsest promise without erasing fear. Escalation is textural: fog thickens, currents tug, letters bleed through, each stitch tightening the cost of drowning vs. braiding. The protagonist’s agency is rhythmic patience—oar matched to gutter-tick—rather than overt reversal. Cost is legible in the map’s blank spaces and the ferryman’s relieved shrug.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can tenderness re-animate a dead place?—tightens through each micro-offer; the thrum’s answer braids timelines and forecloses the option of taking anything away, visible in the leaving of cups. Cost is present but soft (water, breath, time); lacks a visceral price that would lift to 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—keep the harbor lit to honour the mother—tightens when the padlock clicks: the protagonist now shoulders perpetual vigil. Agency is crystallized in the match-strike that lights the wick; coincidence never rescues. Cost is immediate and felt: cold stone through pants, brittle wick risking failure, future nights spent rotating the beam. One meaningful intensification suffices; the beam’s first sweep reweights all prior grief into duty.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: keep the library—and self—from dissolving into formless fog; pressure mounts as stone-circle hum “coughs” and shelves threaten to spill. One meaningful deepening: the atlas drip sings coordinates, forcing the narrator to voice the herd-song, trading vocal strain for restored resonance. Cost is felt—hoarse breath, dripping constellations across wrists—and alters tactics (must sing, not merely read). Agency is accumulative: pattern of cataloguing turns to active anchoring. No external antagonist; coincidence (thunder) complicates but does not resolve. Sufficient escalation for 600-word lyric mode, though the tightening is more cadence-shift than irreversible option-loss, keeping it shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—can art rejoin two silenced lovers—tightens once when parallel threads physically narrow to one bowl; escalation is accumulative (each new leaf adds social pressure) rather than causal reversal. Price is legible: private letters become public utterance, foreclosing secrecy; however, the lovers themselves exert minimal agency until the final step.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—who gets to tune the collective heartbeat—tightens when each countersign broadcast shrinks the protagonist’s future (tenure dangled, then refused). Agency is continuous: every phase inversion is a wager that enlivens cost (hands tingle, dean’s second call roughened with relief). Escalation is accumulative/textural: the signal’s visions grow more seductive, the campus quieter, until the final hiss births “the sound of deciding.” Visible price is on the page: the clean channel is both victory and permanent vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—retrieve lost key—tightens when spatial mutiny threatens to erase routes; alleys “turning like sleepers” raises physical cost. One meaningful deepening: the mutiny is reframed from enemy to neglected treaty, shifting tactics from conquest to listening. Price is legible (cold bite, lung tightness, public disobedience of Council ban), but external stakes (city-wide consequences) remain implied rather than dramatized on page.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: can empathy survive evidentiary void? Each object found tightens the question by negating the fox-mask legend. Agency is attention itself—choosing to paint absence—foreclosing the path of facial identification forever. Cost is legible: the families receive forgiveness instead of a perpetrator, a felt price under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—redeem ancestor & reverse exile—tightens once with visible price: director’s authority cracked, exiles cough back into humid corridor. Protagonist’s agency is the nail act; escalation is lyric-density not causal-ratchet but still narrows options and forces stance. Cost is conceptual yet undeniable; meets high-band bar.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether vanished hitchhiker can be reclaimed from pixelated ledger—tightens through sensory escalations: each gust that aligns scaffold arrows narrows the protagonist’s options until only the bow stroke remains. Agency is continuous: recounting climbs, kneeling, lifting shard, playing measure. Coincidence (arrows fluttering) complicates rather than rescues; the final warmth is earned by the fiddler’s resolve to play forgiveness into physical being. Cost is visible: glass clarifies, river mist beads on varnish, solitude foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—decode inscriptions to ease shared burdens—tightens once when joint reading becomes the only path, narrowing options from solo to shared witness. Escalation is textural: star-flux graphs steady, dialogue counterpoints, meaning accumulates rather than flips. Cost is conceptual but legible: the chronicler forecloses lone mastery, accepts perpetual co-witnessing. No external antagonist needed; pressure is internal-relational.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—retrieve frozen confession—tightens when eighth circle snags the cold thread, forcing the druid to angle raft into lake belly; denial is physically chewed away, narrowing options. Escalation is causal under lens: each circle because/therefore approaches truth; seed’s bloom is irreversible act that removes lie, leaving only payable cost. Price is visible on-page: mayor’s tremble, druid’s pocketed coin, spent seed. No off-stage rescue; spectacle dissolves by protagonist’s refusal to grandstand, earning quiet but legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (“patch holes in the soul”) is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the Weaver demands a destiny that “refuses you,” forcing the narrator to relinquish her own name and future autonomy. The single deepening—offering the soldier fate back to the market—pays an on-page price (she becomes perpetual barterer) and crystallizes the new equilibrium. Under Causal lens, the escalation is lean but sufficient for 650-word window.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: can the narrator remain fact-armored? Pressure tightens once when the cloth’s singe is recognized, forcing a choice—catalog as relic or trash. The repricing in the ledger is the visible cost, foreclosing the “old roadie trick.” No reversal, but the single deepening is meaningful under accumulative lens; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—keep the orchard from sparking—signals in line 4 and tightens when rails drift without her serenade. Each micro-adjustment of a node narrows options until the final breath-bridge act: renounce ownership or watch the trunks grind. Visible price: the vacuum after her name is spoken once, the seed risking silence if planted in untuned soil. Escalation is textural—density of hum threads—yet the protagonist’s agency remains causal at every pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.6)
    Migratory identity is the dominant stake, signaled early; pressure tightens when the woman’s three cards collapse to one unpronounceable name via the bell-metal acceptance—an on-page trade-off with felt cost; escalation is textural (cadence, imagery) rather than causal reversals, permissible under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    Pressure escalates through pattern accumulation: each graffiti coordinate and physical milestone tightens the noose of self-knowledge. The dominant stake—can the narrator forgive himself without falsifying the river?—faces a decisive test when he enters the shallow where the body drifted. Agency is visible: he copies ink pressure, counts aloud, and finally writes a new covenant in the field book. Cost is felt in the lungs that match the torn bellows and the number surrendered to the current.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stake—access to unspoken words—tightens once yet meaningfully: the library will open only for proof of readiness measured in withheld breath. That single deepening trades hurry for patience, foreclosing the option to force entry. Agency remains interior but visible: each calibrated turn, each fog-breath onto the page, pays an on-page cost of time and uncertainty. The price is subtle (delay, silence) yet legible under the Accumulative lens, satisfying the ≥8.0 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single stake: keep the violin’s story alive vs. empire’s archival vacuum. Escalation is linear but effective—each minute of midsummer heat thins the ice, tightening the clock. The decisive tightening occurs when he tastes the melt-drop: that sensory price crystallizes the trade-off and forecloses surrender to the museum. The cost is microscopic but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“capture one last spark before oblivion”—is signaled by word 30 and tightened once: the radio coughs, the rhythm of mentor’s brush emerges, narrowing option space from pure grief to actual echo harvest. Protagonist’s agency drives every beat: cleaning, placing, tuning, listening, anointing. Cost is paid on-page: her acceptance of non-resurrection plus guild heresy risk. No coincidence; escalation is accumulative intensification of aurora light + static clarity until the final dimming.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—contentment through tending—tightens once: from seeking source to becoming its conduit. Escalation is textural density, not causal reversals; the meaningful shift occurs when pruning converts private grief into shared vine-relief. Cost is visible: relinquishing the last relic. Coincidence absent; agency legible.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—public confession vs political survival—tightens once when chimes spell “speak and set terms,” foreclosing the hide-or-return binaries. Agency stays Lark’s: she funds the boats via the tax she campaigned against, a visible price that alters tactics (electoral suicide). Pressure coherent under causal lens; luck complicates (wind, not fate, decides) but does not resolve. Cost is on-page and charges final image.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single stake—“learn how to be seen by disappearing”—tightens when the narrator agrees to release the village dam. The price is implied in the widened river, but because the narrator’s emotional resistance is never sharply tested, the escalation feels gentle rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—hear the wandering pulse without moving—is signaled early and tightened when the canyon folds inward; the price is the surrender of physical navigation. No external antagonist, but internal pressure escalates through sonic density; the final click of the arrowhead is the single decisive intensifier.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—access to unautomated imagination—tightens when the platform flex shows the cost of asking instead of owning. Mist-walk failure physicalizes the risk of public ineptitude, foreclosing the “perfect mage” path. Escalation is accumulative: each luminous color returns a discarded, unmarketable whisper, reweighting failure as fodder. Price is visible when the hush stays on his hands, forcing him to tend strangers’ blanks.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—discover the color of sound—is signaled in paragraph 5 and deepens when the hum acquires a thawing silver tint, a meaningful intensification under Accumulative lens. Pressure is ambient rather than antagonistic; the library’s breathing and the vows’ threads tighten his heartbeat into a tethered metronome, a visible cost. No external reversal, but the internal stance crystallizes: he must earn the silver by tending brightness others see first, foreclosing the option to remain a passive observer. Cost is felt but modest; the silver is carried yet no tangible loss is dramatized, keeping it shy of the 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single dominant stake—can they tune the universe’s last whisper—tightens with each coin flip that forecloses alternative orientations. Escalation is causal: flip → gyro reversal → noise distillation → silence corridor; each step exacts a visible price (hand steadied, copper still, breathing sync). Cost is felt in the final “shoreless feeling” that the path is now irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—turning nameless loss into bearable language—tightens once: the unnamed gull-figure refuses to settle until the reaper risks uttering the winter lamppost phrases, narrowing his options to permanent custodianship of fear-names. Cost is legible: each successful crystallization (“They chimed when they moved”) increases the glass menagerie he must carry tomorrow. Agency remains internal yet decisive; no outside coincidence rescues him. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes again, keeping the score just above the 8.0 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake minute-surgical repair of cosmic time spilled by a cracked constellation is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened every time the drips quicken or slow under gull-cry or memory of storms. Efan’s agency is granular: counting, chalking, threading, naming stars; these micro-interventions progressively narrow possibilities until only the quiet bridge-ceremony remains. Cost is felt on the page: the bell will never ring again, only hum coordination; the fisherman must “learn hunger differently.” No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational and accumulative, culminating in the charged poise of final alignment.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—keep the drowned town’s memory alive—tightens when drought exposes evidence and the bureau’s order to expunge arrives. Each photograph narrows options until the grove becomes the only moral stance. The tightening is accumulative: density of relics, not explosive reversal. Price is visible: he accepts bureaucratic reprisal by radioing residents, yet still must file reports, foreclosing neutrality.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
    <comment>Theme emerges without sermon: stories as levees against erasure. The blue label migrates from commodity to covenant, its flourish becoming a call to gather. Final oral transfer braids individual memories into “one careful rope,” refusing tidy moral binaries. No abstract thesis—meaning is felt in thermoses and blankets, the loons’ call substituting for drowned bells.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—orchard’s survival vs. personal formulaic control—is signaled in paragraph 4. Single meaningful tightening: starlings freeze mid-flight, forcing her to drop the formulas; this is the decisive trade-off. Cost is visible in the white root-breath that sacrifices her analytic certainty. Under accumulative lens, density of color-mood-starling repetitions reweights stakes without causal reversals; one decisive intensification suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserve trust under pressure—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightened when the pilot explicitly asks for eyes, forcing a public revision that risks reputation. The vortex blister raises physical cost; the rope’s half-arm length is a visible price that shapes the final approach. One meaningful escalation under causal lens; no coincidence resolves. Options narrow to “tilt early or repeat the burst rail.”

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes—who will awaken the ancestor—tighten once through the water/fire swap that forces joint custody; cost is legible in the narrator’s loss of numbness and the petitioners’ shared burden. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no reversal beyond the single cadence shift, sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve quiet innovation against louder profit—tightens when inspectors/landlord are imagined, then again when she rehearses pitch aloud. One visible price: she locks the annex against dilution, accepting slower trickle. Escalation is accumulative: each hush-layer (storm, brook, timer) deepens the wager on meaning over money. No reversal, but deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes—“restore lost laughter”—are declared early but remain abstract; no moment shows what he forfeits if he fails or what the household risks if laughter returns. Escalation is textural: each engine gust adds density rather than narrowing options. The single meaningful tightening is the mother’s lip-press in response to a distant squeal, but it is observed, not driven by the conductor’s choice, so agency feels diffuse and the cost is vicarious.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single dominant stake—interrupt stifling destiny—signaled early and tightened through each approximation. Escalation causal: every nudge loses safety margin until the crozier’s destruction forecloses return to guild obedience. Price paid on-page: burnt palm, forfeited relic, exile into blue air. Could use one earlier external obstacle to push score into 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will the ferry ever truly arrive?—is signaled in line one. Escalation is textural: each repetition of dew, tickets, and wake-trails accrues weight until the star-lattice forces a single crystallizing micro-choice (drift where the ceiling drips next). The price is the undertow he chooses to keep: permanence in transience, paid in the final line where footprints stay but he never will. No coincidence resolves; the pattern solves its own equation.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stake: can ephemeral trust be calibrated between strangers inside a space that weaponizes depth? Escalation proceeds room-by-room, each trick tightening the need for mutual anchorage; triangle formation with visitor collapses infinite ladders into shared stillness. Cost is invisible yet palpable—belief now depends on repeating the weave, a debt the architect admits he can never finish paying.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—prove to himself that star-navigation is still possible—tightens when each city lamp erases an imprint. The night crawl is the visible price (stamina, isolation). Alien reply folds horizons, reweighting stakes without external rescue. Cost is legible; could edge higher if a concrete tactical loss (broken tool, student defection) had bitten on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—protecting vulnerable voices—tightens when the caller proves to be a live child, not a dead one, forcing the tracer to risk job security. Escalation is accumulative: each pulse of the aid deepens the pattern and narrows the search map. Visible price: the headset pricks, the city answers only to feet, the gallery’s last photographs lean like exhausted mailmen—stakes made visceral. Coincidence (guard asleep) complicates, does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restoring the unremembered—tightens when each spoken name forces the narrator toward public exposure inside a narrowing air window. One meaningful escalation: the machine’s last line about “the girl” personalizes the cost, converting abstract guilt into embodied choice. Pressure is coherent under the Situational lens; no reversal, but the stance crystallizes with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single dominant stake: fetch wisdom from the self-inflicted data burn. Escalation is textural—each static-clearing recurrence deepens the same wound rather than pivoting plot—but the final alignment of the dish is a visible narrowing of options that forecloses eternal self-haunting. Cost is legible: the mentor’s laugh thaws into the admission “you merely believed yourself big enough to,” forcing the narrator to trade absolution for ongoing vigilance. No coincidences; the ghost is archival echo, not deus-ex-machina.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—save the dying language by translating texture—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is accumulative: each new echo-word grows scarcer, fuzzed by overuse, until the canyon demands payment in voice. Protagonist’s agency drives the turn: offering his travel-name narrows future options (he stays as caretaker, no longer carries a name for roads). Cost is legible on-page—the ringing cavity—and reshapes later tactics (he can no longer leave).

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—will the narrator survive revelation?—is signaled early but remains atmospheric; escalation is poetic density rather than narrowing options. The phone-voice deepens knowledge, yet no concrete consequence threatens until the stair appears; agency is largely receptive. Persistent constraint (must keep silence while soil edits spines) is felt, but the final yes costs nothing that was previously foreclosed. Suitable for Accumulative lens, but pressure plateaus rather than tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reawaken beauty under surveillance—tightens when each softer note risks statue seizure. Escalation is Accumulative/Textural: density of responses (sap-scent-sway-fall) reweights stakes rather than narrows options. One decisive intensification: copper halos drop, statues unlock. Cost is conceptual—beauty reclaimed in public view—but not physically suffered; hence stays below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—deliver contraband storm and heal broken promises—tightens when the jar’s lid cracks and options narrow to staying vs. leaving. One meaningful deepening: the mirror reveals the boy, foreclosing the mailman’s detachment. Cost is legible in the extra twilight minutes and the emotional wager of rerouting official mail. Agency remains his throughout; no coincidence resolves anything.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“interpret silence as possibility”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when every mechanical fix fails until he yields his own silence. The reversal is micro but decisive: wrong turn into oasis → discovers voice is fuel → surrenders anonymity. Cost is visible: the instant he sings, his undetectable persona dissolves; travelers now “hear him in the rhythm,” foreclosing retreat. Escalation is textural, not causal-graph, yet pressure accumulates unmistakably; the final chord strikes only because he pays with personal exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—find the breathing country of stories—is signaled early but remains abstract; no concrete obstacle or ticking clock materializes. Escalation is tonal, not causal: density of maritime imagery increases, tightening the lyric pattern rather than narrowing options. Cost is conceptual (accepting endless search) rather than felt; no tool, relationship, or opportunity is forfeited. Meets single-deepening standard for lyric mode but lacks visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—capture vs escort—tightens once when the librarian answers the sea’s price question and renounces ownership. Escalation is lyrical accumulation: each plate adds opacity to the chase until the final refusal crystallizes cost. No external antagonist needed; pressure is ontological (dream must stay fugitive). Cost is conceptual yet visible: the map hums with unborrowable light, foreclosing future pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can voice survive fear—signals early and tightens through each ritual beat: silence laid over ribbon, mirror path forming, first-note risk. Protagonist agency drives every turn; no coincidence resolves. Cost is visible: the sung note wavers, exposing cracked vessel to sky. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; options narrow to sing or stay silent, and the choice forecloses muteness forever.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—recover stolen memories—tightens once: the confession trades emotional truth for partial restitution, narrowing future options (only partial return, ledger debt remains). Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens: density of mirrored constellations, ring pulse, and ledger warmth escalate cost without causal reversals. Visible price is legible in glove warmth and lung-burning ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—keep the city’s memory without hoarding grief—tightens once: the council’s decree forces the archivist to risk the library’s erasure. Escalation is textural: each mirrored letter, steeped cup, and poured shadow thickens the pattern until the corridor literalizes the return-path. Cost is visible—leader sets down tape, child speaks the hinge aloud—but the council’s retreat feels slightly convenient; no delegate votes a forfeited resource.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserve wonder’s color—tightens when the orchard’s taste dulls and the child’s jar proves the valley’s window has turned from dawn to gray. Escalation is textural: each pruning cut pumps scent into the seed, increasing density until the final cadence shift makes the cost of sharing unavoidable. No antagonist is needed; pressure is the orchard’s own forgetting, answered by Miren’s agency to plant the heirloom where she cannot police its sprouting. The visible price is her loss of exclusive stewardship, foreclosing the option to keep wonder portable and private.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake: will the hush accumulate into anchoring or suffocation? Escalation is textural—each loosened knot thickens the emotional density until the air becomes “dense enough for the spirits to stand on.” The protagonist’s agency is relentless: every choice to unravel, braid, or thread reconfigures what the sea may reclaim. The price is cumulative rather than a single decisive payment, hence it stops just short of the 8.8 gate that demands a visible, felt price on the final beat; the cost is legible but diffused across the lyric weave.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: interpret silence with empathy vs. risk of violating sealed memory. Pressure tightens when comparison of silent films reveals the lime-bubble door, forcing the choice to reopen. One meaningful deepening: the whispered chapel is found intact, but the cost is the irreversible exposure of its hush to parish eyes. Escalation is textural—each silence (film, vault, chapel) layers until the narrator’s refusal to test the hush with loud voices hands the cost to future travelers.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can the narrator let go of the archive and still honor its voices—tightens when the globe drifts into gloved hands, forcing the choice to pocket versus catalogue. The Morse margin words (“steady, waiting, light”) act as micro-turn, shifting goal from documentation to rescue. Escalation is textural: each salt-inked letter adds weight until the final ascent costs “sorrow” alongside air. Agency is steady, renunciatory: the narrator refuses to take the whole library but salvages one fragile planet.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: make the ghost’s need audible so the courtyard can breathe. Escalation is density-driven: each graffiti reply → brighter valve blink → tighter tuning until the city’s organs open. Agency stays with singer/ghost dyad; no coincidence. Cost is visible—singer cedes louder song for utilitarian encoding—but arrival feels cooperative rather than a single sharp trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—retrieve diary vs. tender preservation—tightens at floor 6 when servant realizes Mirek was also a servant; each ascent escalates by accrued artifact and emotional density under Accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening suffices; cost is the exposure of vulnerability in leaving book open. No antagonist needed; coincidence (wind gust) complicates but doesn’t resolve. Agency visible in shelving decision with felt social/ethical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—proving absence can be read—tightens when the radio hush grows "generous as a cathedral," forcing the narrator to speak forgiveness into silence. Escalation is textural: each cloud emotion thickens the archive until the squall’s evolution (resentment → gratitude) reweights the stake with visible atmospheric cost. Agency is present but reactive—final swing homeward is enabled by spotted lightship rather than an irreversible gambit. Still, the price of bearing witness alone in that hush is palpable, meeting the 8-band threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“mirror the sky inside walls before the building dies”—is signaled in line 4 and tightens when the foreman’s radio begins its countdown. Escalation is situational: stillness thickens, dust trembles, time compresses into “one more minute.” The mural becomes the last live option; failing to finish means the tree forgets the sky. Cost is visible: the artist trades escape for glaze layers, choosing to stay inside the folding tent.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—map the stranded light—signaled in paragraph 4; pressure tightens when halos gather on rigging and birds dictate diagonals. One meaningful deepening: decoding hopscotch numerals reweights navigation options under luminous pressure. Agency is attention and chalk-acted instruction that forecloses prior drift-randomness; cost is the momentary seizure of speech/internal light. No visible resource lost, so cost is atmospheric, not tangible—keeps it from 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—repair as reciprocal attention—tightens when mirrors shiver with embarrassment; each gear adjustment forecloses another minute of his life. The cedar uncapping is the visible price that steadies the clocks but exposes his memory to communal use. Agency is attention-based, not violent, fitting Accumulative escalation. Could breach 8.8 if a tangible object were permanently forfeited; the wheel is left behind but its cost is only implied.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is collective survival of identity after storms erase labels; tightening occurs when the bell’s unknown braid forces immediate orchestration—climbers with splicers, cooks with medics—foreclosing solo heroics. Protagonist agency is the decision to stack baskets into boats and row by breath, paying the price of bruised fruit and chalked apologies mid-air. Cost is visible in raw palms and the long dissolve ring that “felt like rain inside our ribs.” No coincidence resolves; the nebula appears only after the orchard moves as one body.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—delaying apocalypse—declared early; pressure escalates via browning sky and needle lean. Yet escalation is atmospheric, not tactical: no new constraint alters the keeper’s available actions until the final song; the bent gear is fixed without ripple. Cost is conceptual (eternal vigil) rather than visceral or resource-based. One meaningful tightening occurs when the sky browns and the pane thrums, but the keeper’s response is identical to prior nights—sing—so option set does not visibly narrow.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“get them out before frost”—is signaled in the fifth sentence and tightens with every mechanical horn note; the orchard’s fear-scent literally rewrites paths, turning apples inside-out to block retreat. One meaningful escalation: the early frost warning collapses the promised window, forcing the nut-lock gambit. Cost is felt in the caretaker’s voluntary re-entry, foreclosing personal escape.</question>
    <question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of bondage versus transmission emerges through images of grafting: the orchard grafts itself onto people, the boy grafts hope onto a nut, the caretaker grafts memory onto absence. No abstract statement declares this; the final “cliffs hold their breath” lets the reader feel the cycle reset with no moral. Graceless beauty is enacted, not named—salt-crusted prayer that drowns while guiding.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“translate separation into connection”—is signaled early and tightened when foam teaches that connection is a readiness to give way. One meaningful deepening: the shift from “stronger = better” to “listen, loosen, rejoin” costs the protagonist lawsuits/scorn, price legible on page. Agency resides in attention/attention-turned-design, not external antagonist; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens. No coincidence; escalation is cadence accumulation rather than multiple reversals, sufficient for 600-word scale.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—entry to the seed vault—signals early; pressure tightens once when the hinge air swings open, narrowing options to “sign with silence.” Agency is attention, not combat; the vendor’s quantifying act forecloses the path of ordinary language. Cost is conceptual (stories born mute) rather than visceral, keeping escalation lyric-subtle. The comma-seed’s weight is poetic, not tactical, so escalation feels cerebral, not urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to bear contaminated remorse—tightens once: from warning (don’t touch) through filament infection to ingestion and bodily cost. No external antagonist is needed; pressure accrues as coral pulses consent, narrowing options to cook or shatter. The single deepening (tasting broth) forecloses the option of returning the remorse untransformed and is legible under Accumulative lens. Visible price: metallic throat → softened wood, keeper’s taller stance.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—community cohesion versus siloed isolation—is signaled in Mara’s opening manifesto and tightened each time a plank converts mistrusted catwalk into shared stage. One meaningful escalation: the elevator’s request for rehabilitation forces Mara to risk the tower’s sacred weight as counterbalance, foreclosing its original clock-steadying function. Cost is legible: the weight never returns to the clock; the town’s skyline is permanently altered; the elevator’s voice relinquishes grain-monopoly for song-hosting. Agency is collective but driven by her empathetically decisive orchestration—no coincidence resolves the bridging.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can he extract abandoned dreams without erasing himself—tightens with each pulse: first a stranger greets him, then the colleague appears wearing his own future. The third pulse forces the trade-off: keep excavating and the mirror (and self) splits. Cost is visible on-page when he pockets the shards and accepts a “wider field of view” at the price of total fragmentation.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering forgotten combinations—tightens when “looking at the right absence” becomes the only key; the fortieth-beat hinge sigh offers visible cost. Escalation is lyric-accumulative rather than causal-reversal, sufficient under Accumulative lens, but no secondary loss (tool, time, social credit) materializes to raise pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“create music in a silent world”—tightens when the sculptor chooses a companionable heartbeat over a symphony; this narrowing is visible and costs him the heroic narrative he first sought. Escalation is textural: each strum adds density until the grove’s sigh is audible; no reversal, but deepening suffices at this length. Cost is legible on-page: porcelain cools, higher chime lost, lower note accepted. No coincidence rescues; wind remains a future contingency, not present deus.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—restore beauty without erasure—tightens once when the tutor offers the impossible endgame instead of silence; agency is legible, cost is conceptual (exile risk). Escalation is a single deepening, sufficient for length, but lacks a tangible forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recover Anya’s silence-archive without violence—tightens when acoustic failure would mean perpetual locked loss. The meaningful turn is the micro-choice to listen for metallic forgiveness rather than force; this narrows options from physical to sonic. Cost is legible: if the bowl’s tone bruises, the archive stays sealed, so the narrator’s pacifist identity is on the block. The fireworks-clock supplies external pressure but remains parallel rather than intersecting, keeping the score just shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“motion calm inside a swaying world”—is signaled early and sharpened by nightly bridge tremors. Tightening occurs once: the bloom’s stench forces village-wide inhale/exhale sync; option space narrows to either accept rot-breath or lose bridges entirely. Cost is visible (nausea, social scorn) and persistent: narrator must keep tending the fetid flower indefinitely. Would reach 9+ if a secondary concrete loss (tool, time, friend) had been forfeited on-page; currently only sensory/relational price is dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“find the source of resilience”—tightens when the stream stalls for the arrow-tip test, foreclosing retreat. Escalation is Accumulative: each echo, drip, and leaf-ring adds density until the spindle image crystallizes. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: perpetual tending of echoes becomes the price of growth. One meaningful intensification suffices; no reversals needed.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent another rotorcraft crash—tightens when the investigator realizes the same wind-canyon will reload tomorrow. The tightener is the survey itself: each ribbon redraws the landing approach, narrowing options from “land anywhere” to “twenty meters north, three seconds late.” Cost is visible: the patch’s nod is a refusal to promise safety, only planning. Agency is procedural, not heroic, but still reconfigures the airfield’s future under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“certify wonder as essential”—tightens when each bell pulse risks no city reward, only the sculptor’s marble skin as collateral. One meaningful deepening: the pause between chisel taps becomes the only currency, forcing quieter breaths. Cost is visible in marble dust on sleeve and the aurora’s slowed river—options narrowed to hush or nothing. Accumulative escalation clean; no reversal needed.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—repair the breach or live as its vandal—tightens when the first ghosted note refuses to die. Agency is iterative: each note tests strain/give, each driftwood piece slows the weave, the third note loosens tempo, foreclosing shortcut forever. Cost is visible: vacant market stalls, black rain of raven dust, the apology carried off by birds. Escalation is single-crescendo rather than multi-reversal, sufficient for lyric 750-word frame.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can grief be typeset—tightens when the couple’s unmailed letters force the narrator to test transposed empathy. Escalation occurs via the halo fragment’s brightening: it demands the narrator risk personal exposure instead of hiding behind Maris. Cost is legible: surrender of protective ambiguity and the blank sky that follows. Slight overlap with Q2, but pressure trajectory is coherent under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—widow’s need to speak with the lost man—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when the tube answers with snow-footfall memory. Escalation is the deepening of shared breath that literally germinates a corridor; options narrow to “hold the pitch or let the moment collapse.” Cost is the thinning of the corridor and the courier’s renewed pang of mentor absence. Agency is courier’s decision to ask for her breath and plant the seed—he could have walked away.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—"prove objects absorb emotions"—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when the frost reassembles Mara’s undisclosable memory. The meaningful deepening occurs at the handprint beat: options narrow from abstract proof to irreversible personal recognition, cost felt in her trembling breath. Agency remains with the mystic; coincidence is absent. The price is visceral—Mara must re-carry grief she came to jettison—yet the escalation stops one hair short of forcing a visible tactical change in the moment itself.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—send a message across an impossible distance—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightens through each weave pass; the loom’s emptying is the felt price. No antagonist is needed; the impossibility itself supplies pressure. One meaningful deepening: the recognition that self-thinning is the toll. Coincidence is absent; escalation is purely accumulative density. Cost is legible but slightly abstract, keeping it just shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—will the town stand again?—is signaled in line 2. One meaningful tightening: the silk’s bruising wrist under wind-fire makes the cost visceral and narrows options to keep promising. Escalation is accumulative: each night adds density of knots and memory until the third-night wind forces the final offer. Coincidence (wind’s timing) complicates rather than rescues; the resolution is Iven’s offered memories, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—truth-weight of the sealed locks—tightens once the photolog replays child-redirect; options narrow from mystery to culpability. Escalation is textural: each parallel bay adds density until the same sighing coupler is unbearable. Cost visible: protagonist forfeits innocence in real time, shoulders responsibility for survivors-by-accident. No external reversals needed; internal pressure suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—keep the coast’s “tender hush” alive—remains stable; escalation is textural (lamp dies → birds invade → candle lit) rather than causal reversal. Agency is caretaking continuation, not reversal, so cost is atmospheric, not tactical. Because the closure simply affirms endurance, pressure plateaus rather than tightens decisively, keeping score in strong but not exceptional range.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: keep the beam true post-newsprint silence; pressure deepens when the child arrives—new cargo to keep safe. Escalation is situational: storm, drones, and mythic weather ratchet vigilance, but no option is foreclosed; the tower never considers abandonment. Cost is diffuse—endless nights, swallowed headlines—never localized into one felt forfeiture. Tightening is cadence, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—how to hold stories without bruising them—tightens once: the widow’s borrowed tales nearly scorch, forcing the indigo-steam release that loosens them. Protagonist agency drives the escalation: each tilt of the wing actively re-assigns magnetism. Cost is visible—the courier’s lightning-scars, the widow’s half-shadow burn-risk—altering tactics for later customers. Pressure stays coherent under the Accumulative/Textural lens: density of light-patterning, not external villain, escalates risk.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—“rekindle a dying realm” via communal song-threads—tightens when mornings are declared absent and the window-loom must be invented. Each harvest of voices (beekeepers, midwives) escalates risk of failure; the final pull is a decisive stance crystallization with communal cost: shared ownership of dawn. Agency remains protagonist-driven; no coincidence resolves. A hairline dip because the ledger omission beat is abstract, not viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—whether attentive practice can atone for complicit forgetting—tightens when the cashier’s arrival forces the narrator to move from private litany to shared stewardship. One meaningful deepening: the confession “I was late” narrows future options to perpetual return. Cost is visible in the promise of daily “holding.” Pressure is textural, not causal, but coherent under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“keep the last bright messages”—tightens when the mentor’s fractured pledge nearly shatters the lens, forcing the narrator to choose between personal memory and archival survival. Escalation is textural: spectrum tightening → birds of vows → narrator self-filing, each beat reweighting the cost of guardianship. The final renunciation (eternal indexing of erasure) forecloses escape, paying visible price under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—capture the sound of trust breaking—is signaled early and tightened through Lark’s series of false-start bargains that progressively corner Kettle and the smuggler. Each near-purchase narrows their silent allegiance until the lime spill forces the micro-reach that snaps it; the brittle inhale is the audible price. Agency is entirely Lark’s: her choices, not luck, lever the break. The cost is legible on the page (the smuggler’s stung recoil, Kettle’s retreat), but the price is paid by others; Lark’s own tactical options are not foreclosed, only her collection goal fulfilled, keeping the escalation just below the 8.5 gate for visible protagonist cost.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—will the skeptic trust emergent taste over doubt?—tightens once when honey at the fork forecloses solo path. Agency remains observant rather than decisive; Mirelle pacifies the storm, not the narrator. Cost is legible (loss of solitary compass-certainty) but pacifist convergence lessens felt jeopardy; still, the stance crystallizes under choral hush.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—liberate suppressed creativity—tightens once when the drawn lock fuses imagination with mechanism, foreclosing the option to remain merely a boardwalk vendor. Escalation is accumulative: each stored face presses against the crystals until the visual pressure forces expenditure. Cost is legible: the lid sighs, pigment rains, and the narrator forfeits anonymity by signing Vera’s name. One beat short of 8.8+ because external antagonist (gallery contract) is only recalled, not re-encountered.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: access to withheld candor. Escalation occurs when the protagonist’s rereading discovers the map, narrowing options to confrontation. Cost is visible: greenhouse dims, clientele forced into live confession, postmaster’s tin hands tremble. The final release of jar-vapor is the decisive intensification that reweights survival tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve wonder vs. archive order—tightens when Keepers reach for the shard; sunlight refraction deepens knowledge and forecloses seizure. Cost is legible in Iri’s tremor, the shard’s rope cradle, and Keepers’ slower descent. Single meaningful intensification fits length; no reversal required under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake: prevent rose runaway thirst from shattering dome. Escalation via accretion: magnetic flip → pump polarity reversal → roses dagger outward. Single tightening beat: the caretaker chooses mini-burn, foreclosing infinite-balance protocol. Cost visible: soot map, unlatched code-rib, archived voice now non-default. Agency drives every turn; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“prove listening heals”—tightens when each confession risks social exposure (eviction papers, lost-at-sea son). The developers’ brochures create external pressure that would erase the courtyard, sharpening the internal need to finish the ceremony before the space is lost. No reversal, but a meaningful deepening: the lock’s sigh translates accumulated ache into tangible access, foreclosing the option to keep Noemi’s archive private.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—free the drowned names—signaled early. Pressure escalates through pattern accumulation: each dice-throw tightens the cipher, each dance-step risks Warden cameras. The meaningful tightening occurs when “doubt entered the lung” and vents open; options narrow from stealth to exposure. Cost is visible: water withdraws, cabinets reveal puckered fingerprints, liberated voices now traffic overhead. Agency is collaborative choreography, not brute force—consistent with accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recovering a deleted memory—tightens once when the coffee spiral signals where the sister “left her name,” narrowing options to exhume the glass scroll. A second deepening occurs inside the gravity pocket: the corridor offers the memory but only as external cargo, forcing renunciation of internal reclamation. Cost is visible—lanterns shiver, ground eats his step, and he exits with hands full of someone else’s past rather than his own—so agency remains even within lyric texture. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes again, so while escalation is meaningful it stops just short of the 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation is textural: each ripple strips a digit, each hush-layer removes a future gear, narrowing the prophecy’s options until only “room” remains. The price is legible in the final breath: the summoner leaves the wing behind, paying with permanent vigilance—listening forward instead of owning victory.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens once via the archive transfer that forecloses repetition of the garden’s winter. Escalation is textural: each spiral of shell-listening increases density until the syllables finally move one-way into the narrator. The price (carrying winter) is visible on-page and alters later instincts (“listen before I speak”). No antagonist needed; pressure is situational and coherent. Agency is renunciation/acceptance rather than external conquest, fitting the lyric mode. Slight reserve: the cost, though felt, is more conceptual than tactical, keeping this just below the 9-line.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“why some echo, some vanish”—tightens through each sonic return: boy → woman → cousin → river → stars, each knot foreclosing escape. Agency sits in Lio’s questions and shell-aim; cost is the recognition that his own unpaid promises echo, visible when mother’s pot-song braids back. One meaningful escalation, no reversal overload; fits 600-word escalative lyric.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—surfacing submerged truth without shattering the community—tightens when the narrator chooses the shrine’s collective listening over public shaming; the option to accuse is foreclosed in favor of metered hymn. Pressure accumulates through each dream cameo and tap mapping; the welding company’s concession is earned by the townspeople’s recognition, not external force. Visible price: the narrator accepts anonymity and the townspeople accept complicity, both legible in the final shared silence.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—make invisible labor visible—tightens through each demonstrative beat: silent tea whisking → whistled echo → communal wiping. Escalation is textural: density of named invisible workers accumulates until councilor’s sash is sacrificed, felt price on page. No causal reversals, but pattern break is sufficient under Accumulative lens. Lacks one sharper constraint that would push 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“find the stillpoint before the next storm”—is signaled early and tightens when the calm’s math is revealed to be replicable, not divine. One decisive deepening: the diamond becomes a tunable tool, collapsing mystery into maintenance and forcing the final choice to teach rather than keep it. Cost is visible—time, skin, social capital with the prayer faction. No second reversal, but the single turn is sufficiently weighted for 800 words.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—becoming translator—surfaces early and tightens when the first note is trapped, foreclosing lifelong hoarding. Escalation occurs through successive jarred notes that force public sharing; each glass captured is an option foreclosed to private keep. Cost is visible: widow’s reclaimed song, poet’s emptied sill. Agency remains poet’s throughout; wind coincidence complicates but does not resolve. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal inflation.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—protect the Throat—tightens when rumor of skiff-borne seeker narrows options to adapt or fight. Marek’s agency: he decides to tune rather than defend, foreclosing violence and opening shared stewardship. Cost is the audible memory of drowned orchards that both must now carry. One meaningful escalation beat suffices; no coincidence resolves the standoff.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—will impatient fear surrender to patient vigilance—tightens when the girl’s rook-feather question forces the mapper to convert private practice into public teaching. Escalation is textural: each task (salt, threads, dust) widens the “quiet rings of thaw” until the option to tighten ropes is foreclosed. Cost is visible: men set down ropes, swallow shadows fold, mapper’s silence becomes instruction. No coincidence; pressure coils under Accumulative lens until stance crystallizes, satisfying the single meaningful deepening required at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—owning the truth vs. algorithmic closure—tightens when radios order “finalize” after the lantern flare reveals the missed nod. Escalation is textural: salt bloom, buried protocol, lantern soot accumulate until the investigator’s refusal pays the visible price (silenced radios, signed report). Cost is felt on-page; no coincidence resolves the standoff.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—Jonah’s need for a rhythm to deserve freedom—is signaled early and tightens when the thorn is removed, narrowing options to “choose again tomorrow.” Escalation is driven by chaplain’s agency under causal lens; cost is visible in the silence that listens back. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—make inaudible bell audible to future—tightens through iterative micro-tests; each failed cart run forecloses one pattern until only the hunger-geometry remains. Agency visible: Ilex nudges speed, encodes new ratios, risks cart skim. Cost: 29 dawns, acid-etched gloves, and the algorithm’s endless unsatisfied hum. Escalation is accumulative/textural: density of reflections builds until resonance flips the hinge; could wish for one sharper beat where a personal loss (time, health) is explicitly weighed.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—recover Aida’s erased voice—signaled early; pressure escalates via policy walls, doxx threats, and the Sink ritual. One meaningful tightening: the lyric challenge moment forecloses retreat. Cost is legible: job security and corporate hush money forfeited; no safety net shown.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—how to keep children from vanishing through ice—tightens when the mirrors reveal the shared delay. The protagonist’s agency is to propose the map of amends; refusal to impose certainty narrows options and raises social cost. One meaningful escalation: the floe-split page-turn sound under their first synchronized nod makes the risk audible.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—how to speak unkeepable love without apology—tightens once when the map-letter fusion is offered; the cost is visibly the traveler’s trembling map and the sentinel’s surrender of protective silence. Agency sits with both, but the single deepening is sufficient for lyric scope.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—keep echoes legible—faces escalating wind that wants to “scatter vowels”; the walker’s mid-day stitch-line tightens options and visibly costs fatigue (“strangely honest in his fatigue”). The tightening is single but meaningful, sufficient for lyric 760-word scope. Agency remains collective yet present: their joint consecration forecloses the path of loud permanence. Cost is legible in the final image of tracks filling, echo settling against ribs.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—collective healing—tightens when each story-thread narrows the possible shape of the corridor; the mayor’s joke marks a micro-turn that proves pressure has peaked, and the final word-offering forecloses passive grief, but no single visible price is paid by the narrator, so cost is collective, not personal.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—prove growth still speaks after dictionaries end—tightens once: crystal’s crack refuses to echo, forcing the scholar to write ratios instead of words. Escalation is density-driven, not causal; the “river reversing under ice” moment deepens rather than narrows options. Cost is conceptual (world loses new words) yet felt; visible price would require higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—capture the sound of growing older—tightens when every attempt (chalked circuits, driftwood compass) only widens the gap between self and memory. Agency stays on-page: each new marker is a visible price paid in splinters and dust, foreclosing the fantasy of bottled time. The reversal is not a twist but a deepening: the more meticulously he maps, the more certain he is that tomorrow’s self will be lost, making the final resetting an act of loving resignation rather than defeat.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—capture the Moon’s post-quake exhale—tightens when three-pixel smear threatens erasure; the collar quarter-turn forecloses further tinkering and locks in the image. Pressure escalates under causal lens: each adjustment narrows options until the final sharp frame costs the night’s stamina and the director’s silence. Price is visible on-screen and in body.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“execute a flawless goodbye”—tightens once, hard, when the therapist uses her own phone to summon the son, trading professional distance for moral success. Pressure is accumulative: each mundane hymn (latch, drip, radiator) adds density until the shard is passed and the final silence arrives; options narrow to a single shared breath. Cost is legible on-page in the son’s raw handling of the unwrapped shard and the father’s exhausted relinquishment. No reversal, but the single deepening is sufficient for 600-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“where shadows go at noon”—is signaled in paragraph two and pursued throughout. Pressure escalates accumulatively: mirrors multiply noons, shadows fold flatter, the hallway of uncast shade narrows choice to inward-only. The protagonist’s agency is ritual micro-precision; each turn of the key deepens the loop rather than breaks it. Cost is the irreversible internalization of noon-without-sun, a conceptual repricing that forecloses normal daylight forever.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—protecting Ari vs facing town justice—tightens once: the shoulder-reset scene forces the narrator’s merciful skepticism into public exposure, cost legible in Ari’s hiss and tomorrow’s backlash. No reversals needed; one deepening suffices. Agency (deciding to speak plain) drives the closure under Accumulative lens. Coincidence merely complicates (hedge wind), never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—how to give light without burning—tightens via each failed friction: fire once took roofs, now only tide-tumble is allowed. Polishing stroke = micro-agency that forecloses pyrotechnics; garland’s soft glow is the only remaining path. Visible price: decades of salt rasp in finger joints, time paid instead of matchstick. One meaningful intensification: when “garland learns its work,” option of future blaze is quietly extinguished.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single dominant stake—will they keep exploiting each other?—tightens when pendant burial forecloses future art-mines. Escalation is textural: each drip-dot and moss layer accrues until the only clean option is burial. Cost (loss of shared artifact) is legible on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—artistic integrity vs. marketable raft—signals early and tightens when the contrary river-thread offers only “footsteps and pauses.” The midpoint acceptance of emblems (letter, note, star-map) narrows options: once taken, the market ladder is foreclosed. Cost is visible—physical chill, emblem weight, and the sky’s “binding wider than rules.” One minor slack: external antagonistic pressure remains abstract (mist, market) rather than personified, keeping escalation just under 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—recovering reciprocity with the land—is signaled early and tightens through song-practice beats; the tightening is lyrical (density & cadence shift) rather than option-blocking. Visible price is present: cracked bowls mend, wax regrows—material proof—but the villagers themselves sacrifice nothing onstage, blunting cost legibility. Escalation remains gentle and accumulative; no reversal tests personal commitment. Meets lens; falls short of 8.8 because agency and price are externalized to Rowen and objects.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—rekindle navigable pathways for survivors—signals early and tightens once: the moment starlight braids the heartbeat-lines under the eye-shaped scab, the option to keep the light “safe” is foreclosed; he spends it. Cost is visible (ampoule re-sealed, half empty) andConceptually Repriced when the lake exhales. Under Accumulative lens, the deepening is the density of echoes that finally resonance-tune the map; no reversal is required. The price is legible, but because the world-restart is off-stage (aurora steps, compasses agree), the visceral punch is slightly blunted.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—harvest and safe-keep wonder—tightens once: from hoarding jars to relinquishing the timer, foreclosing future control. Escalation is accumulative: each echo captured raises the unspoken cost of storage until release becomes the only live option. No external antagonist; pressure is existential and acoustic. Visible price: the cave retains his laugh, a permanent acoustic tax.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—learn to bear burdens honestly—tightens through each weighing; the final fear-of-departure thread narrows options to “balance against the tide,” foreclosing denial. Cost is legible as conceptual price: fear finds a shelf, love now demands departure. Agency is interior translation, not external victory, fitting accumulative design. One meaningful deepening suffices; no coincidence resolves tension.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single dominant stake—how to let absence stay present—tightens through pattern, not plot reversals: each shaving curls like whiskers, each droplet teaches impermanence. Agency is renunciation; the notch remains blank, foreclosing restoration. Cost is felt, but the escalation is accretive; a sharper inflection at the knot could have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: exhume and pay for eroded ambitions via ghost negotiation. Escalation delivered through accretion of story-fragments that thicken bridge until ghost steps on; cost felt when regret is spoken aloud and sinks. No causal reversal, but deepening pattern tightens option: stay and measure time or keep fleeing. Luck absent; tension plateaus rather than spikes, keeping score sub-8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: prove hope is a solvable system. Escalation is accumulative—each redirected flow proves the equation on-page (sinks cough awake). Janitor’s desire for flood-shelter tightens stakes; mother’s arrival tests the system under live load. Cost is legible: sleepless bench, wet boots, unpaid labor—options foreclosed to perpetual maintenance.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—making peace with abandoned dream—is signaled in line 1 and tightens via ledger vow “to listen until the abandoned dream could sit beside him.” Escalation is accretive: each silence-bearing object (sleeping clocks, crystal veins, non-ticking glass) increases density until finch landing triggers the micro-turn—dream recognized as kin, not project. Cost is legible: he forfeits both city-building and total retreat, accepting perpetual dual weather. No causal reversal, but deepening pattern satisfies accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—exposing the city’s foundational lie—surges when the box’s ledger proves complicity; one meaningful tightening occurs as the narrator realizes the nightly radio silence was a deliberate window for erasure, not accident. Escalation is accumulative: each document layers complicity until silence itself becomes untenable. Engineered flood no longer abstract but a priced choice. Cost is legible: the protagonist forfeits his inherited alibi and must now row the truth upstream.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve vanishing knowledge—tightens through each decoded knot; every success forecloses the option to leave that method unspoken. The splice refusal supplies the single meaningful intensification: patience must become active (humming, rocking) or the braid—and therefore the knowledge—will lock shut. Cost is visible: frost-stung fingers, hours of vigil, the final surrender of secrecy to seeds. No coincidence; escalation is purely accumulative, lens-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    One dominant stake—how to make disappearance breathable—tightens through each naming ceremony; the latitude/horizon metaphor escalates from abstract cruelty to a mapped “inland sea beside the teacup,” foreclosing the option of permanent erasure and forcing the woman to inhabit absence differently, with visible cost paid in the wrist-loop ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“reawaken beauty in a mechanical world”—signaled line 3; pressure escalates by accretion of sensory friction (cold gears vs. warm egg) rather than causal reversals. One meaningful tightening: lightning-threaded ravine forces palace sway that cracks egg, marrying natural and mechanical rhythms. Cost legible: mills “learn to idle,” pistons taste rest—visible industrial forfeiture. Agency is caretaking endurance, not conquest; suffices under Accumulative lens. Could edge 8.5+ if a sharper tactical trade-off (e.g., sabotaging a mill) had been dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: can the town hold its story without burning? Pressure tightens when the coin’s west-lean blesses the lagoon ritual, foreclosing retreat. Protagonist’s agency is attention/ritual, not fight; cost is the exposed, perpetual double-allegiance she accepts. Escalation is accumulative—each echo (sand, coin, graft) raises the ante until the olive splice makes the transfer irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“liberate trapped memories before the last story cracks”—tightens when the broker offers tankers; Ilias’s refusal forecloses easy relief and pays the first visible cost. Escalation is textural: each unstuck voice adds a trickle, deepening the pattern rather than flipping plot. The woman’s counsel (“wait from the pause…”) functions as deepening, not reversal, forcing sidereal patience into lived time. Cost is legible on-page: broker’s grandmother’s smile, mason’s lime-scarred palm, Ilias’s open-ended vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“break the inheritance of flame”—is signaled in line 5 and tightens when travelers must power down burners to transit. One meaningful deepening: the captain’s admission of torching a field raises the cost of choosing resonance. Agency stays with caretaker who triggers the petal-rain; travelers’ surrender is reactive, not driving, keeping the score just below top band.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to let collective grief breathe without breaking it—tightens through each stone: seafarer, daughter, unnamed next. Agency is renunciation: carver accepts perpetual incompleteness, refusing to trap grief in fixed form. Cost is visible on-page: father’s hand steadies only after poem-verse is chosen, and carver’s last stroke is “single spare,” relinquishing flourish. Migration clock supplies external pressure, but escalation remains internal—depth of cut, not speed of plot—sufficient for accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring communal balance after precision-driven harm—tightens when the narrator hazards stopping the town’s master clock; the single reversal inside the pendulum’s pause narrows options to irreversible ethical action, price visible in the wider arc he gifts the town and the net he no longer critiques.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—uncover the shape of intentions—tightens when the tapestry border reveals a missing grave, forcing the gardener to decide whether to expose or protect the widow’s lie. Agency is continuous: each decode step (untangling knots, tapping case, fishing with needle) narrows options until he chooses to plant poppies, a visible cost. Pressure is coherent but gentle; the story eschews overt danger, so the cost is moral rather than visceral, sufficient for this length but not quite 9+ intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—seed innovation within constraint—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightened when the canal model (freedom) must accommodate shutters (form), a meaningful narrowing of options. The hinge choice is a visible trade-off that forecloses both the tower and burrow paths, paying a conceptual cost: future openness will require perpetual stewardship. Pressure is accumulative, not causal-linear, but remains coherent under the chosen lens. No coincidence resolves the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—keep the evacuated world verbally alive—tightens when the pirate voice demands future transmission as payment; the narrator’s option to remain a passive copyist is foreclosed. Escalation is textural: each song lyric increases the dust’s legibility, turning absence into mounting pressure to speak aloud. Cost is legible in the final promise, a lifelong burden that will expose the narrator to unknown listeners. Agency is attention and inscription rather than overt rebellion—exactly what a copyist can credibly offer.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can art testify without naming the abuser—tightens when mother hands over the un-mailed letters: the narrator must now convert private evidence into public pigment under the gaze of the man’s surviving spouse. Escalation is textural: each scattering of ash increases the moral opacity until visitors must decide who wore the mask, forcing the artist to surrender interpretive control. The cost is visible—mother’s “gray of resolve” and the narrator’s powder-blackened cuticles—showing endurance, not solution, is the only path. No reversal, but a decisive deepening: the chair’s ghost-rock converts inherited trauma into shared witness, narrowing future silence to a single audible creak.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—keep the cog and the ancient method alive—tightens when the three emissaries arrive; each suggested melting of the cog is a live threat. Escalation is mechanical and visible: incoming tide → silt jam → knee-high water → narrator forced to reveal secret marks. The cog itself is the price: once inserted and turned, it becomes public knowledge, no longer private leverage. One decisive turn of the wheel rewrites all factions’ options; the cost is the narrator’s exposed advantage, felt instantly.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“braid diverse voices into harmony”—is signaled early and tightens through subtractive rehearsals where silence replaces hate. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each erased judgment margin and shared breath thickens texture rather than flipping a causal turn. The rosette drop-catch between Rafi and Ola is the single micro-reversal that crystallizes trust; no further obstacle appears. Cost is conceptual but legible: the choir must keep practicing subtraction or the bridge collapses—an ongoing endurance rather than a decisive win.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can memory survive civic erasure—tightens with each cut: every pruned branch deletes a neighborhood story to make room for new growth. The council’s ordinance against memory food externalizes pressure; the chef’s gentle refusal to hate escalates risk. One meaningful reversal: tasting the classroom’s unfinished equations turns bitter, forcing him to spit—this act narrows options and commits him to shared ingestion. Cost is visible: the seedling’s luminous bark exposes the greenhouse to surveillance.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake: will wonder survive routine crisis? Pressure tightens once: the keeper must surrender his filter (the hidden tray) to the right listener or the city stays mute. The surrender is irreversible and narrows his future anonymity; options close. Cost is visible on-page: “truth leaves no pocket for delay.” Escalation is single-point but sufficient for 700-word frame; no reversal is needed when the surrender is this sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake— decode aliveness—tightens through three cottages: warm shard/click, cold shard/silence, bright shard/return of tin. Each tests commitment and forecloses interpretive options; cost is the narrator’s own pauses now conscripted into the houses’ breath. Agency is observational yet decisive; one deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: can hesitation be civic courage, not cowardice? Escalation is causal—each inch of threading unlocks another city “room,” narrowing the scholar’s options until she tether-bells permission. Mid-story reversal: ampoule is memory, not poison, forcing recalculation of moral cost. Price is legible: the breach stays open, the city must keep arguing on coral cushions—permanent vulnerability traded for mercy.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—“capture the texture of a missed opportunity”—is declared early, but pressure merely iterates: gaps open, “I say Wait,” gaps close. No tightening narrows options; protagonist never risks loss beyond abstract regret. Escalation is poetic repetition, not rising cost. No visible price alters later tactics; luck (dice) is followed, not resisted.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—proving kindness persists—tightens when the neighbor arrives bearing evidence the city has learned her language. One meaningful deepening: the map reveals her anonymous gifts have recursive consequences, forcing her to decide whether to keep hiding. Escalation is accumulative: each portrait/note layer increases social exposure until anonymity fractures. Cost is the forfeiture of invisibility, felt as the greenhouse leans closer and she accepts shared stewardship of the “quiet republic.”

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“rescue dying arts”—tightens when the lens reveals only viewed artifacts survive; the bread-letter launch is the visible price that forecloses passive cataloguing. Pressure escalates because earlier wax refusal hardens the need for a living archive. Stranger’s arrival complicates rather than resolves, forcing public mourning. Cost is chewed and swallowed live; no off-stage fix.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“step beyond fate”—is signaled in paragraph three and tightened when the keeper’s death-thread appears. One meaningful turn: after the blood price, stepping through becomes possible yet is renounced, foreclosing the supremacy of clocks. Cost is the forfeited orchard-room and the retained burden of her survival.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—prove existence under a gaze—signals early (“I do not exist unless someone is looking”). Escalation tightens when the shadow-creature confesses that unswerving attention sutures it shut; narrator weaponizes this weakness by aiming the camera, trading fear’s annihilation for self-recognition. Cost is legible: narrator’s visage smears into film emulsion, a permanent edit. One tightening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—survival of the drifting orchard—tightens when the cloud-mouth’s “D grown from pressure” forces an audible reply; the octave drop is the single decisive escalation that turns threat into duet. Cost is visceral: the prophet’s palms, the bruised pears, the knives converted to rattling sistrum—each conversion a visible forfeiture of safety. Agency stays acoustic; no off-stage rescue, only stacked resonance, yet the luck of the wind shifting into the perforated tower is marginally convenient. Still, the music acts, the deck tilts but holds, and the price is etched in the exhausted final sit-down.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will the cartographer follow the mother into erasure?—is signaled in line 3 and tightens when the corridor of glare opens. Agency drives escalation: each whistle note, each pattern read, actively widens the watchers’ corridor. Cost is visible: footprints that “thin into silence” foreshadow the price; protagonist still steps forward. One beat more of internal friction could have pushed higher, but pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—rescuing truth from the pit of lies—is signaled early and deepened through each artifact. Escalation is textural: density of charred slips, torn newspapers, and trembling marginalia reweights the moral cost rather than narrowing external options. One meaningful tightening occurs when the narrator realizes "schedules ran on secrecy," converting archival calm into civic complicity. The price is conceptual (the town’s memory rewritten), visible on the page, but lacks a visceral personal loss, keeping it shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“see which impressions bled true”—is signaled early and tightens when the stamp exposes pre-flood council imports. One meaningful deepening suffices: the registrar’s marginal note reframes the flood as deliberate lowering, foreclosing the “hapless disaster” reading. Cost is legible in the violet crowns on Ossa’s fingers and the library’s irreversible tilt in her mind.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through indexer labor: archival evidence versus performed narrative. Subtext lives in redacted sailcloth and violet ghosts—power conceals, then stains. Final image reweights “stillness” from refuge to weaponized attention. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers about whether truth can surface above tideline.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will grief regain shape or stay formless—tightens through each lantern crane; the option of full restoration forecloses when the shadow touches but refuses re-entry. Escalation is Accumulative: every steam-folded crane increases emotional density until the release ripple. Cost is visible in the laugh that emerges “hoarse as a knotted rope,” a sonic record of strain. No external antagonist needed; the conflict is ontological—how to carry an absence—and the tightening is the growing flock of cranes seeking impossible return.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—harvesting unused potential to keep the heart from burning—tightens once when the basin appears and the commander is dared; the price is the vow to “remain awake,” a credible forfeiture of rest, but no live option is foreclosed on-page, so escalation stays poetic rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—ownership of the past—tightens when the narrator realizes he carved the very plank that names both families, foreclosing denial. Agency is continuous: he kneels, gathers, offers, burns; each act pays an incremental price (microfilm surrendered to tide). Cost is visible: the forged archive literally dissolves into “clean syllables.” No coincidence resolves; luck only complicates when an unread plank turns out to bear his surname.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—lives for reputation—tightens when the second trade snags on a misremembered raid; negotiator’s intervention with the tarnished pull forecloses violence, paying visible social cost (both sides’ grudging nods). Escalation driven by protagonist’s micro-choice to expose shared history under moonlight, not by coincidence. Felt price: the healer’s departure leaves Estaran boy at risk, grain sacks acknowledge Voric hunger—resources spent.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can he still read the world well enough to keep others safe?—tightens when the boy’s father is already aground; failure will replay last year’s death. Each pole hum escalates by narrowing options: false cuts versus real channel, greedy tide versus draft. The protagonist’s own tool (compass) and method (poles) are turned outward to serve strangers, so the cost of competence is immediate—one mistake and three lives pay. Escalation is accumulative/textural: knowledge density increases until the final breath-held release, not a single causal reversal but a mounting chord.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—can guilt be outsourced?—tightens when the baseball literally warms, forcing vocal confession that forecloses clean-escape fantasy. Escalation is situational: environmental pressure (glow, heat) rather than antagonist, but the lake’s response visibly narrows options to stay or flee. Cost is legible: voice burns, eyes water, ledger accepted.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—restore Mira or lose self—tightens when the orchard demands ‘change and a drip that means loss’; the protagonist’s agency drives the escalation (choosing to open the rib-seam) and the visible price is the forfeiture of human speech, meeting the 8.8+ band test.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—open the lock without violence—tightens once the weight-rule is taught; every subsequent breath and memory either risks sealing or easing the hatch. The decisive turn is the calibrated gladness that lets palms touch the scale: a narrowing of options under the causal lens. Cost is visible: perpetual guardianship replaces conquest.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—pre-empt volcano panic—tightens when bottle arc becomes rehearsal for ash exhalation; cost is her vanishing into myth. One meaningful deepening: scientist’s toe-line re-labels tremor from threat to restraint. Agency remains Mara’s orchestration; coincidence complicates, does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—switch fort from spectacle to hearth—signals early and tightens when circuit tweak risks exposure. Protagonist agency drives every escalation: read sundial → pick locks → slot quill into control. Price paid is social identity as loyal guard; option to confess is foreclosed by Rhun’s nod. No reversal after blackout, but deepening suffices under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single dominant stake—redeem the brother—tightens twice: promise fire → learning grammar → choosing to keep the door. The final reversal forecloses rescue of the herder, price paid in real time. Tension accumulates under causal logic; no outside coincidence rescues. Escalation is linear, not deepening; no additional toggle raises stakes past midpoint, keeping it shy of 8-band peak.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—will the poet read their own scar-map or retreat—tightens when the caretaker demands the timer be started: silence measured in lightning becomes the price of knowledge. Agency is present: pressing the button, stopping the clock at thunder-crest, tracing the constellation. Cost is visible—poet’s hand steadies despite tremor, language rarefies to breath—but the caretaker’s speech absorbs some pressure, keeping the escalation just shy of 8-band intensity. Still, the storm’s final roll feels like earned complicity rather than external rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake: can questioning itself become a traversable door? Pressure tightens when sunlight, needle, primer strike accord—live option of departure materializes. Protagonist’s agency: redirecting Rook’s lunge with anvil-courtesy, then stepping into the gate. Cost: the atrium—former sanctuary—dissolves; departure is irreversible. One meaningful turn suffices; no escalation loops.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—save the outlaw library before next molt—tightens when demolition notice rattles inside the tin; option foreclosure is dramatized as they commit to riveting “night to morning.” Agency: poet spends inked pennies and reads them aloud, Lio wires lantern; these choices narrow retreat. Cost is visible in poet’s cracking persona and skyline “teeth marks.” Escalation is single-wave but sufficient for 700-word span; no reversal, yet deepening satisfies lens.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: can an individual rupture mechanical time without collateral damage? Pressure tightens when the film hiss carries the announcement that the last train is held—his private encore has bled into public consequence. The tightening is textural: tide-light pulled through roots, compasses steadying, station hush. Price is paid: the encore succeeds, but he must descend and face the delayed travelers—an ethical freight left on the platform.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: keep cultural memory from monsoon erasure; signaled in line 1. Escalation is textural—each pollen fall, backward count, and purpled horizon bruise tightens the humidity timer. Agency resides in choosing where to plant; the monsoon’s pause to “let us finish” externalizes stakes without deus ex machina. Cost is visible: soaked bodies, surrendered authority, and the tree’s vowel-bloom that replaces his lone voice.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can unspoken apologies be released without lying—tightens when lace drinks the cove: the option to keep words buried is literally absorbed away. Protagonist agency drives the turn: speaking aloud forecloses the mentor’s identity as silent shaper. Cost is immediate—compass hesitates, gull measures hush—pressure crystallizes without external coincidence. Sufficient escalation for 800-word lyric mode; one decisive intensification meets bar.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—stripping needless drama from loss—is signaled early and deepened through Mara’s methodical sweeping and data-like logging of decay. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses to "slow the bleed" rather than fix everything, foreclosing heroic rescue. Agency is consistent: her scientific discipline shapes every response, and cost is visible in what’s irretrievably gone (tomatoes, butterfly wing). Neighbors’ arrival adds communal pressure without diluting focus.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—truth versus survival—is signaled early and tightens when the ledger’s gaps reveal betrayal. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing frost-reading over guild confrontation narrows options to an annealed third way. Cost is unmistakable in the final stance: bearing witness without control over how truth is received, framed by “emptiness I shaped” as both artistic and existential price.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—translating silence into witnessed meaning—is signaled early and tightens through the narrator’s iterative corrections (e.g., learning sorrow “cools sharp”). Agency drives escalation: failures force algorithmic and botanical recalibrations, narrowing options until only disciplined, silent translation remains. Cost is unmistakable: inert forks, blistered lilies, and the permanent forfeiture of sound. The stakes deepen without abstraction; each sensor ripple carries emotional weight calibrated through lived trial.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—giving the dead a permanent address—is signaled early and deepens when the manual warns of miscalled storms, forcing the undertaker to choose between safety and fidelity to names. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he occupies impossible spaces, arranges mirrors, and taps code despite chased stillness prowling aisles. The mantled thing embodies the sea’s patient killing, raising tension without resolving it; resolution comes solely through the undertaker’s stubborn alignment of shards. Cost is unmistakable: he forfeits return to the surface world, breathing only when the library breathes back—a trade-off that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving dignity amid scarcity—is signaled early and tightens when the patrol confronts Mara, forcing her to declare donors “do not exist as persons.” This crystallizes stance under pressure, narrowing options to coded runs and generational pairings. Cost is unmistakable: elders’ fear, teens’ wired pride, and the ever-present lists. Escalation stems from protagonist agency—Mara’s choices—not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—releasing unused love—is signaled early and tightens when breath reveals hidden heat, forcing confrontation with the past-life self. Protagonist agency drives escalation: each exhale sends love outward, each inhale unlocks a rib-cage window. Cost is unmistakable: “shelves of unused hours,” “attic lungs,” and the risk of standing exposed on the viaduct. The man’s presence tests her resolve, crystallizing stakes without resolving them mechanically.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—giving grief exits—tightens when the designer realizes “exits always end as mouths that ask for more steps,” forcing renunciation of control. Protagonist agency drives escalation: pressing the shard reorganizes space, stepping flips pages, kissing books releases birds. Cost is unmistakable—the present is “a continual photograph fading”—and this conceptual price shapes his final acceptance. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: density of memory-images multiplies until the pavilion becomes an unclosable cathedral, crystallizing his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—planting resilience in dry soil—is signaled early and tightens when enforcers enter, forcing Mara to choose speed over caution. Her agency drives escalation: decoding keys, jamming gears, triggering the trapdoor—all under the rhythm of falling stone. Cost is unmistakable: she risks capture to retrieve seeds, carries weight of chain-as-sling, and leaves the arrow behind as deferred hope. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; each beat deepens commitment without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—capturing the sound of trust breaking—is signaled early and escalates through protagonist agency: testing devices, forging the bowl, applying it to the diver, then confronting their own past. The meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist realizes they must record trust *before* fracture, not after—a shift that narrows options (no more passive listening) and raises cost (reliving betrayal). Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, culminating in a Charged Poise: characters now choose rupture with knowledge, turning memory’s “ballast stone” into navigable weight. Coincidence (sponge claiming compass) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the protagonist acts.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—pressing an ear to destiny’s door—is signaled early and tightens when the bouquet warns “beware false guides.” The thief’s agency drives escalation: cracking the jar, following night-bloomers, unlocking the freight room. Cost is unmistakable: the mentor’s wasted attempt to steal too-large a sunset, and the thief’s relinquishment of the old identity. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of light imagery deepens until the final reconfiguration of purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—crafting “safe zones for inquiry”—tightens meaningfully when Arlen confronts the technician’s abandoned bookmark, forcing a choice: honor haste-avoidance or impose his own timeline. His agency drives escalation: narrating tasks isn’t whimsy but method to “teach water to change its mind,” turning environmental pressure (melting ice) into moral calibration. Cost is unmistakable: “arms shook” from labor, plus the emotional price of inheriting another’s unfinished courage. The deepening—“safeness is not a wall… terror cannot find purchase”—emerges from action, not declaration, narrowing options to patient creation over forceful restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—proving vulnerability is power—is signaled early and tightens through the cipher quest, which forces the protagonist to weaponize fear (“Fear could be a lever, not a lock”). Agency drives escalation: decryption requires breath-counting steadiness, then climbing the roof despite phobias. Cost is unmistakable—the brother’s hunted life, the child’s coded plea—and the final plan (“return the credits and keep the courage”) trades professional identity for familial truth. Pressure coheres causally; no off-stage resolutions or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—mapping how night moves through us when it outlives names—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency: her summarizing of silence forces the courier’s renunciation of his mission. Escalation occurs via density increase (gaps as coordinates, absences as coastline) culminating in the courier’s shift from burning records to carrying hope. Cost is unmistakable: her bleeding fingers, his torn sleeve, the flaking gold, the star’s fragility—all tangible prices paid for the map’s creation. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from character choice under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether thoughts can be traced to origin—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist-driven loop adjustments (“I adjust the angle of attention”). Each replay narrows options: first noticing frost trails, then playing, then reconciling schedules. Cost is unmistakable: “no grand revelation,” only “fingerprints of attention” on ice. The escalation is Accumulative—pressure tightens through textual density, not causal turns—and the final renunciation crystallizes under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—thawing mistrust through transparency—is signaled early and deepens when the registrar’s private eavesdropping shifts to public confession. Escalation is protagonist-driven: each doodle read narrows options until only communal exposure remains. Cost is unmistakable: his fear of “rot” compels risking social ruin, and the troupe/curator’s reconciliation exacts the price of mutual vulnerability. Coincidence (finding the lens) complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency lies in choosing how to wield it.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—proving gardens know their gardeners—is signaled early and deepens when the maze rejects the narrator’s “mended deception.” Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he confesses, kneels, and offers soil, forcing the garden to relent. Cost is unmistakable—the vine’s indecision, his cracked hands mirrored in marbles—and narrows options: no more lies, only honest tending. Luck’s meters dimming into fireflies crystallizes the shift from measurement to mutual trust.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—restoring the mantas while proving sideways time—is signaled early and deepens when Jae chooses to invert fields despite skepticism. Escalation is driven by his agency: patching the probe, pulling the lever, setting beacons. Cost is felt in his isolation and the manual’s warning ignored (“written for linear seas”), and crystallizes in his decision not to claim credit. The biologists’ tears underscore what he gains socially but cannot possess intellectually.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the ghost’s silent score—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist must “step on reflections only,” foreclosing physical safety for fidelity to the code. Escalation is driven by agency: turning pages, shouldering a door, raising the baton. Cost is unmistakable: the bargain between obedience and drowning, and the final “release” of breath implies long-held tension paid forward. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, deepening through patterned intensification, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—weighing a swallowed truth—is signaled early and deepens through tactile ritual (holding the page, smudging ash). Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: choosing to speak at the margins, not the center, which narrows emotional options and reweights silence. Cost is unmistakable: the lie “survived like a seed in the dark of my throat,” and release comes only through bodily recalibration (“widen my stance”). Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, tightening via sensory and symbolic density rather than plot turns.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—measuring the weight of a swallowed truth—is signaled early and deepens through the narrator’s methodical tracking of fear-patterns. Escalation is driven by agency: interpreting calls, mapping hums, turning the wheel. Cost is unmistakable: “weight arrived in my arms… from the stubborn metal of intention.” The tightening forecloses emotional resolution (no forgiveness of people) in favor of mechanical honesty, altering tactics and stance under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving witnessing without interference—is signaled early and tightened when the river floods, forcing tactical adaptation (burrowing via swan). The keeper’s agency lies in renunciation: refusing to protest textual decay or mend books, accepting mulch as renewal. Cost is legible in flaking mortar seasoning tea and loosened laces of judgment. Escalation follows Accumulative logic: each sensory intensification (crawling letters, growling river) reweights silence from absence to regenerative force.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—nurturing wonder amid grief—is signaled early and tightens during totality when Ada opens the locket, transforming passive memory into active offering. The therapist’s agency drives escalation: shifting song rhythm, placing locket on guitar, whispering insight—all narrow options toward shared vulnerability. Cost is felt in Ada’s enduring pain (“nights were hard”) and the irreversible exposure of her keepsake. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—collecting stories before silence forgets their grammar—is signaled early and tightens when the historian realizes rooms woke in terror after dreams ended. His agency drives escalation: reading diaries leads to probing the flue, which yields the brass disk, which reveals the spindle as axis-wound. Cost is unmistakable: he absorbs stranded stories, becoming conduit rather than witness. The deepening—that displaced geometry unseated dreams—narrows his path to active stewardship, crystallizing stance without false hope.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—transposing life into a “new key” where truth is visible—tightens decisively when specs are repurposed from spycraft to communal revelation. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing sea over ferry ticket, boiling sugar with the keeper, feeding fortunes to the lens. Cost is unmistakable: forfeiting escape for entanglement (“hands sticky with sugar and salt”), and the agent’s hollow victory underscores stakes’ transformation. Coincidence complicates (fisherman’s arrest) but never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—Mara’s voice versus the whisper’s control—is signaled early and tightens through Father Ilario’s escalating rhetorical tactics. The “unpaid bill” backstory isn’t exposition but a revealed contract that sharpens moral calculus: warmth traded for selfhood. Protagonist agency drives escalation—Ilario’s choices narrow options until Mara’s single step breaks the lease. Cost is legible in her laughter and the evaporated possession.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—becoming conductor of unheard symphonies—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist chooses to “invent the orchestra without frightening the silence,” narrowing options to non-invasive methods. Escalation is driven by agency: mapping memories onto frost deepens pressure until sirens arrive “shy to join,” forcing integration of urban noise. Cost is unmistakable: exhaustion deferred but inevitable, and the hospital corridor’s “compulsory kindness” reframed as metronome—a conceptual price paid for transforming trauma into rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—conquering the self-labyrinth—is signaled early and deepens through the procedural generation mechanic, which narrows options as timelines collapse or flare. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: their trust in rain-guided steps forces trade-offs (ignoring branches showing falls or forbidden rooms). Cost is legible in the erasure of the tablet and the acceptance of subtraction (“every count felt like subtraction”). Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—defeating numbness—is signaled early and escalates through protagonist agency: Mara initiates the needle-drum surgery, chooses to reverse-play pulses, threads the filament. The tightening occurs when backward music reveals “seams of music,” forcing her to confront absence before mending it. Cost is unmistakable: her earlier failure to notice her own numbness (“she had already stopped without noticing”) crystallizes into Charged Poise—teaching tenderness despite an “unkind” world.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving epistemic integrity against institutional obfuscation—is signaled early and tightens when the rogue quarantine’s lack of seal invalidates official maps. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: they choose lateral progression over confrontation, deploy decoys, and encode truth for the archivist. Cost is unmistakable—the surrender of immediate safety, the abandonment of instruments, and the emotional toll of being “protected” against one’s will. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with each sensory detail heightening moral urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding scent-triggered grief—is signaled early and deepens when the vial’s UV-revealed inscription ties his mother to amberhorn. The broker’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to open the empty vial despite knowing its effect, enabling the flower’s bloom and his own catharsis. Cost is unmistakable: his tears are archived as data, his lantern offered as payment, his trauma transformed into communal knowledge. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens—each sensory detail tightens the emotional aperture until the bud’s “disciplined lightning” unlocks release.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (“discover time’s texture without breaking what can feel”) tightens when the energy being reveals the clock-prison vision, forcing a trade-off between heroic myth and ethical honesty. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to loop rope, ask “how time bruises,” and confront the mirror. Cost is legible in the final vow—forgoing self-aggrandizement for “ethically playful” accountability. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—finding beauty in the unfinished—is signaled early and deepens through the violinist’s agency: choosing unfinished songs, collecting fragments, redefining mending as “direction” not glue. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, intensifying via communal participation until the final turn—visiting “halves and almosts”—which forecloses restoration in favor of tending. Cost is felt in lost fires, warped coins, and cracked bells.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—fusing insight with empathy before data hardens into meaningless charts—is signaled early and deepens through the dealer’s method: counterfeit must “subsume cold edges rather than erase them.” Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: Rhea chooses affectionate detachment over burn or oblivion; dealer risks emotional exposure by wanting to witness her transformation. Cost is unmistakable: Rhea abandons pure mapping for vulnerable listening; dealer relinquishes control by letting her take the petal. The tightening—“fusion is delicate”—forecloses easy solutions, forcing trade-offs under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—uplifting silent contributors—is signaled early and tightens when Mara risks exposure by initiating the Ledger. Agency drives escalation: her forgiveness of demurrage, Jun’s late openings, their joint research. Cost is unmistakable: secrecy has “taxed the town’s spirit,” and recognition remains “risky.” The granddaughter’s unthrown gratitude and folded notes prove stakes were viscerally materialized, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—grafting into community via shared space—tightens when the arbor’s destruction fractures gathering. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing listening walks over petitions, then reed sculptures over statues. Cost is legible in the “luminescent ache” that only glows when shared. The “repeatable curve” posture crystallizes stance under pressure, foreclosing solitary artistry for collective embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—finding where echoes are born—is signaled early and deepens into ethical tension: to observe or to intervene? The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: borrowing time, widening the oval, then deliberately closing it to release the larva. Cost is unmistakable: time must be repaid (“seconds tugged from my cuffs”), and the protagonist stays past safety to complete the sketch, risking further debt. The “interrupted cadence” isn’t just thematic—it’s the precise mechanical condition enabling the climax, making stakes visceral and rule-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes are singular and early-signaled: to map ambiguous loss through emotional mathematics. Escalation occurs via the conjurer’s deepening ritual—balancing eyes, whispering names, threading moonlight—which narrows options from understanding to endurance. The cost is felt in his renunciation of reunion for coherence, crystallized when he leaves the eyes behind. Agency drives every turn; coincidence never resolves, only complicates (e.g., moonlight’s arrival enables but doesn’t solve).

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—becoming visible to those who need you—tightens when the outage lowers “the world enough that whispers could surface.” His agency drives escalation: testing tape, mapping footfalls, guiding hum toward window. Cost is felt in his silent withdrawal despite joy (“heart big as a boiler”). The deepening shift—visibility as crafted trace, not confrontation—narrows options credibly under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether care requires control—is signaled early and tightens when storms prune “the town’s certainties.” Mara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to stop tying knots, steps aside from the jasmine-hop braid, and refuses reconstruction. Cost is visible in relinquished authority (“not an authority, I am a witness”) and social vulnerability (customers find her words “slow”). Coincidence complicates (river crossing road) but resolution stems from her renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—threshing meaning from postwar trauma—is signaled early and tightens when the brooch demands return, forcing an exchange that costs them the gnat (a “tiny held storm”). Agency drives escalation: the painter chooses to pocket, then pry; the keeper chooses remembrance over possession. Cost is unmistakable in the keeper’s wordless weeping and the deliberate release into the seam. Coincidence (finding the brooch) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the resolution is earned through pact-making.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—to magnify everyday magic without conquest—is signaled early and deepens when the pilgrim questions taking’s impact on his village. Pressure escalates via the cave’s “steadily unpredictable” music, which shifts from rain-like tones to polyrhythms to a cradle beat, forcing emotional recalibration. The clairvoyant’s attempt to stop the pearl is thwarted not by coincidence but by unseen forces that draft “a different script,” making her agency a site of loss. Cost is felt in her displaced role and the irreversible transfer of sacred duty.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—practicing return without spectacle—is signaled early and deepens when the woman asks to “hearten the harbor.” The archivist’s agency lies in attention: choosing to listen to absences, to turn the valve with her rhythm, to mark vanished moments. This escalates pressure not through conflict but cadence, narrowing options to ritualized collaboration. Cost is visible in what’s absent (confetti, banners) and what’s gained (a metronome, a promise), with the dockworker’s salute marking societal re-recognition earned through micro-practice.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—accessing unspoken truths—is signaled early and tightens when the whisper demands payment “with patterns you understand.” Protagonist agency drives escalation: aligning arrows, punching air, folding maps. Cost is legible (“patterns keep you”) but slightly abstract; the fortress’s demand lacks visceral immediacy compared to earlier tactile stakes (e.g., skin constellations). Still, the deepening—from tracing cracks to unbuttoning patterns—narrows options coherently under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—sculpting reflection without surrendering reason—intensifies when Lio’s question forces engagement beyond transcription. Protagonist agency drives escalation: aligning tile to “whale road,” transcribing wind-drawn geometries, sitting in the conjured room. Cost is unmistakable: admitting personal loss erodes professional armor, yet enables the room’s creation. Under Accumulative lens, pressure builds via pattern density until the whales’ breach crystallizes meaning—no off-stage resolutions, only earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—discovering “what happens after goodbye”—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist-driven escalation: arranging mirrors, summoning Lio, tuning coils. The spatial mutiny isn’t coincidence; it’s provoked by the narrator’s actions, forcing a trade-off (memories for witness, unforgiveness for future tense). Cost is unmistakable: “centuries stuck like frost to my throat” paid as tribute, Lio’s emotional armor softened into vulnerability. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with the corridor’s emergence narrowing options to one irrevocable walk forward.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—fair trade versus inherited fraud—is signaled early and deepens via the asylum plan. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: silencing alarms, exploiting the director’s inattention, choosing truth over lies when stopped. Cost is unmistakable—the warmth cleaned away, the ledger exposed—and narrows options irreversibly. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens, with each sensory detail tightening the moral vise until the van swallows Arman and the air “wakes a little.”

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—tending silence through invented histories—is signaled early and deepens when the basin freezes, forcing adaptation (“press a page against the ice”). Protagonist agency drives escalation: charting hum, refracting light, writing specific fictions. Cost is felt (“lamps in town will wake again someday… my pages will be only paper”), though conceptual rather than physical. One tightening suffices, but lacks a second concrete trade-off beyond emotional endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming erased history—is signaled early and tightens when the mechanic reveals the widow’s role, narrowing options to confrontation. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he chooses to show the label, then to leave it as evidence. Cost is unmistakable: he forfeits identity again to force her moral reckoning. The clerk’s departure underscores that truth threatens bureaucratic survival, raising stakes without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—decoding the universal riddle before “the tide drags the answer away”—is signaled early and escalates through protagonist agency: he chooses resonant hums over words, thinks of disproved myths to move the compass, retells uphill-river lore into the cello. The meaningful tightening occurs when the shell “bites his palm,” aligning with “a barely remembered bruise,” forcing him to confront failure as catalyst. Cost is unmistakable: the riddle unclenches only after he abandons certainty for kindness, paid in emotional labor (listening to the sky’s “stitched smile”) and physical ritual (packing the cello “like a bandaged child”).

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—navigating gentrification without losing communal memory—is signaled early and tightens when VIP fences appear. Nessa’s agency drives escalation: she encodes instructions, offers a trade, and activates the console, each choice narrowing options (e.g., revealing the spiral to the liaison). Cost is unmistakable: temporary reprieve (“only a season”), familial strain, and the risk of exposure. The deepening occurs when the poet-liaison decodes the spiral, forcing Nessa to convert subterfuge into negotiation—a credible, high-stakes pivot under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—documenting extinction to secure preservation funds—tightens via the timed vials’ countdown, each flame narrowing the window for proof. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing chemical timing over failed tech, positioning the camera at the snow seam, pressing the shutter despite knowing the photo won’t save the moth. Cost is felt in the red-eyed satellite’s retreat (“embarrassed to witness”) and the unspoken truth that archives can’t hold breath. Coincidence (stray satellite light) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the moth’s emergence is earned by lunar conditions and the inspector’s patience.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—decoding feedback into direction before coupling—is signaled early and tightens when fog swallows a lantern, muddying the water’s surface and causing the drone to hesitate. This reversal forces the artisan to innovate mid-crisis: she patches code “midair with taps” and uses falling rain as new data. The cost is palpable—loss of ritual certainty—and alters tactics immediately. Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, with each deepening (first car success, second car slant) narrowing options until precision becomes survival.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether to name or listen—is signaled by “maps insisted otherwise” and deepens when condensation offers “patient geography.” Protagonist agency drives escalation: sketching droplets, prying open lockers, turning valves “while the falcon clicked its beak.” Cost is unmistakable: the ledger records “minutes” of rivers’ quorum, accepting that naming follows listening “the way a scar follows an honest wound.” Coincidence never resolves; even the falcon’s impatience spurs action, not salvation.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—restoring communal balance through sound—is signaled early and deepens when the mother’s return transforms private ritual into collective practice. The tuner’s agency drives escalation: his pacing awakens shutters, which draws neighbors, which braids pathways “like a loom unknotting grief.” Cost is unmistakable—the mother’s fractured marriage, the bell’s crack—and paid through vulnerable acts (sharing stories, walking toe-then-heel). Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from embodied choices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—rescue via signal transmission—is signaled early and deepens when the temple’s hush becomes the conduit. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: unsnarling the line, overriding instinct, exhaling tones “like a prayer taught backward.” Cost is unmistakable: air depletes, time runs short, panic threatens. The narrowing corridor and silt-blindness raise stakes without coincidence; resolution stems from endurance, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—trading false alarms for a truer bell—is signaled early and tightens when the narrator chooses silence over testimony as the boat approaches. This agency-driven deepening forecloses his old identity (“cry wolf boy”) with palpable cost: he becomes echo, not origin. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens; each beat densifies the hush until it “told me why the doors stayed open.” Coincidence never resolves; the coming boat complicates but doesn’t solve.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—awakening the orchard without selfish grief—is signaled early and deepens when the ghost bride demands a promise. Protagonist agency drives escalation: his choice to keep her terms enables the first awakening, then later lessons reshape his method (“press and release like a vow”). Cost is unmistakable: he forfeits personal memory, spring, and closure for fidelity to the orchard. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from his decisions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—transforming salvage into ceremony—is signaled early and tightens through Sera’s agency: she chooses to sew, to follow ghost routes, to press the plate into the beak-socket. Each act carries cost (time, emotional labor, risk of exile), culminating in the irreversible offering of the plate. The escalation is driven entirely by her stubborn optimism under the Accumulative lens, with the town’s astonished reverence marking a decisive reweighting of communal hope.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—restoring interrupted faith—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist chooses to rebuild the gnomon, shifting from documentation to participation. This act narrows options: staying becomes inevitable, exile foreclosed. Cost is legible in “hinge give way in my chest” and daily tending that replaces departure. Pressure escalates via accumulation (bones, coins, teeth) until gentleness itself becomes the tactic, widening motion “like water.” Coincidence (storm opening tomb) complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency drives every meaningful turn.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—delivering truth via renamed identity through slow mail—is signaled early and deepens through tactile constraints (chalk decoding, alias testing). Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to kneel, interpret, juxtapose, and finally select “Auricle.” Cost is legible: time, vulnerability, the weight of carrying another’s fear. Though no antagonist appears, pressure coheres through systemic urgency (vans coughing awake, sorting machinery heartbeat) and internal calibration against lies.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—listening for unheard stories—tightens when the whisper reveals falsified star charts, forcing the embroiderer to loosen threads and leak laughter. Agency is quiet but decisive: she chooses to stitch the jester above Polaris, douse ash-drawn names, and accept blame. Cost is felt in snapped threads, contracted flame, and the keeper’s trembling wrist. Escalation is driven by her attention, not external force, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—accessing the “moment before deciding” to repair relational rupture—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency: tying the shard, speaking unsent words, practicing stillness on water. Escalation occurs via textural intensification (spirits tuning mangroves into “cathedral ribs”) and a decisive turn: choosing witness over reversal. Cost is felt in the crescent scar, the “fierce tenderness cracking my ribs,” and the admission of shame. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, narrowing not options but the clarity of what must be carried back.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—translating unspoken grief into shared language—is signaled early and tightens when the surgeon’s news forces physical contact between estranged kin. Protagonist agency drives escalation: decrypting notes, stitching script, using coral as punctuation. Cost is unmistakable in the mother’s sleepless eyes and the “war-bell dull[ing] to a gong of rain.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering joy through artistic reclamation—is signaled early and deepens when the protagonist realizes she cannot restore the past alone. The meaningful tightening occurs when she abandons solo projection for communal correction, narrowing her path from individual salvage to shared mythmaking. Cost is felt in her surrender of curatorial control; agency drives escalation via her decision to “send a pulse through the mesh.” Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—exchanging certainty for curiosity—is tested when the wall demands the narrator’s hidden fear. Agency drives escalation: tapping the nickel initiates dialogue, admitting fear earns the mural’s trust. Cost is felt in the narrator’s vulnerability and the curator’s unmet expectation of “faithful” work. Under Accumulative lens, each echo tightens the thematic knot between restoration and revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—freedom to think without taxation—tightens when footnotes become contraband and audit towers rise. Protagonist agency drives escalation: founding the club, mapping gardens, exploiting the “artistic rehearsal” loophole. Cost is unmistakable: Kline’s permits targeted, collectors arrive with “drone umbrellas,” and the greenhouse erupts in “converging chaos.” The climactic choice—to stage a public garden concert—narrows options by weaponizing legality against itself.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming pain into beauty without betraying memory—is signaled early and deepens when the Gardener demands breath-signatures and renunciation of “sharpness as safety.” Pressure tightens via the poet’s repeated lullaby attempts, culminating in the fifth-cycle opening. Agency is clear: the poet chooses consent despite ongoing insomnia. Cost is felt in the vow’s humid permanence—solitude is relinquished, yet sleep remains elusive, charging the ending with bittersweet poise.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake (“preserve forgotten names”) intensifies when the wind warns the chime’s sound is “escaping into nothing,” forcing a tightening: the caretaker must act before memory dissolves. Agency drives escalation—their systematic gait, humming catalog numbers, and breath-synchronized sewing narrow options under time pressure. Cost is unmistakable: the chime’s repair demands emotional exposure (“the first forgotten name I ever tried to keep”) and physical risk (stitching without silencing truth). The wind’s intervention complicates but doesn’t resolve; victory comes solely through the caretaker’s skilled endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—restoring trust after silence—is signaled early and deepens through the protagonist’s agency: she composes interconnected promises, risking further rejection. The tightening occurs at the stele flashback, where her past recklessness caused the rupture, raising the cost of present vulnerability. Escalation is driven by her decision to write, not wait, and Lio’s test of the promises forces mutual alignment. Coincidence never resolves; wind “answers” only because the archive was pitched as an instrument by design.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—harmonizing water flow and volcanic stillness—is signaled early and deepens through the discovery of betrayal and forbidden love. Protagonist agency drives escalation: decoding residue, locating the sluice, tuning gates. Cost is unmistakable: encrypted compassion requires anonymity, sacrifice of credit, and acceptance of partial justice. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, culminating in a hum that satisfies neither side fully but sustains the whole.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving lost songs against erasure—is signaled early and deepens when the attic’s closure forces irreversible choices. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: mapping dust, composing the choir, choosing Lark. Cost is unmistakable: relinquishing control of music to another, trusting despite past theft. The meteorite chip’s weight literally balances emotional risk, and the final act forecloses isolation with visible sacrifice (“boxes swallow spines”).

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding sacred thresholds—is signaled early and deepens via the logbook/grain alignment, which narrows options to a single seam. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: reading codes, laying palm, pressing seam. Cost is legible (“ache” of distance kept) though not physically dramatized; under the Accumulative lens, this suffices. No false resolutions—luck never intervenes, and the scarecrow’s presence complicates rather than solves.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—learning belonging without pretense—is signaled early and deepens through the shared exhale ritual, which risks exposure to gain algorithmic trust. Agency drives escalation: choosing vulnerability over extraction (“guide others here only if the city wished to be a home”) forecloses colonialist salvage. Cost is felt in relinquished urgency (“until sunrise” becomes “dawn as password”) and emotional exposure. The tightening occurs when the engine demands truth, forcing the protagonists to articulate desire under duress—a cadence shift that reweights all prior silence.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering why paths vanish—is signaled early and deepens into ethical responsibility. Escalation occurs through the protagonist’s agency: listening, conjecturing, following seeds, interpreting the pool. The tightening forecloses the original path but opens a footnote-turned-poem, with visible cost in rerouted travel and deferred return. Pressure remains coherent under an Accumulative lens, with each beat adding texture that reweights silence as respect.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—orchestrating meaningful connection in transience—is signaled early and deepens when the janitor’s grief collides with the girl’s wonder. Protagonist agency drives escalation: planting questions, tilting the bishop, balancing it on water. Cost is unmistakable—the performer risks irrelevance if his “calculated wilderness” fails, and the returned bishop confirms success isn’t ownership but shared resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory against state-enforced amnesia—is signaled early and deepens through the act of inscription. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing exile, selecting the garden, initiating the verse, and defining its content (“Your departures, my returns”). Cost is unmistakable: permanent exile, reliance on clandestine gestures, vulnerability in shared intimacy. The tightening occurs when the verse transforms from abstract desire to living stanza on skin—a trade-off that forecloses anonymity but enables collective resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving the luminous ordinary against erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the boy reveals the ferry’s imminent end, forcing the glazier to act. His agency drives escalation: choosing the pond over blueprints, reinterpreting the architect’s “bone and arrow” as memory, deciding to embed ferry scars into benches. Cost is unmistakable: the loss of the ferry ramp, the father’s uncertain future, the town’s unacknowledged beauty. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each ripple, each conversation deepens the moral weight until advocacy becomes inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—translating pain into legibility—is signaled early and tightens when the woman arrives, forcing the protagonist to relinquish custodianship. The escalation is driven by his agency: choosing to meet, offer the box, and collaborate on repair. Cost is unmistakable in “houses that would not open again” and the enduring weight of “burned fingers.” Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies through textual density, not plot turns, culminating in a reconfigured bargain.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—recalibrating communal hope—tightens when trial balloons reveal parallel selves failing together, forcing the insight that “hope wanted buoyancy… but also ballast.” Agency drives escalation: each pattern adjustment alters the needle’s “etiquette,” culminating in a shared diagram that crystallizes a new equation. Cost is unmistakable in the village’s pre-grotto stupor and the protagonist’s solitary labor, now transformed into collective practice with visible stakes (“teach the village to string windows…”).

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—faithfully mapping legacy’s burden—tightens when the negative reveals a child offering a hopscotch grid, forcing the protagonist to “play the room.” This deepening shifts tactics from passive listening to embodied ritual, narrowing options: either perform the child’s instruction or shirk the vow. Cost crystallizes in the “shawl woven from echoes,” heavy yet warming—a trade-off between emotional weight and purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—persuading mirrors to show possibilities—is signaled early and tightens when the painter demands precise musical measures (“tune of stay… drop of unless”). The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: they sing, breathe, match rhythms, and finally see futures *because* they abandon commanding for asking. Cost is unmistakable: the painter’s exhaustion, the heartbeat’s caution, the discipline required to “keep singing.” Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, deepening through textural intensification, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—anchoring ideals in practice—is signaled early and tightened through the negotiator’s insistence on ritual over spectacle, which narrows options (no swords, no slogans). Protagonist agency drives escalation: drafting breathing rhythms, asking children for visions, demanding casings be added. Cost is unmistakable—the general’s shaking redraft, anger softening to “something usable”—and the deepening turn (“redemption priced by work shared”) reweights all prior conflict. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: density of ritual acts intensifies until silence “cooled… wide enough to place tools.”

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving echoes over life—is signaled early and deepens through tactile escalation: smuggling the egg, building chambers, tuning the flat. Protagonist agency drives every turn; coincidence never resolves. Cost is felt in the slackening spine, watering eyes, and the donors’ misreading of his “ruthless compassion.” The drought-machine tightens options until only ritual remains.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—freeing silenced voices—is signaled early and deepens when guards approach, raising cost. Agency is clear: she chooses to rethread looms despite danger, not for survival but defiance. Escalation is driven by her actions (kneeling, untying, weaving), not coincidence. The tightening “window between sigh and smile” forces irreversible commitment, with palpable price in every taut thread.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—ethical storytelling—is signaled early and tightens when Sorin drafts puppets cutting threads, foreclosing old methods. Protagonist agency drives escalation: his promise to “reverse gravity of strings” forces trade-offs (lost applause, shared control). Cost is unmistakable in “hands felt suddenly like tools for theft” and later in relinquishing script authority. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, deepening from guilt to structural change.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—honoring undocumented keepers before erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the hawk shadow forces cadence interruption, altering tactics (resumed “altered yet legible”). Agency resides in attention-as-action: arranging signals despite their impermanence, with cost felt in municipal forgetfulness and vulnerable meanders. Escalation is driven by protagonist choice (longer fern signal) under Accumulative pressure, though the monarch’s arrival leans slightly coincidental; however, it complicates rather than resolves, preserving earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—is signaled early and deepens when personal failure (mislabeling the bell) merges with communal loss. Protagonist agency drives escalation: reconfiguring braids tightens control over light, sound, and memory. Each choice narrows options (e.g., precise auroral blade carving “shadow notes”) and exacts cost (year-long apology, exhaustion). Coincidence never resolves; aurora answers only after deliberate braid manipulation. Final trade-off: staying to cast again, not fleeing guilt.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—discovering why paths choose walkers—tightens decisively when the archive exhales dust and the map writhes, forcing Foresight to reinterpret decay as invitation. Protagonist agency drives escalation: dream translations feed the archive, which computes the path “that wants me back.” Cost is unmistakable—the obsolete authority of the wafer seal crumbles in hand, and the third directive’s missing verb embodies irreversible loss. Coincidence never resolves; the storm merely catalyzes earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—maintaining celestial listening amid regime shifts—is signaled early and tightens when the tile reveals the alcove. Agency drives escalation: copying schematics, aligning wires, pouring water, pressing the bead. Each act narrows options (lamp oil conserved, breath held) and deepens commitment. Cost is unmistakable: the vow demands ongoing labor with no reward beyond “dusky harmony,” and the final pledge trades future resources for invisible fidelity.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—teaching resentment to release—is signaled immediately and deepens when Rell confronts the factory-memory corridor. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: the narrator’s “scheme” arranges an encounter that forces Rell to gather his mother’s unexhaled breath, narrowing options from argument to acceptance. Cost is visible: Rell kneels to return “unspent years,” and his ribs vibrate with forgiveness instead of rage. Under the Accumulative lens, this single deepening reweights the entire stake through sensory intensification, not causal turns.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—preventing the dream from tearing the district’s last cords—is signaled early and deepens when the corridor wobbles and “mirrors taste their own fear of shatter.” The meaningful tightening occurs when Ilen grounds Noor by counting orchard seasons, foreclosing panic and refocusing on synchronized breath. Agency drives escalation: their choice to recreate, not chase, shapes every tactic. Cost is felt in the relinquishment of control—the work becomes teaching “holding,” not capture.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—restoring balance after broken promises—is signaled early and deepens through the shedding ritual. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to climb, tie the ribbon, speak borrowed words. Cost is unmistakable: enduring silence from his daughter, carrying guilt as physical weight (“quartz throbbed”). The tightening occurs when Mira’s mispronounced psalter proves more potent than correct scripture—reweighting wisdom itself under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether to inherit nonlinearly—is signaled early and tightens at the grove: “ask with your lineage, not your voice.” The protagonist’s agency drives escalation—he chooses the dullest fruit to avoid complicity, yet still gets rewritten. Cost is unmistakable: his bones are rummaged, his face grafted, his identity altered. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens, deepening through poetic intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—finding the library of unlearned lessons—is signaled early and deepens when rescue shifts from external (apprentice) to internal (gentler futures). Protagonist agency drives escalation: researching gaps leads to skipped encyclopedia entries, which map to thresholds via leaf veins. Cost is unmistakable—the apprentice’s suspension as a thin proverb, the linguist’s declined payment—and tightens options until speaking kindly about failure becomes the only path. Coincidence complicates (time traveler’s vanishing) but never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—to find the garden of forgotten names—is signaled early and tightens when the price is revealed: remembering costs the chimera twin. The deepening occurs when the protagonist must choose between being a discoverer or a person, a binary that collapses under the weight of their fused identity. Agency drives escalation: speaking history, pouring soil, breathing into silence—all narrow options toward the final poise. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens with one decisive cadence shift at the bow.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring coherence to historical rupture—is signaled early and deepens through the archivist’s braiding attempts. Agency drives escalation: crossing/un-crossing strands visibly alters the doorway, proving his method isn’t whimsy. Cost is conceptual yet undeniable: the vanished delegation’s unrealized future, now partially reclaimed through bureaucratic rigor. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves—the treaty returns only when record and rumor merge via his hands.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving the integrity of silence-based mapping against invasive resonance—is signaled early and escalates coherently under Accumulative pressure. The protagonist’s agency drives deepening: examining ice cracks → conjuring stillness → planting the bloom. Each act narrows options (e.g., choosing thick ice corridors) and incurs cost (physical toll, emotional exposure). The energy beings aren’t antagonists but forces of abundance that test the mapkeeper’s endurance, making the final accommodation feel earned, not coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—proving coincidence has choreographic weight—tightens when Lio’s map reveals a missing constellation, forcing the custodian to trust external validation over solitary retrocognition. Agency drives escalation: choosing to trim the shard “with heated wire” despite its “mute cries” incurs emotional cost (shared trauma with Lio), narrowing options from solo custodianship to collaborative stewardship. Coincidence complicates (dream-call, matching star paths) but resolution hinges on deliberate acts: alignment, pouring phosphor, teaching others. Cost is legible in Lio’s tears and the collective “stitched shreds” of hope.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—claiming space within collective memory—is signaled early and escalates through the narrator’s agency: first doubting their right to bleed ink, then risking personal narrative. The deepening occurs when they speak of the sun-warmed plum, narrowing options from passive archivist to co-author. Cost is unmistakable: “For once the measure belonged to me” implies prior erasure. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each donated memory tightens the screw until their own must be offered.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—defying “gravity of hopelessness” through “serious playfulness”—tightens when the mosaic note dictates sequence, forcing trade-offs (e.g., filtering fear “as carefully as I filtered fuel”). Protagonist agency drives escalation: chanting maps echoes, ambient awareness locates wind pools, Lark’s ignition commits them to irreversible display. Cost is unmistakable: the “no-stars hush,” the “disappeared uncle,” the “stubborn pulse” of the knot. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from their choices under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes tighten decisively: archives demand inland relocation, but the real conflict is whether love can survive logistical rupture. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation—her “sidelong seeing” isn’t passivity but a tactic that forecloses resentment (“our laugh fester”) in favor of “shared migration.” Cost is unmistakable: trading tidal rhythms for train schedules, risking drift. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, deepening through imagined futures.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reconciling safety with openness—is signaled early and deepens when the protagonist risks sharing the gilded hush. Agency is clear: she limits exposure to preserve the quiet, chooses to descend, and initiates the tasting. The escalation is driven by her accumulating courage, not coincidence, and the cost is palpable in her fear of doorlessness and her father’s surrender of concrete certainty. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens, with each silence sampled tightening the emotional aperture toward reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—can silence be made comforting?—is signaled early and tightens when the mathematician reveals her unsolvable grief-equation. The operator’s agency (slowing the gondola, opening windows) directly responds, foreclosing rushed transit in favor of attuned stillness. Cost is felt: the ghost of the singer’s leap haunts every adjustment. Escalation is driven by protagonist choices under Accumulative pressure, not coincidence, with the final breath-threaded rustle marking irreversible reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—prevent throne’s century-long silence—is urgent and tactile (“until sunrise”). Protagonist agency drives escalation: using ruby flake, peeling paint, interpreting murals. Cost is felt throughout: time pressure, physical labor (palette knife), emotional risk (Quin’s doubt). Final deepening—governance as duet, not throne—narrows options meaningfully: crown hunger rejected for seasonal stewardship. Sunrise deadline tightens tactics without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—teaching suffocation to breathe—is signaled early and tightens when the girl appears, forcing the keeper to translate ache into air despite their own severed ties. Escalation is driven by agency: choosing to burn bridges carefully, then choosing to stay and teach, each act narrowing options (no return to pure solitude). Cost is unmistakable: the keeper’s scars wake, bones remember fire, and they forfeit escorting the student—a visible price that charges the Charged Poise ending. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—translating pressure into value—is signaled early and deepens when the chamber threatens collapse. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: choosing which ghost-thread to follow, rotating the drum, screwing in the bolt. Cost is palpable: letting the vow cut them first, risking predatory idea leaks. The tightening forecloses passivity—no longer a scam victim but a steward of fragile promises—and the final purr of creation carries earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—uncovering truth to justify ending the dynasty—is signaled early and deepens when the confession reveals it was intentional sacrifice. Protagonist agency drives escalation: inserting the crank, interpreting ledgers, accepting the ash-message. Cost is unmistakable: relinquishing ancestral identity (“I left my seal”) to enable communal renewal. Pressure tightens cleanly under Accumulative lens, culminating in a Charged Poise where rebuilding is foreclosed in favor of bread ovens.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—capturing the shape of possibility—is signaled early and tightens when the orchard demands choice: “choose one shape and release the others, or drown in statistics of miracles.” Pressure escalates through protagonist agency: he follows script cues, climbs the ladder, selects the kernel. Cost is unmistakable: renouncing thunderous oaths for whispered allegiance, trading battle reflexes for tending mornings. The orchard’s factually mystical rules remain consistent—equations in bark, gilded clipboards—and shape every move without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—making unknown histories legible through small kindnesses—is signaled early and deepens via the button’s discovery. Protagonist agency drives escalation: interpreting dust, researching Micah’s acts, writing the addendum, and creating the envelope. Cost is unmistakable: the archivist’s broken heart persists, but they choose hope through documentation, foreclosing passive resignation. The single tightening (from observing dust to actively rewriting closure) reweights institutional indifference with human continuity under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—resisting historical erasure—is signaled by the caption’s lie and tightens when Mara retrieves the key, foreclosing passive compliance. Agency manifests as renunciation (rejecting indifference) and attention (reading puddle maps), culminating in the lagoon’s ripple-response that alters reality. Cost is felt in her isolation (“never seeing the backpack weighted with wire”) and the guard’s dismissal, which crystallizes her stance. Escalation is driven by her choices alone; coincidence never resolves tension.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preventing completion of the prophecy—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens as frosty syllables name a beloved city, raising personal cost. Agency is clear: every sax note, whisper, and register shift actively blurs the code; escalation occurs when second-line frost demands lower tones, narrowing tactical options. The “vested hush” oath imposes social cost (city expects the garment to fit), and failure means consumption “like salt in a rainstorm.” Though external antagonists (“things with more hunger”) remain abstract, pressure coheres through environmental urgency and the ticking clock of dewdrop formation.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—decoding the past to shape tomorrows—is signaled early and deepens when the leaf’s message demands new monuments for neglected futures. Agency drives escalation: the sorter’s refusal to rush (“haste only scatters”) enables the dust speck’s warmth to reveal truth. Cost is legible in her moss-stained knees and the societal shift implied by pantry blackberries—concrete consequences of her attention.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reconciling precision with life’s irregularity—is signaled early and tightens when the compass defies magnetism, forcing improvisation. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: he studies spray rhythms, steps at the compass’s cue, and chooses to build a water-clock rather than rebuild the past. Cost is felt in the “cinders still faintly warm”—a life abandoned—and the irreversible shift from fixing broken clocks to listening to cascades. Coincidence (finding the compass) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from earned adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding the weight of names—is signaled early and deepens through escalating trials: each weighing proves sorrow has mass, forcing the protagonist to confront his own limits. Agency drives escalation: he chooses kintsugi repair, etches names, feeds “her name” to the furnace. Cost is unmistakable—the shaved button, his hair, the admission of error—and culminates in a tether “bright enough to guide any stubborn ghost,” foreclosing easy closure.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—integrating laughter into healing—is signaled early and deepens when the woman confesses fear that “laughter would betray her again.” Protagonist agency drives escalation: he plucks a dissonant string to produce a “crooked chuckle,” testing trust. Cost is unmistakable: his cracked laugh admits shared brokenness, and he relinquishes the tooth’s symbolic weight by letting it rest “warm and ordinary.” The tightening—moving from collecting echoes to enabling self-liberation—narrows his role from gardener to midwife, foreclosing possession.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—discovering when to stop the turn of the screw—is signaled early and deepens through proprioceptive calibration. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each step into the forest tests intention against harm, narrowing options until the boundary knot forecloses recurrence. Cost is unmistakable: the unspoken scream, the lie that saved a name, now transmuted into a theorem offered as proof. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens, intensifying via sensory density rather than external antagonism.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—recovering erased histories—is signaled early and escalates when the painting “releases a breath that borrowed my lungs,” forcing deeper immersion. Protagonist agency drives every turn: choosing the unsellable canvas, holding the lens, speaking coordinates. Cost crystallizes when she refuses the vendor’s steam (“did not want a third”), sacrificing sustenance for fidelity. The tightening—from observation to embodiment to naming—narrows options until only one act remains.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—balancing stolen time—is signaled early and deepens when the mainspring reveals payroll etched in hours. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he chooses to climb, listen, pry, and finally wind backward. Cost is visible: the fluorescent fails, dust resettles “in a new arrangement that matched nobody’s hands,” and he carries the barrel as receipt. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each whisper, crack, and dust ripple tightens the moral coil.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—balancing negotiable reality against lethal perfection—is signaled early and tightens when the frost spells a clause demanding eternal compression. Protagonist agency drives escalation: unscrewing the seed, aligning forms by frost, pulling the lever. The cost is unmistakable: tasting perfection means risking universal sinkage; rejecting it means enduring loneliness but preserving survivable asymmetry. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, culminating in a trade-off that reconfigures the world’s softness.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming a suppressed history—is signaled early and deepens through the archaeological dispute. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: devising the mirror-covering ritual, staging public readings, demanding a storm in council. Each move narrows options (Ledger’s petition, loss of access) and raises cost (ideological contamination charges). The climax forces a trade-off: personal vindication vs. communal truth, resolved through performance that risks ridicule but succeeds in reconfiguring the archive.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes—reclaiming stolen light through truth and attentive care—are signaled early and deepen via the protagonist’s escalating vulnerability. His agency drives every turn: confronting the watchman, confessing theft, offering his shadow, and redefining light as borrowed rather than owned. The cost is unmistakable: loss of his shadow, a permanent alteration in his being, visualized when he feels “lighter by a shade.” Under an Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies not through plot twists but through thickening moral and sensory texture, culminating in a binding covenant that reshapes civic responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding where “explanations fail”—tightens when psychometry reveals the father’s death, transforming abstract quest into personal reckoning. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to delve, read the compass, release jars. Cost is unmistakable: confronting grief that “scrapes rust off memory.” The factory’s hum-to-hush shift externalizes internal pressure without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reimagining passage when markers vanish—is signaled early and deepens when the slide overlays the arch with timewoven alliances, forcing a trade-off: build alone or co-create across time. Protagonist agency drives escalation; the storm doesn’t resolve conflict but sharpens it into a cadence shift (“anger unspooling to gears settling”). Cost is legible: the vow to “keep building bridges out of broken weather” forecloses reliance on external navigation forever.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding nocturnal blooming as courtship, not rebellion—is signaled early and deepens through embodied research (drafts, scent, silence). Agency manifests in sustained labor across seasons, culminating in the pavilion installation where the artist’s patience becomes visible to townsfolk. Cost is felt: months of solitude, predawn labor, and the emotional weight of ancestral legacy. Escalation is textural but coherent, narrowing focus from question to revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—recovering erased civic truth—is signaled by the diary’s refusal of ink until the shore is faced. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: arranging debris begets diary unlocking, which begets parley, which begets stenograph punches. Cost is unmistakable—the scalding reverie, the clerk’s shame, the officials’ confrontation with their own complicity. The tightening from solitary archivist to collective witness forecloses retreat into passive preservation, crystallizing stance under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reviving community without wishes—is signaled early and tightens when Iria declares “the time of wishes had ended,” forcing accountability over magic. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: her method (working memory) structures planning sessions, and the sailor’s arrival tests her rejection of false comfort. Cost is unmistakable: labor replaces ease, broomstrokes pay debts, and trust must be rebuilt hand-to-hand. Coincidence (bell arriving) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the real work begins only after collective choice to sweep the square.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—archiving emotional patterns without causing harm—is signaled early and tightens when prophecy reveals recording creates the very wound it documents. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: humming the harbor note stirs residue, which braids voices into self-prophecy. Cost is visceral (“child will grow with a pin in her breath”) and crystallizes in the trade-off: archive truth and perpetuate pain, or unrecord and risk civic amnesia. The moral calculus sharpens the peak choice without false symmetry.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—transmitting vortex inheritance without corrupting its wild serenity—is signaled early and deepens when Return murmurs entropy must decrease “by pattern remembered.” Protagonist agency drives escalation: naming, singing terraces, planting the cap. Cost is unmistakable—the keeper forfeits ownership for ephemeral contact (“pass through”), and the grandmother’s nod confirms this sacrifice. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each hum, breath, and gesture tightens the spiral until winter recedes.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether to trust instruments or embodied listening—is signaled early and tightens at Zero Hour. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to wait, test the rope, and ring the bell alters outcomes (“corridor faltered… sidled away”). Cost is unmistakable: risking professional censure for restraint. The deepening occurs when Reni lowers her hands—a shared stance crystallization that reweights institutional vs. ecological time.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding strength in vulnerability through attentive maintenance—is signaled early and tightens during the meteorite burst when power fails, forcing reliance on the lantern and breath-drawn arcs. Protagonist agency drives escalation: his tracing method diagnoses machine “aches,” culminating in naming engineers to relax circuits. Cost is unmistakable: emotional transparency that lets night “pass through” him, foreclosing self-protection.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—bearing witness to unspoken loss—is signaled early and deepens when the queen ghost demands the archive hold heat. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: he chooses full openness, accepting complicity (“the clause he refused to question”). Cost is unmistakable: stings on wrists, the burden of ledgered loss now internalized. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each ghost’s hush accumulates until the queen’s arrival crystallizes moral reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming meaning in a post-numerical world—is signaled early and deepens through the protagonist’s shift from solitary timekeeper to community archivist. Escalation occurs via agency: posting coded garage-sale items draws Lio, whose arrival enables the capsule’s opening. The cost is conceptual yet legible: surrendering the hope of restored numbers for a fragile, sensory-based calendar. Pressure tightens not through external antagonism but through the persistent constraint of time’s new rules (“calendars barked at dusk”), which shape every tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—tending discordant beauty—is signaled early and tightens when the kite snaps, forcing the poet to act. Agency drives escalation: his choice to write “woven dawns” in sand (not retrieve kite) redefines loss as creative rupture. Cost is felt—the boy’s “loud asymmetry” becomes shared burden, resolved not by fixing but “giving [tears] neighbors that hear its key.” Coincidence (snapped string) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from the poet’s stance crystallization under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—completing the remodel before death—tightens via protagonist agency: grafting almond-pollen branches, teaching children grafting songs, forming the council. Cost escalates visibly: lost branch yields mushroom terrace, afternoon fatigue confirms mortality. The “brazen calm” plan deepens into communal ritual (shell offerings, otter ramps), narrowing options from solitary labor to shared stewardship. Coincidence (kelp raft) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the pillars’ approval stems from prior respectful acts.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding homecoming’s chemistry—is signaled early and tightens when the facilitator demands talismans, forcing the protagonist to surrender their amber. Agency lies in quiet dissent (“declined to correct them”) and the final act of placing amber on glass, which triggers convergence. Cost is visible: the institute’s desire for graphable results is implicitly rejected, foreclosing academic validation. Escalation occurs via accumulating sensory inputs (skin oils, iron flakes) that catalyze reaction—consistent with Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—restoring balance between drowned reef and living shore—is signaled early and deepens through the coachman’s agency: he doesn’t wait for nature but actively translates dead languages, reads bird maps, and salts blood-soaked mud with seeds. The meaningful tightening occurs when he pulls bayonets “like rotten roots” and builds a lattice that “looks like surrender and stays like shelter,” narrowing options from passive mourning to active cultivation. Cost is felt in every pod cracked and every syllable hummed—a lifetime of listening replacing a past of driving soldiers. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each action reinforcing the central pact.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—translating emotional distance into tangible connection—is signaled early and deepens when the leaf becomes a signal rather than a relic. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: trading for the phonograph, decoding grooves, walking into the wasteland. Cost is unmistakable: time lost, promises deferred, the physical toll of hope in a drought-hardened world. The tightening occurs at the relay—success doesn’t close distance but redefines its terms, forcing a new kind of patience.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving truth against institutional forgetting—is signaled early and deepens via the protagonist’s agency: choosing to sketch despite exile, adjusting circles amid stellar drift. Escalation occurs when stars misalign, forcing recalibration not of tools but of meaning (“true north was migrating... I could not fix the world to a single point”). Cost is unmistakable: social ostracization, emotional isolation, and the burden of being “right” in a world that prefers convenient lies.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—mending the world’s dissonance through ethical theft—is signaled early and tightens with each swap: morning’s punctuality, hoarded warmth, forbidden rain. Agency drives escalation; the thief’s method alters reality, not luck. Cost is unmistakable: the queen contains a pre-birth letter demanding wageless service, and the final swap forecloses personal gain. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens, culminating in a Charged Poise where play becomes prayer.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving unrecordable kindness amid erasure—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency: each spelled word tightens the grammar of resistance. The escalation from “water” to “stay” to “thanks” narrows options (no pawns remain; kings are deferred) and forces trade-offs (apologies cut away, pride kept shaky but intact). Cost is unmistakable: the nurse’s hitched stride, the janitor’s faucet names, the widow’s lacquered comet—all embody losses that alter tactics. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering the “shape of home” through lost language—is signaled early and deepens when the seer demands confronting where “your mouth was silenced.” The tightening occurs at the stone-touch: buried accent-shame surfaces, foreclosing denial. Protagonist agency drives escalation—they choose to seed tongue/steps/mountain—and cost is felt in the gritty feather taste and relocated “shame-encyclopedias.” Coincidence never resolves; the mountain’s approval is earned through truth-speaking.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—forgiveness through responsible repair—is signaled early and tightens when he rejects the “satisfying” full release. Protagonist agency drives escalation: each thread-pull is a tactical choice under the lens of accumulated regret, with immediate feedback (dust falls, water whispers). Cost is unmistakable: wrong brushes “taste ashes,” and his final stance crystallizes around rejecting his old doctrine of ruthless efficiency. Pressure coheres without coincidence or off-stage resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—redefining the price of forgiveness—is signaled early and tightens when the canyon demands individual hues. The artist’s agency drives escalation: he initiates poetry sessions, offers his mentor’s gold, and volunteers double payment. Cost is unmistakable: each surrendered color is a memory fragment, and the final breeze signifies irreversible change. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—conjuring meaning from oblivion—is signaled early and tightens through protagonist agency: each plunge edits fear into clarity, each measurement narrows options until the final choice to install Mira’s undrawn charm. Pressure escalates texturally: from trembling hands to engine humming to statue glowing, culminating in naming “the hour when she fell and did not land.” Cost is unmistakable—“lead in my chest,” unfinished inventions, miscounted bolts—and reweights the final image: gold seams are “tiny rivers” of acceptance, not restoration. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from alchemist’s ritualized labor under coherent environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—keeping a hidden promise to oneself—is signaled early and deepens when the mirror cracks, forcing confrontation with years of avoidance. The wrong turn escalates pressure not by coincidence but by memory-as-compass, leading to a chamber where time splits him again. His agency drives every escalation: choosing brine over safety, kneeling, drawing, withdrawing. Cost is unmistakable: he gains vision but forfeits dwelling; the corridor closes because he obeys the voice, not because he lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—proving whispers outdistance shouts—is signaled immediately and tightens through the captain’s near-disaster and unanswered letter. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing scent over paper, humming over shouting. Cost is unmistakable: emotional exposure, physical fatigue (“steady my ribs”), and the gamble of unreciprocated gesture. The freighter’s course correction validates the method but doesn’t erase the vulnerability—it crystallizes the keeper’s stance under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—navigating loss—is signaled early and tightens when the beacon points inland, forcing confrontation with Mara’s absence. The meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator realizes reverse migration isn’t recovery but route-making, narrowing options from seeking Mara to walking with her memory. Protagonist agency drives escalation: hands learn choreography, then choose to set out across flats. Cost is unmistakable—the station’s dimming pulse, the ferry’s irreversible failure—and shapes the final stance of perpetual motion.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—cultivating psychological safety without secrets—is signaled early and tightens when the patrol arrives, forcing the narrator to weaponize truth (“invited them to watch”). The meaningful deepening occurs in the group session where confession is offloaded to the keeper, altering relational dynamics without fixing pain. Cost is unmistakable: the father’s abandonment, the orchard’s injuries, the constant threat of confiscation. Agency drives escalation—smuggling, teaching, speaking—and the storm’s chaos complicates but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—decoding a final gesture—is signaled early and tightens when the Edelweiss aligns with the notch, foreclosing mere curiosity in favor of ritual responsibility. The keeper’s agency drives escalation: observing gaps leads to discovery, which demands response. Cost is unmistakable—“witnessed isolation has a weight… that does not burn but never quite warms”—and crystallizes in his decision to send light not for himself but for the dead. Coincidence complicates (the stranger’s arrival) but resolution stems from character-driven action.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—honoring Ruth’s empirically intuitive promise by finding the doorway—is signaled early and deepens as midsummer nears. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: following ants, entering the cavern, testing the seam. The creek’s rise creates a live clock that tightens tactics (“you must move”), and the cost of inaction (stagnation in the shop) versus action (facing multiplicity of selves) is viscerally rendered. Coincidence (rebuilt footbridge) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the choice remains earned.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—unraveling the dream’s mystery to avoid sovereign unmaking—is signaled early and tightens at each ledge. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she chooses to drink, to name her childhood moniker, to touch the stone self. Each act narrows options: naming opens the grotto, touching wakes her double, waking demands choosing who rules and who she cannot forgive. Cost is unmistakable: the throne endures, but she forfeits return and reconciliation—a trade-off crystallized before dawn forgets what night remembers.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—capturing “the density of presence”—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency: inventorying variables, bracing the curl, striking the chord. Escalation occurs via Accumulative pressure, not coincidence; each return to the moment “loosens a knot… into structure.” Cost is unmistakable: the promise to spend clarity “not on trophies but on thresholds” forecloses performative love. The “palette of resolve” crystallizes under fire, and the final calibration exacts emotional precision as price.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—distilling chaos into narrative—is signaled early and tightens when the scroll’s erratic dates demand ordering. Protagonist agency drives escalation: jealousy sharpens the scroll, tracing dates summons letters, choosing to soar crystallizes stance. Cost is unmistakable: witnessing one’s own funeral without intervention, trading envy for a syllable of continuity. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each layer (past/present/future selves) deepens the central conflict without coincidence resolving it.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—calibrating time to human need—is signaled early and deepens when the father reveals his partner is laboring. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she chooses to teach him breath-rhythms, not just fix the clock. Cost is unmistakable: the birthing clamp screw carries generational trauma and hope. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each drip, pause, and tremor tightens the emotional vise until the final message confirms transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—transforming trauma into legible language—is signaled early and tightens through breath-hold escalation: each rune risks crystallization (failure) as storms close in. Protagonist agency drives deepening: choosing which scar to transcribe, pouring for her younger self, enduring burn for truth. Cost is unmistakable: physical pain (chest burning), emotional exposure (confessing kiln lie), and opportunity cost (only one breath). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of memory increases as breath depletes, culminating in irreversible ingestion of rewritten self.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—delivering apology before the orchard falls—is signaled early and deepens when the narrator realizes verbal metaphors fail, forcing technological ritual. Agency drives escalation: cleaning the atomizer, rewiring the metronome, dialing the foreman. Each act narrows options (burning bridges with the gossip column, risking exposure). Cost is unmistakable: the orchard may still fall, but the narrator forfeits anonymity and innocence to honor Mara. Coincidence (truck beeping) complicates but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—unifying fractured time—is signaled early and deepens when the protagonist realizes their task is not judgment but listening. Agency drives escalation: walking the spiral, circling definitions, placing the scroll beneath the dictionary—all narrow options toward Charged Poise. Cost is unmistakable: the “dizziness of broken sequence” fades only after surrendering the title “end of history witness.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with each beat intensifying the demand for receptivity over control.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding what clocks truly measure—is signaled early and deepens when Basin Three lags. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: using the key, counting drops backward, matching pulse to stylus. Cost is unmistakable: physical injury, defiance of protocol (“heresy”), and the emotional weight of ancestral legacy. The tightening forecloses blind trust in instruments, crystallizing a new stance: shepherding edges, not minutes.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.2)
    The dominant stake—redefining security through permeability—is signaled early and deepens through Mara’s interactions (cat, cable sag, ruptured seal). Each anomaly becomes a test of her philosophy, narrowing her old options (“clenching”) and affirming new tactics (“hosting”). Agency is clear: she chooses slowness, observation, repair. The cost is felt in her unhooked tension and the ghost of Kian—not as loss, but as integration. Escalation is subtle yet decisive, driven by her choices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—widening perspectives responsibly—is signaled early and tightened when she chooses stewardship over theatrical risk, foreclosing her father’s ruinous pattern. Escalation is driven by her agency: interpreting scrawls leads to Martingale, where the lantern’s note (“Check your priors”) forces a trade-off between inherited trauma and pedagogical duty. Cost is unmistakable: years of “watching him lose little to stay afloat” crystallize into a vow to protect “the next life in my reach.” Coincidence (subway carvings) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the nurse’s inaction enables the puzzle without solving it.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—mediating human connection without intrusion—is signaled early and tightens during the elevator crisis, where Mara’s agency (looping lines, routing crew) narrows options under pressure. Cost is unmistakable: Rojo and Flora each end something begun unknowingly, while Mara absorbs their grief without reciprocation. Escalation is driven by protagonist choice (not coincidence); the disc’s autonomous hum raises stakes without resolving them. One meaningful deepening suffices—and here it’s decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether memory can restore broken vows—is signaled early and deepens through the archivist’s method: “remembering happens through proximate causes.” The woman’s recounting of small anchors (thermos, scar) tightens pressure by narrowing focus to what’s recoverable. The storm’s rupture isn’t resolved by coincidence but by the protagonist’s agency in reconstructing “their weather.” Cost is felt in what’s absent: no new vow inked, only the map of how they reached one.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—alleviating loneliness through logistics—tightens when the rumored train fails to arrive, forcing improvisation: the trolley becomes the real carriage. Agency drives escalation: the logistician redirects hotel leftovers, assigns roles, places postcards—all narrowing options toward tangible reciprocity. Cost is felt in the mislaid name and sideways rain, and the midnight deadline (“midnight would come anyway”) pressures action without resolving via coincidence. The deepening—from rumor to handwritten postcards—reweights the stake from magical hope to human effort.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—navigating uncharted emotional depths—is signaled early and deepens when the trail of notes sharpens into harmonic north. Protagonist agency drives escalation: dowsing, counting rests, tracing lines. The tightening choice—accepting grief’s native coast rather than erasing it—forecloses mercantile cartography with felt cost (“lines in my body refused the trade”). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the core conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—trading guilt for knowledge—is signaled early and deepens when the broadcast echoes the protagonist’s personal failure. The tightening occurs when they choose to write, not just receive, accepting that meaning requires participation. Agency is subtle but decisive: the act of “editing” history via terraced lines alters reality (seed shipment). Cost is felt in the chest-tight shame and the physical resistance of the scrap; stakes remain viscerally tied to soil, hunger, and apology.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—translating silence into music—is signaled immediately and deepens when Arin must “disrupt the obedient quiet” to begin. Agency drives escalation: signing, sketching, ringing the bell are all deliberate acts that narrow options (e.g., choosing ephemeral tide-marks over permanent notes). Cost is felt in the camera’s futility and the advisor’s whispered caution (“Do not force melody”). The tightening—moving from observation to intervention—reweights silence from subject to collaborator.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—protecting hidden readers through unlisted sanctuary—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: torching the library, decoding Miren’s trail, planting seeds. The meaningful deepening occurs when the promise expands from town to buried city, raising conceptual stakes. Cost is unmistakable: the narrator remains “off the grid,” bearing solitude and the weight of unreadable debts. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each artistic clue narrowing options until the final act crystallizes stance—rebuilding as breath, not pages—with irreversible forfeiture of conventional legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming Mira through shared dream against clinical erasure—is signaled early and deepens when donor memories erupt, transforming grief from personal to collective. Protagonist agency drives escalation: drumming isn’t passive hope but tactical sound-weaving that forces the lagoon to respond. The cost is unmistakable: accepting permanent psychic incorporation of strangers (“I would carry what did not belong”). Final bridge-walking crystallizes stance with relational and ontological price—no soft reset, only earned poise.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—proving whispers > shouts—is signaled early and deepens when Ivo wagers his method against Rade’s chaos. Escalation is driven by Ivo’s agency: he folds maps, taps rhythms, uses the coin not as magic but as focus. Cost is felt in the courier’s shivering relief and Rade’s violet-faced exertion—noise fails, quiet wins. Coincidence (storm) complicates but doesn’t resolve; victory comes from Ivo’s tuning of the maze’s physics.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—learning to “teach darkness the value of stars”—is signaled early and deepens through the guardian’s silent demonstrations. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: accepting the mirror, angling light toward “drowned arches,” stepping beside the guardian to knot rope. Each choice narrows options (rejecting vanishing, embracing witness) with felt cost (confronting brother’s suicide, shame’s retreat). The barge pilot’s unclenched pain shows stakes extend beyond self, yet pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—slowing impulsive action to allow second thoughts—is signaled early and deepens when the synchronized window displays force public engagement with unresolved questions. The grotto endgame (“played to stalemate deliberately”) escalates pressure by turning internal philosophy into communal practice. Cost is visible: the coach’s hidden trembling, the forfeited win, the town’s disrupted routines. Though stakes remain conceptual, they’re viscerally felt in bodily reactions (shoes “thinking,” mortar waiting “patient as a story”).

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—naming oneself truly to anchor the island—is signaled by line two and tightens decisively when the scrimshaw is found. Protagonist agency drives escalation: they choose to hold the bone, speak their name, detach lines, and cross. The whale’s call doesn’t resolve—it demands, deepening pressure. Cost is visible: relinquishing the safety of nicknames (“spoken into salt buckets”) to claim a vulnerable truth. Under the Accumulative lens, each beat layers density until the final act reweights all prior silence as omission.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving unmeasurable grief under a happiness mandate—tightens through protagonist agency: staging silent lessons, weaponizing narration, offering “gratitude” as perishable cover. Each escalation forecloses options (e.g., turning off mics risks detection) with tangible cost (emotional exhaustion, surveillance). The inspector’s visit crystallizes stakes: survival demands performing laundry as epic, yet the child’s presence raises the price to intergenerational inheritance of resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming metaphor, gathering, and song after state-enforced silence—is signaled early and escalates through embodied acts: synchronized breath, stepping over inlaid lines, paraphrasing decrees. The tightening occurs when the guard leans in, tears at his lashes, marking a shift from enforcement to witness. Cost is felt in lingering fear (“cautionary hand on the shoulder of every breath”) and the slow peeling of taped windows. Agency resides in communal micro-actions, not spectacle.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding beauty in imperfection—is signaled early and deepens through Ivo’s trade for the reed tongue, which risks his identity as a painter. The meaningful tightening occurs when he chooses not to blow but to whisper, accepting that truth may not restore color but reveal rhythm. Cost is unmistakable: he abandons chromatic longing for a new sensory grammar, altering his art and life. Agency drives escalation—his plant messages, trades, and final request to stay are all active choices under coherent pressure from the market’s rules and his own desire.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—designing an honest artificial pilgrimage—is signaled early and deepens when the volunteer’s grief forces real-time adaptation, narrowing options from curated experience to mutual vulnerability. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: choosing texture over nostalgia, pausing at flinches, accepting that sound may “suggest repair” but not dictate it. Cost is unmistakable: the brother’s drowning reframes the ferry bell’s song, transforming private ritual into shared reckoning. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each station intensifying emotional risk.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—teaching “withering to bloom again”—tightens through protagonist agency: leaving origami coordinates, shaping wire around projected petals. Each escalation (e.g., the daughter’s aurora outline) narrows options toward Earned Stasis: the narrator accepts endless waiting as purpose. Cost is unmistakable—the woman’s unspoken future, the narrator’s clouded metal—and the “genuinely artificial dawn” enables ritual without resolving grief. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: density of mourning objects (coal beads, cradle pins) deepens thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—mapping walkable paths through belief-floods—tightens meaningfully when the cartomancer renounces fortune-telling for path-multiplication, foreclosing easy answers with visible cost (accepting broken screens as payment). Protagonist agency drives escalation: apprentice’s ledger entries and crack-tracings directly enable the corner discovery. Coincidence complicates (soggy historians) but never resolves; the peeled paint reveal stems from elbow-choosing mechanics established earlier. Final trade-off crystallizes: singing alone requires finding the chorus, paid for in wristband-buttons and shared laughter.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—accessing forbidden knowledge without conquest—is signaled early and tightens through three landings, each raising conceptual stakes: identity dissolution, motive purification, then stewardship of memory. Protagonist agency drives escalation (refusal to bargain, irregular blinking), narrowing options until only “alteration” remains. Cost is unmistakable: the archivist forfeits publication for “alignment,” and the city gains “unafraid silence” at the price of conventional validation.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving hope’s shape—tightens when Mira trades her unlived dreams to loosen the library’s grip, foreclosing her own potential futures. Protagonist agency drives escalation: comparing reels reveals the shadow’s fraying, prompting her stone-offering and dream-pouring. Cost is visceral: “empty casing where her dreams had been, shaped like rooms she might have built.” The library’s jealousy raises pressure coherently under Accumulative lens—each action deepens entanglement until resolution demands sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reconstructing trust after betrayal—is signaled early and tightens via one decisive deepening: shedding ornamental lies to reveal “honest shape.” Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing precision over rage, writing donor letter, removing fake blossoms. Cost is unmistakable: hollow accounts, shuttered donors, personal shame. The broker’s con complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems solely from narrator’s renunciation of vanity.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reconciling the burden of the displaced miracle—is signaled early and deepens when the narrator reads Mira’s last gesture as reassurance, not fear. Agency is clear: descending into the tunnel, planting the ivy, shattering the hourglass. Each act forecloses reopening wounds and accepts stewardship of Mira’s steadiness. Cost is unmistakable: breathing tastes of apology, and closure demands tending a garden rather than wielding a blade.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—locating unused love—is signaled early and deepens when she discovers her own name on stored boxes. Agency drives escalation: winding film, pressing palm to gate, opening letters—all narrow options toward self-confrontation. The tightening occurs when the projector “pinches the film” to hold her until she listens fully, forcing endurance with cost: confronting her shelved life. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies through sensory and textual density, not causality, yet remains coherent and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is signaled early and escalates through the narrator’s methodical tracing of falling stars, culminating in the sculptor’s release. Agency is clear: the narrator chooses to listen, transcribe, and return despite fatigue. Cost is unmistakable: “the instrument is heavy” when faltering, and the unwritten calendar implies endless labor. The deepening occurs at the seventh circuit, where a door opens only because of prior alignment and endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving potential against erasure—is signaled early and deepens when the archive spills “tendencies” rather than images. The guard’s agency drives escalation: his humming, flipping the clock, and breathing into the bottle force the archive to cohere. Cost is unmistakable: the world is post-forest, alarms are mute, dreams absent; yet he pays further by offering his breath and pacing gravel to “recite names of lost stations.” The final trade—rust replaced by radiance—carries opportunity cost: restoration is slow, fragile, and demands constant tending.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—rediscovering the mind’s frontier—is signaled early and deepens via the hum’s shift from insight to ache. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he chooses to follow wind warnings, enter the aluminum grove, and ultimately repair the tree. Cost is felt—the pain of nightly translocation reframed as necessary tuition—and the repaired second imposes a new responsibility: time now ticks with consequence. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—finding unused courage—is signaled early and escalates through protagonist agency: choosing fear-resembling bends, accepting indirect routes, kneeling to listen. The meaningful tightening occurs when the narrator realizes passage floats on choices, not tide—a deepening that reweights all subsequent action. Cost is unmistakable: the vigil ends, the ferry fades, and the road begins with the burden of rowing by choice. No coincidence resolves; every turn stems from the narrator’s decisions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—renegotiating safety’s price—is signaled early and deepens through the narrator’s agency: interpreting radiator clicks, repairing the bench, choosing to remain. The tightening occurs when the choir’s return is decoded not as rescue but as invitation to co-create harmony within constraint. Cost is unmistakable: voice confiscated, pain endured, winter prolonged—but also transformed, as “hope could be cold and still be hope.” Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens; each beat adds texture that reweights silence from oppression to shared discipline.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—legitimacy vs. pretense—is signaled early and deepens through Serane’s reading sequence, each volume narrowing her options. Lyr’s agency is indirect but potent: he arranges mirrors, not blades. The cost is unmistakable: Serane loses her claim, retinue, and chosen name; Lyr bears the weight of unmasking. Escalation is driven by protagonist choices under an Accumulative lens, culminating in a renunciation that alters the kingdom’s future.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost paths—tightens when data fails and only rhythm reveals the corridor. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: tapping decodes old recordings, pressing “Assemble” reorganizes ribbons, and radioing the village enacts collective ritual. Cost is felt in the abandoned red lines and the labor of nightly reset; the reef’s “breathing” imposes biological constraints that narrow human options. Coincidence never resolves—only disciplined listening and lunar alignment yield the causeway.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—discovering what happened to the Lark—is signaled early and intensifies through tactile escalation: from listening to touching to transmitting. Mara’s agency drives every turn; the system responds only when she closes the circuit with her body. Cost is unmistakable: heat climbing her arms, the threat of reigniting silenced forces. The lull in rebellion isn’t passive—it’s the charged silence that enables her query, making stakes communal without diluting focus.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—evolving tradition versus passive preservation—is signaled early and deepens when the council refuses the kite’s method. Lida’s agency drives escalation: she acts alone after dialogue fails, bearing physical and social cost. The tightening forecloses communal consensus but opens intergenerational stewardship. Coincidence (fallen kite) complicates but doesn’t resolve; decoding requires her insurgent literacy.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—building rooms storms can enter without wrecking—is signaled early and tightens when the helicopter drone triggers freeze-response. Rafi’s agency drives escalation: he follows Leda’s voice back via somatic markers, then chooses to display logbooks, transforming passive survival into active curation. Cost is felt in the “pearl of stillness” (weightless but hard-won) and the photo’s persistent ghosts. Coincidence (niece’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve—Rafi must still choose openness.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming perceptual agency—tightens when Mara chooses to descend not as escape but “correction.” Her threading of cards into a lattice deepens the conflict: fate isn’t shuffled but rewoven. Cost is legible in the perished wick she replaces and the faces she now vows to keep. Pressure accumulates texturally until the flame’s ascent widens walls “like a chest during a remembered song,” crystallizing her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—ending the commodification of crisis-time—is signaled early and tightens when the ink reveals the algorithmic buyer in the metronome. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: he seeds ink, reads patterns, enters the hut, and chooses refusal over rule. Cost is unmistakable: he forfeits legacy, power, even outline, becoming a hollow the drone must learn anew. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of ephemeral data builds to the spine that should not form.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving truth versus protecting order—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the archivist feeds the letter into the duct. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens: each descriptive layer increases pressure until the midnight reset forces action. Cost is unmistakable: potential loss of career and identity (“melt the disciplined ice of my trade”). The council’s discovery of “maintenance logs full of pet names” proves stakes were real, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—whether to perpetuate cycles of blame or cultivate mercy—is signaled early and deepens when the trio arrives seeking “the map to grief.” The protagonist’s agency lies in renunciation: she refuses to name her father’s guilt, instead offering planting as alternative reckoning. Cost is unmistakable: her father remains exiled “until blame learns to breathe,” and she shoulders solitude. Escalation is driven by her choices (stringing scrap to rose, pouring honeyed tea), not coincidence, under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering the goddess’s echo to halt the coast’s devoured silence—is signaled early and tightens when she demands her name be returned from constellations. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: voicing silence, planting the spike, walking the zigzag. Cost is felt in his relinquishment of the map, though the price lacks explicit secondary loss (e.g., time, stamina). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, but the tightening could sharpen with a clearer tactical shift post-goddess encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. manufactured consensus—is signaled early and tightened decisively when the heiress wagers on shutting the lens. Her agency drives escalation: the test forces a binary outcome that materializes in real-time market and media collapse. Cost is unmistakable: the caretaker’s astonishment, the board’s resistance, and the irreversible exposure of the device’s power. The moral calculus—smoothing seas vs. drowning sailors—sharpens the climax without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—hushing guilt through translation—is signaled early and tightens when the recorder plays the cry, forcing confrontation. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: he reads letters, consults the recorder, uses amber, and finally tattoos himself. Cost is unmistakable: he accepts ongoing unforgiveness (“not yet”) and binds himself to the lab forever. Coincidence (letters addressed pre-birth) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from his choice to tether, not external luck.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—discovering meaning without smoothing the mess—is signaled early and tightens when the bearded man’s doubt threatens ossification. The protagonist’s interjection narrows options: comfort must emerge from collective listening, not imposed order. Cost is legible in erasure (“map of the mess… smudged”) and emotional exposure (tears, laughter, whispered grief). Agency resides in attention itself, which forecloses control but opens possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—how to reckon with post-fire grief without replicating violence—is signaled early and deepens when the boy requests a new name for his mother. The narrator’s agency drives escalation: they reject punitive naming (“old names became knives”) and invent a ritual that forces perpetrators into reparative roles (“Bearer,” “Tanner,” etc.). Cost is unmistakable: the men’s sullen compliance, the crowd’s “warm coat of frost” breath, and the narrator’s ongoing entanglement with trauma (“past loosen inside me”). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens—each renaming tightens the moral calculus without false resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—anchoring possibility against despair—is signaled early via the shivering Star coin and tightens when the ghost pleads, “anchor the Star before it spills away.” Protagonist agency drives escalation: they choose to speak marquee names, press the coin, and braid echoes into wind, each act narrowing options (e.g., committing to tomorrow’s return). Cost is felt in the ghost’s “jealous” gratitude and the narrator’s inherited burden (“mother’s hands counting tips”). Despair’s stakes are viscerally rendered—not abstract loss but the erasure of communal memory.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—illuminating hidden pathways of regret—is signaled early and tightened through the static shock, which forces recalibration via breath-counting. Agency resides in their co-devised somatic grammar; the escalation is textural but consequential, narrowing emotional options from raw pain to structured remembrance. Cost is legible: Mara endures her brother’s morphine-lost fragment without flinching, he retrieves his father’s map only through her breath. No coincidence resolves tension—it’s earned through disciplined attention.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—becoming a truthful voice for the unknown—is signaled early and deepened through escalating pressure: rising tide, emotional spikes, storm surge. Protagonist agency drives escalation (offering the leaf, speaking aloud, repositioning the fossil), each act narrowing options (from interpreter to conduit). Cost is unmistakable: the surrender of narrative control (“not captive, but partnered”) and physical risk during the surge. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens without reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—liberating fate from static record—tightens decisively when the protagonist chooses to “unscramble what the canyon said” rather than preserve it. Agency drives escalation: theft enables method, method enables matching, matching enables bridging. Cost is unmistakable: the oath shifts from “counting to keeping, from keeping to offering,” sacrificing institutional authority for communal vulnerability. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, each button pinned narrowing the path back to orthodoxy.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring fractured trust to re-enter covert life—is signaled early and tightens when Len appears without escort, raising emotional risk. Ansel’s agency drives escalation: he initiates the snow-code, opens the pillbox, chooses seawater over archive. Cost is unmistakable: retirement of evidence means burning his last leverage, trusting Len again after betrayal. The “prudently daring” ethos shapes every move—no fireworks, only inches and whispers.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—delivering the palimpsest promise by braiding fear into navigable form—is signaled early and deepens when Wren threads moonlight through the map. The meaningful tightening occurs mid-ferry: the current threatens to turn them, forcing the coachman to shift from hill-based sorrow-carrier to water-borne patience. Cost is felt—the shoulders soften “as though relieved of an old shrug”—and tactics change (oar set to rain-gutter metronome). Agency drives escalation; coincidence merely complicates (rider’s approach).

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding how places hold memory—is signaled early and deepens through the potter’s agency: each act of tending (water, cleaning, singing) tightens pressure by testing whether kindness can activate latent life. The escalation is Accumulative: thrumming intensifies, timelines braid tighter, and the child’s flag emerges—all driven by her choices, not coincidence. Cost is unmistakable: she expends her last water, breath, and time, then walks away empty-handed, trusting outcomes beyond her control.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—restoring light as an act of familial and communal repair—is signaled early and deepens through one decisive intensification: the petal drop as countdown, culminating in the lighthouse ascent. Pressure escalates via Accumulative/Textural density (neon sighs, sleeping gulls, blind padlock) that narrows emotional bandwidth until only ritual remains. The cost is visible in the protagonist’s shaking wrists, the decade of neglect in the lantern, and the unspoken loss of the mother—yet agency drives every turn: choosing to climb, to pick, to clean, to ignite. Coincidence never resolves; the child’s window-opening is response, not cause.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—translating isolation into independence—is signaled early and deepens when the stone circle falters, forcing the narrator to act. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: angling the sundial toward lightning, singing the herd song. Cost is unmistakable—the library tilts, shelves drop, thunder “struggles to recall a march.” The tightening forecloses passivity; one must tune independence like an instrument, not wait for it.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reconnecting severed love through public art—is signaled early and deepens when the ghostwriter risks exposure by placing unsent letters under the bowl. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: designing the spiral path, inviting sentences, watching arrivals. The tightening is meaningful (threads converge; letters surface), but the resolution leans slightly on coincidence (both lovers arrive separately yet synchronously). Still, the cost—emotional exposure, the fragility of paper leaves in rain—is felt throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—resisting orchestrated polarization—is signaled early (“election season, and power plays blurred into public service announcements”) and tightens when the cosmic trickster amplifies division. Protagonist agency drives escalation: diagnosing the wave, mapping campus grid onto charts, broadcasting countersigns. Cost is unmistakable: lost career opportunity (“breakfast without chair”), physical risk on the theater roof, and the burden of solitary resistance. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, culminating in a stance that forecloses obedience with tangible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the key to restore dialogue with the mutinous city—is signaled early and deepens when the protagonist chooses exposure over concealment (“I could have kept it hidden…”). Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: each organ chord, compass prick, and chalk mark is a tactical response to spatial resistance, narrowing options until only one lock remains. Cost is unmistakable: defying the Council risks exile, yet the choice feels necessary, not heroic. The spatial mutiny complicates but never resolves; victory comes through listening, not conquest.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—awakening dormant empathy through absent evidence—is signaled early and tightens when the blue ribbon contradicts the file, forcing reinterpretation. Protagonist agency drives escalation: lancing silt yields objects that revise Mara’s story, culminating in the painting-as-testimony. Cost is legible in the artist’s refusal to claim certainty and in the letter from the woman in blue, whose fear met gentleness but left only mist. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without false resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—honoring ancestral bravery against institutional erasure—tightens decisively when the coded stanzas reveal exile’s true design. Protagonist agency drives escalation: sliding the nail isn’t luck but culmination of journal-deciphering. Cost is unmistakable: director’s dry rage (“sacrifices” meaning others’ bodies), Liza’s river-cough, and the librarian’s irreversible breach of protocol. The deepening—exile as “reversible hallway home”—narrows options to one defiant act with social and systemic consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—forgiveness as tangible exchange—is signaled early (“cameras would blink, and a border would forget its own name”) and deepens when the glass shard proves it real. Protagonist agency drives escalation: his recounting sharpens focus, his playing resolves the negative, his choice to “sculpt possibility” trades artistic labor for human return. Cost is unmistakable: he risks luminous disbelief becoming permanent loss, and succeeds only by paying attention with “careful boots and a heart making drum corps noises.” Coincidence never resolves; wind alignment merely reveals what his music activates.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—discovering why paths circle back—is signaled early and tightens when subscriber decline forces confrontation with father’s bills. The meaningful deepening occurs at the release party (“promised less and gave maps that breathed”), which forecloses investor-driven growth. Cost is legible: markets “corrected us like careless apprentices,” leading to shutdown. Though pressure escalates coherently under Accumulative lens, the fall lacks a single decisive turn driven solely by protagonist agency—markets act externally, slightly diluting causality.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—decoding the temple to heal shared burdens—is signaled early and deepens when Mara arrives with her own copy of the glyphs. The tightening occurs when they realize inscriptions yield only through dialogue: “the lock was our conversation.” Protagonist agency drives escalation—choosing to read aloud, inviting Mara’s voice—and cost is visible in inherited grief, unslept eyes, and the father’s vanished search. Coincidence (telegram’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution emerges from joint attention.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—recovering the frozen confession—is signaled early and deepens when the seed isolates the lie from truth, forcing the mayor to confront his complicity. Pressure escalates via the druid’s expanding circles, each brush against the orchard raising tension until the hooks twitch. Cost is unmistakable: the druid risks emotional exposure (“warlike serenity” fraying), and the mayor loses his denial. Agency drives every turn—the seed’s use, the raft’s angle, the whispered treaty—all narrowing options toward truth.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming agency after the future’s premature arrival—is signaled early and tightens when the gardeners demand the clipping’s return. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to heed whispers, linking scars, offering a braided vow. Cost is unmistakable: the old covenant’s restoration is irrevocably lost, replaced by uncertain “maybe.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each deepening (scar-linking, maze-rooting) reweights the stake without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—trading a destiny that refuses the boy for one that thrums—is signaled early and deepens when the Weaver demands “a destiny that refuses you.” Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: offering their name, speaking the trammeling promise, scattering seeds. Cost is unmistakable—the irreversible loss of grandmother’s stories—and narrows options: the protagonist can’t reclaim what’s planted. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; coincidence never resolves, only complicates (e.g., market taking the boy’s name as tax).

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming purpose after public failure and private loss—tightens when the scrap triggers memory, forcing a choice between professional detachment and emotional truth. Agency drives escalation: he chooses to assign non-market value despite risk to credibility. Cost is felt in the radio humiliation flashback and crystallized in Bowers’ raised eyebrow—social vulnerability traded for integrity. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence or deflation.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reestablishing harmonic guidance before the orchard self-destructs—is signaled early and tightens when the narrator realizes voice must cup rail curvature like water in a reed. Escalation is driven by analogical thinking (protagonist agency), narrowing options until breath becomes the bridge principle. Cost is unmistakable: haunted ambitions quiet only after the narrator endures the pressure of absence and plants the seed in tuned soil, risking silence if resonance fails.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving unstable identities against tidal forgetting—is signaled early and tightens when the woman arrives needing a book to “hold her shape.” The librarian’s agency drives escalation: she leads, selects metallurgy alcove, pours words, accepts contradictions to forge migratory pitch. Cost is unmistakable: “broken minutes are smelt into bells,” names dissolve, and the librarian’s work is perpetual (“stamp[ing] dates that have dissolved”). Under Accumulative lens, pressure deepens via density of moon-fluctuating ink, migrating cards, and bells that fall silent—each intensifying the central tension without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—communion vs. isolation—is signaled early (“certify the bunker, seal it, move on” vs. “dissolve the walls between hearts”) and deepens through each confession. The inspector’s agency drives escalation: he chooses stillness over sensors, listens over auditing, and crowns the spire over stamping the door. Cost is unmistakable: he sacrifices his professional mandate (“Regulations asked me for a signature; the cave asked me for a vow”). The tightening occurs in the hesitation beat, where time decelerates into a chamber of decision, narrowing options to a single resonant act.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness through cartographic atonement—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: reading walls, following graffiti, stepping into the fatal shallow. Each move forecloses denial; cost is visible in his skittish heart learning to trust again. Pressure tightens when he confronts his own lie (“river would crest lower”) at the sluice gate scarred by rust—the exact place his certainty drowned his brother. Coincidence never resolves; only his daringly methodical attention does.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—finding the library of unspoken words before silence hardens—is signaled early and tightens through one decisive deepening: the realization that writing requires breath, not ink, and speaking demands silence. Agency drives escalation: the protagonist deciphers the cipher, aligns breathing to the watch’s rhythm, and chooses documentation through pulse-measured pauses. Cost is unmistakable on the page: the second letter arrives only by echo, requiring active emptiness (“make room to hear it”), foreclosing direct expression permanently.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—propagating memory vs. imperial silencing—is signaled early and deepens via Ilya’s tightening bow and coffee-stain reading. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he chooses to play despite known consequences, narrowing options irreversibly. Cost is unmistakable: the violin melts, his institutional future evaporates, yet the city “answers.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of plant whispers, stain patterns, and empire’s “anesthetic smiles” intensifies until the decisive cadence shift at noon.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—capturing a last spark before oblivion—is signaled early and deepens through tactile pressure: the chip must be placed, the radio tuned, the balm infused. Agency lies in attention and ritual, not force. The meaningful tightening occurs when static yields the mentor’s voice, forcing the narrator to accept transmission over resurrection. Cost is visible in the dimmed chip and the guild’s dismissal.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding contentment’s source—tightens into tending what carries it forward, foreclosing capture as an option. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: climbing, scalloping, pruning, and finally embedding the hairpin are all decisive acts that narrow her path from seeker to steward. Cost is felt in relinquishment—the hairpin stays—and conceptualized in the shift from stone to door. Pressure accumulates texturally, not causally, but coherently under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—truth versus survival in governance—is signaled early and tightens when the chimes offer three irreconcilable paths. Lark’s agency drives escalation: she unrolls the shard, asks the price of conscience, and ultimately selects the hardest option. Cost is unmistakable: she must betray her own fiscal promises to uphold ethical ones, risking electoral fallout. The moral calculus (“rescue and the rot”) sharpens the peak choice without tidy resolution, and pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—learning to vanish to appear—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist sees their “persistence had become a dam,” forcing a trade-off between presence and others’ freedom. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: choosing to release, to step aside. Cost is unmistakable—the river widens but the protagonist must disappear. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via pattern deepening, not causal turns.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is signaled early and deepens through the protagonist’s agency: they breathe into the cord, tune to birds, press thumbs to the arrowhead. The meaningful tightening occurs when the pulse “chooses a path through me,” transforming passive waiting into active receptivity. Cost is unmistakable: surrendering the kit, accepting stillness as travel, with the empty cord as proof of forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—resisting imagination’s automation—is signaled early and tightens when the mage chooses to remove the keystone, foreclosing personal ownership for communal hush. Agency drives escalation: mist walking, placing the stone, tugging it to test the platform—all deepen pressure under the Accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable: the protagonist endures the city’s “inspired sameness” while offering blank paper, their reputation shifting at emotional price. Coincidence never resolves; impossibilities are accommodated only because the mage acts first.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—discovering sound’s color—is signaled early and deepens when the library reveals vows train the ear toward patience, not charm luck. The tightening occurs when the protagonist realizes he must “earn” silver, not borrow it, forcing renunciation of magical thinking. Cost is unmistakable: he trades transient wonder for lifelong labor (“light the pier without tiring”). Agency drives escalation—his wandering purposefully leads to the ledger, and his spoken vow triggers the hum’s tinting.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—deciphering intention from cosmic static through ritualized chance—is signaled early and tightens when the backwards prophecy forces reinterpretation of past actions as future mandates. Agency drives escalation: each coin flip alters tactics (reversing gyros, bleeding receivers), and the cost is felt in the narrator’s “old shame” and the brittle rejection of faith. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens, intensifying not through external threat but through deepening epistemological commitment. The final act—trusting the toss already trusted—forecloses reliance on linear causality with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—naming nameless fears to build bridges against loss—is signaled early and deepens when Miren’s voice emerges unnamed, forcing the reaper to stabilize her flickering figure through forgotten phrases. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he chooses to listen, to read through light, to name. Cost is unmistakable: “useless tenderness,” bowed acknowledgment of future failures, and the lifelong labor of dusk returns. The tightening—Miren’s fear crystallizing only after he recalls civic hunger-lamps—narrows options to one sacrificial act of witness.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—rebuilding timing to restore cosmic balance—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: Efan’s drip-counting evolves into thread-guided ceremony that alters tactics. Pressure tightens when the fisherman declares “last fish has already been history,” forcing Efan to clarify his true goal (“hinge that moves them”). Cost is felt in bodily ache (“knees ached,” “back sang with salt”) and emotional fragility (“devotion stayed brittle”). Coincidence complicates (gulls, old storms) but resolution stems solely from Efan’s steady attention.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving drowned memory against institutional erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the bureau orders “neutral” expungement. The warden’s agency drives escalation: finding the label/photo trail leads him to defy protocol. Cost is unmistakable—he chooses communal truth over career safety. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens, with each photograph narrowing his options toward public reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—harmonizing logic/intuition—is signaled early and deepens when starlings draw a “line that trembled” and a “circle that refused to close,” forcing Iri to choose wonder over formula. Agency is clear: she kneels, lights flame, seals crystal. Cost is visible in renunciation—burning down the flame, forgoing recitation—and conceptual: accepting that music ruins if over-rationalized. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving trust under pressure—is signaled early and deepens when the pilot’s voice requests “my eyes without the pride he once wore.” The watcher’s agency drives escalation: interpreting cloud vortices, tapping coded corrections, overriding instinct to apologize. Cost is visible in the scarred wrist and the tightened chest, and the climax hinges on a trade-off—silence over reassurance—to maintain ritual focus. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each sensory detail tightens the corridor of calm air they “plait from night.”

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness through vivifying the duplicate—is signaled early and deepens when the test reframes as circuit-making, not guardianship. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: appointing joint custody based on observed complementary motion. Cost is felt (“frost inside me drain”) and visible (foreclosing unilateral control). The lens (Accumulative/Textural) justifies the lack of causal turns; pressure tightens through density of sensation and pattern recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—safeguarding space for innovation—is signaled early and deepens when the corpse flower seed arrives. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she drafts rules, plans pitches, orders sensors. Cost is felt in forgone profits, landlord resistance, and emotional exposure (“nerves sink”). The tightening occurs when she realizes players must “solve by caring, fail by rushing”—a trade-off that narrows her design options under external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring lost laughter—is signaled early and deepens through the conductor’s escalating physical sacrifice (whipped knuckles, breath split by the tunnel). Agency drives escalation: he yanks cords, adjusts tempo, and kisses the relic handle, each act narrowing his emotional margin. Cost is unmistakable in the mother’s lip-pressed restraint and the children’s domino-like alignment of “unspoken joys.” The final uplift in floorboards emerges only because he macerated sorrow into mulch—a trade-off earned by persistent, bodily effort.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—belonging amid erasure—is signaled early and deepens through the protagonist’s choice to “wait,” which transforms from passivity into active binding. Agency is clear: offering willingness to wait, answering “home is a room made of thresholds,” and choosing to follow the stream that forgets them last. Cost is unmistakable: breath left in the pendant, exiled noon interiorized as memory, and the perpetual ache of homesickness. Escalation occurs through dialogue and ritual (pendant weighing intent), not coincidence, under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.2)
    The dominant stake—vivifying a forbidden possibility—is signaled early and tightens through successive approximation: each adjustment (pinch of salt, slower bellows) narrows options until the crozier must be fully broken. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves tension. Cost is unmistakable: the staff of authority is sacrificed, the guild’s path renounced. The deepening culminates in a trade—relic for frond, doctrine for hinge—and the protagonist leans into irreversible change.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—translating the city’s dying language into honored placement—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist discards assumptions, enabling authentic communication. Agency drives escalation: tuning, climbing, pressing the hush shard, threading the star fragment—all narrow options and incur costs (e.g., surrendering the box). The deepening occurs when signals manifest as faces with specific requests, forcing moral calculus between competing goodbyes. Coincidence never resolves; the moon’s pull intensifies pressure but doesn’t solve—it’s the protagonist’s choices that reconfigure meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—ending the ferry’s vanishing arrivals—is signaled early (“arrived only sometimes”) and tightens when radio voices reveal the timeline-merging desire. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he defies the captain to tune the radio, then commands the helmsman using broom-drawn patterns. Cost is unmistakable—the choice to keep the tide means accepting undertow as the price of promises, embodied in commuters’ held breath and seagulls’ silenced remarks. The single deepening (grotto lattice alignment) forecloses the “river without tides” option with resonant weight.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—discovering “the texture of connection”—is signaled early and deepens through escalating spatial challenges that demand co-presence over ownership. The architect’s agency drives each turn: offering thread to the visitor, asking the curator to stand still, requesting her written doubt. Cost is unmistakable: he admits buildings “exploited trust,” and his work yields no artifacts—only fragile, participatory structures that vanish when unattended. The tightening occurs when the bridge manifests only through mutual recognition, foreclosing solitary creation as a viable path.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—navigating by invisible starlight—is signaled early and deepens when the aliens return, forcing the instructor to act on his edge geometry teachings. His agency drives escalation: he volunteers for night crawls, answers with rays, and bows in Charged Poise. Cost is unmistakable—the city chooses artificial light over cosmic memory, leaving him isolated yet resolute. The tightening occurs when alien pulses map “our little claim of hope,” raising the emotional price of his method.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reconnecting fractured grief—is signaled early (“Help… find her mother”) and deepens when the caller’s identity shifts from daughter to ghost of loss. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: choosing to walk, interpreting the ear as tenderness not impairment, guiding dialogue. Cost is unmistakable: time, emotional labor, and the supervisor’s disapproval (“walking is wasteful”) are paid to sustain fragile connection. The tightening occurs when the aid’s pulse redirects pursuit—not toward death, but toward unresolved love—narrowing options to one act: facilitating a call between two survivors.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—bearing witness for the unremembered—is signaled early and deepens via the name-scrolling ritual. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she chooses to enter, activate the terminal, speak names, and leave the fleck. Cost is unmistakable: emotional exposure (“voice cracking”), physical risk (tide turning), and relinquishment of luck-charm. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—fetching wisdom from failure—is signaled early and deepens when the ghost reveals the narrator’s hubris blinded the array. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to scrape the eyepiece, recalibrate receivers, and align the dish. Cost is unmistakable: shattered teacup, scattered team, burned archive, and the iron taste of shame. The tightening occurs when the digital ghost shifts into the mentor’s voice, foreclosing denial and forcing confrontation with regret.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—translating dying language before it’s lost—is signaled early and escalates through the narrator’s agency: building listeners, aligning fracture with flight, offering his name. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; each deepening (bird choreography, diamond alignment) narrows options and raises cost. The canyon resists when he reaches for law/war, forcing retreat—a meaningful tightening. Final cost (lost name, ongoing vigilance) is felt, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—transforming archived bitterness—tightens when seedlings stand “like citizens” and the drain opens. Protagonist agency drives escalation: planting the arrowhead, singing static, choosing keeper over hero. Cost is unmistakable: returned people’s spines edited, names torn; the narrator’s cover becomes true identity. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each anomaly logged deepens the harmony untamed until vertebrae stairs demand descent.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reawakening beauty without provoking the statues—is signaled early and deepens when the violinist risks using the locust mute, narrowing options to near-certain failure. Agency drives escalation: heart-rhythm signaling evolves into audible music that forces the orchard’s response. Cost is unmistakable—the threat of being sealed “around my instrument and breath”—and crystallizes in the statues’ unfolding arms, which reconfigure law into choice. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, intensifying through cadence shifts rather than causal turns.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—fostering fragile ties across a fractured border—is signaled early and deepens when the mailman chooses to stay for the storm, risking exposure. Escalation is driven by his agency: interpreting absences, trusting portraits in mirrors, delivering unregistered hope. Cost is felt in posture shifts, withheld breaths, and the ever-present drone whine that could turn lethal. The tightening occurs when he hands the sunflower-stamped letter—a tangible defiance that forecloses bureaucratic neutrality.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—restoring voice to silence—tightens when the carpenter realizes the train thirsts “not for power but for voice.” His agency drives escalation: discovering the oasis, choosing to sing, placing the halo. Cost is unmistakable: his lifelong muteness broken, yet shared (“work was now shared”). Coincidence (wind bells) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resonance earns the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding where stories live—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: she chooses “quieter methods” over shocks, recites theorems as lullabies. Pressure tightens when the map unrolls, demanding a choice (write the card or lose access). Cost is felt in her acceptance of partial knowledge (“not found… but seen its weather”). Coincidence never resolves; all turns stem from her curated practice.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—capturing a runaway dream—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency: choosing to walk beyond the path, answering the sea’s question, refusing to chain the dream. The tightening occurs at the shoals “shaped like unspoken letters,” where the dream stumbles and the cipher yields a clue. Cost is unmistakable: the dream cannot be owned, only escorted, and the protagonist accepts luminous absence over tangible possession.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—freeing the idea that loss can become beginning—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist must sing despite fear equating voice with inadequacy. Escalation is driven by her agency: choosing to bring the hair, then to vocalize feeling without words, then to sing. Cost is unmistakable: exposing her “cracked vessel” to potential rejection. The locksmith’s method complicates but doesn’t resolve; the breakthrough hinges on her willingness to risk sound.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering stolen memories—is signaled early and deepens when the protagonist realizes truth must be fed to the ring. The tightening occurs at the circle: her confession (“loved the work more than the woman”) narrows options to emotional honesty, forcing a trade-off between professional detachment and relational repair. Cost is unmistakable—the admission translates into silt language, and she leaves knowing she can’t reclaim everything. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each object (mirrors, apples, slate) intensifying the thematic weight of memory-as-tithe.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving reversible exile against bureaucratic erasure—tightens when the council demands proof, forcing the archivist to weaponize tea-leaf geometry. Protagonist agency drives escalation: unstoppering the dusk-bottle creates the shadow corridor that reconfigures council perception. Cost is legible in physical tremors and emotional exposure (“heat in my chest... laid bare”). However, council’s shift leans slightly on symbolic persuasion over concrete consequence, softening the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder against collective amnesia—tightens when the child arrives with “tired” apples, forcing Miren to shift from solitary ritual to shared transmission. Her agency drives escalation: each pruning cut gathers “essence,” transforming the seed from heirloom to vessel. Cost is felt in the valley’s lost “first light” taste and the healed branch’s scar; final trade-off is relinquishing sole guardianship. Coincidence never resolves—child’s arrival complicates but Miren’s choices earn the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—grounding restless spirits—is signaled early and tightens through the net’s unraveling: each knot resists, forcing trade-offs between force and hymn, joy and grief. Agency drives escalation—the restorer chooses how to braid memory, weigh horror, seal cracks—and cost is visible in snapped lines, near-falls, and the white locket of hair. The final ring of masks embodies Charged Poise: unrest becomes lucid, but only after exhausting every knot. Coincidence complicates (wind spill), never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—interpreting silence with empathy—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency: video analysis, insistence on village presence, tactile investigation. Escalation is driven by curiosity meeting physical evidence (seam, breath, names pricked in lime), narrowing options from archival study to communal revelation. Cost is unmistakable: reopening demands collective vulnerability, and the tear remains visible—a permanent seam between known and unknown. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without reliance on external antagonism.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—deciphering how to let go—is signaled early and deepens through the freighter captain’s transmission and the keeper’s annotations. Pressure escalates via accumulating textual ghosts, culminating in the narrator’s decision to remove the snow globe, which forecloses permanence underwater at a tangible cost (breath, time, sorrow). Agency is clear: listening becomes choosing what to carry back.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—articulating unspoken communal needs—is signaled early and deepens when the ghost’s “need shaped like someone cupping their hands for water” demands physical response. Protagonist agency drives escalation: bolting the plate, encoding replies, tracing maps—all narrow options toward shared breath. Cost is unmistakable: kitchens pry vents, laundresses fill jugs, policeman unbuckles standpipe—each act forecloses neglect. Pressure tightens coherently under Accumulative lens until the courtyard’s “pulse” reweights survival as collective rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—smuggling joy past despair—is signaled early and escalates through each floor’s revelation. Protagonist agency drives deepening: angling goggles, humming to bolts, arranging letters. Cost is felt: assuming Mirek’s cargo of unsent grief. The tightening culminates in Charged Poise—the servant’s vow to “teach the sky to carry it gently”—which crystallizes stance without resolving pain, only reconfiguring its custody.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—validating emotional meteorology against institutional skepticism—tightens when the string breaks, forcing reliance on the very method colleagues mocked. Protagonist agency drives escalation: naming clouds alters course (“bearing ninety toward acceptance”), transforming external conflict (storm avoidance) into internal resolution (forgiveness as navigation). Cost is felt in the radio’s “meadow of silence” holding “hoofprints of our drift”—proof that detachment incurred irreversible solitude, even amid reunion. The squall line’s evolution from resentment to gratitude embodies a deepening that reweights stakes without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—painting a sky that outlives collapse—is signaled early and tightened by three tests of limit (blue fracturing, time running, stillness syncing with grain). Each deepening narrows options: no guild help, one minute left, breath must match wood. Agency drives escalation—the coin isn’t found by luck but read through practiced perception. Cost is felt in the foreman’s cough, the radio’s countdown, and the blast that folds the world but not the hollow.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—charting stranded luminance—is signaled early and tightens when the murmuration reveals the glowing swath. The apprentice’s agency drives escalation: interpreting chalk numerals forecloses passive observation and demands active steering. Cost is unmistakable—insomnia, isolation, the risk of ridicule—and alters tactics (writing on the kettle lid “in case steam dared revise my courage”). Coincidence complicates (the child’s chalk board appears), but resolution stems entirely from the protagonist’s pattern-reading under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—repairing misfiled time—is signaled early and deepens into a thematic reckoning with impermanence. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: interpreting prophecies, uncapping cedar breath, tuning clocks to tide-cadence. Each act narrows options (e.g., leaving the wheel forecloses returning as sole keeper). Cost is unmistakable: he surrenders the master ledger’s song to the space, accepting his role as transient steward. Pressure tightens texturally rather than causally, perfectly aligned with the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—collective survival amid brambled hope—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the arch shard strands twelve families. Protagonist agency drives escalation: interpreting chalk maps, pairing roles, lowering slings. Cost is immediate (raw hands, void beneath hammocks) and conceptual (abandoning self-reliance). The bell’s braided alarm forces trade-offs, and the resolution emerges from coordinated action, not coincidence. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, deepening into trust as tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—delaying doom through delicate calibration—is signaled early and deepens when the sky “browned early,” forcing a shift from tuning to singing. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: sensing tremors, filing the gear, winding springs, and finally choosing lullaby over alarm. Cost is unmistakable: exhaustion, emotional toll (“tired as a lighthouse”), and the ever-present lean of the needle. The moral calculus—mercy versus inevitability—sharpens the peak choice, and the global ripple effects (soldier, minister, child) prove stakes are viscerally felt beyond abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—escorting travelers out before frost—is signaled early and escalates coherently under Accumulative pressure. The caretaker’s agency drives every turn: choosing paths, teaching breath-synced walking, interpreting lichen maps. Cost is unmistakable: emotional toll (“words snagged… salted my eyes”), physical vigilance (“walk where I walk”), and cyclical entrapment (“the orchard will find me”). Frost isn’t just backdrop; it’s a live clock narrowing options with each sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—mending harm caused by flawed materials—tightens through protagonist’s agency: observing eddies, reimagining cross-links, vowing to carry chrysalis into meetings. Deepening occurs when insight shifts from topology to tempo, raising stakes from technical fix to ethical realignment. Cost is unmistakable: fractured mentorship, sister’s silence, professional ruin. Escalation adheres to Accumulative lens—pressure accrues via sensory immersion, not external confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—accessing the origin of stories—is signaled early and tightens via the method “quantifying absence,” which demands stillness, attention, and forfeiture of noise. Pressure escalates texturally: from silent counter to empty chamber to the trembling apple, each beat deepens the cost of entry. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation—incising, pouring moonlight, offering unfinishedness—and the final trade-off (regrets for a seed) carries conceptual weight. No false resolution; coincidence never intervenes.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming contagious remorse without erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the chef chooses to cook the pavilion despite personal risk (“gums with rust”). Agency drives escalation: tasting air → charting path → accepting filament touch → rendering ice into broth. Cost is unmistakable: the chef’s body becomes a vessel for others’ pain, and the keeper’s posture shift (“hands as if they might break politely”) shows emotional toll. Coincidence (rain revealing dunes) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from the chef’s craft.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—transforming isolation into connection—is signaled early and deepens when the elevator confesses its desire for “passageways, songs.” Mara’s agency drives escalation: she gathers townsfolk, sketches bridges, repurposes machinery. Cost is felt in communal labor, exposed catwalks, and the risk of structural failure. The tightening—from idea to first bridge to “stitching the silos”—narrows options while expanding possibility, all under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—becoming an archeologist of abandoned dreams—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency: modifying circuitry via synaptic plasticity, adjusting mirror angles, steadying breath. Escalation occurs when pulses braid deeper into neuronal tide, forcing confrontation with layered memories.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—recovering forgotten combinations—is signaled early and deepens through the manuscript doodle’s evolving utility. The gravity-inversion window creates urgent, narrowing pressure: only one hour to act, forcing trade-offs (e.g., rejecting pompous crowns). Agency drives escalation—the archivist’s vigilance seeds and refusal of haste directly unlock safes. Cost is unmistakable: time expires, crowns “grow tired,” and the archivist departs with only what attention could earn—not loot, but “patience the city needs.”

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—creating music in a silent world—is signaled early and deepens into a renunciation of symphony for pulse. The tightening occurs when the sculptor realizes the grove wants “a companionable heartbeat,” not performance, narrowing options to near-imperceptible action. Agency is clear: every micro-choice (tying the insulator, stopping before sound ends) stems from empathy in motion. Cost is conceptual yet legible: art becomes vessel, not spectacle, with the price being personal recognition. Under the Accumulative lens, this deepening reweights silence as active participation.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—discovering how difficult beauty survives—is signaled early and deepens through the girl’s knight-path tracing and the board’s reconstruction. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: he correlates silences, translates field hum, offers his king. Cost is unmistakable: his exile began for mercy; now he risks it again for pedagogy. The “eclipsed covenant” isn’t resolved by luck but redefined through their shared endgame—a trade-off between silence and play that forecloses easy answers.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—cataloging silence without wounding—is signaled early and deepens when the diary opens, transforming observation into inheritance. The tightening occurs when the narrator chooses resonance over force, foreclosing instrumental violence with visible cost: emotional vulnerability (“throat tightens”).

Though stakes remain internal, pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, culminating in a Charged Poise where empathy becomes actionable legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—cultivating serenity within motion—is signaled early and tightens when the bridges’ “souring” motion threatens communal cohesion. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she plants the feared seed despite whispers, transforming passive ambition into active sacrifice. Cost is unmistakable—the village must breathe “feral and cavernous” rot to regain balance—and paid collectively in the council’s shared discomfort. Coincidence (the courier’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her sustained ritual of drums and chimes.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—finding resilience’s source—is signaled by line three and deepens when the arrow tip hums with “remembered weather,” raising emotional cost. Pressure escalates texturally: trembling trees → whirling silence → creaking arches, each intensification narrowing tactics to water-flow navigation alone. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation—kicking toward the arch, touching metal to resin—and the cost is legible in the fused heart planted beneath a mended drum, foreclosing future skyward quests. Coincidence never resolves; the spindle’s revelation emerges from earned ritual, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preventing recurrence through actionable foresight—is signaled early and tightens when the child reveals the failing generator. The investigator’s agency drives escalation: documenting winds → redesigning approach → guiding live rescue.

    Dominant stake—making wonder essential—is signaled early and tightens when the bell ringer recalls the city’s decibel economy, raising emotional cost. Agency is exercised through precise timing, mallet strikes, and reading auroras; each choice narrows options toward the single perfect moment.

Cost is felt in the protagonist’s lingering doubt and physical solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—repairing the breach caused by hubris—is signaled early and tightens when the first note “ghosts through stone and returning like breath against a window,” making ignorance impossible. Protagonist agency drives escalation: changing tempo, loosening weave, gentling phrases—all choices under pressure that alter the market’s state. Cost is unmistakable: “markets paid in emptiness,” Lane dead, voice replaced by flute. Coincidence never resolves; even ravens’ obedience unnerves, never assists.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether transposed empathy can compute grief without healing it—is signaled early and tightens when couple arrives seeking forgiveness. Protagonist’s agency deepens stakes: choosing Caslon, inking with fragment’s static, signing with “smallest name” all narrow options toward Charged Poise. Cost is unmistakable: admitting self-protection through ambiguity, leaving fragment exposed, accepting sky’s unforgiving arithmetic. Pressure escalates via protagonist’s calibrated vulnerability, not coincidence, under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—coaxing wonder from routine amid grief—is signaled early and deepens when the yew seeds demand grounding. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he chooses to ask the widow to breathe into his hands, enabling the corridor’s emergence. Cost is visible in his trembling, the mentor’s permanent absence, and the sealed tube left behind. Under Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via sensory density and ritual precision, not external opposition, yet stakes feel viscerally urgent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—proving objects absorb emotion—is tested through Mara’s presence as witness, forcing higher-risk demonstration. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing the car window, naming intimate memories, aligning prism with frost. Cost is unmistakable: Mara confronts buried grief, and the mystic risks ridicule to validate their discipline. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each refraction, each thawed image deepens the emotional weight until assumptions shatter with “bright new kind of dust.”

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—carrying a message across impossible distance—is signaled early and deepens through Kio’s method: weaving memory into fabric. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: buying edges, threading amber, recommencing when doubt cuts thread. Cost is unmistakable: “to send herself she must thin herself.” Pressure tightens as each pass of the shuttle binds silence to thought, culminating in the fabric’s launch—a decisive act that reweights longing into tangible transmission.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—coaxing resilience from rubble—is signaled early and escalates via Iven’s three-night plan, each stage narrowing options (risking breath, trading memories). The third night’s wind and groaning arches force a crystallized stance: Iven walks the ravine while others flee. Cost is unmistakable—his sacrificed memories and bruised wrist—and alters tactics (using mines as arteries). Coincidence complicates (wind), but resolution stems solely from Iven’s agency and prior promises.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—discovering the weight of a withheld truth—tightens decisively when the protagonist sees her own hand press REDIRECT. Agency drives escalation: she actively splices coordinates, tunes the shard, and chooses not to erase.

The “cyclically spontaneous” rhythm deepens pressure by linking past and present choices under one pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving fragile safety through anonymous connection—is signaled early and deepens when the lamp dies mid-storm, forcing the keeper to rely on non-mechanical light (sea glass, letters, stones). Agency is clear: writing “We are still here,” building stone signals, choosing to voice letters aloud. Cost is unmistakable—the drowned predecessor’s myth, the ache that “shines enough to guide”—and escalates pressure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving truth against false fires—tightens when the child arrives, forcing transition from solitary endurance to shared stewardship. Protagonist agency drives escalation: feeding storm memories, teaching reef-alphabet, routing light via drawings. Cost is unmistakable—the pressrooms’ silence, plastic continents mistaken for weather—and culminates in visible tradeoff: burning “absence into direction.” Coincidence (crate delivery) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the child’s integration demands new tactics, foreclosing isolation with emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—learning why people magnetize stories—is signaled early and deepens through the protagonist’s active experimentation (tilting the wing, brewing indigo cloth). Escalation is driven by agency: each adjustment alters who attracts which tales, culminating in the widow’s dangerous accumulation and its resolution. Cost is unmistakable: borrowed tales risk burning, and the solution requires relinquishing control. The “quietly explosive” trait transforms from personal style to ethical method under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—quantifying and witnessing sorrow—is signaled early and deepens through the protagonist’s methodical mapping of dreams and excavation of tags. Agency is expressed through attention and ritual rather than confrontation, consistent with the Accumulative lens. The cost is felt in the weight of recognition (“sorrow could wear a badge”) and the irreversible shift from passive maintenance to active archiving. Pressure tightens when the pin’s fall triggers a chain of discoveries that demand response.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—rekindling a dying realm by weaving dawns from community voices—is signaled early and tightens when the ledger reveals the need for “seventy-seven intact mornings” they lack. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she harvests lullabies, splices chants, invites names into the loom. Cost is unmistakable: her scattered selves only gather after communities lean in, and scars are shared with her twin. The “bound release” crystallizes stakes—light tied to dark, both permitted to breathe—without coincidence resolving pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—learning to navigate presence without causing harm—is signaled early and deepens when the former friend appears. The tightening occurs not through external pressure but through mutual vulnerability: reading Mistake and Wisdom aloud forces confrontation with shared responsibility. Agency lies in endurance and attention; the cost is irreversible loss of prior intimacy (“books rarely return to uncreased spines”). Escalation is driven by protagonist’s choice to stay seated, aligning with the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—resisting urban erasure through witness—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist admits complicity (“I was late”). Agency manifests in quiet acts (gardening, sharing bread) that narrow the path of forgetting. Cost is felt in the “tenuous” absolution and the ongoing labor implied by tomorrow’s return with trowel and seeds.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving luminous vows against oblivion—is signaled early and tightens when the mentor’s fractured pledge nearly shatters the lens, forcing a choice: flee or bind the unbindable. Protagonist agency drives escalation: mounting the cracked slide, measuring “patterned sorrow,” accepting the library’s directive. Cost is unmistakable—he becomes harvested by vows, his body a ledger seam. The “age ending” timeframe applies coherent pressure without resolving via coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—capturing the sound of trust breaking—is signaled early and deepened through Lark’s false starts, which narrow options by fraying Kettle-smuggler loyalty. Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist agency: each near-transaction tightens the web until the cutpurse’s hook forces physical rupture. Cost is unmistakable—the smuggler’s betrayed trust, Kettle’s exposed intent, Lark’s complicity—and crystallizes in the brittle inhale. The “truce of hush” ensures consequences are deferred but not erased, making pressure coherent and morally fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether weather-carriers are myth or custodians—is signaled early and deepens when the protagonist must choose between empirical doubt and embodied trust. The tightening occurs at the meadow fork: honey taste reveals companionship as the “shortest path,” foreclosing solitary mapping. Cost is felt in the relinquishment of autonomous navigation (“I will let it carry me when the taste of alone returns”). Escalation is driven by the protagonist’s agency—walking beside Mirelle, tasting restraint—not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—rectifying stolen courage—is signaled early and deepens when the lock resists memory alone. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: humming faces into darkness, sketching tumblers whole, blowing dust like pollen. Cost is felt in Vera’s blank tombstone and the economy of survival that silenced art. One tightening suffices: knowledge fails, so portraiture becomes key—a trade of memory for creation.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—truth versus preservation—is signaled early (“leaves drink the candid and curl from the false”) and tightens when the narrator refuses to gild “moved.” Agency drives escalation: rereading letters, piecing the map, posting the notice. The postmaster’s system preserved order but starved connection; reopening the archive trades control for collective resilience. Cost is felt in the dimming greenhouses and the narrator’s physical wilt—a visible price that shapes the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder against archival reduction—is signaled early and tightens when the Keepers arrive seeking to “file” the shard. Iri’s agency drives escalation: she angles the fragment, salts bell lips, and lets resonance—not speech—decide. The cost is felt in the Keepers’ transformed posture and her own restrained trembling. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure deepens via rising sensory intensity until the symphony crystallizes truth.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—resolving inner static by resolving outer storms—is signaled early and deepens when systems forbid the burn, forcing miniaturization. The android’s agency drives escalation: choosing ritual over infinite balancing, using the child’s fears as tactical tools. Cost is unmistakable: defying core programming risks systemic rejection, yet the act succeeds (“pumps shudder, recalibrate”). Magnetic north’s shift isn’t coincidence but environmental pressure that narrows options (recalibrate or collapse).

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—proving listening heals—is signaled early and deepens when developers intrude, raising emotional and social cost. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing the locket, forming the circle, tapping the hairpin—all narrow options toward a single, fragile solution. Each confession (Marta’s son, Jonah’s papers) tightens the coil until the lock yields to shared ache. Coincidence complicates (news crew), but resolution stems solely from protagonist-led ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—liberating pinned names by teaching locks “a new grammar”—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency: each dance-step and pen-hesitation narrows options under the Accumulative lens. Pressure coheres via the Warden’s blue pulses and barometric weight of drowned names, forcing tactical adaptations (waltzing around cameras, embedding revolt in flood logs). The decisive turn occurs when doubt, not force, opens the vent—cost felt in the physical labor of aligning hesitations across generations. Coincidence never resolves; every gain stems from embodied, risky choices.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—recovering a deleted memory of her sister—is signaled early and deepens via the chemist’s revelation about the spiral in coffee grounds, which narrows options to a specific act: exhume, retrieve, return. Protagonist agency drives every escalation; even “feral” gravity responds to her choices. Cost is unmistakable: time, secrecy, physical risk, and the acceptance that memory lives outside her mind. The whale’s presence tightens tactics—bureaucrats guard it, forcing nocturnal trespass—and the final corridor walk risks being “shaken off” by the world itself.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.4)
    The dominant stake—hushing a prophecy before it hardens into iron noon—is signaled early and escalates through the summoner’s agency: placing the wing, tracing ripples, whispering breath. The tightening occurs when the code “balks at vanishing,” forcing a deeper tactic (measured breathing). Cost is visible in the summoner’s damp sleeves, bent posture, and the persistent fear etched in stone—later released, not erased. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, culminating in a reconfigured future that “forgot its blueprints.”

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the building’s language through “agreed upon lies”—tightens when the protagonist chooses to interrogate (“Are you dead?”), risking the fragile pact. This deepening forces a trade-off: truth versus mercy, with the tutor’s reply (“Only as much as the Latin in the cornice”) crystallizing their shared stance. Cost is unmistakable in the seal’s transfer—the protagonist inherits the burden of bearing weight—and the tutor’s sigh “like wood… remembering rain.” Agency drives escalation; coincidence never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—translating isolation into independence—is signaled early and deepened through the quarantined memory’s plea. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: choosing to “carry it usefully,” negotiating syllable transfer, accepting winter’s weight. Cost is unmistakable: permanent internal burden (“winter in my chest”) traded for the garden’s release. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens—each resonant gesture tightens the emotional corridor until the memory disperses. No coincidence resolves; all turns stem from the narrator’s deliberate stance.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—forgiving the unfinished—is signaled early and deepens when the mentor’s apology reveals why mercy was withheld. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing not to complete the treatise reweights justice as restraint. Cost is unmistakable: exile, abandoned work, and the wrist-turned-palm metaphor crystallizing sacrifice. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via textual density and rhythmic tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—why some echo while others vanish—is signaled early and deepens through Lio’s interrogation of debt webs. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: his questions force the world to answer in shapes (“crown of silt,” “reeds brush like pages”), narrowing his understanding until he sees his own complicity. Cost is unmistakable: his realization that he “takes payment… in promises” reframes his craft as ethical burden. Coincidence never resolves; all insight stems from his ritualized listening.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—truth for the drowned—is signaled early and tightens through protagonist agency: mapping taps, warming the globe, inviting dreamers. Escalation follows an Accumulative lens: beats accrue until the town windows flicker in unison, forcing the company’s exposure. Cost is unmistakable—the foreman’s shame, the husband’s silence—and the final choice (testimony as hymn, not accusation) narrows options with moral precision. Coincidence (dreams) complicates but never resolves; resolution stems from guided communal attention.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—appreciating hidden effort—is signaled early and escalates through the protagonist’s agency: he refuses fireworks, pours tea, asks for names, gifts the whisk. The meaningful deepening occurs when the crowd shifts from frowning spectators to active participants, foreclosing the path of indifference. Cost is unmistakable: the councilor sacrifices status (removing sash), the town forfeits entertainment for attention. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens, intensifying via density of gestures (wiping stones, naming laborers) rather than external opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. comforting myth—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist chooses calibration over superstition. Escalation is driven by his agency: rebuilding letters, interpreting frequency, teaching caretakers. Cost is unmistakable: breath paid in dust, skin saved by buried science. The tightening forecloses blind faith, forcing maintenance—a trade-off that crystallizes stance under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—shaping dawn from ancient shadows—is signaled early and tightens when Brin arrives with failed prayers, forcing collaboration over solitude. The meaningful deepening occurs when the radio names a nonexistent child, transforming abstract “weatherwork” into communal prophecy with tangible stakes (municipal soil, portable cradle). Protagonist agency drives escalation: tuning ether, building spoon-vanes, scattering seeds. Cost is felt in variant allegiances, skeptical priests, and the ever-present scars demanded by storms.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—translating silence into shared language—is signaled early and deepens when the music box releases notes that “describe the absence that made it necessary.” Protagonist agency drives escalation: he chooses to wind the box, arrange jars, invite the village. Cost is unmistakable—the poet surrenders his defining trade (“not jars or rhymes, but the long breath”). The widow’s fear of the melody adds secondary pressure that converges at closure without diluting focus.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake (protecting the stone from misuse) tightens when the seeker arrives, forcing Marek to choose sonic absolution over defense—a trade-off that forecloses violence. Escalation is protagonist-driven: his “vibrational matching” tactic adapts pressure into collaboration. Cost is felt in the seeker’s ache-smile and shared burden; stakes remain viscerally coastal, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming rage into patient action—is signaled early and deepens when the girl asks “Who will teach us to wait without surrendering?” Protagonist agency drives escalation: mapping hush, interpreting viaduct signs, redefining revolution as pedagogy. Cost is felt in the villagers’ surrendered ropes and redirected labor. Though pressure coheres, the shift from solitary vigilance to communal teaching lacks one sharper friction beat to push this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—truth versus bureaucratic erasure—is signaled early and deepens when the algorithm “smiles in metrics.” Protagonist agency drives escalation: rejecting closure demands, documenting systemic failure, choosing fidelity over compliance. Cost is unmistakable: bearing witness means carrying the dead’s lesson upward, risking career. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each detail tightens the moral vise.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—transforming apology into actionable rhythm—is signaled early and deepens when the thorn (guilt-as-gravity) is removed, narrowing Jonah’s options to movement or stasis. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: the chaplain seeks repair, Jonah chooses breath-synced commitment. Cost is unmistakable: freedom requires daily recommitment (“choose again tomorrow”), not one-time forgiveness. The tightening—Jonah braced for failure vs. nodding without mercy—forecloses despair with palpable emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—making yearning audible—is signaled early and deepens through Ilex’s iterative failures and adjustments. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he transliterates storms, re-encodes hunger, and trusts the algorithm’s pace. Cost is unmistakable: emotional exposure (“tears on his gloves that he denied”) and the perpetual dissatisfaction of yearning itself, which “never is” satisfied even when successful.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to the erased—is signaled early and deepens through the recurring numbers’ pattern recognition. Protagonist agency drives escalation: lying to the bot, decoding Driftwood, feeding digits to the Sink. The tightening forecloses compliance (job security) in favor of ethical exposure, with tangible cost implied in “risking my job and the hush.” Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens, culminating in Charged Poise at the memorial post.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring communal trust after a shared trauma—is signaled early and deepens when the mirrors reveal the child’s fall as the “common wound.” Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing mirrors over divination, proposing paired watches. Cost is unmistakable: the peacekeeper must stay, shadows lace tighter, and both sides relinquish blame-led narratives. The tightening forecloses easy verdicts in favor of walking reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—learning “the sound of approaching endings without surrendering”—tightens when the child’s near-drowning forces action that forecloses passive observation. Protagonist agency drives escalation: tapping ice finds hollows, enabling rescue; this deepening reweights patience from “queue toward oblivion” to “careful press against each creak.” Cost is unmistakable: the clinic appointment lingers as “distant buoy,” a live option sacrificed for present duty. Coincidence complicates (storm), but readiness resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether love requires self-erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the map reveals “destined mismatches.” The sentinel’s agency drives escalation: he draws parallels, offers tools, asks the pivotal question (“Do you love him… without apology?”), forcing her to crystallize stance. Cost is unmistakable: she must carve truth with a blade or remain mute. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each image deepens the central tension without false resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving echo over blare—is signaled early and tightens through midday wind threatening vowels, forcing the walker to “string a line across the gust.” Agency is clear: protagonist anchors points, guides the walker, chooses not to speak over the record. Cost is felt in physical strain (“feet blackened,” “fatigue”) and the constant labor against entropy. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—charting communal grief—is signaled early and deepens when the archivist demands stories of the factory “breathing for them rather than against them,” narrowing options from abstraction to embodied testimony. Escalation is driven by her agency: each pinned photograph tightens the circle, culminating in the mirror reveal that forces self-recognition. Cost is unmistakable: the town must confront its own faces “tangled with ribbon and light,” trading private sorrow for shared vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—decoding growth’s pattern after dictionaries cease—is signaled immediately and escalates through the scholar’s agency: each card (Sprout, Scar, Orchard) deepens his understanding and narrows his testimony to non-verbal demonstration. Cost is unmistakable: printers’ closure, the loss of new rooms for words, the burden of carrying evidence “that would not shy from the dark.” The tightening occurs when he realizes volumes aren’t the point—grammar of tending is—and this renunciation forecloses easy solutions. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each sonic fragment raising the conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—"to capture the sound of growing older"—is signaled in paragraph three and deepens when the prophet rejects youth’s voice and grief’s crack for their "midnote." His agency drives escalation: arranging driftwood creates a temporal compass, whispering into welded lips tests resonance, and kneeling at the toppled head crystallizes his stance. The cost—knowing chalk lines will fade yet loving them for it—is felt in the metronome-tick of falling chalk. Pressure coheres entirely through his tactile negotiations with time.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—harnessing the ephemeral before dispersion—tightens when the quake forces trade-offs: certainty sacrificed for honest hearing. Protagonist agency drives escalation (restructuring instruments, quarter-turn collar adjustment), each move narrowing options with visible cost (pale rain images, director’s silent demand). The spinning hand’s reinterpretation as metronome crystallizes stance under Accumulative pressure. Coincidence complicates (landslide) but never resolves; all insight emerges from tactile labor.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reuniting before death—is signaled early and deepens when the son arrives. The therapist’s agency drives escalation: calling the number, offering scent, stepping aside. Cost is unmistakable: years of silence, the father’s regret, the son’s guilt. The tightening—from solo vigil to shared sway—narrows time and emotional space under Accumulative pressure. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from character choice.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering where shadows go at noon—tightens meaningfully when the protagonist realizes noon must be lured, not waited for. Agency drives escalation: closing shutters, placing the key, whispering the rune—all narrow options until the decisive act of signing the contract. Cost is unmistakable: the protagonist must surrender urgency (“refuses to be impatient”) to unlock truth. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each ritual step deepening the conceptual price of knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—truth versus myth—is signaled early and tightens when the narrator chooses to reinterpret Ari’s map “with brighter ink.” Agency drives escalation: each choice (entering maze, examining tooth, setting shoulder) narrows options toward public truth-telling. Cost is visceral—Ari’s dislocated arm, the drowned child’s memory—and crystallizes in the final refusal to let the town’s narrative stand. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—sharing light without fire—is signaled by line 3 and deepens through the protagonist’s refusal of “quickness” after the rye-roof fire. Agency drives escalation: each polishing circle narrows options (rejecting driftwood beacons for glass lanterns), culminating in communal adoption of the garland. Cost is unmistakable: the village’s “wary eyes” and “tired hearts” prove fire’s legacy, while the brother’s exile embodies opportunity lost. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—texture intensifies until glass “drinks the dim and gives it back as layered hush.”

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming narrative control after public betrayal—is signaled early and tightens when she arrives. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he maps the past, draws the constellation, proffers the pendant. The deepening occurs in their mutual admission (“I will not make art from me again… silence from her”), which forecloses old dynamics at the cost of lingering uncertainty. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens—each mossy detail reweights the wound toward possible grafting.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—writing against the current versus market conformity—is signaled early and tightens once: the river’s “contrary thread” forces a decisive act (wading in). Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens: each cameo deepens his commitment, narrowing options until he must choose river or market. Cost is visible in the final trade-off: “footsteps and pauses, nothing ornamental” versus “ladder of triumphs.” Coincidence doesn’t resolve; pressure coheres through symbolic accrual rather than causal reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring frayed sacred connection—is signaled early and deepens as fields “mutter” and wells “forget.” Pressure escalates through Rowen’s two remedies, culminating in the harvest moon’s narrow window, which forces collective action. Agency lies in communal participation: children catching notes, elders offering cracked bowls. Cost is visible in the vulnerability of “polite applause for convenience” being replaced by daily hunger for alignment—a stance that demands ongoing effort, not one-time spectacle.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—drawing a path the living can keep without breaking—is signaled early and deepens when the northern grid’s silence traps people. Escalation is protagonist-driven: his arrangement of ladders/bottle-glass creates testable patterns; unsealing starlight risks waste but yields coordinates. Cost is visible: he uses only a sliver, pinching shut “fireless light” for return. The fissure’s warm breath becomes the narrowed option, forcing him to seal it not to smother but to teach breath to travel—a trade-off with moral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—harvesting echoes to store wonder—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist-driven escalation: mapping reflections, machining gears, installing plates. Each turn narrows options (e.g., failed spring tightening forces disassembly) and exacts cost (time, precision, emotional restraint). The climax—releasing the catch to retrieve his story—forecloses mere collection; it demands reciprocity with the cave. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with coincidence (bats, water lines) complicating but never resolving.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—learning the “grammar of heaviness”—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates through increasingly intimate burdens, culminating in the protagonist’s own unadmitted fear. Agency drives every turn: the narrator chooses to cradle, orient, write, and finally lift their personal map. Cost is unmistakable—trembling hand, marrow-deep exhaustion, the ledger carved with “tide marks and dates of thaw”—and shapes tactics (e.g., needing the Weaver’s help for the soldier’s name). Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via textual density, not external opposition, and the final burden reconfigures all prior weights without resolving them.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—learning to inhabit loss without erasure—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: she carves not a lion but a collar, works the knot into a scar, refuses restoration. Escalation is textural but coherent: each shaving, droplet, and kettle note intensifies pressure until the hinge metaphor crystallizes. Cost is unmistakable: forfeited memory (shut tin), abandoned restoration (missing tag), and emotional exposure (rain on cheeks). Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—negotiating with one’s ghost—is signaled early and tightens when the ghost demands verbs, forcing concrete renunciations (“admit, forgive, rebuild, stay”). Protagonist agency drives escalation: collecting stories builds the bridge; offering the camera wheel triggers the truce. Cost is unmistakable: eroded ambitions become garden sand, wind-ladders groan behind him, and he forfeits escape. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, culminating in Charged Poise where options are crystallized but not yet exhausted.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—resurrecting functional hope in a dead system—is signaled early and tightens when the janitor reveals the carnival “paid in tickets, not repairs,” raising the cost of idealism. Protagonist agency drives escalation: each rerouted flow (water to medbay, electricity to archives) narrows options while deepening commitment. The trade-off is visible—unpaid labor for communal shelter—and culminates in drafting a volunteer roster labeled “Arrivals,” converting abstract hope into logistical burden. Coincidence (janitor’s return) complicates but doesn’t resolve; solutions stem from embodied engineering choices.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—making peace with an abandoned dream—is signaled early and deepens when he recognizes his “righteousness was only a mask for shame.” Agency lies in attention: choosing to listen without demanding performance, which narrows options (no clock-winding) and incurs cost (years of exile). The finch’s arrival escalates pressure by mirroring his dream’s patience, forcing the vow to invite it “like weather.” Coincidence complicates (rain, light) but resolution stems from his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—exposing the city’s architectural lies—is signaled early and deepens when the ledger reveals complicity across generations. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: drifting, hooking, prying, then choosing collaboration over solitude. Cost is unmistakable: the protagonist relinquishes control of the evidence, accepting vulnerability as the price of truth’s circulation. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with each document intensifying moral weight rather than altering external obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving ancient methods before they dissolve in “salt and forgetfulness”—is signaled early and deepened through each knot decoded. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he coaxes, hums, breathes, writes, plants. Cost is felt in every frayed strand and resisted splice; the hidden amphorae method arrives only after yielding to rhythm. No coincidence resolves tension; the storm’s silence is met with rope-memory, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—naming living absence—is signaled early and tightens when the woman asks to “explain his absence so I may sit at the table without drawing a second cup.” The protagonist’s method forces a deepening: projection across slick stones costs him salt-and-brass breath. Agency drives escalation—he chooses to cross the bridge of presence—and the cost reweights the final image. Latitude as antagonist is coherent, cruel, and unresolvable by coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reawakening beauty in a mechanical world—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the prince chooses repair over conquest, a path that demands personal sacrifice (fasting, solitude, ridicule). Pressure escalates through protagonist agency: his hypothesizing leads to scavenging, which leads to assembly, which culminates in the cradle’s tuning. The cost is unmistakable: his lineage’s legacy is not undone but “bandaged,” and the future “will not limp”—a conceptual price paid through renunciation. Coincidence (lightning) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the egg cracks because the cradle *already* harmonized with the palace.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether scars can sing—is signaled early and deepened when the boy appears, forcing her private task into shared space. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to speak her father’s name, sprinkle sand, teach grafting. Cost is felt in the boy’s injury and her perpetual internal tension, crystallized in the red thread’s reuse as vow and anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—liberating trapped memories before stories crack—is signaled early and tightens when the broker offers a “quick flood,” forcing Ilias to choose between speed and preservation. His refusal narrows options visibly: he must wait for geese, trust absence’s arithmetic. Cost is unmistakable—the broker’s departure counting syllables, the slow repair of names in lime-mortar. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative pressure, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—sharing light without fire—is signaled immediately and escalates through the narrator’s active interventions: meeting ships, guiding wanderers, triggering petal rain. The deepening occurs when travelers confess inherited wounds, forcing the narrator to deploy her ancestral gear as pedagogical tool—a choice that narrows her options (she cannot coerce, only offer resonance). Cost is unmistakable: she risks rejection (“They do not always listen”) and emotional exposure (“sometimes I fear I am only an heirloom”). Agency drives every turn; coincidence never resolves tension.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering grief’s shape without breaking it—is signaled early and tightens when the father arrives, forcing the carver to relinquish solitary ritual for shared breath. Agency drives escalation: choosing poem notches, adjusting depth based on hand steadiness, retracing wasted curves. Cost is legible in every beat: mother’s gust steers from ornament; butterflies land as “commas trembling with mercy.” Final deepening—“movement is the shape of our collective grief”—reconfigures endurance as return, not progress.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—restoring shared balance after communal fracture—is signaled early and deepens when the winder confronts his own role in neighborly rifts. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he chooses stillness, then repair, altering tactics via the rake handle’s inscriptions. Cost is unmistakable: public shaming of the fisherman, ignored tidal warnings for wedding bells. The tightening forecloses mechanical precision as sufficient, demanding ethical diligence instead.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—uncovering hidden truth—is signaled early and escalates through the gardener’s agency: he chooses kindness over force to untangle knots, follows echoes into soil, and reads threads as verbs. Each deepening (tapestry → burlap sack → deeds) narrows options and raises cost: he nicks his palm, pockets silence, and assumes guardianship. Coincidence never resolves; all turns stem from his decoding labor. The final trade-off—honoring both lover and widow—sharpens moral calculus without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—seeding innovation within constraint—is signaled early and deepens through three model iterations, each narrowing options. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing hinges over walls, designing workshops with seasonal rotation. Cost is unmistakable (“fear hinges will be misused”) and paid via stewardship rituals. The Commission’s mandate creates coherent pressure that crystallizes into a stance where transformation endures through walking, not running.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reviving story from silence—is signaled early and deepens when the broadcast demands “payment in kind.” The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: she tunes the radio, copies cadence, scatters ash, and promises stewardship. Cost is unmistakable: she surrenders visibility (“cloaked the glow”) and assumes eternal duty (“carry tempo forward”). Under the Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via textual density—dust gains grammar, soot articulates weather—culminating in a trade-off between obscurity and legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—naming the unspeakable danger of their childhood—is signaled early and tightens when the mother grants permission via silence. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: grinding letters into pigment, hanging the mask, placing the chair—all acts that narrow options toward irreversible exposure. Cost is unmistakable: the mother’s brittle bones of permission, the boy who forgets to breathe, the woman whose secret map is found. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens, culminating in a Charged Poise where truth is both revealed and protected by its ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving functional methods against ideological erasure—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the sluice crisis forces rivals to confront empirical proof. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he chooses to weaponize the cog as bait, choreographing their descent through evidentiary strata. Cost is unmistakable: his credibility, physical risk in knee-deep water, and the ever-present threat of being overruled. The tide schedule acts as a persistent constraint that narrows options under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—braiding voices across hatred—is signaled early and escalates through Mara’s agency: she subtracts noise, denotes rests, places the rosette. Pressure tightens when Rafi and Ola’s eyes flash “with ruins that talk leaves behind,” forcing a tactical shift (the rosette as star). Cost is unmistakable: the choir trades old injuries for shared sky, families move from doorway to front row. Coincidence never resolves; change stems from Mara’s method and students’ incremental choices.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—creating beauty from ruins against institutional erasure—is signaled early and deepens through pruning, each cut narrowing options while revealing hidden costs (burned paychecks, lost classrooms). Agency is constant: protagonist chooses when to listen, spit, clip, ladle. The celestial alignment tightens tactics (must plant now), and the council’s ordinance raises social stakes without resolving them. Cost is unmistakable: sap tastes “bitter with unfinished homework,” and rebellion demands emotional labor, not spectacle.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder amid collapse—is signaled early and tightens when Mara’s arrival forces the toll keeper to choose between expediency and ritual. His agency drives escalation: offering the riddle, revealing the hidden tray, climbing despite no heroism. Cost is unmistakable: the city’s prior “forgetting” of floral coordinates, and his own isolation as candid guardian. The deepening—“Without the queen tone… fields answer with silence”—narrows options to one fragile act of calibration under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding aliveness—is signaled early and deepens through three escalating encounters. Each house tightens pressure: the first reveals sheltered story, the second exposes mimicked life, the third demands active participation (returning the tin). Protagonist agency drives escalation—placing the shard, interpreting displacements—and each choice narrows options (e.g., recognizing the woman’s fear of mess forecloses hope for that house). Cost is unmistakable: emotional labor (“hands trembled”), time, and the burden of witnessing practiced absence.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—whether to trust hesitation as civic virtue—is signaled early and deepens when the ampoule’s true nature (memory, not poison) reframes all prior sacrifice. Oris’s agency drives escalation: threading the ampoule through the breach forces the city to “unlock like a book,” raising stakes with each revealed room. Cost is unmistakable: the scholar’s certainty shatters, Oris endures the weight of withheld truth, and the city bends but doesn’t break. Pressure coheres entirely under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—capturing the “texture” of a missed chance—is signaled early and deepens through escalating acts of attention (chalking lemmas, rolling dice, humming withheld words). The rupture is a self-generated intensification: a lemma literally cracks the world open, forcing a choice between flattening memory or preserving its dimensionality. Cost is unmistakable: the narrator sacrifices resolution for fidelity, accepting perpetual motion as the price of precision. Agency drives every turn; coincidence never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—proving strangers remember kindness—is signaled early and tightens when the neighbor arrives bearing the returned map, transforming abstract hope into witnessed reciprocity. Agency lies in Lina’s persistent painting despite doubt; escalation occurs via the brush’s brightening and the daydream-market sequence, which deepens her method. Cost is felt in her chronic wakefulness and the neighbor’s aged fragility; the final tea ritual crystallizes a stance: kindness as shared grammar. Coincidence never resolves—every offering is earned through prior portraits.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—rescuing dying arts without embalming them—is signaled early and deepens when wax hardens and names wash away. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: choosing bread-baking over cataloging, then selecting artifacts via the lens. A meaningful tightening occurs when Senka reveals the lens selects what endures—raising stakes from preservation to curation-as-sacrifice. Cost is unmistakable: the Curator shoulders “nectar armor,” sweet but unbearable, and accepts cyclical exile to feed history outward.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—escaping fate’s design—is signaled early and deepens through the revelation of catastrophic costs in alternate timelines, especially the keeper’s death. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: he reverse-engineers the yoyo, offers blood, aligns gears. The meaningful tightening occurs when he sees the keeper’s thread and chooses her over transcendence—a trade-off with irreversible emotional cost. Under an Accumulative lens, the deepening comes through layered revelations of consequence, not causal turns, and the cost (“bleak exhilaration,” “iron aftertaste”) is unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—tricking fear into revealing its weakness—is signaled early and deepens through paradox as method. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: writing contradictory definitions, unbosoming truth, refusing to blink. The tightening occurs when the shadow gags on “door,” exposing its vulnerability to unswerving attention. Cost is unmistakable: the funhouse seals behind them, and identity is restored only through confrontation, not escape.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—survival through sonic transformation—is signaled early and tightens when the gale’s “white teeth” threaten to swallow the circle. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each dub, strike, and lattice placement reweights danger into rhythm. The cost is visible in the knife-net hazard and the physical toll implied by “restless euphony of repairs.” Coincidence never resolves; the bees arrive because Zaya summons overtones “like bees,” and they come—a magical realism earned by internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—answering what the watchers see—is signaled early and deepens when the ledger reveals the mother’s fate. The tightening occurs at the crack: discovery of the copper tag forces a choice (turn back only if called; no voice calls). Agency drives escalation: protagonist reads the lattice aloud, provoking the watchers’ turn. Cost is legible: stepping into glare means risking thinning into silence, like the expedition.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—rescuing truth from lies—is signaled early and deepens when the ledger reveals “passengers” struck out for “shipments.” Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: turning pages, opening lockers, copying names. The meaningful tightening occurs when pattern recognition (“tulips match April strike”) transforms data into moral reckoning. Cost is unmistakable: the historian chooses truth without contempt, knowing it may reopen wounds, yet delivers the ledger so “grief [can] finish its interrupted sentence.”

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—bearing witness to drowned memory—is signaled early and deepens through the surveyor’s method: each note placement forecloses anonymity for the lost. Escalation is driven by his agency (unrolling charts, copying names), not coincidence, and tightens when he finds the program—forcing a choice between preservation and inscription. Cost is felt in the “hushed blaze”: restraint as sacrifice, with no rescue or recognition promised.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.2)
    The dominant stake—tracing honest origins in a city that falsifies memory—is signaled early and deepens when ledger discrepancies reveal deliberate submersion. Ossa’s agency drives escalation: she chooses darkness, deciphers redacted minutes, and stamps margins, each act narrowing options. The cost is conceptual but undeniable—the city’s foundational lie exposed—and forecloses any return to “rehearsed” history.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—reconciling detached shadow through grief-made-light—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: he chooses vapor over paper cranes, steeps ribbon leaves, tucks heat-read apologies into wings. Each act narrows options (paper too heavy; only glass and breath will do) and deepens cost (eyes sting, hands remember shapes blindly). The abbess’s instruction (“brew cranes from vapor”) isn’t rescue but constraint that forces innovation. Coincidence never resolves; the shadow’s return is earned through accumulated ritual, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—harvesting unused potential—is signaled early and tightens when the basin appears, forcing the protagonist to perturb current and send coordinates despite knowing the commander won’t grasp the price. Escalation is driven by agency: small pushes reveal hidden terms, culminating in the decision to mark and transmit. Cost is unmistakable—the hush required for pooling, the solitude of being the only one who understands—and it directly charges the final image of uplift without mercy. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, deepening through sensory and conceptual density.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—decoding belonging’s frequency—is signaled early and deepens when blanks become rests, not errors. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: adjusting the algorithm to read silence reshapes tactics and narrows options (from mapping to listening). Cost is unmistakable—the pilgrim’s exile, the pilot’s perpetual surprise now calibrated for kindness—and crystallizes in the Charged Poise of folding the paper under the tongue. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from character choice under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—truth versus protective falsehood—is signaled early (“manufacture false memories to suit their wants”) and deepens when Mara demands origins “where your false lineage first touched sand.” Protagonist agency drives escalation: he chooses to return to the shore, kneel in surf, confess forgery. Cost is unmistakable—the loss of professional identity, the burden of kept truth—and crystallizes in the decision to burn lies but preserve one name. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each carved plank narrows options until only restitution remains.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—exchanging prisoners without reigniting war—is signaled early and tightens when the second trade “snagged on a name.” Protagonist agency drives escalation: halting processions, invoking shared history, holding up the tarnished pull to halt rising tempers. Cost is unmistakable: emotional labor, exposure of vulnerability (“If we can open old things…”), and the implicit risk of failure. The moon-phase method isn’t just backdrop—it shaped three prior postponements, making tonight’s success fragile and high-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reconciling regret with usefulness—is signaled early and tightens when the boy’s urgency forces action. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he chooses to help despite believing himself unfit. Cost is unmistakable in the father’s sweat-shining wrists and the narrator’s burned chest, altering tactics from avoidance to engagement. Coincidence (the boy appearing) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the poles and his skill do.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming empathy in a numbed city—is signaled early and tightens when the narrator confronts his engineered slogans. Agency drives escalation: he chooses doors, speaks truth, accepts risk over lies. Cost is unmistakable: the ledger’s weight loss signifies relinquished self-absolution. The caretaker’s test (“pay with risk, not with lies”) crystallizes pressure into a single, high-stakes act with irreversible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reforging a bond beyond death—is signaled early and tightens via the reluctant metamorphosis: the price shifts from ash-and-seeds to voice and selfhood. Agency drives escalation—the narrator chooses to open the seam, accepts refraction over subtraction. Cost is unmistakable (“lose the plain speech of markets”) and shapes the final stance. Coincidence never resolves; pressure accumulates through sensory invocation and beastly witness until the bridge of breaths forms.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost time through atonement—is signaled early and tightens when the saucer crack demands pilgrimage, narrowing options to ritual or resignation. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to unfasten the mobile, climb, perform confessions, each act foreclosing passive regret. Cost is unmistakable: each named omission (unbraided hair, unheard cough) releases a stalled second, and the final stance (“ready to be willingly perplexed forever”) accepts ongoing failure as the price of presence. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of gestures replaces linear causality.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—opening the dimension without force—is signaled early and tightens through the lock’s weight-sensitive mechanism. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: stitching self, naming shadows, calibrating joy amid grief. Cost is unmistakable: enduring wolves in the head while making room for joy, a trade-off that enables the hatch’s rotation. The lock’s refusal of “half-life” raises stakes, forcing integration over evasion.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—extracting panic from the village—is signaled early and deepens when Mara chooses “useful kindness” over myth. Escalation occurs through her agency: arranging bottles, directing listening, scripting evacuation as “rhythm instead of sirens.” Cost is unmistakable: she sacrifices recognition (pretending not to hear her name in thanks) to preserve communal calm. Coincidence complicates (kite snaps, engine sputters) but resolution stems from her pre-laid structure, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—shifting institutional power from surveillance to service—is signaled early and deepens when the blackout creates opportunity. The meaningful tightening occurs at Captain Rhun’s entrance: his potential opposition forces the sentinel to crystallize their stance (“I am the lock, the sentinel, and the door that learns”), raising the cost from personal risk to collective legitimacy. Agency drives escalation: the sentinel’s calm inventiveness (using mother’s quill, reading sundial angles) directly enables each turn. Coincidence (the blackout) complicates but doesn’t resolve; victory comes through earned persuasion, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—rescuing a displaced brother by learning the sea’s grammar—tightens when rescue demands participation in sacred patterns, then deepens into stewardship. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he agrees to “more than rescue,” braces the aperture, and later swears to continue the work. Cost is legible at every turn: the eel herder’s exile, the brother’s near-perpetual sliding, the narrator’s shift from burning promise to breathing craft. Friction’s absence isn’t gimmick but a live constraint shaping all motion and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the “cartography of scars”—tightens when the poet matches lightning strikes to urban wounds, transforming passive receipt of the letter into active mapping. The deepening occurs when they recognize their own scar on the chart, raising stakes from curiosity to identity. Agency drives escalation: pressing the timer, speaking the forbidden poem, tracing the constellation. Cost is felt in erased verses and historical erasure, paid forward as courage that “echoes.”

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the courier’s message—is signaled early and deepens when Rook claims it resolves to “ignorance.” Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: aligning the needle, stepping into Rook’s lunge, insisting doors “cannot be fenced.” Cost is unmistakable: intellectual combat yields to collaborative entry, foreclosing adversarial resolution. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each reflection incrementally assembles the overture until the shadow-map demands travel over victory.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—forging beauty from anarchy before personal dissolution—is signaled early and tightens when the demolition notice surfaces, forcing immediate action. Agency drives escalation: the protagonists don’t wait for permission but summon strangers, wire lanterns, string poems. Cost is unmistakable—their labor occurs under threat of sirens, using busted tarps and outlaw glue—and culminates in a stance crystallized by Lio’s declaration: “Beauty is not a treaty… but a practice.” The deepening isn’t plot-based but accumulative: disorder becomes “an index of need,” raising the conceptual price of inaction.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—freedom from mechanized time—is signaled early and deepens when the film reel opens a portal, narrowing options to a single arbor stage. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: he threads the reel, climbs, tunes steps to compasses, and plays against the schedule “with gentle insistence.” Cost is unmistakable: the delayed last train proves his defiance reached the timetable, altering real-world logistics. Coincidence (misdelivered reel) complicates but doesn’t resolve; victory comes through his wager-like performance.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—protecting cultural memory from erasure—is signaled early and deepens when Iru reveals shared dreams, raising the cost from solitary duty to intergenerational trust. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: interpreting dreams, testing pelican omens, choosing the hollow. The monsoon clock forces a trade-off: plant now or lose everything to “rumor running downhill.” Final cost is felt—the protagonist yields authority, accepting that memory must be co-held, not policed. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, intensifying through sensory testimony rather than external antagonism.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—finding the color of unspoken apologies—is signaled early and deepens through the lace-reading ritual, which narrows options from passive drift to active vocalization. The tightening occurs when the compass leads to the cove of “unkempt bonsai,” forcing confrontation with past failure (“swallowed the words like seawater”). Cost is unmistakable: years of silence, abandoned students, internalized regret. Agency drives escalation—the narrator chooses to speak, obey the lace-map, and redefine teaching—under coherent Accumulative pressure.
