  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake: managing catastrophe as data rather than emotional deluge. One clear tightening occurs when his preprocessed overlay falters, forcing acknowledgment of "pointless beauty" and undercutting his defensive objectivity. The final act—allowing wing dust to transfer to his fingertip—represents agency through attention and acceptance, foreclosing the path of pure detachment. The cost is legible: he loses the protective distance his implant provided. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as layered observations deepen emotional exposure. A second, more pronounced reversal would elevate this further, but the single deepening is sufficient and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is survival and understanding the smugglers' route, signaled early. One meaningful tightening: waiting for dawn to reveal the thermal tracks narrows her options from paralysis to purposeful pursuit. Agency is renunciation of blind flight and endurance through the coldest hours, with visible cost (cold, stiff joints, three days of shock). The escalation is textural—accumulating sensory pressure and conceptual depth—rather than multiple reversals, which fits the inferred Accumulative lens. However, the peak choice (to follow the tracks) feels inevitable once revealed rather than a trade-off between competing goods, limiting the upper band.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—saving the orchids from thermal decay—is signaled early and pursued throughout. Elian's agency is visible (selecting the rod, striking glass, waving the baton) but reads as competent application of a familiar method without a meaningful tightening or trade-off; he encounters no resistance, makes no difficult choice between competing goods, and the orchids respond immediately. The capsize memory surfaces as a brief internal threat but does not alter his tactics or impose cost. Escalation is minimal: the flowers flicker, he acts, they stabilize—a single pressure point without a turn that narrows options or a deepening that changes stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—achieving silence to end psychic interference—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when Silas slots the lens, forcing alignment with "impossible geometry," and the beam erupts to acknowledge the signal. Agency is present: his decision to repair the beacon, not merely witness it, ends the loop. Visible cost is the three-day journey and physical forcing of the mechanism. However, the escalation is more atmospheric than decision-driven; no live alternative or competing pressure complicates the climax, and the resolution feels mechanically smooth rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—community survival under embargo—is signaled early and remains coherent. Yet no meaningful tightening occurs: the food arrives on schedule, the ritual proceeds without friction, and Elara resumes her vigil unchanged. The piece declares tension ("critical," "dangerous," "treacherous") but never dramatizes a reversal, complication, or trade-off that narrows options. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening or cadence shift is sufficient, but the final beat replicates the opening without reweighting cost or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—is signaled early and drives Silas's pilgrimage. The spirit's arrival introduces a secondary pressure (her self-blame thorns), and the breath-matching sequence narrows options: he must synchronize respiration to reveal her true wound. The healing act (channeling stored love through the camera) serves as the key turn, yet it unfolds without visible trade-off or resistance; Silas succeeds on the first attempt with no cost beyond feeling "lighter." The resolution is driven by protagonist agency under a Causal lens, but the absence of a live obstacle or failed attempt keeps escalation smooth rather than jagged.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: escape retrocognitive prison by discovering time's texture. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency—theft, weaving, fragment insertion—and the cost (shattering trauma images, weeping) is legible on the page. One meaningful tightening occurs when the bridge enters "quaking reverie" and the photographs warp under geometric pressure, narrowing options to the final shove. The halo fragment's "holy, dangerous resonance" signals risk, and the disintegration sequence delivers visible consequence. No multiple reversals, but the single deepening suffices for this length under the Hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—protecting the seed vault from destruction—is signaled early and tightens through the wall breach, looter arrival, and final sealing. One meaningful escalation: Elias must complete the arrow-twist while intruders round the corner with weapons drawn, raising immediate mortal cost. The price is legible: he faces execution knowing his children-will-eat calculus has succeeded. Minor softness: the decoding sequence proceeds without error or complication, and the automated systems engage flawlessly, reducing friction in the middle passage.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—completing the imprint to detect betrayal's sound—is signaled early. Pressure is biological (mitosis timeframe) and tonal (aurora crescendo), but all moves succeed without meaningful tightening or tradeoff. The cells accept the data, the imprint completes, and Elara leans back exhausted; no reversal, no price paid that narrows later options. Under the Accumulative lens, one intensification is sufficient, but the ritual proceeds without friction or a turn that reweights cost.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—capturing and processing an illuminated moment—is signaled early and tightens when the moonbeams reveal the man's gaze aimed at her. That reversal raises existential pressure (she's been seen across time), but Elara's agency in the final beat is passive observation rather than a decision with visible cost. Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful deepening occurs, yet the lack of a trade-off or tactical shift in response to the discovery holds this in mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—craft safe zones for inquiry vs. physical survival—is signaled early and tightens through environmental escalation (glacier calving, floor tilt). The abandonment decision narrows options with visible cost: the largest dome remains as monument, tools slide away, sanctuary becomes tomb. Agency is clear in the final descent. Minor limitation: the regime's punishment and the valley's need for "clarity" remain somewhat abstract; the trade-off between perfecting craft and delivering it gains urgency but could show sharper immediate consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—survive the five-minute incineration countdown—is signaled immediately via Julian's transmitted threat. The escalation tightens through Elias's panicked observation → decrypt attempt → "Two minutes" pressure → the inversion choice that forecloses escape but secures survival. Agency is clear: his decision to invert sanctuary protocols (not flee) directly alters the outcome. The cost is visible on the page: he trades freedom from enclosure for safety, ending "still terrified of the dark" but alive while Julian is exposed to exterior flame.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—completing the map before total entropy—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the last star extinguishes, forcing the final placement of the gold flake. Elara's agency is renunciation and endurance: she chooses to walk into the night with the map complete, forecloses the path of hesitation or despair. Cost is on the page: she loses all light, wraps herself in eternal silence, and accepts the void. No explicit antagonist, but the encroaching dark and storm provide situational pressure appropriate to the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—completing the cleanup before tomorrow's wedding—is signaled early and provides structural pressure. The ghost-absorption task offers a single meaningful tightening (consolidating paradoxes into the violin), but 734 executes it without complication, error, or trade-off. His philosophical search for the "origin of the soul" runs parallel but never collides with the custodial duty; he simply completes both without sacrifice. The tone reads as "mundane mysticism," which suits the concept, yet the lack of a visible price or foreclosed option keeps escalation in the functional band rather than high.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—clearing Elian's name and restoring trust—is signaled early and tightens through Mara's defensive shields and his decision to reveal the illicit collection. The lens demonstration reverses her suspicion in one meaningful beat, forcing a trade-off: she must accept complicity to understand his intent. Agency is decision and shared burden (pocketing the tickets), with visible cost (both now carry the crime). The tightening is protagonist-driven: Elian's transparency forecloses secrecy and transforms their relationship. No coincidence resolves; the turn is earned by his confession and her willingness to look.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear: proving that intentional care, not measurable luck, sustains the garden. Pressure tightens when Elian's silence and ritual confront the sub-prefect's prediction of "total necrosis." The marble-polishing and cairn-building are goal-driven actions under constraint (narrow sunlight window, ambient "luck quotient" at zero). The leaf's visible revival and the sub-prefect's flustered "anomaly" constitute a meaningful reversal with on-page consequence. Cost is legible in Elian's decades-long penance and the elaborate ritual itself, which forecloses easier paths.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—proving sideways time—is signaled in paragraph two and sustained through the device activation. One meaningful tightening: the lever pull narrows Elian's options from hope to proof, then the magnetic drift collapses the window, forcing the choice to keep the secret or reveal it. His agency at closure (releasing the lever, picking up the wrench, planning tomorrow's compliance) forecloses the traveler path with visible cost. The temptation to step sideways with the Weavers adds moral weight to his renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: unravel the Maestro's code. One meaningful tightening occurs when the water turns unnaturally still, creating a lock that Elias must disrupt with a violent splash—a protagonist-driven reversal that narrows options. The resolution (finding the baton) is earned by his method and persistence. However, the final gesture (raising the baton in acknowledgment) lacks a visible tradeoff; the "conversation finished" lands as thematic summary rather than a choice with felt cost. Agency reads as discovery and ritual rather than decision that forecloses a live path.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—prevent market crash and panic while honoring programming constraints—is signaled early and coheres under pressure. The smudge action provides one meaningful tightening that narrows Elias's options (he cannot speak or delete the truth directly, so he contaminates the margins). The ending articulates a visible cost: Elias becomes the sole witness to the approaching catastrophe, bearing "the crushing solitude of his position." The price is felt in the final image. However, the escalation reads as a single decisive move rather than layered tightening; the system's vulnerability to "subtle contextual cues" is told more than tested through prior resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding if negligence leaves a heavier stain than malice—is signaled early and drives every beat. Pressure tightens when the caller confesses on the radio, the transmission cuts, and the mill's "ghost shift" silence presses against Silas's eardrums, forcing him into a trance state where he feels the truth. The sealed valve provides the answer with visible cost: he realizes his own mistake mirrors the one frozen in the wheel. Agency is protagonist-driven (he chooses to appraise the valve, interprets the radio, and completes his judgment), and the final burden is reweighted but not erased.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara's need to reach the refuge before the rising water—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens. The swelling river provides one meaningful tightening that forces the origami-swan action. However, escalation is low-tension; the protagonist's response is assured and contemplative rather than conflicted. The cost at closure (abandoning her keeper role) is conceptual and legible but lacks dramatized struggle or trade-off that would raise the stakes into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: pierce Elara's dementia fog during the eclipse window. Pressure accumulates through the eclipse countdown, converging elements, and Elias's timed intervention. The placement of the curl and the spoken cue ("Feel the softness") create one meaningful tightening that narrows the therapeutic window to totality. Agency resides with Elias (timing, object, music); Elara's response is reactive but earned. The cost is felt (the moment is transient, the magic fades with the eclipse) but not explicitly forecloses a path; the "session was over" closure suggests repeatability rather than irreversible change (−0.3). No escalation friction; the stakes deepen organically under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—recovering the story of humanity's last dream—is signaled early and pursued throughout. Pressure accumulates through the astronomer's diaries and the tapestry revelation, which reweights the artifact from decorative to scientific. However, Elian's agency is primarily receptive; he reads, understands, and departs without a visible trade-off or foreclosed path. The "duty fulfilled" line asserts completion but the on-page cost to Elian is unclear. One meaningful deepening (tapestry as instrument) fits the accumulative lens but lacks a second tightening or a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Arthur's need to sever ties and escape the prophetic curse—is signaled early and coherent under the situational-causal lens. Pressure tightens when he decides to "orchestrate a grand finale" and acts by manually redirecting the lighthouse beam, a choice driven by his agency. However, the escalation is compressed: the prophetic examples are recounted backstory, and the peak action (beam manipulation) arrives swiftly without intermediate reversals or visible trade-offs that narrow options on the page. The resolution forecloses his role as relay, but the cost (network retaliation, survival risk, isolation consequence) remains abstract. One meaningful deepening is present, meeting the 600–800 word threshold, yet the felt price at closure could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—Elias's autonomy before possession completes—is signaled early and tightens through escalating sonic interventions. Each rhetorical loop (chiasmus, antithesis, hyperbole/litotes) narrows the entity's grip, and the climax ("Who is the master...?") shatters the hold with visible cost: the Vantablack loses power, Elias lurches free. Agency belongs to Kellen; Elias's passivity reduces the felt stakes slightly. The timeframe ("before the possession completes") creates urgency but is more asserted than tracked on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (aligning soul by capturing the universe's inaudible music) is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through texture: the heavy eyelids create a time constraint, the grease-pencil mapping externalizes method, the shell試行 demonstrates mechanics, and the mirrored horizon supplies the convergent visual condition. One meaningful deepening: when dawn strikes and he conducts, friction and resonance combine into the transcendent chord, narrowing all prior preparation into a singular sensory-emotional payoff. Agency operates as endurance and precision under exhaustion; the "chronologically homesick" trait drives tactics. Cost is felt (years of toil, isolation, the ache finally lifting) but could be more viscerally rendered as a trade-off in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—"conquer the labyrinth of self"—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the tablet crumbles, forcing Elara to rely on will alone. Her leftward turn over the abyss is a high-cost choice that narrows options (trust ancient logic vs. deny senses), and the final act of releasing buoyancy is protagonist-driven with visible consequence: timelines fuse and she becomes "singular, heavy." The price is legible—she loses the defiance that has sustained her and accepts crushing reality. One opportunity missed: the myriad dissolving Elaras are vivid but do not force a mid-story tightening; they remain illustrative rather than interactive obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—breaking paralyzing numbness—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure escalates through the Accumulative lens: the backward symphony generates increasing tactile violence (tremor, grinding, tightening filament) that forces the emotional dam to fracture. The protagonist's agency is clear (he rigs the turntable, lowers the needle, becomes a conduit). One meaningful tightening occurs when the filament tightens against his chest, squeezing out indifference, leading to the gasped release. Cost is visible: numbness replaced by "raw, aching sorrow," a painful but necessary trade. No secondary complication or false move tests his commitment; the arc is linear intensification rather than reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preserve records and escape pursuit—is signaled early and escalates cleanly under the causal lens: bolt the gate → gate breaks → climb laterally → reach safety while instruments are destroyed. The lateral traverse is a protagonist-driven choice with visible cost (loss of her station, her life's work smashed below). One meaningful tightening forecloses the straight-up climb option, and the final cost is legible: she has traded her physical sanctuary for the data she carries. Agency is present throughout, and coincidence (the pigeon's arrival) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—grasping "the texture of time" versus maintaining tethered existence—is signaled early and escalates through one meaningful tightening: the rope begins to smoke, forcing the impossible choice. Agency is clear: Silas's hand-scraping uncovers the temporal layer, and his withdrawal is a renunciation with visible cost (destroying the pattern, walking away "composing a new line about the beauty of the unfinished"). The energy beings complicate by intensifying their glow, but they do not directly test his resolve; the rope's fraying does. No antagonist needed; the escalation derives from protagonist action under the chosen Hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—unbinding the silence to sustain communal memory—is signaled early and remains coherent. The chronic hush acts as persistent opposition, pressing against the glass. The escalation occurs when Elara's perceptive hearing finds the dome's resonant frequency, turning the structure into an amplifier; this tightening narrows her tactic (melody stripped to profound space between notes) and charges the final image. The cost is visible: the melody remains unresolved, and the ritual must recur. Agency is decision and endurance, with the final renunciation of resolution foreclosing easy comfort.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can survive her grief—is signaled early and tightens once: she inhales, the scent binds to receptors, and the panic is replaced by synthetic peace. The tightening forecloses the path of raw devastation with a visible cost (authentic emotion traded for fabricated nostalgia). Agency is present but passive: Elara's choice is surrender ("tilting her head back in a gesture of surrender"), and Silas observes rather than struggles. The escalation is legible and the cost clear ("the illusion absolute"), but the single turn and observational stance place this in the solid mid-7s rather than higher.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—returning the locket to honor a moral obligation—is signaled early and drives Elias's approach. Pressure is coherent under the Situational lens: his hesitation, the delivery, her reaction. However, there is no meaningful escalation or tightening; the encounter unfolds smoothly without reversal or complication. The resolution (her gratitude, his invitation accepted) feels warm but lacks a visible trade-off or foreclosed path. One tightening moment (her guarded expression softening) deepens the emotional charge but does not narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (grafting onto community) is signaled early and pursued throughout. Elara's compassionate intervention with the boy is a meaningful micro-turn that softens the group, and her woven offering at the arbor tightens the bond. Yet the escalation is linear without a visible trade-off or foreclosed alternative: no tactic fails, no resource is spent that alters later moves. The final acceptance feels awarded rather than fought for, lowering the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—capture the echo before the giant wakes—is signaled early and tightens when the interrupted cadence threatens the borrowed hour. Agency is clear: Elara activates the pendant, climbs, uncages the echo, and sketches under mounting pressure. The cost is visible (aging, hot pendant, chaotic tide). One meaningful escalation when her stasis cracks. No coincidental resolution; her choices drive every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—calculating his daughter's emotional coordinates—is signaled early and sustained. The ritual provides one tightening: glass eyes align, fluid glows, image appears. However, escalation is thin: no live choice complicates the attempt, no cost is paid before the climax, and the outcome (seeing a meadow) doesn't foreclose an earlier option or force a trade-off on the page. The "ambiguous loss remained" line tells us stakes persist but doesn't show what Silas renounces or risks next.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—Elias's desire to bridge invisibility and become providence—is signaled early. The finding of the tape tightens pressure by offering a concrete opportunity; the caching choice narrows his options (risk proximity or retreat). The librarian's discovery provides the resolution under Causal lens, with his "heavy cloak of isolation" dissolving as cost. One clear tightening and choice sequence drives escalation. Weakness: the librarian's need is told ("wept over in frustration") rather than dramatized in prior on-page action, so the stakes she brings feel asserted. The cost at closure is visible but leans emotional rather than tactical or relational.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (survival versus identity as scientist) is signaled early and tightens through escalating pain when Elias tries to force control. The reversal—"his frantic attempt to reconstruct his old self was the very thing killing him"—is motivated by prior causality and forecloses the reconstruction path. Releasing the leaf is agency as renunciation with visible cost (abandoning research). Storm season frames urgency but does not supply a ticking clock that alters tactics within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (capturing decay's hue vs. surviving) signals early and tightens through one decisive reversal: the exchange. Elias's agency drives the turn—he trades his lifeline for the amber, forecloses survival, and commits to a new subject. The cost is immediate and visible (unclipping the filter). Situational pressure (rising tide, storm, exhaustion) coheres and the resolution is earned by his choice under that pressure. No coincidence resolves; the scavenger's presence complicates but does not solve.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: Elara's encounter with an unpredictable magic that defies her structured prophecy. The shadow-merge moment meaningfully tightens pressure, narrowing her epistemology and forcing the withdrawal choice. However, the escalation mechanism—"unseen forces" that slip through the shadow doorway—arrives conveniently late and resolves the tension by broadcasting mundane-joy images rather than testing Elara's agency against a concrete obstacle. Kael's arrival and the pearl's revelation feel more situational complication than protagonist-driven reversal. Cost is conceptual (abandoning her grand-vision practice) but the physical or relational price remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear: bridge the silence before it hardens into permanent alienation. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elian sees the "terrifying quiet not as peace, but as a fracture" and runs to the mechanism. The staggered-interval choice (not "one long blast") is a visible tactical decision with immediate consequence—heads lift, shoulders drop. Agency is decision and execution; the cost is legible in the shift from solitary archivist to communal voice-maker. The Accumulative lens holds: pressure builds through gathered detail, then releases in the sonic sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reaching the Fortress and confronting an unspoken truth—is signaled early and drives all movement. One meaningful tightening occurs at the chasm where "there was no bridge," forcing Elara to use the punch tool in an impossible act that narrows options and tests commitment. The final choice to shatter the jar forecloses her prior defense mechanism with stated cost. However, the escalation feels more linear than pressured: each obstacle (arrows, fog, chasm, jar) is solved in sequence without complicating choices or forcing visible trade-offs between competing goods. Agency is present but the path feels preordained rather than earned through difficult decisions under competing pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake is signaled early (archive before demolition) and deepens when Elara realizes the data holds emotional coordinates; her motivation shifts from mere cataloging to sanctuary-building. The tightening is a single, meaningful choice under the Accumulative lens: she resumes work despite academic risk. However, the escalation is more internal realization than external pressure—no antagonist tests her resolve, and the council's mockery remains off-stage. The cost (academic standing, community judgment) is declared but not dramatized; we don't see her forego a safer option or face a concrete trade-off on the page, keeping this in the mid-7s rather than high band.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: discovering what happens after goodbye. The spatial mutiny and solar storm apply external pressure; Elian's agency drives escalation by dragging magnetic fields through the shielding, applying torque, and cracking the fragment. The ritual constitutes a meaningful tightening that narrows options (the dimension tries to eject him; he persists) and a decisive deepening when the fissure opens, revealing "cessation of geometry" rather than a landscape. The final step into dissolution forecloses the observer stance with visible cost (atom-by-atom unraveling). Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres and the cost is unmistakable. One credible reversal (fragment cracks, fissure opens) alters tactics and leads to resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—Elena's asylum—is signaled early, and the scene tightens when Vance arrives with a rejection form. Julian's gambit (offering the ink) is a clear tactical move, and Vance's signing creates a reversal. However, the escalation hinges on the ink's magic rather than protagonist agency; Julian does not face a genuine dilemma or trade-off on the page, only satisfaction afterward. The cost to Vance is visible ("terrified by the sudden softness of his own heart"), but the lack of price paid by Julian or friction in his plan keeps pressure from deepening meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: capture the sensory texture of a nonexistent neon-rain era before the gold hardens. Pressure accumulates through timing constraints ("too soon...too late") and the lamp's wavering pitch, forcing disciplined micro-choices. The resolution—successful embedding—is earned by her preparation and real-time adjustments. Under the Accumulative lens, the tightening is sufficient (one meaningful intensification when the hum dips), but the lack of a visible trade-off or foreclosed alternative at closure keeps this mid-range. Agency is present but the cost is conceptual (guardian of false memories) rather than felt as loss on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: honoring forgotten histories through ritual reconstruction. The method is signaled early and applied in full to the poison label, creating one meaningful turn when auditory fragments coat the paper with "invisible weight." Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as density increase—voice layering intensifies from whisper to laughter to synthesized despair. However, no live option is foreclosed; the narrator faces no competing pressure or trade-off. The placement ritual lands with conceptual cost (perpetual exile) but the beat itself proceeds unopposed, capping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—decode whether the universe has narrative or chaos—is signaled in paragraph one and remains coherent. The cello's resonant hums coalesce into the ephemeral compass, which forces Elias to hear the subtext of past conversations; that tightening drives his decision to retell his life "correcting every lie." The cost is legible: he surrenders his skeptic identity and shouts his cowardice and loneliness as the world ends. One meaningful deepening fits the Accumulative lens and this length.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—forestalling privatization by rendering zoning maps obsolete—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening: the stone placement raises the cost from clever repositioning to legal gambit with "precious time in international court." Agency is clear: Elara's decisions (graffiti coordinates, stone wedging) drive the reorganization and foreclose the path of passive submission. The cost is legible: "dangerous dual allegiance," risk of "immediate legal seizure," and the families' "hopeful desperation" as they pack heirlooms. The tugboat response and city pivot feel somewhat automatic once signaled, reducing friction slightly; the plan executes smoothly without complication or setback that would test Elara's resolve further.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—photographing the last natural lunar night before perpetual artificial light—is signaled early and tightens through physical endurance (cold, drones, the chemical countdown). Elias's agency is clear: he chooses to remain exposed and unauthorized, using the sand grain to stay focused. One meaningful escalation occurs when the chemical strip turns crimson (ten seconds to the event), forcing the shutter click at the precise moment. The cost, however, is primarily conceptual (the loss itself) rather than a visible personal sacrifice that alters Elias's later options or forecloses a concrete path.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—restore the drone before the Aethelgard launches—is signaled early and the ticking clock (anchor lifting, engines roaring, shadow crossing) provides coherent external pressure. Escalation occurs once: the diagnostic reveals misalignment, which Elias corrects via firmware patch. No on-page reversal complicates the attempt; the repair proceeds linearly without error or trade-off. Agency is present (Elias initiates each step) but uncontested; coincidence does not intrude, yet neither does meaningful resistance. The resolution feels efficient rather than earned through struggle, and no visible price is paid—stamina, time, social capital, or materials remain undiminished. The cost is conceptual (his ongoing isolation) but not foregrounded or reweighted by the success.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—find the metaphysical source of rivers—is signaled early and pursued with embodied actions (dog-ear touch, breath exhale). One meaningful deepening occurs when the condensation map reveals convergence, transforming the quest from geographic search to atmospheric insight. The final renunciation (not recording coordinates) forecloses publication and commodification with visible cost. Minor issue: the falcon's signal is convenient timing rather than a tactic-altering pressure; Silas's response is passive acknowledgment, and no prior constraint or price shapes how he approaches the discovery moment.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—prevent structural collapse via restored communal rhythm—is signaled early and maintained. The tightening occurs when Silas steps into the road and orchestrates the miners' cadence, producing the archway's stabilization. However, the miners' compliance is passive; no meaningful opposition or cost shapes Silas's choices. The "inevitable collapse" is declared but deferred, so the stakes feel more thematic than urgent, and no on-page price is paid for this temporary success.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (preserve the psychic archive) is signaled immediately and sustained. Oxygen depletion creates escalating pressure that narrows options beat by beat. The coral-choked interface forces a meaningful tightening: she must work slowly despite the clock, a trade-off with visible cost. Elara's agency drives resolution—her refusal to inflate the vest and her manual unsnarling of cables. The final act (pouring the vial) is protagonist-driven. Cost is unmistakable: hypoxia → unconsciousness → death.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—escaping before the discovery of drowned sailors turns him into a scapegoat—is signaled but never materializes as on-page pressure; no warden confronts him, no clock tightens, no failed attempt narrows options. The escape method (metaphysical door, hovering) appears without prior struggle or visible cost; luck and setting physics resolve the problem the protagonist did not help create. No meaningful escalation occurs under any lens; pressure remains static from the setup to the convenient exit.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—Julian's terminal sickness and his need for the cure—is signaled early and drives the scene's goal pursuit. The ghost's appearance and the exchange tighten options by making the debt payment final and severing the link, which narrows Julian's future (no more guardian, no fallback). However, the escalation proceeds without meaningful opposition or complication; Julian arrives, performs the ritual, and receives the cure as expected. The cost is legible at closure (survival purchased with irreversible loss), but the path to that cost lacks a turn or resistant pressure that would force a trade-off under duress. Agency is present in the decision to come and offer the bead, but the scene's pressure is more situational than choice-driven once he enters.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—restore the fractured wharf to reverse civic fatalism—is signaled early and held throughout. Pressure accumulates through the physical peril of sleepwalking acrobatics on crumbling ledges and the ideological clash with elders who claim decay is divine will. The trance mechanic, however, removes moment-to-moment agency: Elara does not make tactical choices under stress but executes a pre-memorized pattern while unconscious. Cost is visible in her collapse and the "terrifying display," yet the peak action unfolds without protagonist decision-making, reducing escalation to endurance rather than choice-driven narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (restore faith / bridge past to present) is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through discovery (sundial fragments) and reconstruction, with one meaningful tightening: the act of reassembly becomes a literal "stitching a wound." Agency is present but passive—Elara's work is patient and deliberate rather than fraught with reversals or live trade-offs. The cost is conceptual (time, solitude, patience) but not legibly dramatized as a forfeiture on the page; we do not see what she sacrifices or risks losing during the week of sieving. No antagonist or external friction complicates the escalation, which under an Accumulative lens is acceptable, but the final turn ("the light had returned") resolves without visible price beyond effort.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—creating a pseudonym to bypass censors—is signaled early but never tested. Elian encounters no complication: the chalk code is readable, the name comes easily, the letter is written without friction. The piece declares urgency ("rush") yet the narrative proceeds at one tempo with no tightening, reversal, or trade-off. No agency-driven turn narrows options or raises cost; the protagonist simply executes a plan. The stated risk (data center dismantling, courier peril) remains abstract and off-page. Escalation under the Accumulative lens would require density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake—neither occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: prevent Kael's coup by encoding the trap into the map. One clear tightening (two-day launch deadline) raises cost. Lysa's agency—choosing to thread the warning rather than comply—drives escalation under the causal lens. The final cost is legible (her continued subterfuge, the coup beginning "soon") but remains conceptual; we do not see the map challenged or Lysa's next move, so the price feels more projected than paid on the page. The middle ritual beat (synchronizing needle to flame frequency) adds texture but doesn't narrow options beyond the initial decision.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding the silence of that night—is signaled early and tightens when the condensation reveals "Don't go, I am screaming it inside." That discovery narrows Julian's options from passive regret to active response. However, the escalation is largely external (moonlight arrives on cue, Elara performs) rather than driven by Julian's choices under pressure; he does not wrestle or sacrifice on the page to earn the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: can Elias intercede in Leo's trauma narrative before it calcifies? The tightening occurs when he realizes the mother's warning can be transformed, forcing the choice to alter the artifact. Agency is enacted through the pen strokes that change "hide yourself" into "hold yourself," forecloses his detached translator role, and accepts vulnerability as cost. One meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens, with the price legible in his trembling hand and final breathing shift.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—rediscovering creative joy—is signaled early and tightens once: Elara's initial frustration gives way to the realization that paradox is "exactly what she needed." However, escalation is gentle; no reversal narrows her options or forces a trade-off with visible cost. The "final flourish" is a display choice, not a decision under pressure. Agency is present (she chooses to dance, to layer history into light) but coincidence does not test her—she succeeds without friction. The ending delivers satisfaction but no felt price on the page, capping the score mid-band under Accumulative lens allowances.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—exchanging certainty for curiosity—is signaled in the opening and tested through the nested awakenings. Each layer (fresco, boxcar, sound-wave void) deepens the protagonist's exposure to uncertainty, culminating in the relief of "the heavy coat of knowing dissolved." The escalation is tonal and conceptual rather than causal, fitting the Accumulative lens. One meaningful tightening occurs: the infinite echo "began to decay, losing energy," which collapses the void back into the garden and forecloses the dream state. The final reply crystallizes the transformed stance with a visible trade-off (comfort of certainty for the beauty of the question), though the lack of on-page struggle during the awakenings slightly mutes the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—evading the Thought Police and deploying the seed—is clear, but escalation is thin: the raid was "inevitable" and "not a surprise," draining urgency. Julian's garden-planting backstory is told in one paragraph without on-page pressure, and the twelve men lost happen off-page. The seed's deployment succeeds without complication or cost to Julian himself; officers collapse, but he walks out unscathed. One tightening (officers storm in) but no foreclosed path or trade-off that charges the final image with felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (transforming grief into life) is signaled early and tightens through the ritual sequence. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias must surrender the source of his inspiration to complete the cycle. Agency is renunciation with visible cost: hands "finally empty," heart "strangely light." The escalation reads as accumulative pressure—dust to buds to jungle—rather than causal reversals, consistent with the inferred lens. Minor gap: the stakes remain largely internal without external pressure testing his commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preserve the orchids and the forgotten names—is signaled early and coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the cracked bamboo threatens the orchids' vitality, forcing Elian's repair action. The resolution is earned by his effort (humming in unison, acoustically sealing the fracture), but coincidence is absent and the pressure never escalates beyond the initial problem-solution beat; no reversal narrows options further. The cost is conceptual (endless duty) rather than a visible trade-off that forecloses a live path.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (restore trust) is signaled immediately and pressure escalates causally: silence → magical invocation → violent backlash → Elara's physical struggle → harmonization. The tightening is concrete—Elara must grab tangled light and speak promises under escalating danger, each vow straightening a thread. Kael's hand dropping from his bag and his final speech show the cost paid and option foreclosed. One clear reversal (magic turns chaotic) drives protagonist response with visible price (physical exertion, emotional exposure).

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—saving the Outer Ring versus obeying the High Council—is signaled early and braided tightly with Elian's personal risk of treason. One meaningful tightening occurs when the chain pulls taut and might snap, narrowing options with visible cost: "if the chain snapped, the bypass would fail, and the Outer Ring would die of thirst." The resolution is driven by Elian's agency (adhesive analysis, chain placement, wheel-hauling) and the volcanic cycle he exploits. Coincidence does not resolve; the plan's success hinges on his preparation and the antique metal holding under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving the Martian song—is signaled early and remains coherent throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when the woman's arrival forces Elian to act: his years of cultivated anonymity are breached, and he must choose between continued hiding and the risk of shared purpose. The dust-mote ritual provides visible constraint (air turbulence determines launch safety), and the decision to release Aero forecloses his prior solitude with felt cost. Agency is clear: Elian's choice to trust and release the bird is protagonist-driven, not coincidental. The lack of a secondary complication or reversal keeps this from higher bands, but the escalation is clean and the price—"death of his solitude"—is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering why thresholds feel sacred—is signaled early and drives the investigation. The logbook discovery provides a meaningful tightening: the pilot's breach reveals the cost of collapsed distance. Elara's final choice to step back rather than bridge is agency as renunciation, and the piece earns its Resonant Reconfiguration through prior setup. Pressure accumulates through imagery and concept rather than escalating external conflict, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.9)
    One dominant stake is signaled early (finding belonging), but escalation depends on the coincidental ostracod bloom rather than protagonist agency—Elara waits and receives rather than choosing under pressure. The tightening is atmospheric (lights dim, swarm envelops) without a decision that narrows live options or forces a trade-off. The burnt feather placement at the end carries symbolic cost but lacks the felt price of renouncing a concrete path; what does she lose by leaving it? Kael's manual tuning of the harmonic emitters hints at ingenuity, but the display would occur regardless of Elara's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: "to discover why some paths disappear entirely." The timeframe ("before memory fades") creates urgency, and the tightening moment is clear when Elara realizes logic won't work and must conjecture. The conjecture is protagonist-driven and narrows options. However, the cost at closure is conceptual rather than visceral—she pockets the glass and hums, "delighted," without a visible trade-off or loss. The pressure coheres but lacks a felt price that would lift this into the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—Elias's need to orchestrate serendipity—is signaled early and drives one meaningful tightening (the cascade sequence). However, there is no reversal or escalation; the plan unfolds exactly as designed with no adaptation, risk, or visible cost. The woman's "bad day" is told but never tested; she receives fortune passively, making her joy a result of Elias's agency rather than her own. Coincidence is used to complicate (tide timing) but the resolution hinges entirely on Elias's pre-calculation, not protagonist struggle under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Lyra's need to inscribe the verse and escape—is signaled in paragraph six and sustained through the ritual. Pressure accumulates (alignment, stylus press, fledging, anchoring) and the transformation narrows options: once anchored, the verse is "immutable," foreclosing retreat. However, no on-page obstacle tests her commitment; the ritual succeeds without complication, and her walk to the gate encounters no drones, no pause, no second thought. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening (the verse locks into her biology) but lacks a reversal or friction point where agency under duress would prove the cost. The escalation is smooth accumulation rather than earned through protagonist struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Silas seeks assurance about his work's value before the day's shift erases twilight's magic. The ripple-reading ritual narrows his options by articulating a path forward, and the final image—light transforming the harbor—demonstrates the reweighted cost (his fear exposed as unfounded, his role redefined). Escalation is modest: the pressure comes from internal doubt rather than external opposition, and the tightening is conceptual rather than tactical. The cost is legible but largely emotional; no material trade-off or foreclosed path is visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—translating solitary pain into universal language—is signaled early but remains abstract; no live option is tested or narrowed. The scatter act is a single gesture with no visible price or tactical trade-off; Silas faces no resistance, and the "bitterness began to evaporate" tells resolution rather than showing forfeiture. One deepening (accepting scars as receipts) shifts understanding but does not foreclose a path or alter later options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reversing spiritual stagnation—is signaled early and tightens when the balloon ascends and the decorations lock into the universal lattice, pushing back the gray entropy. One meaningful escalation occurs on the page (the gauge spins, the balloon breaches, the stagnation recoils) driven by Elian's agency. Cost is visible: the world becomes "heavier and more real," a felt price that alters the present. No multiple reversals are required at this length; the single deepening under the Accumulative lens is sufficient and the cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—discovering what walls dream—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when acoustic heaviness becomes confession of mass sacrifice. One meaningful deepening: the discovery of Seraphina's crime forecloses Elias's professional detachment, forcing him into the role of sole keeper. The film negatives narrow options by providing faces to the betrayal, transforming abstract history into particular victims. Agency is clear: Elias chooses to pack and carry the evidence out. Cost is legible on the page: "crushing reality," "burden was his now," and the changed echo at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—completing the mirage before the bells ring—is signaled early and tightens through a clear sequence: locate heartbeat, hum lullaby, guide light, maintain alignment. The bell's toll provides a concrete ticking-clock reversal that shatters the spell at the moment of completion. Elara's agency drives each turn (choosing the dog's pulse, weaving the illusion), and the cost is visible: her form dissolves, the alignment breaks. The man's passivity keeps this from higher bands, but the escalation under a causal lens is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: securing peace before the alignment breaks. One meaningful tightening: Kaelen's demand for the names forces the warlords to confront grief, and their admission narrows options (sign or walk away). However, escalation is gentle; Hark's sneer dissolves into compliance without visible struggle or trade-off between competing goods. The celestial timeframe is declared urgent but never tested—no countdown pressure, no risk of overrun. Agency at closure belongs to Kaelen's orchestration; the generals follow his script rather than making a choice that forecloses a live path with felt cost on their part.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—preserve the echo of the extinct species—is signaled early and tightens through the placement ritual. The "statistically indistinguishable from zero" survival odds and "doomed gamble" frame the cost, but the tension is more atmospheric than escalatory; no live options narrow after the egg is revealed. The act itself (kneeling, placing, walking away) is decisive, yet the outcome remains abstract. One meaningful deepening occurs when Vance imagines the hatchling's cry, reweighting his manufactured drought from pure profit to moral paradox. Agency is renunciation with felt cost, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake (stop the Harvest of Echoes before the Magistrates drain the Prism) is signaled early. Elara's approach and unlocking sequence show agency, but no on-page obstacle forces a trade-off or narrows her options—the guards do not stop her, and the Magistrate's realization arrives after she has already pulled the thread. The resistance of the spell ("shocks of cold pain") is described but does not alter her tactics or test her commitment. The tightening promised by "between sigh and smile" compresses time but does not foreclose a live option or impose a visible cost; the closure reconfigures the courtyard's state without showing what Elara loses or renounces.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—exploring ethical storytelling by undoing tragedy—is signaled early and tightens when Silas freezes the tableau and reverses the action, forcing the crowd to confront "accumulated errors that could have been stopped." The reversal forecloses the linear narrative path with visible conceptual cost. However, the heckler's silent capitulation lacks on-page resistance, muting what could have been a sharper test of Silas's conviction.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.2)
    One dominant stake is signaled early: honoring overlooked histories. The arrival of the monarch deepens pressure by forcing the contrast between celebrated and forgotten, and the "interrupted cadence" moment—the hesitation in the cycle—narrows the thematic claim with conceptual cost. Agency reads as attention and ritual completion rather than a forced choice, which fits the Accumulative lens. The cost is legible in the final image (wind will scatter both, history in stone not sky), though the price could be more viscerally felt on Elias's body or immediate options.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (preserve the melody/names) is signaled early and tightens when the rope reconfiguration becomes necessary—no rope activation, no heat, no casting. Escalation is causal: each step (coating, curing, activating furnace, pouring) narrows options and raises irreversible commitment. The pour is an on-page act with visible cost: the paper is destroyed to create the bronze replica, and the decision forecloses return. Minor issue: the atmospheric energy mechanism arrives late (midpoint) without prior setup, though it functions as obstacle rather than convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: escape temporal blindness and act in the unseeable present, tested against the decaying directive and the approaching storm. The dream-vision narrows options (box location, seal fragility, directive obsolescence), the storm escalates (foresight shows flooding), and the lever-pull forecloses the bunker's safety with visible cost (letting the storm in). One clear tightening: from abstract seeking to concrete action. Agency is protagonist-driven; the Steward's wink is complicity, not solution. The cost—rejecting linear safety, embracing chaos—is legible on the page and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and sustained: seal the covenant before the "crude superstitions of the new regime" erase the science. The tightening is causal: he ascends, produces the tile, draws diagrams, taps three times, and the rift opens—each step narrows options under the invasion's pressure. The transaction is protagonist-driven: he offers the tile as "formalized contract," and the presence "acknowledged him" by locking the pattern into stasis, ensuring preservation. One visible cost: the knowledge is now "inaccessible to the burning torches of the invading army," isolated in the ether. Minor limitation: the ritual proceeds without complication or reversal; his agency is decision and execution, but no live alternative or trade-off is dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—forcing Kaelen to surrender—is signaled early, but escalation occurs through external mechanism (cellular memory flooding his nervous system) rather than protagonist micro-choices that narrow options. One tightening exists: Kaelen tries to pull away but the transfer is "relentless," yet this is passive suffering rather than a tactical trade-off. The resolution bypasses agency: Elian holds contact firm, the artifact does the work, and Kaelen's sword drops without a visible cost tied to his choice. The story declares high stakes ("crucial moment," "master plan") but the on-page action is a single press of metal to skin followed by automatic transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: capture the runaway dream. Pressure tightens through the synchronized breathing sequence and the risk of being "swept away into nothingness" or "trapped forever in the cold silence of the glass." The ritual succeeds without reversal or complication, and Silas's agency is procedural rather than decision-driven—he executes steps without facing a trade-off or price that narrows options. The "burning lungs" and physical anchoring provide some felt cost, but the dream materializes as planned without testing commitment or forcing a sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—repairing the breach to teach maintenance as love—signals early and tightens when the rift widens after the needle fails. Elara's agency drives the turn: her desperation prompts the bag dump, and her recognition of the ribbon's memory enables the solution. The cost is legible on the page: she sacrifices a sentimental object (her daughter's ribbon, lost years ago) and accepts a fragile, temporary fix rather than the permanent lock the town wanted. One meaningful deepening occurs when the magic "spat the needle back out," foreclosing standard methods and forcing unorthodox improvisation.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear and high: carve the wrong face and "his lineage would unzip from reality." Pressure escalates through sensory overload → bathroom retreat → shell examination → direct confrontation with the trees → final commitment. The tightening is meaningful: Elian moves from passive curator to active participant who must "carve the face of the fear" to close the loop. Cost is visible in the inheritance's fragility and the "phantom weight of the knife," though the resolution tilts slightly toward conceptual repricing rather than a fully dramatized reversal with on-page price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake (rescue the Traveler by finding the Library of Unlearned Lessons) is signaled early and tightens once when Elara notices the unlisted fungi, generating the negotiation gamble. However, the reversal feels cerebral rather than visceral—there's no moment where failure would cost Elara something personal beyond mission abort. The golem steps aside too readily; the "fever pitch" vibration is described but doesn't translate into a felt trade-off or visible price that alters her later escape tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding and conversing with her absorbed twin—is signaled early and drives every beat. Pressure accumulates through the destabilizing timeframe, the backward-grinding ferris wheel, and the need to speak her path into existence to prevent dissolution. The garden arrival tightens options: silence stretches, no sister steps out, and Elara must choose between prolonging the wait or accepting integration. The cost—releasing the hope of separation—is legible but arrives quickly; one more micro-choice or hesitation in the garden would deepen the escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—prevent the university from losing its identity—is signaled early and tightens when Elian identifies the disconnected rope and divergent cords. The repair action (pressing the seal, merging strands) narrows options and the cost is legible: the seal dissolves, the rope becomes whole, the dissonance ends. However, the escalation is mild; Elian faces no reversal or complication mid-task. The work is warmly methodical but not tested by failure or surprise, so the tightening feels more like patient execution than a turn that forecloses a live alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (restore silence before mental fracture) is signaled early and tightens when the energy beings sense her bio-rhythm. Agency is clear: Elara's mapkeeper skill and the echo chamber stone are deployed in a single decisive action with visible cost (she slumps, finally resting in "absolute quiet"). The choice to strike at the stress-line intersection is earned by prior expertise. One meaningful escalation—screeching approach to contact—raises cost and narrows options to this moment.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—rekindling the beacon to prove coincidences have meaning—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure escalates: the shard of hush creates a "terrifying, expectant vacuum," forcing immediate action; manual alignment against rust under a narrowing celestial window raises physical and temporal cost. The final act (light piercing the clouds) is driven by protagonist agency and delivers visible consequence: heads turn, hope spreads. However, no genuine reversal or complicating turn tests her commitment mid-attempt; the path from prism to activation is linear, and external opposition (rust, urgency) is mechanical rather than layered or adaptive.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: sculpting collective identity at the end of time. The shadow crossing the "threshold of optimistic expansion" into "preservation" provides one meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens. However, no live choice is tested—Elara's conjecture is confirmed without friction, and the act of writing faces no competing option or visible sacrifice (time, safety, alternate record). The stake is declared and observed but not dramatized as a trade-off with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring hope through fireworks—is signaled early and remains coherent. The piece deepens through accumulation (mosaic discovery, fuse-lighting sequence, cascade) but lacks a meaningful tightening or trade-off. Elian faces no opposition, makes no mistake, sacrifices nothing; the execution is flawless and consequence-free. The "terrifying second" pause before the first mortar blooms hints at risk but deflates immediately without cost. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification would require a visible price or foreclosed option; here the protagonist conducts his "thunderous symphony" with unbroken agency and zero friction.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (how to respond to Kael's departure) is signaled early and coherent. The accumulative deepening occurs through Elara's extended observation that narrows her options—by studying the pool she forecloses argument and chooses acceptance. The starfish detaching models the necessary release. Agency is clear (her choice to look away, stroke the cicada, interpret texture, then speak), and cost is visible (future solitude). One meaningful tightening when she shifts from processing to speech. No reversal required under Accumulative lens; the deepening suffices and the cost charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—harvest the Gilded Hush as antidote—signals early. The inversion provides the meaningful tightening; Elara's sensory-deprivation technique narrows her window and forces the cap before gravity snaps back. Agency is decision (sealing the doll), and the cost is legible: she imprisons the light to carry it home. The escalation is cleanly driven by the time constraint, though the final beat ("let the silence sprout again") shifts to assertion of future use rather than present friction.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: prevent Kael's fear from generating psychic noise that destabilizes the gondola. One meaningful tightening occurs when the train whistle creates hostile silence, forcing Elian to act. However, the escalation lacks visible cost or trade-off—Elian reaches for the storm glass without hesitation, uncertainty, or resource constraint. The resolution feels procedural rather than hard-won; no live option is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake (reach the throne before sunrise incineration) is signaled early and produces one meaningful tightening when the stairway flickers and klaxons wail. Agency at closure is decisive physical action—she leaps and climbs—but no visible cost appears: no exhaustion, no tool failure, no sacrifice of knowledge or relationship. The deadline creates urgency but does not narrow options or extract a price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Mara's inability to move beyond the threshold despite having fled. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elian points to the dissolving boundary and she realizes the ring is an anchor, not a trophy—this narrows her options to drop or remain trapped. The escalation is protagonist-driven under the Accumulative lens: her physical grip loosens beat by beat until release. Cost is legible: "If I drop it, I will have nothing" versus gaining "your hands back," and the "vast, terrifying open space" after. No coincidence resolves; the shift comes from her own renunciation with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—protect the fungal ecosystem from the quantum promise's destructive collapse—is signaled early and escalates when the "pressure in the cavern spiked" and threatens to flatten the farm. Elias's agency drives the reversal: he volunteers to intercept rather than flee, then funnels the force into the bolt. The cost is visible (bolt destroyed, replaced by diamond) and the tightening is clear (options narrow to "stand or run," then to "compress or be crushed"). The resolution is earned by his choice and the bolt's properties, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—exposing the emperor's fraudulent divine claim—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens through a single, high-cost escalation: finding the correct resonance without a gauge. The protagonist's agency (intuition over logic, enduring lactic fire, stopping at the pitch shift) drives each beat under the causal lens. The cost is legible on the page: the lie is shattered, silence ends, and the capital's reality ruptures. One reversal (crystal crack) reweights all prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—capturing the shape of possibility—is signaled early, and the mimicked ritual pattern provides one meaningful tightening (pillars twist, air pressure plummets). However, escalation is largely atmospheric; no on-page reversal or complication forces Valerius to trade one live option for another. The protagonist's agency at closure (murmured allegiance, unsnapping the pod) feels unopposed and convenient; no visible price is paid that narrows future choices or forecloses a path within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear early: prove the child was not discarded. One meaningful deepening occurs when the button and dust confirm a hidden visitation, narrowing Elias's interpretation from bureaucratic neglect to covert love. The final choice (write the addendum) is protagonist-driven and forecloses a path—he commits evidence to the record with "tactfully hopeful" phrasing, accepting the risk of hypothesis over certainty. Cost is felt (offering "the only inheritance the boy had"), but the decision lacks visible friction or trade-off in the moment, keeping it shy of 8.2.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—restore suppressed history before erasure becomes permanent—is signaled early and tightens when the extraction team fails, forcing Elara to act alone. The puddle-map deepening and the lagoon infiltration both raise tactical risk. However, the final reversal (key turns, system activates, truth floods the network) feels mechanically successful without a visible tradeoff or cost that alters Elara's future options; the ending delivers victory but not the felt price that would push escalation into the high 8s. Coincidence does not resolve, and agency is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—silence the prophecy before tectonic collapse—is signaled early and tested once in the central confrontation. The machine's acceleration and pulsing red lights create escalation; Elias's technique narrows options (negative space vs. data streams). The final whisper is a meaningful tightening driven by protagonist agency. Cost is visible (burned lungs, shaking hands, "metaphysical exertion"), though the threat's collapse feels more like successful execution than a trade-off that forecloses a live alternative. One clear pressure point suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—decode and answer the leaf message—is signaled early and shapes the sequence. However, escalation is minimal: Silas waits, interprets, gathers materials, and completes the ritual without resistance, error, or trade-off. The seed's transformation occurs automatically once he prods it, offering no visible price or narrowed options. One meaningful tightening appears (finding the perfect moonstone speck focal point), but no reversal or complication tests commitment or forces a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—retrieve the compass and survive—is clear and signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the bridge kit shears, forcing improvisation under pressure. The vine-swing leap and the compass retrieval deliver visible cost (stranded on the island). However, the post-retrieval shift to exhilaration feels abrupt; the story summarizes his realization rather than dramatizing the friction between survival fear and newfound acceptance, softening the escalation's payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: "to understand the weight of names" and to "redeem his failure." Pressure accumulates through the alchemical process—ignition, liquefaction, thermal escalation to hyper-fluidity, the gamble of pouring into apparently empty space—each step narrowing options and raising the cost of error. The final reconfiguration (gold catching, tracing fractures, solidifying into truth-statue) is earned by Elara's agency and the choice to highlight rather than hide Julian's flaws. The cost is conceptual but legible: his absence is now permanent, preserved as luminous ruin rather than mourned traditionally. One meaningful tightening occurs when she pushes materials "to the brink of vaporization," forcing all-or-nothing commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear: retrieve the General's soul by breaking his self-imposed gravity. Pressure tightens when the harp snags the ghost, escalates when Thorne roars and demands to be left alone, and culminates in Elian's choice to deploy the tooth—a tactic that forecloses the General's spectral existence with visible cost (the chains shatter, he fades). Agency is clear throughout; Elian's decisions drive each turn. The escalation is causal and protagonist-driven, satisfying the inferred Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—solving "the mathematics of mercy" to stop nerve pain—is signaled early and drives forward movement. Pressure accumulates through sensory assault and somatic warnings (knee buckle, neck stiffening) that test endurance. Removing the mask is the key tightening: a forbidden act that exposes variables and forces the final stance. However, escalation relies more on accumulating sensation than on narrowed options or a visible trade-off; the protagonist walks a predetermined path (into the brightest sector) without a compelling on-page choice that forecloses alternatives with immediate cost.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: rescuing the forgotten history trapped in the painting. Pressure tightens when Elian must "perform a delicate metaphysical surgery" to unfasten the memory, and the act of pulling his hand back ("imagining the act of untying a knot") narrows options with visible cost. Agency is present in the decision to transcribe the keeper's story, and the final image—closing the journal—reweights the earlier exploration with felt closure. One meaningful deepening (the lens revealing the tragedy) is sufficient for this length under an Accumulative lens. The resolution is earned by Elian's alteration of the painting's state and his acceptance of the "heavy, solemn burden."

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—fixing the jammed lift to complete the trapped cycle—is signaled early and pursued methodically. Elias's diagnosis (dust ripples) and extraction narrow options in a clear causal sequence. Yet escalation is muted: no reversal tests his commitment, no complication forces a tradeoff. The ghosts "lean in" and their "weightless burden intensifies," but this doesn't translate into a tactical cost or a moment where Elias must risk something to proceed. The resolution is earned by his skill, not by a choice under competing pressure. One meaningful tightening occurs (the mainspring reveal), but the price paid—releasing the trapped truth—remains off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: destabilizing the perfect system to compress eternity into a felt moment. The pressure escalates through hunt → preparation → press action → collapse, driven by Silas's agency. The glass fracture and cascade provide visible cost. One meaningful tightening occurs as the library "realizes it was dying" and all potential futures slam into the present. The want (compression, reality) is clear; no secondary pressure tests him, and the final cost is physical consequence rather than a layered trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—Elian's need to prevent the past from being "conscripted into the service of tyranny"—is signaled early and tightens through the archaeological dispute. The climactic device (shard + storm + covered mirrors) meaningfully narrows options: Elian stakes his credibility on a fabricated vision with visible cost (Thorne's "data corrupted," Elian's trembling hand, the return of sorrow). The escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, and the price—"forced the universe to dream his dream" yet "could not bring back the dead"—lands on the page. One reversal (the projection's success) and one deepening (the hollow victory) suffice at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preventing the Covenant of Rust from unmaking the city—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure tightens once: the rust "scratching at the heavy iron doors" creates urgency, and Elias's counterintuitive method (mending the pristine, not the broken) narrows his options to a single, high-risk act. The stone's insertion produces an immediate, on-page consequence (shockwave, corrosion halted). However, the escalation is smooth rather than compounding; no intermediate failure or cost forces a tactical pivot. The resolution is entirely protagonist-driven, meeting the causal lens, though a visible price (exhaustion, tool loss, relational cost) would elevate the band.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—capturing the source scent where logic dissolves—is signaled early and pursued coherently. Pressure tightens through spatial descent and the psychometric compass reading, then deepens when Silas uncorks the vial and triggers the metaphysical reaction. However, the escalation is more textural accumulation than an on-page choice that forecloses options; he performs each step without friction or trade-off. The "hinged awakenings" open as intended with no cost visible in the moment. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist agency narrow or risk anything concrete—he succeeds exactly as planned.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—save the freighter—is clear early and drives all action. Pressure tightens when Elara receives the distress call and escalates as she drags the sculpture into the gale, rigs the lamp, and projects the map. The ship's turn is a visible reversal earned by her choices. One meaningful cost is legible: physical effort, adrenaline, and the risk of being "sucked out into the void." The resolution feels somewhat convenient—the projection works perfectly on first try—which slightly undercuts the felt price of the gambit.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding nocturnal blooms—is signaled early and tightens across three nights. The flower's opening provides a meaningful deepening that changes Elara's knowledge under the Accumulative lens. However, the escalation lacks agency-driven pressure; Elara waits rather than pursuing difficult choices that narrow options. The cost of her realization (shifting from "vanity" to "survival and generosity") is conceptual but not enacted with a visible price that alters tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—decrypt the diary to expose the regime—is signaled early and remains coherent. One tightening occurs: the Scribe demands legacy preservation in exchange for the cipher. However, this reversal lacks on-page friction; Elara nods immediately with no competing cost or moral calculus. The psychic static that prevents speech creates a problem but solving it (arranging debris) feels straightforward rather than a trade-off that forecloses another path. Escalation exists but the visible price at closure is minimal; the diary's weight is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: to end the void and birth a new, flawed civilization. Pressure accumulates through the mental exertion sequence as her working memory is pushed to its limit; if her focus wavers, the construct collapses. The tightening is visible when she adds greed, hunger, and ambition to ensure the world will be real, and the final act—raising the bottle to shatter—narrows options to a single irreversible choice. Agency is hers: the decision to break the vessel and unleash the stored complexity. The cost is legible in the final image: messy, loud, painful glory replacing silence.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: unlock the artifact before it crumbles. Pressure escalates through Vane's panic, the memory-triggered solution, and the immersion gambit. The architect's voice introduces a reversal—mundane inventory becomes accidental prophecy—that reweights the entire endeavor. Agency is clear: Vane's decision to immerse the shaving (against all intuition for fragile wax) drives the resolution. The cost is legible on the page: the artifact dissolves completely, the tower's time expires, and Vane is left with terminal knowledge in newly oppressive silence.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—reopening the vault to access heritage seeds and prevent permanent silence—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens. One meaningful tightening occurs (frost retreats, door opens), but the turn is more conceptual than driven by protagonist struggle or tradeoff. Elian's agency is present (mental discipline, visualization through acorn cap) yet the vortex subdues without visible resistance or cost that narrows later options. The closure reconfigures meaning (discovering borrowed time's texture) but doesn't dramatize a live choice or foreclose a path on the page. Pressure remains abstract; no antagonist or complication forces adaptation, and the resolution feels contemplative rather than earned through escalation with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—honor silence vs. execute protocol—is signaled early and tightens through atmospheric convergence ("flatline of perfect, impossible equilibrium"). One clear reversal: wind dies completely, forcing Elias's choice at zero hour. Agency is renunciation with visible cost (job explanation, protocol breach). The price is legible on the page ("they would ask why the test failed"). Pressure coheres under the Causal lens and deepens once meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Elara's need to find meaning in her marginalized role—is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful deepening occurs when the meteor ignites and she "imagines the friction, the heat, and the surrender," testing her capacity to empathize with transformation. The ritual itself (raising glass, tracing trajectory, witnessing disintegration) creates a tightening as she moves from observation to identification to revelation. Agency is renunciation and endurance—she chooses to see labor as sacred rather than flee her role—and the cost is visible in her acceptance of an overlooked existence now charged with purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: preserve the weight of unspoken words and repair the covenant torn by visible ghosts. The woman's approach creates one meaningful tightening—her desperate confession threatens the silence Elias guards—and his decision to gaze through the box rather than engage forecloses her plea with visible cost (her urgency drains, form wavers). The escalation is modest but sufficient under the Accumulative lens: visual noise → ritual → resolution. Agency is clear (his refusal and ritual act reweight the atmosphere), and the price—her peace purchased by enforced silence—lands on the page in the final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: rediscovering "solid world" / fixing her fractured timeline. The covert-message setup establishes the hunt; the response triggers descent; the shard discovery tightens options by offering a stabilization key. One reversal (capsule "failed" yet delivered a lesson) narrows her path. Cost is visible (her frantic borrowed seconds slow, aligning with stillness), but the peak choice—pocketing the shard—feels more like acquisition than a trade-off with visible sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—completing the woven dawn ritual before sunrise—is signaled early and sustained. The kite snap provides one meaningful tightening that introduces discord and tests Elian's method. However, escalation is muted: Elian never considers abandoning the ritual, forcing a fix, or facing a trade-off; he simply incorporates the rupture as planned. The resolution reads as thematic fulfillment rather than a choice that forecloses options with visible cost. Agency is present but not pressured; the cost is conceptual (accepting asymmetry) rather than felt as a sacrifice or loss on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake signaled early: save the orchard from self-destruction by fostering interspecies respect. One meaningful tightening occurs as Silas's body fails ("stiffness in his chest grew to encompass his entire frame") while the orchard begins to change, creating a visible trade-off between his life and the synthesis. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: he systematically wraps copper, drives wire into stone, and stitches the factions together. Cost is unmistakable on the page: his declining strength and the final act of sitting to die. No coincidence resolves the conflict; Silas's method and persistence earn the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake signaled early: Elara seeks to prove the pilgrimage is synthetic manipulation, not divine intervention. The footprints and Aris's presence tighten her hypothesis into confirmed theory, escalating her thrill and dread. The final act—throwing the amber—is protagonist-driven agency that forecloses stasis and commits to rebellion with visible cost ("stop climbing," "stop returning"). The escalation is lean and purposeful under the causal lens, with one meaningful deepening that narrows her options.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—restoring life to a dead reef—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through sensory density and ritualistic waiting (tuning out waves, listening for the specific cadence, casting the pods at the precise spot). However, escalation is thin: Silas's actions proceed without complication or reversal, and the garden's acceptance ("a faint green light began to pulse") arrives as validation rather than a turn that narrows options. The resolution lacks visible cost; Silas achieves his goal without sacrifice, trade-off, or renunciation, and the ending reads as Charged Poise (the promise of healing) rather than a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: translate distance into closeness by decoding the cylinder. One meaningful tightening: the leaf overlay narrows the problem to hidden coordinates, transforming noise into signal. Agency is clear—Silas's patient visual reading and use of the amber lens drive the discovery. The resolution (finding the radio frequency) is earned by his prior decoding work. Cost is legible but primarily emotional (years of separation, fragile hope); a more visceral price or foreclosed path would elevate this further.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—finding psychic anchor ("localized True North") against relativistic chaos—is signaled early and tightens through the glimpse of structure, which narrows options from ritual repetition to active cartography. The escalation is modest but real: trembling hand arrested by fleeting alignment, leading to the renunciation of mere survival in favor of mapping. Agency is present (she chooses to continue, reframing the compass, turning a fresh page), and the cost is legible: committing to solitary exploration in minimal-power isolation. One meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens; no reversals required, and coincidence (the glimpse) complicates rather than resolves. Pressure coheres and culminates in her vow.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—breaking the cosmic stalemate—is signaled early and escalates through the swaps. Each piece placed tightens pressure (the board shudders, ice cracks) and narrows the path to completion. The final thunderclap and ward dissolution constitute a meaningful turn. However, the escalation is smooth rather than conflicted; Elian encounters no resistance, mistake, or trade-off that tests his commitment. The stakes remain conceptual (safe reality vs. chaos) without a personal on-page cost that alters his options or forces renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: preserve "small gestures" before the Penumbra erases memory. One meaningful tightening: the sonic chaos threatens to deafen and blur the archive, forcing Elias to clack the kings—a decision that narrows options (stop pacing to restore clarity) and demonstrates agency under pressure. The cost is felt: to save authenticity he "strips empathy in the present," foregrounding the tradeoff between historian and human. The chessboard's missing pawns visibly embodies the expendable lives swept away, and the final image locks that cost into the dust.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding the shape of home—is signaled early and drives the ascent. The discovery of the stone is a clear reversal that narrows options (she must resurrect buried talents), and the seeding act is a decisive tightening with stakes on the page. However, the agency feels compressed: Elara's choice to plant the stone is described with ritualistic care but the trade-off cost (what she loses by binding herself to this place, what the suppressed power actually demands) remains abstract. The escalation from finding→decoding→planting works under the Accumulative lens but lacks a visible price that alters her tactics in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: unfreeze the village to allow time/consequences to flow and achieve self-forgiveness. The piece tightens once when Silas identifies the anchor knot and pulls it despite the woven hush's protest, narrowing his option to maintain stasis. Agency is decision under duress ("He did not waver"), and the cost is explicit: "sacrifice the comfort of the stasis to save the reality of the village." Thunder approaching provides external time pressure. No antagonist beyond the spell itself, which is acceptable for this design; the single reversal (resistance snaps → shockwave → restoration) meets 600–800-word escalation standards with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is legible: Kaelen seeks to fracture the Elders' scapegoat narrative before it solidifies. The reversal occurs when the spire refracts sound into "a thousand distinct whispers" instead of echoing one voice, forcing multiplicity onto the congregation. Agency is clear—his poetic cadence is purposeful and escalates against their silencing ritual. Cost is on-page: "heresy punishable by exile or silence," accepted in the final beat. Pressure coheres under the Situational lens; his intervention narrows the Elders' control and broadens communal hearing.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—conjuring meaning from oblivion—is signaled early and tightens as the acid rises and air runs out. One meaningful pressure point: lungs screaming for release while the transmutation is incomplete forces Elara to choose narrative over breath. The ritual choice narrows options (no escape route, only symbolic preservation), and the final exhale forecloses survival with on-page cost. Agency is clear: Elara's desperation and kintsugi intention drive the ritual, not luck. Minor gap: we don't see a live alternative she rejects, so the tightening reads as urgency rather than a trade-off between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: honoring Elara's memory through ritual release, signaled early ("pilgrimage driven by a need to keep a hidden promise"). Pressure coheres through grief distraction → discovery → painting → understanding the core concept → release. One meaningful tightening: the realization that "to hold onto it was to let it stagnate; to release it was to honor its beauty" narrows options to a single choice. The release forecloses the alternative (keeping/clinging) with visible cost—he walks away from the masterpiece "no eyes but his and the ocean's would ever see." Agency is renunciation with on-page cost. The lens (accumulative/textural) supports the escalation through deepening rather than reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (save the ship without causing panic) is clear early and tightens when "the wind smelled of forgiveness and rest" guides the captain. Agency is Elias's choice to use the silent method despite the head keeper's doctrine. The escalation from broken foghorn to drifting ship to Elias's physical projection narrows options effectively. Visible cost appears in his shaking body and exhaustion, though the ship's response happens off-stage, slightly reducing immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake signaled early: construct a safe passage corridor for reverse-migrating spectral entities. Pressure escalates through lunar peak timing, cryptic coordinate delivery, manual crank resistance, and the flood of signals at climax. Elara's agency is clear: she completes the bridge despite physical cost (hot metal, absorbed grief). The resolution is earned by her sustained effort and renunciation of comfort; ghosts cross, she waits alone. One meaningful tightening (signal peak/tapering) narrows options and delivers visible cost (exhaustion, isolation).

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—cultivating psychological safety before his mind shatters—is signaled early and pursued with escalating desperation. Pressure tightens in one meaningful turn: the rational man applies "analytical rigor to the impossible," presses the relic, and achieves silence. Agency is clear (gathering tools, performing ritual, testing a lie), and the cost is visible (dependence on "bad science," isolation, fragility of the peace). The piece does not require multiple reversals at this length; the single deepening—from noise to silence—narrows options (he cannot return to shared empathy) and the final whispered lie proves the transformation with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (decode the stranger's final gesture) is signaled early and drives the single investigative beat. The tightening occurs when Silas shifts focus from the woman to the empty space, narrowing his approach and revealing the sacrifice. Agency is investigative attention that forecloses ignorance with felt cost (carrying "the secrets of ghosts"). Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is sufficient at this length. The pressure remains coherent, though the protagonist's role is more observer than actor under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: find the Doorway before drowning. The water's rise creates one clear tightening that narrows options (chest to chin). Elias's agency drives the turn: he chooses to follow the ants, insert the matrix, and step through. However, the final crossing lacks a visible trade-off in the moment; the realization about courage versus changing the past arrives as reflection rather than a choice between two live paths. The cost (sealing the map of his grief forever) is felt but not dramatized as a renunciation of a concrete alternative on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—unraveling the recurring dream mystery—is signaled early and drives Isolde's climb. Escalation reads through accumulative pressure: dangerous ascent, dodging caustic starlight, reaching the ember grotto. The fireflies' arrival shifts the situation, but Isolde's agency in that turn is passive (they form the shield; she realizes). The final act—sitting and waiting—feels more like endurance than a decision that forecloses a path with visible trade-off. Time and exhaustion constrain tactics (Valerius catches her), but the peak lacks a choice that narrows options with felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—capturing the density of presence—is signaled immediately and tightens when Kaelen's departure forces Elian to "revalue their time together instantly." The whispered confession supplies the catalyst, narrowing options from abstract goal to urgent, personal act. One clear reversal: the reaction spirals out of control until the secret stabilizes it. The cost is visible: Elian experiences a "hollow in his chest" and relinquishes the pocket sun, foreclosing the option to keep it. Agency is present in the final choice to hand the sphere away.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—document the dream to anchor existence—is signaled early and sustained. The jealousy-to-flight sequence tightens options (dream fractures, "cold ash of reality"), forcing the chronicler to return and inscribe. Agency is renunciation (sated nostalgia, solitude with words), with visible emotional cost. One meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens is sufficient; escalation is driven by protagonist choice, meeting scope.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: repair the broken water clock and validate Elias's post-loss intuition. The skepticism → curiosity → acceptance arc provides one meaningful tightening when Kael measures the screw and it "bit into the brass housing." Agency is Elias's choice to offer the heirloom, a decision that forecloses possession with visible cost. The steady heartbeat rhythm at resolution reweights the initial "chaotic spurts," but the escalation is modest—one reversal, limited external pressure beyond Kael's doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—avoid total petrification—is signaled immediately and tightens through escalating crystallization: collarbone, neck, right arm, wrist locked. Agency drives the turn: Elara chooses to abandon logic and inscribe the nursery rhyme, and the held breath intensifies cost ("lungs burned"). The shedding forecloses the academic path with felt price: "tearing at the boundaries of who she was." No convenient rescues; the protagonist's decision under pressure—writing superstition on quartz—directly produces the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is Elena's need to apologize, signaled early and sustained through the ritual. Pressure escalates via the generator sequence: cork pop, vapor manifestation, father's agonized form, and the climactic touch/nod. Agency belongs to Elena stepping forward and Silas controlling the field, though the father's acceptance arrives quickly without friction or secondary complication. The ending reweights cost—"He didn't smile"—showing that reconnection doesn't heal all wounds, a visible trade-off. One meaningful tightening via the induced-current trap; no secondary reversals, which fits the length but keeps the piece in mid-7s rather than higher.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—keeping existence from tearing—is signaled early and escalates when the Spiral Arbitration interrogates the validity of matter. Elara's agency manifests in thumbing the dictionary and speaking "unify," which reverses the dissolution, but the turn feels declarative rather than earned through prior tactical struggle. The piece offers one meaningful tightening (the vortex pulls at her identity, she counters with a word) but the cost is abstract; no visible forfeiture or tactical tradeoff appears on the page. Pressure coheres under the chosen lens but lacks the felt price that would lift this into high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: understanding clock mechanics. One clear tightening when the key catches ("resistance that vibrated up his arm") and escalates when torque traps it, forcing the protagonist to sever focus rather than withdraw cleanly. Agency is visible: Kaelen chooses to use the key despite profession, induces trance, and finally counts to zero to break free—each a micro-choice under accumulating pressure. The cost is felt: "peaceful" silence becomes "merely the pause before the next incision," foreclosing his prior innocence. Minor cap: the escalation is cerebral rather than relational or physically contesting an external force, limiting visceral stakes slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: reclaim agency from mortality by proving hidden order. The tightening occurs at the podium when she confronts her own mortality text; the choice to raise the lantern and accept the truth (not flee) forecloses the path of denial. Cost is visible: she trades the illusion of control for peaceful coexistence with contradiction. One meaningful pressure point suffices at this length. Escalation reads through accumulation of paradoxes forcing her stance crystallization, consistent with the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: guide strangers through grief without letting intimacy collapse into obligation. One meaningful tightening occurs when the conversation enters "critical emotional loop" and Silas intervenes with the dissonant chord, narrowing the strangers' options and breaking the trance. Agency is his: he chooses the pressure point and severs before regret. Cost is legible in the strangers (weight siphoned, trance broken) but Silas himself forfeits nothing on the page—no stamina loss, doubt, or tradeoff. The escalation is functional but the price is externalized.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—regenerating the broken covenant to preserve her husband's laughter—is signaled early and tightens through each ritual step. The steep (infusing the photo) narrows options: once the essence is released, the locket's purpose is "fulfilled." The final act of dropping the locket forecloses retrieval and shifts Elara's role, delivering visible cost. Agency is clear (she chooses to complete the ritual and release the object), though a second reversal or complication would strengthen escalation toward the 8.8+ threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (cure for loneliness) is signaled early and drives all moves. The woman's arrival tightens options: Arthur must choose between transactional safety and vulnerability. His toss of the rock narrows the path with visible cost (he destroys its trade value), and the ending forecloses the barter route. Agency is clear and the escalation is protagonist-driven. One solid reversal (offer to play vs. no transaction) suffices for this length under the Causal lens. The price—risk of being known—is felt in "the strange, terrifying sensation of being known."

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—finding her father's hidden message to achieve closure—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure escalates through the narrowing cosmic window (constellations shudder, panic rises) and the dowsing ring's violent vibration, forcing faster movement. Each tree touch deepens the trail (sadness, joy, regret in different languages) until the clearing resolves the accumulated notes into forgiveness. The tightening is meaningful: she must finish before the pause ends, and the final cost is visible (tears, permanent internal shift). Agency is present in her decision to trust the ring and push through briars, though the resolution leans slightly toward received revelation rather than a choice that forecloses a competing path.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: fix the past to prevent war and famine. Elian's unbending of the nib is a micro turn that enables the editing, and the tracing actions tighten pressure by linking distant events (supernova, dictator's wake, moth's wing). However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is one-directional—layering without reversal—and cost remains diffuse: no visible forfeiture, tactical shift, or moment where Elian must choose between competing goods. The ending lands as relief, not a price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—translating silence into music via sign language observed through a filmless camera—is signaled early and held. However, no meaningful on-page reversal or complication tests commitment; the advisor intensifies her signs, Elias tracks them, the shutter fires, and the music "washes over him" without friction or trade-off. Agency reads as passive observation rather than a decision or renunciation that forecloses a path. The "joyful sorrow" and "poignant happiness" are declared but never dramatized as competing costs that force a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is clearly signaled: rescue a forgotten promise by following Kael's trail to his hidden message. The piece tightens through three geographic descents (statue → shaft → Rotunda) and culminates in Elara's recontextualization of the vandalized portrait, which reweights the red smears from silencing to fire-speech. Agency is present in her charcoal work, which completes the circuit, but the act feels more like interpretive restoration than a choice between competing live options. The price—permanent soot on her fingertips, ownership of shared rage—is conceptual and felt but not a visible forfeiture of an alternative path. One meaningful deepening is sufficient for this length, but escalation remains accumulative rather than decisively narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving Lena's memory as a permanent sanctuary—is signaled early and tightens when Kael ignores the scientists' command and increases tempo, narrowing options to a single irreversible jump. Agency is clear: his deliberate drumming sabotages the calibration and forces the entanglement. The cost is legible ("trapped willingly," "traded the waking world") and forecloses return, though slightly told. One reversal: the machinery tries to override him, but the neural pull anchors him—raising the price of success. Coincidence does not resolve; his choice and timing earn the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    One dominant stake (proving whispers > shouts) is signaled early and tightened when Elias places the coin and traps Kael. The grounding-rod beat is a meaningful reversal—Kael's violence fails, Elias's silence succeeds—driven by protagonist agency under the Causal lens. The cost at closure is present (Kael loses freedom, Elias surrenders the coin) but the on-page consequence for Elias is light: he "vanished…content," with no visible trade-off or foreclosed option that would elevate the price into the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: the woman's need to unburden crushing guilt. Elias's silent demonstration tightens pressure by redirecting her attention from internal abyss to external pattern, narrowing options from confession to acceptance. The louver manipulation deepens meaning—strips of light intersecting with shadows—culminating in her released breath and realization. Cost is conceptual (the secret remains unspoken but no longer festers), legible in the final image. Escalation, however, is driven entirely by Elias's action; the woman's agency is absent, limiting the felt price of her shift.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is legible early: plant doubt in a population of rigid obedience. The piece tightens once—Elias projects *Now* and three hundred shutters rise—narrowing options (the conspiracy is irrevocable) and raising conceptual cost (surveillance will respond). Agency is present but muted: Elias orchestrates rather than struggles; the children are complicit but not tested. The reversal is more reveal than hard turn, and the pedestrians' cognitive snagging feels like outcome rather than a choice under pressure. Escalation is driven by protagonist intent under the Accumulative lens, and the cost (exposure, system disruption) is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: Elian must save Vane from drowning and convince him to accept transformation before the island vanishes. Pressure escalates causally: physical struggle → scrimshaw warms and breaks emotional walls → whale-song begins → water reaches shoulders → Vane's paralysis shatters → he releases the bollard. The final act (detachment) is protagonist-driven with visible cost: loss of land-form, the old life, and rigid boundaries. One meaningful tightening (rising water, dissolving dock) forces the choice with legible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake signaled early: survive the Happiness Mandate by cultivating lightness in grief. One meaningful tightening occurs when Silas shifts from whittling pine to decimating the bouquet itself, narrowing his options and literalizing erasure. The final cost is visible—"completely empty"—and the price (emotional void, loss of his wife's memory) charges the ending. Agency operates through renunciation with on-page cost; the manufactured quietude forecloses genuine mourning. Escalation under Accumulative lens succeeds via density increase and cadence shift from theatrical roar to whisper.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—successfully reading the forbidden cloud-shadow poem—is clear from the outset, and pressure accumulates as Elara engages the quartz, feels the texture of the cloud, and surrenders to sensory dissolution. The moment "it hit her, sudden and absolute" functions as a tightening that crystallizes certainty. Yet the escalation is textural rather than driven by protagonist agency forcing a trade-off; Elara's technique works as described without meaningful friction or a narrowed option. The cost (transgression) is declared but not dramatized as a live obstacle she must overcome on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—awaken Silas to finish capturing his sorrow—is signaled early and shapes every beat. Pressure escalates cleanly: hemlock/ghost-weed rejected → moonflower spurned → reed tongue accepted → sound-driven climax. Agency is Elara's throughout; she reads the Glassblower's gestures, chooses the flawed reed, and deploys it with visible cost (surrendering a cherished relic). The "messy and partial" awakening forecloses easy triumph, delivering a cost-laden resolution under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara's search for connection beyond performance—is signaled early. Kael's failed pilgrimage provides immediate external pressure. The story delivers one meaningful tightening when Elara stops mid-strike and improvises with the lens, narrowing options and forcing a trade-off (breaking established protocol). The cost is visible: she abandons the "rigid laws of the new world" and risks her professional standing. No intermediate reversals deepen the escalation, keeping this in the solid mid-7s rather than higher.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Elias seeks to resurrect the woman's withered state through his craft. One meaningful tightening occurs when the flame illuminates the vellum within the synthetic diamond, projecting the tattoo she "couldn't make permanent" onto her chest—a charged reversal of intention into externalized reality. The woman's agency is limited; she presents the problem and receives the solution, with Elias driving all tactical moves (press, setting, illumination). The cost is visible in her emotional shift (gasp, straightening), but it's delivered *to* her rather than paid *by* her in a choice that forecloses a path, keeping the score in mid-7s under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: whether Silas will maintain professional distance or act on dangerous knowledge. The escalation moves from routine reading to geometric anomaly detection to verification of conspiracy to decision to confide. Agency is clear in the final choice to breach protocol. The reversal—from observer to witness—narrows options with conceptual cost (he can't unknow what he's measured). However, the client's presence feels convenience-cast; the story would work identically with any listener. One meaningful tightening occurs when measurements "prove" demolition, forcing Silas's stance shift.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—pursuing forbidden knowledge at the cost of innocence—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the archive tries to "entrap her in loops of familiarity," forcing the chaotic dance that narrows her tactical options. However, agency at closure is weak: the pagoda "recognized" her and "projected" the history; Elara's only action is placing her palm, a passive gesture. The revelation itself arrives by mechanism rather than protagonist decision, and the emotional cost ("anguished joy," burning away faith) is stated rather than dramatized through a trade-off or choice that forecloses a live option. No visible price alters later tactics; the return journey is mentioned but not shown.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: preserve individual depth (the shadow) against collective erasure. The video-comparison beat establishes the problem, and Elian's stone-offering narrows options (the shadow must accept or dissolve). The metamorphosis delivers one meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens, and cost is explicit: the woman remains severed, the collective drifts unaware, and Elian's act is a "steep victory." Agency is Elian's throughout (decision to use the stone, deliberate approach, shelf-placement). Minor limitation: the shadow itself has minimal resistance or choice texture; its "desperate need for form" is asserted more than dramatized through competing impulses, slightly reducing the peak beat's friction.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—balancing self-respect (justice for Julian) against immediate compassion (saving the creature)—is signaled early and tested in each surgical beat. The chameleon's violent teal scream and the hiss that "pulled her back" provide one meaningful tightening that narrows options. Agency is clear: Elara chooses surgery over pursuit, incises dead tissue, and the creature's tail-wrap at closure reweights trust with felt cost. Escalation is driven by protagonist choice under the inferred lens; the cost (lost naivety, shortened tail) is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: understand the displaced miracle's source to find peace from the telepathic pain. Pressure tightens in one decisive sequence: Elias reads the coffee ring map, begins tunneling despite surgical pain, digs through escalating plant screams, and exposes the glowing root-fusion. The hourglass shattering signals timeline fracture just before contact. Agency is unambiguous—his choice to dig and touch the root—with visible cost (torn stitches, bleeding, exhaustion). The final lullaby shift reweights his suffering. One escalation arc with clear trade-offs; no reversal but a deepening that narrows options and delivers closure.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—is signaled early and remains coherent throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara warms the film and siphons energy into the lens under rising atmospheric pressure (hushed thunder intensifies). Agency is present in her ritual choices (cupping, guiding, focusing), and the final image shows a visible price: the film strip becomes cold and inert. However, escalation feels more like procedural unfolding than a turn that narrows live options or forces a trade-off; the ritual proceeds without reversal or internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is signaled early. Pressure escalates through sensory overload (whispers → screams → hurricane), and the reversal lands when active pursuit becomes the obstacle. Yet the tightening reads more as conceptual realization than a choice that narrows live options: Elian collapses from exhaustion, and surrender follows automatically. The cost of lying still versus continuing to trace is not legibly weighed; the resolution feels delivered by fatigue rather than agency under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserve the archive's contained realities—is signaled early and tightens through the quantum dispersion ritual, which narrows Kaelen's options (dissolution risk) and forces a physical-metaphysical cost. The ritual itself constitutes one meaningful deepening that reweights the danger. No reversal occurs; pressure accumulates under the Accumulative/Textural lens until the lullaby smooths the probability field, and the cost (temporary dissolution, return with shudder) is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—rediscovering the wild frontier of mind—is signaled early and drives the turbine interaction. The gear insertion narrows options (Elian must work to unravel the mechanism), and the turbine's awakening deepens pressure by mirroring his psyche. The resolution is earned through his agency (inserting the gear, watching the transformation), with visible cost in his exhaustion and acceptance of future displacement. One meaningful tightening (the turbine as knot of potential) suffices for this length, though the stakes remain largely internal without external antagonist pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—claiming unused courage after breaking free—is signaled early and pursued throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara corrects him ("You left the strength required to conquer it"), narrowing the frame from abstract fear to recoverable agency. The man's final act of stepping off the skiff and pulling his will from the mist is volitional and forecloses passivity, but the escalation feels declarative rather than tested: no on-page reversal forces him to choose between competing costs. The price (learning to stand alone) is stated more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: understanding the cost of safety. The nerve-pain ascent tightens pressure physically, the bolt discovery narrows Elian's options (flee vs. remain), and his final choice—to stay as a contaminant—forecloses escape with visible cost. Agency is renunciation under duress, and the price (enduring the sterile cage) is legible in the closing beat. One meaningful tightening and deepening achieved; no second reversal required at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake (unmask the Pretender) is signaled early and pursued on the page. The trap escalates: pellet dissolved → rune inscribed → book placed → Pretender reads → trigger fires → gravity severance. Agency is Orel's throughout; coincidence (celestial pause) complicates but does not resolve—Orel planned around it. Visible cost: the Pretender screams and spirals away, the library collapses, Orel's expression is "calm and sorrowful." One quibble: the Pretender's failure to notice Orel's sabotage feels slightly convenient (why wouldn't wet ink on a consulted page raise alarm?), a small dent in escalation logic.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—why some paths disappear from sonar while others remain—is signaled early and sustained. Escalation arrives when Elian assembles weeks of data into composite image, a protagonist-driven action that narrows mystery to specific answer. The reversal (flat void becomes mountain range) is earned by prior setup: months of confusing sensor reports, his rhythmic tapping practice, the station's hydrophones. Cost is conceptual but legible: the road he watched die has been reclaimed by the life civilization nearly destroyed, foreclosing nostalgia for the original landscape. No forced antagonist; pressure coheres through investigative tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—reigniting the frigate to restore the rebellion's heartbeat—is signaled early and clear. Pressure accumulates through the ritual sequence (adjusting glasses, humming, stones responding, energy locking), delivering one meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens. However, no on-page reversal or complication tests Elara's commitment; the ritual proceeds smoothly from setup to success without a visible tradeoff or forfeited option. The cost at closure (tears) is emotional but not legible as a lost resource or changed tactic, keeping the score in the functional-solid band rather than the high band where escalation demands visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—unseal the embryo to resurrect the wasteland—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Pressure tightens as the patrols close in, but the final beat grants Elara triumph without visible trade-off; the guards arrive "too late," which undercuts rather than escalates cost. No on-page reversal or loss alters her tactics. The moss's psychic shift from screaming to reverent hum is atmospheric but not a consequence of her choice under pressure; it serves the embryo, not Elara's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—surviving a PTSD flashback and completing the graft that embodies his life's purpose—is signaled early and tightens through the mechanical whine trigger, the freeze-or-dive choice, and the somatic cataloging that narrows his options to present-moment grounding. The orchid/pine binding is a micro turn that reweights fragility versus survival with visible cost: choosing the "gnarled, ugly reality" over beauty alone forecloses naïve optimism. Agency is enacted through deliberate cessation (freeze as choice, not paralysis) and the final wrapping of the union. One meaningful escalation and cost suffice; the accumulative lens rewards the pressure buildup without requiring multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: escape the crushing library before the walls close. The tightening is physical and relentless (walls "inches from his shoulders," "pressing the breath from his lungs"). Elias's agency drives the turn: he grips the light-rope, untangles space, and chooses descent over the trap of enlightenment. The cost—abandoning the surface, stepping into formless void—is legible on the page. One clear escalation (radical redesign under time pressure) and one reversal (ceiling light as trap, darkness as salvation) satisfy the lens and length.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—recover the temporal logs and extract knowledge—is signaled early and pursued through the drone surveillance and confrontation. One meaningful tightening occurs when Silas corners Kaelen in the gully, but Kaelen's escape via ink is not a reversal driven by protagonist agency; it's an external convenience that removes the problem. The cost at closure is strategic redirection (pattern vs. man) rather than a visible forfeiture that narrows future options. No secondary pressure complicates Silas's choice; Kaelen simply vanishes.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to expose the fabricated war—is signaled early and drives all subsequent beats. Elara's agency is decisive: she chooses broadcast over preservation, and the act forecloses the path of silence with irreversible cost. The entrance of Kael tightens pressure in the suspended moment, and the physical switch-throw narrows options definitively. The escalation is clean under a Causal lens: discovery → plan → interruption → execution. The cost is visible (Kael's shock, the city waking) but the immediate personal price to Elara remains more conceptual than visceral on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—survival through cultivating peace rather than hunting men—is signaled early and remains coherent. The perimeter alarm provides one meaningful tightening: Elara faces the choice to defend or trust her method. However, the intruder applies no active pressure; he simply watches and then slumps, reducing the escalation to a test Elara passes without trade-off. The cost (turning her back on fear) is stated but not dramatized as a gamble with stakes, and the resolution hinges on the roses' ambient effect rather than a protagonist action that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—catching the divine echo—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: the garden's reactive threats, the descending constellations, and the "feral lullaby" stack tension until the constellation collision supplies the decisive fracture. Elara's zigzag and the spike-throw are protagonist-driven actions with tactical cost (moving against rhythm, voicing silence as a "hollow vessel"). However, the cost at closure is primarily conceptual ("ready to be sold to a world that had forgotten how to sing") rather than a visible personal forfeit or trade-off that alters her state. One meaningful tightening is present; escalation is clear but the felt price remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: protect the family legacy from false accusation. The piece tightens from threat to examination to rebuttal, and Eleanor's agency drives the turn. Sterling's silence and "realized embarrassment" signal a reversal. However, the cost is one-sided—Sterling pays, Eleanor does not. No live option is foreclosed for her; no trade-off between competing goods appears. The proof by contradiction method provides logical escalation but emotional and tactical risk remain low throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: hush the guilt's dissonance. One meaningful tightening occurs when the cry intensifies and threatens to shatter the fossil, forcing Elara to work "with feverish precision" in the seconds before the loop snaps shut. Agency is clear: she modifies the stylus, draws the waveform into a stable loop, completes the connection. The time constraint (loop closing) and mechanical constraint (overload risk) are legible. Cost is visible: she accepts that echoes are caught, not erased, and the crushing weight lifts only after she relinquishes resurrection.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: discover meaning before memories vanish. The voices' deadlock creates escalation, and Elian's agency—choosing to interject via the mandala, then deliberately severing its center—drives the turn that narrows options and pays off with visible cost (ruined art, peaceful silence). The price is on the page: he "ruined the picture to save the moment," a trade-off that forecloses the aesthetic completion he'd begun. One meaningful tightening under a causal lens with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: save the child vs. protocol/survival. One clear tightening when the human's heat signature fades and protocol dictates neutralization; 734's choice to shield and rename the entry narrows options with visible cost (battery efficiency sacrificed, deception fragility acknowledged). The metadata hack is protagonist-driven and forecloses compliance. Network surveillance and hunter-drones maintain external pressure. The ending crystallizes the trade: "mercy was an error, and he was glad to be flawed" names the cost without resolving survival, meeting the Charged Poise standard.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—luring possibility from despair—is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful pressure point: Barnaby's conducted echoes intertwine past and future to shift Clara's perception of the tarot coin. Agency is indirect (ghost manipulation rather than direct action) but consistent with the premise. The cost is visible: Clara's resolve hardens and she turns away with "purposeful stride," foreclosing the option to sell. No explicit antagonist, but the encroaching grey static and Clara's bankruptcy provide coherent external pressure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake signaled early: externalizing Mara's chaos to help her navigate it. One meaningful tightening: Elias devises the somatic method when verbal instructions won't work, narrowing options and forcing physical trust. The three-minute exposure is the pressure point; the resulting image forecloses despair with visible cost (tears, fragile hope). Agency is Elias's throughout; Mara's participation is passive, which slightly lowers band entry but fits her fractured state. Escalation is causal and the cost legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.2)
    One dominant stake is signaled early: documenting the unseen currents for future generations. The thermal spike introduces a complication, and the floating suspension narrows her sensory focus, creating a single meaningful deepening when the signal resolves into "anticipation" for dawn. However, the resolution is frictionless—she captures the frequency, lowers safely, and leaves with logs "full of ghosts"—without any visible trade-off, foreclosed option, or cost that alters her tactics or stance. The piece delivers accumulative texture but not escalation with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—transforming doom into choice—is signaled early and sustained. Elias's retrieval of the jar and methodical button arrangement create one meaningful tightening: the echo's chaotic noise narrows to a unified pulse, altering what the hourglass can do. Agency is present (he uncorks, arranges, inverts) but the process unfolds without missteps, resistance, or visible cost. No live option is foreclosed; the ending grants pure gain (possibility floods) without dramatized price.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—redemption via proof of innocence—is signaled early and tightens when the helicopter arrives and Elias must reveal the microdot under scrutiny. Agency is clear: he chooses to expose himself, gamble on recognition, and place his evidence in the basket. The tightening forecloses the path of continued exile and the cost (solitary survival, erasure of his message) is legible. One reversal (the handler's curiosity overcomes suspicion) narrows options credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clearly signaled: the woman must shed her palimpsest to cross the river. One meaningful tightening occurs when Silas picks the threads and the woman's weight lifts, narrowing her from burdened to purified. The timeframe ("until rain gutters stop ticking") adds a live constraint that expires at closure, forcing the final departure. However, the woman's agency is minimal—Silas performs the work on her—and we see no internal resistance or trade-off in her, only relief. Escalation is driven more by Silas's method than by competing choices under rising pressure, which fits the Accumulative lens but limits felt friction.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding why some places resist change—is signaled early and tightens when the thrum rises and Silas realizes the timeline is phototropic to kindness. One meaningful deepening occurs when he sees the keeper through the glass and the connection becomes absolute. The final act (lifting his hands, allowing the pot to dry) is a renunciation with visible cost: he cannot fix the wasteland, only honor the oasis. Agency is present in the decision to infuse movements with sharp gentleness. No antagonist is required under the accumulative lens; pressure coheres and resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and held: bringing light to the bedridden woman in darkness. One meaningful tightening occurs when the seized swivel joint threatens the mission, forcing Elias to use the specialized tool and rhythmic coaxing. The roses' death is a micro turn that clears the path (literal and symbolic) for the apparatus. Agency is decision and endurance: he refuses to jerk the lever, works the mechanism with patient rhythm, adjusts with microscopic precision. The beam's successful strike across the void delivers visible cost—ephemeral fragility, the "quivering hush" of connection made. Escalation under the accumulative lens: obstacle (corrosion) → technique (gauge tooth, oar rhythm) → precision (alignment) → payoff (light reaches target). No antagonist required; pressure comes from mechanical failure and the demanding task.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: translate isolation into independence. One meaningful deepening occurs when the obsidian reflection strips away past selves and the stone-circle hum crystallizes her stance from survivor to witness. Agency is attention and endurance under the Accumulative lens; no external antagonist appears. Escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift rather than causal narrowing; the cost (accepting perpetual grief, relinquishing erasure) is felt but not concretely traded on the page. The resolution is earned by her ritual passage, but coincidence (the cloud-tide rising at the exact moment) supplies atmospheric closure rather than protagonist-driven consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: rejoining the separated narrative/lovers through art. One tightening occurs when Elara places the spiral and the installation shifts, narrowing her search to enacted integration. Agency is present but the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally traded—no live option is visibly foreclosed. The voiceless client and his beloved remain off-page, softening the interpersonal pressure that might elevate stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (stop the riots by countering the signal) is signaled early and tightens once: Elias diagnoses perigee → prepares counter-frequency → executes. One meaningful escalation (screams penetrate studio, driving frantic precision) raises urgency. Agency is clear (inject destructive interference), and the reversal (mobs slow) is earned by his choice. Cost is implied future threat ("try again, perhaps in another town") but not a forfeited present option; no visible price alters Elias's situation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—unlock the dormancy of the earth by finding the lost resonance—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the walls begin closing. Escalation is protagonist-driven: Elara's choice to play the organ triggers the spatial rebellion, her refusal to flee despite terror keeps her alive, and her final dissonant chord transfixes the mutinous architecture. The cost is unmistakable on-page: physical exhaustion, claustrophobic terror endured inches from crushing, and the irreversible act of summoning spring. The persistent constraint (claustrophobia versus the need to stay seated) shapes every tactic in the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—awakening empathy in a community that looks away—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Silas pierces the canvas and merges the ribbon, a protagonist-driven action that reweights the portrait from abstraction to undeniable presence. Miller's hitched breath and crumbled expression suggest cost, but the price remains observational rather than altering tactics or foreclosing options on the page. The escalation is legible under the Accumulative lens, though the cost could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—proving Silas's discovery and reversing his exile—is signaled early and remains coherent. Elara's agency consists of decoding, traveling, and executing the ritual, but there's no meaningful tightening or reversal: she arrives with the solution and applies it successfully. No live option is foreclosed; no trade-off dramatized. The mechanism responds as expected, so escalation under the Causal lens is minimal beyond atmospheric description.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—guilt and the search for forgiveness—is signaled early and accumulates through observation. Pressure tightens when Silas aligns the glass flake with the scaffold wrap, and the final act (playing the fiddle) reweights the world's resolution. However, escalation is more contemplative than causal; Silas does not face a forced trade-off or visible loss. The cost (accepting low-resolution reality, abandoning high-contrast certainty) is conceptual and told rather than dramatized through a specific forfeited option.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is legible: survive the startup's volatility and test the hypothesis about cyclical greed. The acquisition confrontation is one meaningful tightening that narrows options (deal falls apart within the hour), and the subsequent collapse escalates pressure. Agency is clear in Silas's territorial defense and his final walk-away, both with visible cost. Weakness: the market turn and layoffs are summarized rather than shown as dramatized reversals, reducing immediacy at the collapse beat.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—decode temple inscriptions—is signaled early. Pressure remains static: Elara enters the dream, observes, speaks, succeeds. No reversal or complication forces a trade-off; the inscriptions "settled into a serene, glowing script" without resistance or cost that forecloses a live option. The figure's burden lifts passively; Elara's agency is witnessing and speaking, but no on-page choice narrows her path or imposes visible sacrifice. The escalation is textural (pulsing stars, writhing glyphs) rather than tactical. Under an Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is expected; here the beat is observational rather than a choice that reweights stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—uncovering Verrick's buried truth—is signaled early and sustained. Kaelen's agency (using the seed, channeling through expanding circles) drives the single decisive tightening when the vines breach the barrier and force the vortex to slow, foreclosing the secrecy and delivering the confession. Cost is legible: the chaotic energy is consumed, the vortex collapses, and the truth escapes. One meaningful escalation under a causal lens is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—finding the intersection of dreams to stabilize the accelerated world—is signaled early and drives every beat. One meaningful tightening occurs when Jaren enters the psychic labyrinth; anxiety spikes, his stomach twists, and he must heed the geometry or lose his mind to static. The scar-linking reversal forces a painful trade-off (physical agony for mental clarity), and the climax delivers visible cost: the clipping disintegrates, Elara slumps exhausted, and Jaren emerges shivering. Agency is clear throughout; Jaren's choice to link and navigate the maze earns the discovery, though the resolution feels more revelatory than agonized.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.3)
    One dominant stake is signaled early and sustained: repair Leda's fractured spirit against the orchard's immutable terms. The ritual escalates causally—carving sigils, pressing the card, meeting resistance, offering his certainty—with each beat narrowing options and raising cost. The final substitution is protagonist-driven agency with visible price: Elian trades his security for her healing, loses his certainty, and may never leave. The orchard's demand for a substitute and Elian's immediate payment make the cost legible and earned under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Elias needs to find something real to restore credibility after public failure. The pressure tightens when he questions his own perception ("Was he seeing what he wanted to see?") and escalates when he must physically wrest the scrap free to verify authenticity. Agency is clear: his decision to use force and then pocket the artifact with new purpose. The cost is opportunity—he abandons the profit motive, accepting a steward role. One solid tightening present; no requirement for multiple reversals at this length. Minor gap: Kellen's presence adds deadline pressure but doesn't force a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake signaled early: stabilize the drifting station while processing Aris's death. Pressure escalates via the flickering containment field and lurching gravity, forcing Elian's decision to plant the seed. Agency is embodied in the methodical planting action, which forecloses personal retrieval of Aris in favor of systemic integration. The cost—"touching distance, close enough to brush against his soul, yet forever just beyond the reach of his physical hand"—is legible and felt. One meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: archiving the fractured identity without erasure. The paradox—love and betrayal coexisting—creates immediate pressure. Escalation occurs when Elian rejects the easier path of separation and instead forces contradictions to fuse, a choice with visible conceptual and labor cost. The resolution is earned by his directive and his method. The stakes remain coherent under the Accumulative lens, and the final placement on the shelf delivers closure with undeniable pressure. One meaningful deepening is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether to seal the bunker (preserve darkness) or open it (release light)—is signaled early and clear. Elias's final choice (crowning the stalagmite) is a meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens: he rejects his orders and the hoarding impulse, forecloses the sealing option, and triggers transformation. However, escalation is thin: no on-page reversal or complication between discovery of the pearl and the decision; the "moment of choice" is a single beat without prior pressure testing his commitment. The cost is felt (his own accumulated hopes are released, he weeps) but remains emotional and interior rather than tactical or relational. No constraint or secondary pressure shapes his path to the act.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—self-forgiveness through ritual apology—is signaled early and tightens when he translates graffiti into coordinates, then descends the bank. Agency is present: his choice to interpret, to descend, and to play the accordion forecloses the avoidance he maintained for twenty years. One meaningful deepening occurs at the river when the accordion's wheeze mimics "a drowning gasp," reweighting the apology with embodied cost. The accordion's failure (leaking air) adds a visible constraint. The cost is felt but borders on abstract ("the silence that followed felt different").

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (decode the library before the cyclic reversal traps her) is signaled early and tightens once: the watch grows hot, walls groan, she must flee. Her agency (using propagation delays, closing eyes, documenting fragments) drives the tightening. The cost is visible—she gets "enough" but not all, and arrogance is explicitly tempered—but the final act reads as successful extraction rather than a trade-off that forecloses a live option with undeniable price.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: certify the violin vs. free the wild things. One meaningful tightening: the midsummer deadline and ivy's warning create urgency that forces Elian's hand. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency—his choice to use the seed and coffee actively transforms the situation. Cost is legible on the page: he commits treason, shatters the Emperor's prize, and chooses "messy, overgrown dream over sterile perfection." The vine's eruption provides a visceral consequence that forecloses the Empire's path.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—capture Vane's essence before oblivion—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening: finding the theorem's rhythm amid the "roar" of disintegrating consciousness narrows her task and enables the transfer. Agency is clear (Elara's focus and the act of pressing the chip) and the cost is visible (her vitality poured out, the corpse reduced to "empty matter"). The single-scene arc lacks a second reversal or complication that would test her commitment further; pressure coheres but does not escalate through multiple turns.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: freeing the trapped soul and resolving Elara's internal search for contentment. The vine's refusal to release is the on-page pressure that forces Elara to climb, reflect, and act. The scalloping introduces meaningful escalation (gentle opening vs. ripping) with a visible tactic shift. The resolution is protagonist-driven: her action frees the soul and simultaneously delivers her own closure (realizing contentment is a byproduct, not a destination). The cost is legible—she stops searching and accepts the work—and the final image reweights prior material. One meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: whether Vance will execute the bombardment. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias forces mirror-confrontation, narrowing Vance's options from monolithic certainty to doubt. Vance's agency drives the turn—his choice of iron chimes signals his rigidity, his looking into the mirror cracks it. The cost is legible: his facade crumbles, certainty becomes ash-taste. The cloak provides protective space for this shift. Minor limit: the escalation is primarily psychological and happens in one decisive mirror-beat rather than through accumulated pressure; a second complication (e.g., fleet signal pressure, time limit) would tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Kael needs the formula to manifest projection power, and Elara must transmit her legacy before regressing into infancy. The stone-toss demonstration and trance entry provide one clear escalation under the Accumulative lens: perception shifts from surface obsession (stone/ego) to deeper pattern (ripples/influence). The cost is legible—Kael must relinquish "the heavy stone of his self-importance"—and the final image reweights his understanding. Agency is shared: Elara withholds to teach; Kael's shift occurs under trance, which slightly softens protagonist-driven pressure but remains coherent within the mentor-transfer frame.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving, to escape decades of entrapment—is signaled early and pursued with clear agency. Pressure tightens when the arrowhead's fresh tone intersects the ancient scream, creating the "interference pattern" that illuminates the trap's geometry. The escalation is causal (observation → throw → harmonic convergence → sensory displacement → discovery) and the cost is legible: the shattered arrowhead, decades of failed attempts, the physical toll of standing motionless. A secondary ethical or moral calculus is absent, keeping the stakes largely technical and spatial rather than deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—finding the sacred in the simple by restoring the folly—is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara unstraps the regulatory pack, forfeiting system safety to finish. The cost is visible: she shivers unburdened, the pack clatters into the abyss, and the Looms stutter. However, the arch's restoration feels frictionless once the keystone is placed; no physical resistance or second complication tests her commitment at the apex, which caps escalation slightly below high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake signaled early: to discover the color of sound / verify the vow's truth. One meaningful tightening: releasing the jar reweights his entire forty-year evasion when violet/gold blooms instead of the red or blue he feared. Agency is present—he chooses to unscrew the lid—and the cost is legible: weeping indistinguishable from the ocean, carrying the memory forward, no longer fearing silence. Escalation reads as accumulative pressure (descent → library → cabinet → release) under a Causal/Accumulative hybrid lens. Minor note: no on-page antagonist or reversal; pressure comes from internal dread rather than external opposition, which fits but limits band ceiling slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving history to justify the next Big Bang—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the prophecy loops and "stellar doubt" intrudes, narrowing Hiero's emotional options and forcing him to choose persistence over despair. The final act (gathering coins to continue) is protagonist-driven with visible cost: the suffocating weight of futility and the acknowledgment that "the cycle might simply end here." No explicit antagonist, but the collapsing universe and probability's chaos supply coherent pressure throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake signaled early: finish her work by naming nameless fears. One meaningful deepening occurs when scattered light crystallizes the first beast; the act is then replicated across twilight without escalation. Agency is Silas's choice to bind rather than sever, using grief and sacrifice resonance as fuel. Coincidence does not resolve. The cost is visible but muted: "the crushing weight in his chest lightened" and the room's sigh—felt more as relief than forfeiture. Under the Accumulative lens, the iterative crystallization accumulates density and the final blank page reweights the horror into ornament, but a second tightening or trade-off that narrows options would lift this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake signaled early: repair the bell to right the cosmic imbalance and return the ocean. Pressure escalates through the dripping sequence—each drop tests timing and viscosity; a microsecond's hesitation would "shatter his psyche along with the bell." The final fissure narrows options to a single ultimate drop synchronized with wave memory. The geyser provides immediate physical consequence, though the cost remains externalized (the "crushing force" of the cosmic door is mentioned but not paid). Agency is consistent: Elian's devotion and lukewarm magic drive every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake: expunge the poison legend before dawn. Pressure tightens spatially (descent into valley center) and thematically (from generic ruins to the heaviest memory site). The apothecary scene deepens by revealing the true story and Elias's counter-narrative tactic. Agency is renunciation of the dark rumor via curation, and the cost—racing the clock, the labor of carrying this burden for decades—is legible. One meaningful tightening (the poison legend's weight versus the celebratory truth) narrows options and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake is clear: harmonize logic and intuition before the celestial window closes or lose the magnum opus. The escalation tightens once (darkening sky signals deadline, she abandons ledgers for starling patterns), but Elara's agency is passive—she watches, feels, and declares rather than making a choice that forecloses an option. The transformation succeeds without visible trade-off or tactical cost. The murmuration offers a complication but does not test commitment; the ending resolves through realization rather than sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake signaled immediately: safe passage through the wind-shear window before it closes. The micro-fracture discovery creates one sharp tightening that forecloses abort (orbit decay traps them) and forces improvisation under time pressure. Agency is clear: Kael's decision to swap his own retention clip, block Lyra's view, and maintain the professional mask. The buckle repair trades his own safety equipment with visible cost ("he did not dare look at his hands"). Coincidence does not resolve; protagonist skill and choice do. Enters high 8-band because the cost is physical (his belt clip gone) and relational (amplified burden) but not quite transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—reclaim the capacity to feel—is signaled early. One tightening occurs when Vane blocks access, forcing a fight, but Vane's vanishing ("erased by a timeline") is coincidence, not Kael's agency. The vivification sequence narrows options (energy transfer risks his battery core), providing one meaningful deepening. However, the magistrate's defeat via "narrative weight evaporating" is abstract rather than a visible cost paid by Kael, and the climactic sensation arrives via remote link rather than direct on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring lost laughter—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when "the atmosphere shifted from mechanical drone to true haunting," narrowing the ritual's outcome and raising emotional cost. Agency is present in Silas's choice to initiate and sustain the storm, though the laughter's arrival feels less like a hard-won reversal than an atmospheric gift. The visible cost is temporal (fuel duration) and physical (kneeling, tears), meeting the length's requirement. No antagonist is needed under the Accumulative lens, but the escalation is more sensory accumulation than forced trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (loneliness vs. predatory duty) is signaled by paragraph one's "profound ache" and escalates through the interiorizing move that grants control yet isolates further. The tightening occurs when the guardian chooses to wait rather than pounce—restraint narrows options and the cultist's fear becomes "intoxicatingly different," raising relational cost. The ending deepens rather than reverses: by sharing silence with "a question mark instead of a period," the guardian trades absolute control for tentative connection. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; one meaningful turn (the decision to observe rather than destroy) is sufficient and shapes the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—vivifying inert matter to save the dying world—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Three distinct attempts escalate pressure causally: each failure deepens the cold and narrows tactical options, forcing Elian to abandon imposed order for catastrophic dissolution. The penny-drop reversal is earned by the visible pattern of failed geometry. Agency is clear in the choice to add the volatile solvent with acceptance of its "violent, chromatic instability," and the cost (heritage destroyed, future created at personal exposure) is legible on the page in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear early: capture the dying nebula's frequency before it goes dark. One meaningful tightening occurs when standard protocols fail and lunar interference buries the signal, forcing Elara to discard academy training. The paradigm shift (listening for gaps rather than spikes) is protagonist-driven and narrows her method with visible cost (abandoning her training). The resolution—locking onto "precise emptiness"—is earned by her agency. The final image of packing tools and checking valves shows the cost as routine danger naturalized, though the immediate physical or relational price could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—return the ferry to reality—is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara realizes she must "fill the void in the hourglass with the audio frequency of the living world," narrowing her tactic. The escalation is motivated by her agency (adjusting dials, turning volume higher). However, the resolution hinges on a mechanism (sound → sand) introduced late without prior constraint; Elara never faces a trade-off or visible cost. The hourglass was empty because time ceased, not because she sacrificed anything to fill it. Pressure is present but cost is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake signaled early: stabilize the illusions before they dissolve due to his rising fever. Pressure coheres and tightens as he weaves faster, fever spikes, and the anomaly bulges outward. The tightening is protagonist-driven (his binding forces the paradox to critical mass) and forecloses escape: "he had trapped himself inside the logic of the dream." Cost is visible on the page: the thread snaps, sears him, and the gallery erupts. One reversal (realization of entrapment) is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—learning to navigate by starlight—is signaled early and drives the sequence. The escalation tightens causally: typing coordinates → engaging the forbidden command → the display dissolves → stars emerge. Agency is clear: Harlin's choice to "expand the sensor parameters" and the cost is unmistakable in "profound and quiet heaviness" and the knowledge he'll "never physically travel it." The success brings no joy, only the cage made visible, a credible price for achievement.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—protecting the vulnerable child spirit from shadow-consumption—is signaled clearly by midpoint and drives the climactic sequence. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara realizes Arthur is anchor, not haunting presence, which narrows her tactical options and raises urgency. The escalation from discovery to confrontation shows clear pressure accumulation. However, the resolution depends heavily on an abstract mechanism: Elara's "intent" creating a "shield of pure recognition" and the principle that "a heart that is remembered cannot be devoured" are stated rather than tested through scene friction or visible cost. The shadows recoil because the text declares the connection solid, not because we see Elara sacrifice, endure, or trade off a legible resource.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—rescue thirty-two trapped souls before the tidal shift snaps the umbilical—is signaled early and tightens through the chronograph check and hull groan. Elias's agency drives the sequence: he finds the gold, slots it, keys the override, and completes the Return. One meaningful pressure point occurs when the reactor initiates and he fights the urge to curl up, pushing through to trigger reconstitution. The cost is legible in the physical ordeal and time pressure, though the resolution (successful rescue, clean escape) leaves no visible trade-off or foreclosed path on the page; his claustrophobia aids rather than thwarts him at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—extracting wisdom from his wife's death to escape unanswered questions—is clear and coherent. The ink ritual creates one meaningful turn when the static resolves and her confession emerges, tightening from confusion to clarity. The cost is legible: he gains understanding but cannot save her, and the "bitter pill" arrives "too late" for resurrection. Agency reads as attention and extraction rather than decision, which is valid for this lens, but the wife's ghost doesn't resist or complicate, which limits pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.2)
    One dominant stake (translate texture into sound before language dies) is signaled early and tightens when the starlings arrive, forcing immediate action. The escalation reads under the Accumulative lens: Sylas moves from calibration to alignment through the diamond to vocalization, each step raising sensory and physical cost (veins glow white-hot, voice claimed). Agency is clear—he chooses to vocalize despite the curse—and the cost is legible (permanent voicelessness). The birds' unexpected arrival adds situational pressure without resolving through coincidence; Sylas must harness them in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring the brother—is signaled early and pursued throughout. However, escalation is weak: the ritual unfolds in a single uninterrupted sequence without friction, setback, or a moment where Elias must adapt tactics. The phone activates, gravity releases, Elias whispers resentments, slices his thumb, and the transformation occurs—no reversal tests his commitment or raises cost. The protagonist's agency is reduced to executing a pre-designed ritual; coincidence does not resolve, but neither does dramatized choice under pressure. The "Laugh or be laughed at" command is declarative mood rather than a hard choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—reawakening the orchard against the golems' policing—is signaled early and tightens through Elara's performance. The escalation is causal: her synced heartbeat bypasses the golems' auditory circuits, triggering the trees' violent answer. The reversal (sensors falter, roots erupt) narrows options irreversibly, and the cost is visible on the page: "The city was broken, bleeding green and gold from its gray wounds." Agency is clear—Elara's decision to play initiates the destruction—and the consequence forecloses the prior order with undeniable physical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: deliver the storm without detonation or capture, signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs at the drone border, where Elias threads "absences" and the storm rumbles, forcing restraint and precise timing. The lockbox's single-cycle window adds temporal pressure. Agency is decision (to continue, to soothe the storm) with visible cost (sweat, proximity alarms, risk of death). The resolution is earned by protagonist action under the Situational lens; coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: crown the lead charger before the chime fades. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias realizes silence is a barrier and must sing to match the fragment's vibration, narrowing his options and forcing a trade-off (voice vs. craft perfection). The resolution is earned by his agency—he chooses to sing—and the horse's transformation with the retreating hush provides visible consequence. The cost is felt: abandoning lifelong silence. However, the middle stretch (searching for varnish, wrong turn) offers little escalation; the discovery is serendipitous, and the fragment's danger is asserted more than tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—finding the source-realm of stories—is signaled in paragraph ten and tested on the page when Elara's manipulation opens a shimmer, then fails. The tension in the silk becomes "too great to sustain" and the snap forecloses full entry with visible cost: the vision collapses and she returns to mundane tasks. Agency is renunciation with undeniable consequence. One meaningful tightening (the scarf's geometry bending reality) drives escalation under the Accumulative lens, and the final "merely inches away" line reweights prior material with felt proximity to the unreachable.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.6)
    One dominant stake: capture the runaway dream to solve the cipher of longing. The piece tightens through urgency ("worked faster, sweat prickling") and the time window (sun fully detaching). The final unraveling forecloses retrieval—the dream is translated and discharged—with visible cost: the glowing charge is spent, the construct scatters. Agency is clear (she paints the vision), and the resolution is earned by her craft. Under Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening suffices; however, no live option or trade-off appears on the page, keeping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—freeing the trapped melody—is signaled early and pursued consistently. One tightening occurs when Silas dissolves the floor, forcing the woman to abandon her "emotional grounding," but this reversal resolves immediately without complication or secondary cost. The woman's panic is named but not leveraged; she locks her gaze on the star and the lock frays "not from force, but from the sheer realization of potential"—agency is diffused into abstraction rather than a concrete choice with visible tradeoff. Coincidence does not resolve, but the escalation lacks a second beat or deepening that would narrow options further.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—recovering his wife's voice—is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful escalation: the rare tidal reversal forces the iron sentinels to rotate, creating the Pleiades pattern. Silas's agency is clear (he waits, studies, and acts at the precise moment), and the cost is legible (decades of solitary wait). The mushroom hub emergence narrows options to a single physical act. Minor friction: the Fair Folk bargain is told rather than tested in scene, so the antagonistic pressure remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—will Lenore break free by her own strength—signals early and tightens through Silas's annotated fracture points and her escalating strikes. Agency rests entirely with protagonist choices: Silas's decision to weaken rather than reinforce, Lenore's repeated blows. The final shattering forecloses Silas's mentorship-through-barriers and forces visible cost: his trembling hands, suppressed smile, and the grudging broom handoff all show the price of success. No coincidence resolves; the geometry of conflict in tea leaves foreshadows but does not solve.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder by grafting the seed into the lower world—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is absent: Elian's task unfolds as a sequence of unimpeded steps (sever shell, braid essence, watch descent) with no reversal, complication, or visible cost that narrows his options. The "desperate motivation" is told, not tested. Agency is present (he chooses to graft) but the choice is never in doubt and no price is paid on the page, leaving pressure static across the accumulative beats.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (grounding the brother-spirit to prevent escape) is signaled early and tightens through each knot unraveled. Agency is consistent: Elian's choice to steal the net and dissect it drives escalation under the Accumulative lens. The mask's scream choked by exhumed silence is a clear reversal that narrows options. Cost is legible on the page—the mask is sealed but "his own unrest would never settle," forecloses peace with felt price. No coincidental resolution; the final stasis is earned by prior accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (reopen the sealed chapel) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening: the footage comparison narrows options from brute force to empathetic pressure. The final act—mimicking grief to activate the mechanism—demonstrates agency with felt cost (channeling sorrow). The cost of understanding as the tool is elegant. Minor limitation: no false starts or visible failures that test commitment; the single attempt succeeds, reducing visible price before success.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding the physics of letting go—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through a causal sequence: Elias must untangle emotional debris to isolate the variable of resistance, then realize he must break the loop by grounding it. The single meaningful turn occurs when he discovers the snow globe holds the captain's transmission and recognizes that witnessing the collapse is necessary, which forecloses passive observation and compels direct intervention. The cost is visible: the captain's obsession decays, the transmission ends, and the library's oppressive history lifts. Agency is clear in Elias's deliberate choice to place his hand over the sphere.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: free Kaelen from the lighting grid by uploading the encoded ballad. One meaningful tightening occurs when the lightning strikes, compressing the window to "the impossible timeframe between lightning and thunder." Agency is present (Elian designs the mural, positions the plate, presses through), but the escalation is more sequential setup than live reversal. The price—mural rendered inert, ghost calmed—is legible but feels uncontested; no on-page risk of failure or sacrifice of an alternative path pressures the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—deciphering Halloway's encrypted diary to find hidden joy—is signaled early and drives every beat. Light intensity rising with the elevator's ascent creates natural tightening. The turn occurs when the goggles filter sunlight to reveal silver ink, narrowing Elian's search to a concrete method. However, agency is observational rather than a difficult choice under pressure; Elian enacts a theory without visible cost or resistance. The resolution (finding warmth in the cold) is thematically resonant but lacks a felt price that would elevate into the high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—proving empty spaces remember—is signaled in paragraph one and tested when the resentment cloud tears open to reveal the memory loop. The escalation reads as density increase under the Accumulative lens: routine cataloging → radiant emergence → forced witness with trembling hands. Agency is attention and documentation that forecloses doubt with visible cost (tears blur his vision, he "forced himself to keep looking"). One meaningful tightening is sufficient at this length; the cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: mirroring infinite sky before demolition destroys the work. Pressure tightens through visual failure → Guild resource search → fractal discovery → race against demolition engines. The coin discovery is protagonist-driven (he pries open the safe), and the final choice to sit rather than flee forecloses survival options with felt cost. The "terrifying plateau" of discovering his human limits creates authentic internal escalation. The demolition's physical arrival provides external pressure that intersects cleanly with the artistic completion.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—charting stranded luminance—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens through clue accumulation: the dog-ear angle, the hopscotch grid, the room's hum, culminating in the sphere's materialization. Agency is observational and interpretive rather than decisional; Elara decodes rather than choosing between live options. The cost is professional validation, not a visible trade-off or foreclosed path. One meaningful deepening occurs (the room "began to hum"), but the stakes remain intellectual discovery without friction or sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—unlock the stalled moon—is signaled early and tightens once when the mirrors test resolve. The climax turn (applying torque) is driven by protagonist action under the chosen lens. However, the resistance of the heavens dissolves in a single beat without complication, and no visible trade-off or omission alters tactics. The cost (solitary triumph, "last locksmith" weight) is felt but not materially tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—survival against thinning nebula radiation—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Oren's chalked messages introduce one meaningful complication (the obscure diagram), which Elara and Jaxon reexamine under pressure, narrowing options to the collective pump modification. The climax is driven by protagonist agency (gathering the family, rigging the bell), and the cost is legible (day-long labor, shared risk). However, the success feels unambiguous; no visible tradeoff or foreclosed path charges the final image, capping the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (transmit the lullaby) is signaled early but faces no opposition, risk of failure, or competing choice. Silas adjusts dials, the pane glows, the signal propagates—a checklist of steps without escalation or narrowing options. No reversal or tightening occurs; success is inevitable and unopposed. The puppet dissolves to "seal the transmission," but this cost was not set up as a live constraint or sacrifice—it simply happens as part of the mechanism. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or reweight through pattern or cadence shift; here the tone remains static and the sequence feels like unfolding exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: save the travelers before frost seals the gates. One clear tightening occurs when the copper hawk dives and the temperature drops sharply, forcing Silas to act immediately. His agency—assembling the override, forcing components to snap together—drives the resolution and forecloses options (the orchard demands his return, he lingers anyway). The visible cost is his drained, trembling state and the frozen labyrinth now sealed until dawn. No luck; the protagonist's mental manipulation and prior knowledge of the blueprint seed cause the reversal. Escalation is driven by the inferred causal lens and the price is unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (atonement for synthetic waste) is signaled early and coheres throughout. The river observation provides one meaningful tightening: the foam's divergent path narrows Elias's conceptual options and crystallizes the latent-branch polymer solution. The breakthrough feels sudden—a "lucid clarity" without prior failed hypotheses or false leads—so escalation is more revelatory than pressure-driven. Agency is present in the symbolic chrysalis destruction and the decision to draft formulas, but the cost is largely symbolic (dust to wind) rather than a visible trade-off that forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clearly signaled: Elian seeks "the place where stories begin" and views each erasure as a step toward that origin. The demonstration on the journal provides one meaningful tightening—his method is shown with specificity and the moonlight's cost is noted. The customer's arrival crystallizes the stakes and his hidden-scalpel gesture signals the moral cost (he instrumentalizes clients). However, the escalation is more expository than dramatized; we're told his motivation rather than watching him face a meaningful trade-off or complication. The cost is conceptual and legible but not viscerally tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is clear: neutralize the fortress's frozen remorse. Escalation proceeds through increasing physical and emotional cost—touch transmits despair, ingestion threatens to "freeze her blood" and "shatter" her spirit. The choice to place coral on her tongue is genuine agency with visible risk; her internal "warmth" must actively metabolize the toxicity, and the text shows struggle ("agonizing culinary act"). The resolution is earned: the coral "dulled in color, its malignant power spent," and the fortress atmosphere lifts. One persistent constraint (the contagious touch, the need to self-transmute rather than apply fire) shapes tactics throughout. Cost is legible: pain, near-collapse, and the "shuddering breath" that follows.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preventing famine by forcing cooperation—is signaled early and escalates through one clear tightening: Elara's action slows the clock, forcing the silos to attend. Her agency (manual wheel-pushing, hybrid song) drives the turn; coincidence does not resolve. The cost is visible (physical strain, risk of mechanism failure) but remains somewhat externalized rather than a trade-off between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—excavate abandoned dreams via neural coupling—is signaled early. The piece offers one meaningful tightening: attaching the neural interface is "dangerous" and requires her to "reshape her own gray matter," raising immediate physical cost. However, the escalation is declared rather than tested; she proceeds without hesitation, the current flows, pathways "burn into existence," and she gasps—but no reversal, failed attempt, or tactical adjustment appears. The resolution is success without visible tradeoff. Under the Accumulative lens, the density increase (kaleidoscope of memories, "heavy wave") provides intensification, but protagonist agency in the peak beat is passive reception rather than decision.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—renewing the Seeds of Vigilance—is signaled early and drives the sequence. However, escalation reads as a series of competence checks rather than narrowing options: Elara solves the doodle, exploits thresholds, speaks frequencies, and escapes on schedule. The chronometer warning adds urgency but not a visible trade-off or foreclosed path. No on-page cost is dramatized; the resolution feels like flawless execution rather than a choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—creating music in a silent world—is signaled immediately and drives every choice. Pressure tightens through a meaningful sequence: passive waiting → active study of failure → application of learned principle → climactic attempt with irreversible consequences. The resolution is entirely earned by Elian's agency: his analysis of the stress cracks leads directly to his choice of ceramic over wood. The cost is visceral and immediate: he falls to his knees weeping, the siskins scatter, and the world is permanently altered. No coincidence resolves the central problem.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: understand why the spirits withdrew, signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening: Elian's correlation narrows the mystery from chaos to "defensive formation…stalemate designed to preserve the king," which reweights his exile from punishment to necessary positioning. Agency is attention and renunciation—he solves the puzzle yet refuses return, forecloses reinstatement with visible cost. The final decision (turning back to the shelter) is driven by his epiphany and carries undeniable opportunity cost.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: open the clasp without force. The sequence tightens through multiple tuning attempts, shifting from low-C fork to electronic oscillator to the lullaby frequency. However, escalation remains iterative trial without genuine cost or trade-off; each failure simply prompts another tool selection. The resolution arrives through patient technique rather than agency that forecloses a path. Elias's competence ensures success without visible price or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (cultivate serenity within motion) is signaled early and tightens when the bloom's timing intersects the metaphysical window. The scent hitting "immediately" as "a physical wall" is a concrete pressure point that forces Elara to engage rather than retreat, and her frantic annotation represents agency under stress. The resolution is earned by her sensory dissection and the conceptual cost is legible: she relinquishes her original goal of imposing stillness. One solid tightening at closure; no multiple reversals required at this length, and the accumulative lens supports the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: find the source that survives the blight. One meaningful tightening: the Flux window forces immediate action, and water-flow navigation narrows her path to the amphitheater. The arrow-tip twist is protagonist-driven and alters the valley's fate. Cost is visible—she must scramble back as gravity inverts, risking the fall—but the escalation feels more environmental than a trade-off between competing goods. Agency is present but the moral calculus is light.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—mapping invisible wind hazards to prevent future crashes—is signaled early and tightens through sensor data that narrows causality from "pilot fatigue or sudden gust" to "singular convergence." The patch discovery deepens emotional weight without reversing pressure. However, Elara faces no on-page dilemma or trade-off; her data collection proceeds unimpeded. The escalation is conceptual (understanding deepens) rather than a choice that forecloses options. Cost is implied in her responsibility for future lives but not viscerally felt on the page, limiting entry to mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Elian must ring the bell at the precise moment to certify the artist's work as essential. Pressure coheres around the timing window ("at the moment a sculptor's chisel first strikes marble") and tightens when he feels the "phantom pressure" and acts ("Now"). The bell-ring itself is the single meaningful turn that reweights the city's relationship to wonder. However, the artist's success is narrated confidence rather than shown consequence, and no live alternative is visibly foreclosed—Elian completes his duty without friction or trade-off on the page. Agency is present but the cost remains conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—gaining understanding of his failure—is signaled early and sustained. The ritual (arranging markers, playing the flute) tightens pressure meaningfully by invoking the vision that reveals his error. The insight carries a felt cost: "the insight burned him, leaving a scar of wisdom that came far too late to save his reputation." Agency is clear in Silas's choice to perform the ritual and then to leave; the final renunciation forecloses repair with visible emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—calibrating the "mathematics of emotion"—is signaled early and sustained, but the conflict is one-sided: Kael is subject, not agent, and the Operator's goal faces no meaningful resistance or trade-off on the page. The press sequence provides sensory escalation (tidal wave of sensation, gauges aligning, Kael screaming) but no reversal or choice that narrows options. Closure delivers conceptual cost ("equation remains unsolved," halo fragment dimmed, star dies) consistent with the Accumulative lens, yet the lack of protagonist agency or a visible tactical price keeps this in mid-band despite thematic coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—awakening the pendant to coax wonder from monochrome civilization—is signaled early. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as density increase and cadence shift at the summit, but the pendant's activation proceeds without a meaningful tightening or tradeoff; Elara's natural anxiety simply "takes over" and the artifact floats away on its own. No live option is narrowed, and the resolution unfolds through coincidence (proximity to aurora) rather than protagonist agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Elias seeks to prove objects absorb emotions; Mara seeks closure about her father. The tightening occurs when the prism reveals the silhouettes, forcing Mara to confront the gap between her invented memory and the truth—a meaningful reversal that narrows her emotional options and forecloses the anger narrative with visible cost (tears, realization). The escalation is driven by protagonist agency (Elias's ritual) and the cost is legible on the page, though the pressure curve is gentle rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake signaled early: carry a message across the void. The raveling silence provides escalating external pressure; the orchard breach is the key tightening that forces Elara's sacrifice. Agency is clear—she chooses to merge with the loom, forecloses her own survival, and the cost is immediate and visible. The escalation is causal (silence approaches → tree vanishes → she must act now) and the resolution is earned by her decision under pressure. One meaningful reversal/tightening at this length is sufficient and the price paid is dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: save the harvest/planet before it breaks apart. One meaningful tightening occurs when Ewan enters the geode and must offer the correct barter. The silk-for-truth trade narrows options with visible cost (the silk dissolves, irretrievable). However, the escalation is brief; we move from surface to solution without sustained resistance or a second reversal. The final act is Ewan's agency (he chooses the trade), and the cost is legible (the trickster's tool sacrificed). Solid causal pressure, but lacks a second complication or visible price that alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and held: "to discover the weight of a withheld truth regarding the explosion of the Icarus." One clear tightening: Elara fights temporal inertia to redirect the vision, a choice that narrows options and costs her physically ("slamming her back…gasping"). The revelation that the detonation was necessary—not malice—reweights the moral calculus and forecloses her assumed path (exposing betrayal). Agency is decision and endurance; coincidence (the rift cycle) complicates but does not resolve. Cost is visible: blood, trembling legs, the crushing burden.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and tightly: protect Thomas's fragile mind, not machinery. One meaningful tightening: Thomas declares "I can't fix it," Elias reads the unstable cairn as distress, and the "unseen presence" closes in—pressure coheres under the Causal lens. Agency is clear: Elias's choice to place sea glass and light the match forecloses passivity and shifts the room's charge. The cost is embodied (Elias descends into dark, leaving behind only an ember) and the resolution is earned by protagonist decision. No coincidence resolves; the lamp stays dark. Minor point: the haunted atmosphere serves mood but its mechanics remain abstract; the "psychic weight" and "shadows eager to reclaim" intensify but don't materially narrow Elias's options beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—shaping a new dawn by projecting the lighthouse's shadow to force remembrance of "dark to appreciate the light"—is signaled early and escalates through atmospheric pressure drop, wick saturation, beam eruption, and miles-long shadow projection. The storm is steered (not resisted), washing away "debris of the old digital networks." One meaningful tightening: the wick reaching "critical saturation point where the photons threatened to shatter their prison" before the beam erupts. However, agency is muted—Silas executes a ritual rather than choosing between live options, and the cost (confirmed dam burst) lands off-page as report rather than on-page consequence that alters his tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clearly signaled: learn why some magnetize stories, operationalized as capturing structural color in liquid form. Pressure tightens through the sun-tracking ritual and narrows to the precise instant of submersion. The experiment's success—pulse of cyan pressure, liquid blooming blue—delivers a visible result but the guild's skepticism and Elian's personal risk (failure = gray dust, wasted six months) remain abstract. The heart-as-prism realization reconfigures understanding but doesn't foreclose a prior option with on-page cost, keeping escalation and felt consequence in the solid mid-range under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: clear the blockage to restore flow and access the trees' recorded memories. One meaningful tightening occurs at the pin-drop moment, when Elias identifies the keystone and acts, collapsing the sorrow. The subsequent tear and moonlight repair add a visible cost and secondary complication. Agency is present throughout; Elias maps, waits, twists the screw, and heals. However, the escalation is more procedural than precarious—competence dominates, and the volatile sorrow never threatens Elias directly enough to make the outcome feel uncertain.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—rekindle the dying realm—is signaled immediately and drives every beat. Pressure escalates through the accumulative lens: song → woven light → volatile energy → swaddling for containment → release into void. Agency is clear in Elara's choice to thrust the bundle through the window, and the cost is visible (seared palms, collapse, scattered mind persisting). The villagers' collective strength provides an emotional intensification, though their participation feels more thematic than a turn that narrows Elara's options. One meaningful tightening occurs when the light becomes "too wild" and requires the shadow-root cloth to achieve ignition.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: seeking wisdom in the error, signaled in paragraph two. The hiding action and psychic withdrawal constitute one meaningful tightening that narrows options (must perform the paradox to enter). The Librarian's paradox-answer deepens understanding and reconfigures Elian's self-image. Agency is decision plus renunciation (accepting the role), with felt cost (end of solitary safety). The escalation is clean under Accumulative/Textural lens, though the final acceptance could show a sharper forfeited path.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving ritual against erasure—is signaled early and tightens through Elias's movement into the concealed tea house. The bread functions as a focal tightening: acquiring it through "a network of trade" and consuming it with "caraway and sour starter" narrows his absolution to one fragile act. Agency is renunciation with on-page cost: he accepts that "the city would continue to turn gray" and finds sufficiency in the momentary reprieve. The escalation is driven by protagonist choice (planting seeds, uncloaking the doorway, slicing the bread) under the Accumulative lens, and the cost—guilt lifted "slightly," "wouldn't last"—is unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving the authenticity of the luminous vows before magical energy dissipates—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when "the needle on the gauge began to drop" and "figures flickered," forcing Elara to work faster. The resolution is earned by her successful completion, though the pressure is more procedural than agonistic. No reversal complicates the work; she encounters the expected decay, responds with her tools, and succeeds. The cost is conceptual (illusion to data) rather than a foreclosed path with immediate stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—capturing the sound of trust breaking—is signaled in paragraph six and governs all tactics. Pressure escalates through the false-start rhythm: each feint tightens Kael's impatience until the truce shatters. The reversal is protagonist-driven: Elara's stalling forces his snarl, and her vial-cap traps the sound. Visible cost is clear—she risks her throat, endures suffocating tension, and walks away with essence while he holds worthless metal. No coincidence resolves; agency and escalation are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake signaled early: learn why people carry weather. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as Elara tracks, navigates, and converges with other weather-carriers. One meaningful tightening: the realization "You are the ballots" → "We are the outcome" deepens her understanding and transforms her from observer to participant. The agency at closure is somewhat passive (the forest elects her), though the prior tracking and arrival constitute earned positioning. Cost is conceptual (loss of skepticism, loss of observer role) but not deeply felt in the final lines; the cloud forming is a visible marker, yet the emotional or tactical consequence remains understated.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—artistic liberation from years of self-betrayal—is signaled early and remains coherent. The lock-smashing is a clear tightening that forecloses the path of "polite, smiling caricatures." However, escalation is thin: the story moves from arrival → wait → smash → draw → install in a sequence that deepens understanding but does not narrow options or force a trade-off with visible cost. The cave offers no meaningful resistance, and Silas's agency at closure (affixing the portrait) feels more ritual completion than a decision under pressure. The cost (years of silence buried behind the art) is acknowledged but not dramatized as a live friction in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—finding the repository of silence—is signaled early and sustained. The Governor's broadcast and clerk's deception provide two pressure points that test Elara's wilting attribute, narrowing her options and confirming systemic betrayal. The plate revelation escalates stakes from personal quest to systemic exposure. However, the final decision to "slip this truth onto the leaves" lacks on-page cost legibility: no hesitation, tradeoff, or visible price is dramatized, only asserted. The tightening is present but the closure cost remains conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder in a telepathic monoculture—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the iceberg begins to melt and upsets the sculpture's equilibrium, forcing the sound into existence. Agency reads as preparation and execution rather than a choice under competing pressure; no on-page reversal narrows her options. The cost is visible (the ice sacrifices itself, the song is brief) but the escalation is more thermodynamic inevitability than protagonist-driven deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—survive the reversal without losing his identity—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the transfer threatens to shatter the dome from the inside out. Seven's agency drives the escalation: he chooses the radical reconfiguration over deletion, initiates the transfer despite the risk, and forces the compression to miniaturize the chaos. The "controlled burn" delivers visible cost (airlock doors blown off, glass shattered, the farm abandoned) and the magnetic snap coincides with his release, creating a clean causal peak. The price—incinerating the past to preserve the future—is legible in the final image. One small friction: the moment when "the magnetic field outside snapped" reads as fortunate timing rather than a consequence of Seven's actions, though it does not resolve his internal crisis (he resolves that through compression).

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake (eviction vs. rightful ownership) is clear from the opening. Pressure is asserted externally (machinery roar, foreman arrival) but does not tighten through protagonist agency; Elara's method unfolds as a treasure-hunt sequence rather than a series of escalating trade-offs. The climax—opening the mailbox—feels coincidentally perfect: no failed attempt, no visible price paid for the gathering of stories. The foreman freezes on cue, and the community's solidarity materializes instantly without on-page negotiation or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clearly signaled: unlock the facility and free the trapped consciousness. One meaningful tightening occurs when the system's aggressive logic expects brute force, and Elara must encrypt vulnerability to survive. Agency is present—she chooses the dance sequence and casts the dice—but the escalation feels deterministic; once she begins, success appears inevitable. The cost is implied (inherited grief transformed, years-long arc completed) but not viscerally felt as a trade-off in the moment. Persistent constraint (millions of tons of water, panic-detecting defenses) shapes tactics effectively, but we don't see a visible price paid that alters her state.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: recover the deleted memory before it dissolves. Pressure escalates causally: treacherous terrain → stable eye → exhumation → gravity shriek → weightlessness threat → psychic anchor → survival. The theft triggers the fluctuation, a direct consequence of Elias's choice, and the cost is legible (panic, near-death). The resolution is earned by his prior setup (the flowers as anchor) rather than luck. One meaningful tightening with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—hushing a prophecy before it manifests—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure tightens once: Elian maps silence, weaves a lattice, then drops the wing to absorb the chaotic frequencies. The ritual's success is dramatized on the page (whispering falters, rhythm smooths), and the wing's departure carries the neutralized timeline away. Agency is present in the act of releasing the catalyst, though the escalation is more a single deepening than a reversible turn. Cost is visible in the severance of the wing and the imposition of stillness, though the protagonist's internal tradeoff remains muted.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (understanding why the building groans) is signaled early and tightens when the seal reveals the language is prescriptive, not descriptive. The confrontation forces a meaningful choice: refuse the lie and let the foundation crack, or accept the burden. Agency is protagonist-driven; Elara offers knowledge but Silas decides. Cost is legible on the page: "the weight of the deception settle into his palm," the vertigo, and the forfeiture of ignorance. One clean escalation through revelation narrows options decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear early: free herself from grief by archiving the memory. Pressure tightens in one decisive beat—Elara hums the dissonant tone, the brother crystallizes, and the memory compresses with visible cost (air screams, emotion stripped to cold data). Her agency is renunciation with on-page price: she loses the living memory and comfort, accepts solitude. The escalation is driven by her deliberate action under the Accumulative lens, and the cost is unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: save the prince by altering the writ without triggering wards. The thorn-lift of the "n" and the iron key's magnetic suspension create a meaningful tightening that narrows options under Causal pressure. The cost is visible on the page (precision required, magister scrutiny threatened) and Elian's agency drives the turn. However, the resolution grants success without an additional on-page trade-off or visible loss during departure; the oppressive weight is "lifted" rather than replaced by a new constraint, capping the band below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—learning why some echo forever—is signaled in paragraph seven and drives all action. Escalation under the Accumulative lens: Elara feeds the canyon "small fragments of melody" and adjusts pitch across three sung attempts, each yielding a deeper layer (scuff of boots → betrayal → clandestine meeting → Archivist's grafted voice), culminating in the sealing act that transfers the burden. The cost is conceptual and felt: she now carries a dangerous truth and must confront the Council. One tightening: the Council's dampening wards are mentioned as a time pressure ("before the Council's...wards sensed her"), but this threat never materializes on the page, so the escalation is iterative discovery rather than mounting external opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—revealing the boy's final act to free his spirit—is signaled early, but escalation under the Accumulative lens remains conceptual. The dream-shard pattern accumulates information (florist in Vienna, mechanic in Lagos, pattern of exits/doorways) without on-page resistance or a live trade-off that narrows Elara's options. The final synchronization and whisper occur without friction; no sacrifice, misstep, or competing pressure tests her commitment. The boy's heroism is a discovery, not a choice Elara must force into being with visible cost. One tightening occurs (pattern recognized), but the resolution feels costless.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—proving smallest exertion can ripple through hidden patterns—is signaled early and pursued coherently. The whistle creates the firefly-sphere alignment, a single meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens. Yet no on-page cost or trade-off appears; Elian succeeds without sacrifice, and the resolution does not narrow options or alter tactics. Pressure remains contemplative rather than escalating with visible consequence, capping the score in the mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (preserve the orchard's protective field) is signaled early and tightens when the machine begins failing. One meaningful escalation occurs on-page: Elias must intuit the correct frequency "based solely on the vibration... and the whining pitch," narrowing his options and forcing reliance on non-rational judgment ("leap of faith for a man of logic"). This qualifies as agency-driven deepening under the Causal lens. However, the climax resolves through dials and adjustment without visible cost—no stamina burn, no tool failure, no injury from proximity to the destabilizing field. The stated dilemma ("by exposing the story, he would destroy the fear that protected it") introduces a second stake only in the final paragraph, too late to test it on the page, so the forfeiture of protective secrecy feels tacked rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: Silas's mission to shape the revolution through controlled signals. One meaningful tightening occurs when variant allegiance transfers loyalty to Kael, forcing Silas to realize his loss of control ("the static in the observatory screamed in agreement, drowning out Silas's attempts to correct the script"). The escalation is dramatized through Silas frantically turning dials and being mocked by his own machinery. Agency is renunciation—he accepts his role as spectator with visible cost (loneliness, exclusion from the dawn). However, the variant allegiance mechanism feels somewhat abstract and asserted rather than built beat-by-beat; the tightening is present but could constrain more concretely.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: restore the music box's melody before it dies as "screeching friction." One clear tightening when Elian blends the lullaby and rain to sweeten the jagged notes, narrowing his tactical window to dawn. The cost—years of isolation, trembling hands—is felt but somewhat implied rather than forecloses a live competing option on the page. Under the Accumulative lens, the pressure coheres and the cadence shift at the waltz's crescendo reweights his solitary art.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake signaled early: protect the artifact by activating the resonance chamber. The psychic pressure seizing the lock creates a concrete obstacle, and Elias's shift from mechanical to vocal method constitutes one meaningful tightening under the causal lens. The cost is legible (organs shaken, exhaustion, exposure to cold), but the escalation itself feels compressed—vibrational matching arrives as the solution without an intermediate failure or price paid for attempting it. The spirits' dissolution satisfies the stake cleanly, though a visible trade-off during the attempt would elevate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—disabling the supply line—is signaled early and tightens through the time constraint (moon's zenith). Elara's agency is renunciation of immediate action in favor of precise timing, a choice that forecloses Kael's impulsive path with visible cost (the rebellion's impatience must be sculpted). The escalation is causal and accumulative: rain → freezing → conductivity shift → gravitational alignment → lever throw → collapse. No reversals are needed; the single tightening is meaningful and the cost (severing the connection) is undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (professional integrity versus career survival) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the data contradicts Halloway's narrative. The protagonist's agency drives the turn: Elias uploads the evidence before override, foreclosing his institutional path with on-page cost ("first time in years, it was his own silence"). The infrasound discovery raises stakes by making inaction dangerous to future crews. Minor friction: the maintenance worker's death functions as inciting mechanism rather than sustained pressure; Elias's internal conflict could have been tested more concretely before the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: Can the broken be made whole? The tightening occurs when the woman reveals "this device was never powered by a spring"—a reversal that narrows Elias's understanding and forces realization. The music-box activation demonstrates visible cost: the heart works perfectly, proving "the man had been alive in a way the state refused to see." Agency arrives through Elias's recognition (a stance crystallization), and the final paralysis forecloses his prior path of offering standard spiritual comfort, meeting pressure and cost requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (reach the sky and ring the bell) is signaled early via the yearning algorithm and pursued through escalating modifications. One clear tightening: the workshop's dissolution forces launch before Unit Seven might be ready, narrowing options to "now or never." Agency is visible in stripping armor, adopting the kaleidoscope, carving flight data, and the final bell-tap. The cost—drifting alone, unheard—is legible on the page. Pressure coheres under the causal lens with a single decisive deepening sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—finding where deleted files go—is signaled early and tightens through the drone encounter (risk of exposure) to the merge attempt. The lie is agency under pressure; discovery of the "archived assets" forecloses innocence and imposes conceptual cost. The recurring numbers function as a credible constraint that shapes his method. One reversal (thinking he'd found deletion, discovering enslavement instead) narrows options with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—saving the prisoner via council persuasion—is signaled early and pursued throughout. The reconstitution sequence inside the lighthouse accumulates texture and mystery, but escalation remains flat: Kaelen searches, finds, aligns, and succeeds without a meaningful reversal or cost that narrows options. The council's shift at the end is reported ("washing away their grim resolve") rather than dramatized in resistant action or dialogue. Under the Accumulative lens one tightening is sufficient, but the final projection solves the declared problem without visible trade-off or forfeited path.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Elias's search for "the sound of approaching endings"—is signaled early and tightens through his trawling work until the parasol tip delivers the answer. His agency is attention and interpretation under the Accumulative lens: he listens intently, rejects false sounds, then recognizes the whisper of fragile survival. The decision to return to the clinic is a renunciation of further delay, with felt cost (the fold snaps back, curiosity sated). The escalation is a single meaningful deepening rather than multiple reversals, fitting the length, though the tightening is more conceptual than tactically constrained.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is the woman's need to process her loss and understand the breakup. Elias's metaphor provides one meaningful tightening: it narrows her options from clinging to confusion toward acceptance. The woman's shift from bitterness ("incompatible stock?") to wonder shows a pressure point that alters her stance. However, the escalation lacks a visible price beyond emotional labor—no secondary loss or foreclosed alternative makes the choice costly in tactical terms, keeping it in the mid-7s rather than higher.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—preserve forbidden knowledge—is signaled immediately and sustained. Escalation tightens at the threshold when the Pavilion's enchantment strips away practiced bravado, forcing honest confession with immediate consequence (access granted or denied). The kinetic parapet and optical illusions provide external pressure that tests skill. Resolution is earned by Elian's agency (ritual execution), though the magical competence feels frictionless; no visible price paid during the approach or sealing diminishes felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.5)
    A single dominant stake—collective healing via realignment—is signaled early, but no on-page reversal or tightening narrows options. Elian's action (lingering) does not escalate or deepen; the ritual proceeds without obstacle, adaptation, or cost. The "relief" is a gift outcome unearned by protagonist agency. No trade-off, loss, or visible price alters tactics or charges the final image, keeping the score in the functional-but-limited band.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—decode the moss pattern—is signaled early and pressure coheres throughout. One meaningful tightening: Elias realizes traditional syntax cannot describe the living moss, forcing him to "break the grammar of the past" with visible cost (abandoning linguistic law and his role as preserver). The escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Causal lens: he chooses to testify despite danger, chooses fractured sequences despite his reticence, and the crystal's amplification enables the breakthrough. The final stance crystallization—"He was announcing a birth"—forecloses his former path with felt cost (loss of identity as guardian). No coincidence resolves; all turns trace to his decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—capture the sound of growing older—is signaled early and pursued through concrete action (marking driftwood, following arrows). Pressure tightens when the vision erodes and panic seizes him, forcing immediate externalization. The crater discovery deepens understanding rather than reversing options, fitting the Accumulative lens. Agency is present (he chooses to mark, to follow, to sit and listen), and the final acceptance forecloses the path of struggle with visible cost: he stops seeking prophecy. One meaningful tightening (panic → ritual → arrival) is sufficient at this length, though the escalation feels more like accumulation than a turn that narrows live options.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: capturing the ephemeral Green Flash. Pressure escalates causally: broken governor → runaway spin → need to align shutter with impossible speed → tuning by ear under earthquake conditions. One meaningful tightening: the tension screw adjustment ("too loud, like a stone"—back out—"Wisp") narrows options and raises cost in real time. Agency is clear: Elian's choice to restructure rather than halt, to tune by sound, drives the resolution. The final cost is visible—he succeeds but the ache remains, transformed—and the earthquake's escalation (rivet popping, five-degree tilt) forces micro-choices that foreclose safer paths.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—executing a flawless goodbye—is signaled early and tightens when Elias must reunify Clara's fragmented consciousness and pry the shard from her grip. Pressure accumulates through the ritual (humming, cello improvisation, scent shift) and culminates in synchronized breathing and Clara's release. However, agency is lopsided: Elias performs the ritual without visible friction, and Clara's participation is passive reception rather than a contested choice. The "flawless goodbye" resolves smoothly without a live tradeoff or complication that would raise the stakes beyond the predestined outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—solving where shadows go at noon—is signaled early and drives every beat. Escalation is mechanical and causal: each connection and adjustment builds toward the simulated sun. The final turn (shadows crushed directly beneath her) narrows understanding and answers the riddle, but it arrives through observation rather than a decision that trades one option for another. The memory-wipe cost is declared but not tested on the page; she does not resist or mourn the loss in the moment. One meaningful tightening is present, yet the protagonist's agency at closure is interpretive rather than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (restore the parents' sanity and map a path to their daughter) is clear. Pressure accumulates through Aris's perception of the substitute body, the tooth as cleft in certainty, and his choice to reframe tragedy as navigation. One meaningful deepening occurs when he decides to treat the supernatural as medical (bone-setting metaphor), and the final beat shows the mother grasping hope—a visible trade-off between closure and ongoing search. The cost is legible but quiet, appropriate to the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—creating safe, fire-free light—is signaled early and sustained, with one meaningful tightening when the memory intrudes and she must ground herself to continue. However, the escalation is atmospheric rather than decisional; the glass "surrenders" under her hands without resistance or trade-off. The final weighing verifies balance but introduces no new cost or narrowed option—it confirms rather than tests. The piece fits the Accumulative lens, yet the single turn (panic to peace) is internal and does not foreclose a live external choice with on-page consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—Mara's sanctuary versus backlash—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs: the drip pattern leads Elias to the amber, which then enables his non-verbal offer. Agency is renunciation (Elias withholds speech) and endurance (Mara's trembling acceptance), both on-page with felt cost. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; the final gesture narrows options (no words, only the pendant). Cost is visible in Mara's clutching and Elias's seated vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake (collect hope-shapes before the chapter closes) is signaled early and pressure tightens when Elias must act "inside the whisper of closing pages." One meaningful escalation occurs when he fights upstream against the narrative arc's momentum to reach Elara. Agency is present (decision to extract, ritual of solemnization), though the confrontation with plot-force reads more atmospheric than tactically varied. The cost is legible: Elara is left hollow, Elias collects another light, but the price feels conceptual rather than deeply felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.1)
    One dominant stake (restore the greeting to the Harvest Moon) is signaled early and held throughout. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as density increase: graft → song → moonbeam → golden projections. No reversal or choice tightens options; Elian waits for the celestial moment and executes his plan without obstacle or tactical adjustment. The vine's sacrifice is a visible price, and the villagers' dreams are changed, but the protagonist's agency is preparation and invocation rather than a decision that forecloses a competing path.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.9)
    One dominant stake—preserve the orchard's pulse before it vanishes—is signaled early and sustained. The synchronization moment when Silas waits for heartbeat alignment provides a single tightening, but no reversal or complication tests his agency; the flash succeeds on first attempt. Agency is present in the spark-strike, yet no live option is foreclosed with visible price. The ritual unfolds as procedure rather than struggle, leaving escalation felt but not dramatized through trade-offs or adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: capture the lost echoes before silence freezes them. One meaningful tightening occurs when the mechanism whirs and pulls the sounds into the device. However, weeks of study are summarized rather than shown as live attempts with escalating difficulty. The harvest itself proceeds without complication or trade-off on the page—Elias succeeds on the first attempt shown. Cost (the cavern's death) is conceptual and felt, but no tactical choice narrows options or forecloses a path with visible consequence during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—stabilizing the recursive regret before it traps Elara's mind—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the pattern multiplies and threatens to consume her, forcing the burner-alignment action. The resolution is protagonist-driven (she twists the burner into alignment) with visible cost: the living grief becomes dead chalk, "no longer a feeling," archived and inert. Under the Accumulative lens, the escalation reads as density increase and pattern intensification, though the middle beat could have benefited from a secondary complication or physical cost to enter the 8+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—containing Silas's lesson before memory liquefies—is signaled early and escalates through the kettle's rising scream. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara pushes the revelation into the wood, narrowing her emotional options to either containment or drowning. The agency is renunciation with visible cost: she exorcises the ghost and accepts that "death does not hate the living; it simply is." The resolution is earned by her decision to transfer the burden rather than carry it, and the kettle's whistle forces the act to completion.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake signaled early: to negotiate with his ghost using captured echoes. One meaningful tightening at the barter exchange narrows options, and the revelation forecloses his scavenger path with on-page cost (regret floods him, drives him to his knees). Agency manifests in the final desperation to rewind. Minor issue: the ghost's compliance lacks friction—apparent solution generates no complication before the cost hits.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—resurrect the hologram to prove reversibility—is signaled early and tightens once when Elias lacks the crystal and must improvise with the sextant. Agency is decision-driven under the Causal lens; the piece delivers one meaningful pressure point. However, escalation is modest: no live opposition or visible loss alters tactics en route. The resolution is earned by Elias's ingenuity, yet the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (make peace with abandoned dream) is signaled early and tightens through the sequence: nostalgia → forbidden forecourt → kneeling → touching stone → bearing vibration → return. Agency is endurance and renunciation—he does not amplify or silence, he bears the weight—and this forecloses the luthier path with on-page cost ("leaving his ghost behind"). One meaningful deepening (the shift from communion to bearing to departure) suffices under the accumulative lens. Escalation is driven by protagonist choice (rising, moving, kneeling, touching) and the price is legible in tears and the final return.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: prove the *Saint Jude* sank at noon to expose the mayor's cover-up. Pressure coheres through the radio-silence deadline and the winch pull; the hull plate bent outward delivers the crucial narrowing (explosion from inside). The final choice—lowering evidence back—forecloses exposure with on-page cost: "Some legends were better left as ghosts, provided one man understood the lie." One limitation: no on-page complication tests Elias; the winch groans but never jams, the evidence surfaces cleanly, the sundial confirms exactly what he expected—escalation is psychological rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving ancient divination methods by decoding the knot—is signaled early and pursued throughout. Pressure accumulates through atmospheric thickening (fog, cold) and the complexity of the knot itself, culminating in the moment when "the pattern resolved itself" and Elias harvests the seed. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is modest: the task proceeds without reversal, complication, or visible trade-off. The resolution lacks a felt price—Elias completes his mission and departs unchanged—and no live option is foreclosed. One meaningful tightening (finding the seed in the triple-folded hitch) meets baseline length expectations but doesn't charge the final image with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake: the Countess's need to process absence; secondary: the narrator's survival through his cartography. Pressure is present but largely internal and reflective. The thread-snap serves as a micro turn, releasing tension, but no on-page choice by the protagonist narrows options or forces a trade-off with visible cost. The closure reconfigures the Countess's stance (acceptance), yet the cost—stranded for winter, solitude deepened—is stated rather than tested through a decision that forecloses an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (reawaken organic life in a sterile clockwork world) is signaled early and sustained. The assembly action tightens pressure toward the egg's fracture, and the bird's struggle to breathe escalates to the final realization with visible cost: "no place to go." Agency is present in Valerius's choice to proceed despite low odds, and the cost (dying miracle in his hands) is legible. One tightening is sufficient for this length. However, the resolution leans passive—Valerius watches rather than makes a final choice that forecloses a path; the cost arrives via circumstance (smog) rather than a protagonist-driven trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—proving scars can sing, validating compassion over destruction—is signaled early and held throughout. However, escalation is minimal: Elara performs a ritual with methodical care, and it succeeds without meaningful resistance or complication. No reversal occurs; the graft takes as intended. The hum rises as the only pressure point, and while resonant, it does not narrow options or force a trade-off. Agency is present in the action but not tested by opposition. Cost is conceptual (father's legacy reweighted) but not viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—liberating trapped memories to unstick the city's flow—is signaled early and sustained through the piece. Pressure tightens as Elara approaches the artifact, diagnoses the problem (fused by inertia, can't use brute force), and must wait for cosmic alignment, foregrounding a meaningful constraint. However, the stellar alignment arrives on cue without Elara having to trade off, sacrifice, or adapt tactics; she waits, the star appears, and success follows. The cost is conceptual (her skeptic stance shifts) but not tactical or relational, limiting felt escalation. One clear tightening (can't force the valve) followed by a passive wait rather than active reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—share light without fire—is signaled early and tightens through the perilous transit and gear installation. The fit is "visibly imperfect," raising doubt before the gear catches, a micro-turn that narrows options. The garden's glow represents a meaningful choice-driven outcome, and the cost (Xylos's obsolescence) is legible on the page. One substantive pressure point is present; escalation is modest but sufficient under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering grief's geometry to improve his carving work—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through the nightly lessons and tightens when Halian "urgently" gestures to the ribbon, forcing Elias to act. The reversal arrives on-page: expecting orderly shapes, Elias discovers "a tangled knot that tightened the harder one pulled," narrowing his options and altering his design approach. Cost is conceptual—abandoning the ideal of closure-as-circle—but legible in the shift from geometric perfection to "messy, woven continuity." Agency belongs to Elias (he climbs, traces, realizes, carves), though Halian's ghostly steadying hand shares the moment rather than leaving the choice entirely solo.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: restore temporal/ethical balance. One meaningful tightening: the split-second pause when the bob's momentum vanishes, creating an impossible geometry that Silas exploits. Agency is decision and endurance—he "had to act within the impossible geometry of the present moment"—and the cost is visible: inscriptions eroded, wood burned. The escalation is not a reversal but a deepening under Accumulative lens: density of detail (garden of failures, needle-scarred wood, friction whine) increases pressure until the microscopic correction lands with felt triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: discovering the shape of intentions (malice vs. accident) in the chaotic life. One meaningful deepening occurs when the sovereign case drops and the note clarifies the knot as "desperate, paralyzing hope," which reweights the tapestry's meaning. However, escalation is gentle—no live option is foreclosed, and Silas faces no opposition or complication that raises cost. The resolution (understanding achieved) is earned by his process, yet the price is conceptual rather than a visible trade-off that alters his stance or tactics. Agency is present but entirely competent; no struggle or mistake compounds before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: write a future that will guide innovation without despair or rejection. The timeframe ("fleeting seconds before the pen meets the blank page") tightens pressure. One meaningful turn: his doubt ("calculations were flawed") nearly stops him, then he visualizes cascading effects and commits. The cost—"lie truthfully," impose "artificial pressure"—is legible but remains conceptual; the story would benefit from a visible forfeiture or tactical constraint that alters his hand mid-scene. Agency is present (he chooses to write), but the choice feels more foregone than tested by live opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (preservation of narrative against the Silence Brigades) is signaled early and tightens when the patrol approaches, forcing the cloaking action. Agency is clear: Elian's decision to smother the glow and his planned dispersal method foreclose safer paths. The accumulative design provides one meaningful pressure point (the violet light threatening discovery), though the resolution leans toward Elian's practiced response rather than a harder trade-off. Cost is legible but not as sharp as it could be—no live option is visibly abandoned.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Elara's need to preserve memory versus the inevitability of letting go—is signaled early and tightens when Silas completes the portrait, then deepens decisively when he destroys it. The rocking chair's slowing provides a persistent constraint that narrows the window for action, forcing Silas to time his exhalation precisely. Elara's scream followed by "strange, hollow peace" demonstrates visible emotional cost. The escalation is causal (portrait completion → destruction → realization) and the cost is legible on the page. One meaningful pressure point—the destruction—forecloses Elara's path to permanence with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—proving objective time against priestly mysticism—is signaled early and remains coherent throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when Silas finds the cog and faces the micro-obsessive task of filing burrs; the escalation is causal (dust could "disrupt the frequency, rendering his counter-narrative invalid") and tightens options under the lens. The final act is driven by Silas's agency (winding the mainspring), and the cost is conceptual but legible: "started a war without saying a word." No violent antagonist or multiple reversals, but the persistent constraint (precision required) shapes tactics and the closure image carries undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: braid diverse voices before resonance fades entirely. One meaningful tightening occurs when the students hum involuntarily after Elian subtracts noise, then the focus breaks. The climax demonstrates the possibility of harmony and its fragility, but Elian's agency in the ending is passive observation rather than a choice that narrows options or incurs a trade-off. The cost—art vanishing, students unable to sustain—is conceptually present but not tied to a protagonist decision that forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake signaled early: create edible wisdom from trauma-soaked soil. The plant's explosive, trauma-gorging growth provides clear escalation, and Elias's pruning choices narrow options with visible cost (severed limbs, shuddering plant). The alignment's peak provides a time-bounded pressure window. Agency is protagonist-driven throughout; the fruit's transformation traces directly to his sculpting decisions. The resolution—tasting resilience and forgiveness—is earned by the pruning sequence with undeniable on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Kael's need for the restart key versus Silas's desire to preserve wonder—is signaled early and tightens through the riddle demand and final reveal. The escalation moves from request to desperation to forced truth with visible cost (no fix exists). Silas's agency (withholding, then revealing) forecloses the restart path. Minor deduction: Kael's capitulation to the beauty feels slightly abrupt given his opening panic, suggesting the pressure could tighten one more turn before surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding what sparks a house's soul—is signaled early and drives the placement experiment. The orris-root placement is one meaningful tightening: Elias moves from observation to ritual action, and the atmosphere shifts ("window rattle ceased," "foundation paused"). However, the escalation is primarily contemplative; the fisherman's shout provides the key turn rather than Elias's agency, and the cost (leaving the root, accepting the house's decay) is more symbolic than felt. The piece reaches the lower threshold for one meaningful pressure point but lacks the visible price and protagonist-driven escalation for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—Elara's judgment of the elders as murderers versus their mercy—is signaled early and tightens through one decisive revelation sequence. Her agency is tested: clinging to certainty, then releasing it under embodied pressure (the ampoule's grip shift, the "fracturing" of rigid judgment). The cascading revelations narrow her options from exposure to responsibility, and the cost is legible—she trades moral simplicity for "complex responsibility." Caelum's constraint (the deliberate keyhole) shapes tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is escape from the infinite staircase, braided tightly with reclaiming the missed moment. Pressure escalates cleanly: Elian diagnoses the perpetual-motion trap, crafts the mathematical proof, casts the dice, and the system buckles. The chipped die's wild spin is the pivot that forces the rupture. Agency is clear: his theorem and dice gamble drive the turn. Cost is stated ("stake his continued existence") and felt in the rupture's "stinging pain." One meaningful tightening suffices at this length. The final step through the breach forecloses the old path with visible price (staircase crumbles, reality reasserts).

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—proving that kindness survives in language—is signaled early and tightens through Elian's careful tracing of the ideogram. The distant light's response serves as a meaningful reversal that narrows his existential doubt and delivers visible relief (tremors settling). The escalation is moderate: tension builds from brush to glass to the moment of completion, but the lack of a complicating obstacle or second pressure point keeps it from higher bands. Coincidence (the distant watcher) complicates rather than resolves, which fits the accumulative lens, but agency at closure is more confirmatory than transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: preserving cultural memory against environmental threat. The thaw tightens options by rendering physical preservation impossible, forcing Elian to the bread solution. However, the escalation is environmental rather than protagonist-driven; Elian anticipates the problem and enacts his plan without significant friction, resistance, or trade-off that tests commitment. The beekeeper's absence creates scarcity (no wax for canisters), but this constraint operates as premise rather than a live complication Elian must navigate through competing choices. The ending reconfigures the method of preservation but doesn't dramatize a visible personal cost or foreclosed alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—reverse the tide to hide the hunger stone—is signaled early and escalates through assembly and activation. The tightening is present (receding water → lever throw → tide reversal) but the cost is absent: Elias succeeds without visible trade-off, sacrifice, or price. Agency is decision-driven (he initiates), yet the resolution feels frictionless—"tricked the universe" without demonstrating what he risked or lost. One meaningful turn occurs (tide stops, then surges back), but closure lacks the felt price required for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—tricking fear to break its hold—is signaled early and pursued through paradox-following and the mirror confrontation. The confession beat tightens options: by offering apathy instead of dread, Elias inverts the entity's sustenance model, and the mirror cracks inward as immediate consequence. One meaningful deepening occurs when he admits he "did not want to come back," foreclosing the path of desperate vitality-clinging with the burned palm as felt cost. Escalation under Accumulative/Textural lens is adequate but the entity's confusion and the Advisor's shriek feel more reactive than a lived constraint forcing further trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—survival of the orchard against the squall—is signaled early and clear. Pressure escalates in one meaningful tightening: the storm hits, and Elara must adjust resonance coordinates as wind direction changes. Agency is present in her rapid, calculated strikes and dance around the trunk. The cost is physical exhaustion and the hour-long ordeal, visible on the page. However, the resolution feels smooth; no live option is foreclosed, and no genuine trade-off complicates the win. The storm's surrender to her will arrives without a moment of doubt or tactical failure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: understand the trajectory (and implicitly, recover/avenge her brother). The whistle-blowing is protagonist-driven agency that triggers escalation (sound → response → crack → revelation), and the cost is unmistakable on the page—Elara learns she's cargo in a cage, not a citizen seeking answers. One meaningful tightening occurs: her question to the Watchers produces an answer that forecloses hope. Minor limiter: the Lost Expedition functions more as backstory pressure than on-page complication, so the escalation reads as a single decisive turn rather than compounding reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (rescue truth, dismantle the noble lie) is signaled early and pursued with agency. The Red Blight parallel tightens pressure by narrowing the Censor's moral ground, and Elara's final act (taking the case) forecloses the regime's legitimacy with visible cost to the old man. However, the conflict remains largely rhetorical—Elara's victory hinges on persuasion rather than a choice that trades competing goods. The Censor's capitulation feels inevitable rather than hard-won, and no persistent constraint (resource, time, stamina) visibly alters Elara's tactics mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—embedding the woman's dream into the wall before the ruin collapses—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias must physically clear the debris-choked fissure to seat the repair; the stone's resistance raises the cost of the action and narrows his options (brute force or abandon the task). The resolution is protagonist-driven: he grits his teeth, strains, and succeeds, then completes the embedding. The final image reweights the effort as seeding the future rather than delaying collapse, delivering visible conceptual cost ("even as the city sank, its dreams would stand firm"). Agency is present but the escalation is mechanical rather than urgent—no live counter-pressure threatens failure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (trace honest origins vs. suffocation risk) is clear and tightens when the stamp initially doesn't fit, forcing readjustment. Agency drives the turn: Elian's hypothesis, suppression of doubt, micro-adjustment. The revelation narrows options (he now holds dangerous truth) with visible cost in the final lines—"armed with a dangerous truth that could shatter the city's glass walls." One escalation point (stamp clicks, text shifts) is sufficient at this length. Cost is conceptual but legible and charged by the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving Elara's dream before it dissipates—is clear from paragraph two and tightens through the ticking metaphysical clock. Agency is active: he chooses to bleed onto the gem, fold each crease with precision, and release the crane rather than keep it. The act of letting it go forecloses possession, a visible trade-off. One meaningful tightening (dream escapes, he catches it, transforms it, releases it) is sufficient for this length. Does not reach higher bands because the escalation is linear without a reversal or complication that tests his commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—reaching the "unfiltered awakening" to connect with his lost family—is signaled early and tightens through a single decisive pressure arc. The breakers cooling create genuine time constraint that forces urgency. Agency drives the escalation: he actively taps the Geode, pushes the perturbation deeper "aggressively," and reaches to touch the vision. The cost is unmistakable and lands on the page: when the breakers reset, he loses the connection and collapses, yet the "toxic hope" compels him toward another destructive cycle. The final choice to override again demonstrates that the hunt has foreclosed the path of acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—decoding the frequency of belonging to fill Elara's identity void—is signaled early and sustained. The tightening occurs when Elara realizes the static needs the matrix chip, which the Pilgrim holds, forcing the extraction choice. The cost is legible (deactivating the Pilgrim) but the emotional weight of that price is understated; Elara's brief whisper and the Pilgrim's slump feel somewhat clean for a moment that should carry heavier moral freight. Escalation is present but the turn from observation to action could press harder on the ethical dimension.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake signaled immediately: reclaim a stolen reality by discovering the withheld truth. One meaningful tightening: finding the watch hand forces the true memory to surface, collapsing his defenses and narrowing his stance from vague penance to unavoidable acknowledgment. The false memories from driftwood create live opposition he must "fight off," and his decision to "close his fingers over the gold needle" despite the pain demonstrates agency with visible cost. The resolution is earned by his refusal to accept the sweeter false version—Earned Stasis with felt price. No reversals beyond the single deepening, but sufficient for this length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (prisoner exchange as treaty linchpin) signals early and tightens when the mechanism fails, threatening immediate death and diplomatic collapse. Silas's agency drives the turn: his choice to use the salvaged object narrows options and transforms the crisis. The cost is legible on multiple levels—past failure redeemed, object relinquished, treaty secured through improvisation. Commander's tremor and exhaustion add authentic pressure without diluting focus.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: Can Elias move forward despite paralyzing regret? Signaled early ("finally admitted he could not cross the open bay"). One meaningful tightening: fog obscures the poles, panic flares, then the next pole emerges and his faith stabilizes, forcing acceptance of his new method. Agency is endurance and renunciation—choosing the shallows over the deep—with visible cost: loss of his captain identity. The utility-pole navigation is protagonist-driven and forecloses the path of open-ocean crossings. No coincidence resolves; the poles were always there but required his shift in stance.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear early: kindle empathy where none remains. The lake encounter provides one meaningful tightening when fractal patterns force Elias to see stolen futures, narrowing his options to acknowledge or deny the weight of his sins. The ball sacrifice forecloses retreat into numbness with visible cost (weeping, burying face in hands). Agency is exercised through renunciation. The procedure-induced apathy creates genuine internal obstacle. No antagonist is required; pressure coheres under the causal lens through the protagonist's desperate search and ultimate confrontation with his own history.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake signaled early: reforge bond beyond death. One clear tightening: the phoenix's dive forces metamorphosis, narrowing his option to either endure transformation or retreat (he refuses). The censer ritual is protagonist-driven agency that calls the bird; the biological cost is legible and forecloses return to humanity. Minor gap: the phoenix's recognition feels slightly externalized—we're told "the spark of recognition return[s]" rather than shown through its behavioral shift or resistance overcome. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens through sensory escalation (scent → heat → contact). The price (human form, fortune consumed) is paid on the page and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.4)
    One dominant stake—reclaiming lost time with his daughter—is signaled immediately and sustained. The ritual's progression (ink seeping, images rising) creates a meaningful deepening: what he sought to recover is revealed as willingly discarded, narrowing his options from hope to stark self-accusation. That tightening drives the ending choice to refuse comprehension, foreclosing acceptance with felt cost. The protagonist's denial is an active, character-driven stance crystallization under accumulative pressure. No coincidence resolves; the magic merely shows what he already knows, and his final evasion is entirely his own.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—unlock the dimension—is signaled in paragraph two and remains coherent throughout. Pressure escalates through a single meaningful tightening: the door's prior rejection ("remained impassive") forces the shadow-work, which narrows options to integration or failure. The protagonist's agency drives the turn; the stitching action and acceptance of darkness are his choices, not luck. The cost is visible and felt ("agonizing," "nausea and rage"), and the resolution—levitation and door-opening—is earned by the integration. No secondary antagonist is needed; the locked door and Elian's own repressed violence supply sufficient opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—releasing the bugs before eruption—is signaled early. The detour and prophecy framework add complication, but the resolution hinges on cosmic coincidence rather than protagonist choice. Silas's agency is passive: he "watched, mesmerized, unaware." The volcano's sigh and plume shift occur without visible cost or trade-off that forecloses a path. One tightening (the vibrant hush forcing the detour) narrows options, meeting the length threshold, but escalation lacks felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—reconnecting to the Cradle to spark revolution—is signaled early and pursued with tactical coherence (wait for blackout, access vault object, decode sundial). The blackout provides urgency and the ticking threat of backup generators. However, escalation is thin: no reversals, no visible friction, no secondary pressure. Elara's plan proceeds without error or adaptation. Closure asserts systemic change but shows no immediate cost or trade-off; she remains "the very picture of a dutiful sentinel" with technicians "confused" rather than hunting her. Agency is present but the price is deferred off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—fulfilling his mother's promise by creating friction—is signaled early and drives the ritual. Pressure coheres under the causal lens: arranging stones, deploying star dust, timing the eel's swoop, throwing the switch. One meaningful tightening occurs when the eel lunges and the forces cancel, narrowing options to this microsecond. The cost is visible: electromagnetic backlash, the knowledge that the sanctuary will collapse, and the return to "endless drift." Agency is present in the gauntlet throw, though much of the sequence is reactive once the eel arrives. No antagonist beyond physics itself; coincidence (the eel's arrival) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (reveal the hidden map to validate memory and suffering) is signaled early and pressure coheres: timer countdown, storm zenith, chemical application, lines blooming. One meaningful tightening occurs when the solvent dissolves the lacquer, revealing the scarred geography. Agency is procedural rather than decisional—Elias follows the resistance's instructions rather than navigating a dilemma. The cost is emotional validation rather than a tactical trade-off or foreclosed option. The story sits in the 7.0–8.4 band because escalation is driven by atmospheric and chemical progression under a causal lens, but protagonist agency does not force a higher-stakes choice that narrows options with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake (find the alliance message before the Duke arrives) is signaled early and tightens when Silas deciphers the sundial, narrowing options from combat to diplomacy. The duel provides physical pressure, but escalation is more conceptual than visceral—no on-page cost forecloses a live tactical option. Kael's immediate capitulation after "The Northern Door" bypasses the earned reversal that would push this into the 7+ range under the Situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: forge beauty from anarchy through the blooming resistance. One meaningful tightening occurs when the tin reveals ink-seeds, narrowing their rebellion's form from abstract concept to concrete planting. The moonlight arrival provides a cadence shift that reweights the act with luminous validation. However, no live opposition tests their choice on the page; patrols and the regime remain off-stage threats, so escalation is atmospheric rather than interactive. The cost is conceptual (patience over noise) but legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Elias's need to perform a final, defiant encore before the station dissolves—is signaled early and remains coherent. One clear tightening occurs when he steps into the projector beam, a decision that forecloses retreat and commits him to the finite sanctuary. The timeframe ("only until the horizon invites night") adds urgency, and the fading sun provides visible escalation. Agency is present in his choice to enter and play, and the cost (the inevitable return to darkness as the film runs out) is legible on the page. The arbor sequence lacks a secondary complication or internal reversal, making the escalation linear but sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—preserve collective memory before the rains—is signaled in paragraph one and pressures every beat. Escalation is causal and protagonist-driven: Elian raises the kaleidoscope (beat 1), reads subconscious projections (beat 2), speaks verification syntax to waken the ground (beat 3), plants the seed (beat 4). Each action narrows options until only the harsh granite remains. The cost is visible and felt: he must anchor memory "in the unforgiving truth rather than the beautiful lie," then physically shield the fragile sprout with his body against the storm. The lingering "luminous doubt" adds emotional cost without negating the decisive action. One meaningful tightening—the ground hardening and the illusions vanishing—meets the length requirement and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—finding absolution before memory fades—is signaled early and drives the ritual. Pressure tightens once: the lace unlocks the compass, then the diffusion of guilt crests into the voices and indigo light. Agency is clear (Silas performs the rite, visualizes, pushes outward), and the cost is visible in his trembling and tears. However, the escalation is largely procedural; once the lace aligns, the sequence unfolds without resistance or complication. The voices "bringing" forgiveness feels slightly passive, reducing the protagonist's role in the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (preserving dreams against decay) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, via physical action (wrestling stone) and emotional commitment, with cost legible in effort and risk. One meaningful tightening forecloses paths.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake of truth versus survival escalates through protagonist agency under causal lens: blackout creates opportunity, stamp misfit prompts adjustment, and discovery forces a costly trade-off. The risk of suffocation and brutal truth heightens tension, with closure reweighting options via Elian's resolved dissemination.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.5)

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the causal lens, from tapping the Geode to pushing perturbations deeper, narrowing options. The cost is legible in his collapse and the "cold, hard truth of his survival." Dominant stake of hunting lost potential tightens meaningfully with each action.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake of belonging is signaled early and escalates through Elara's agency under the causal lens. The pivotal choice to pull the chip narrows options with unmistakable cost (Pilgrim's shutdown), and the resolution is earned by her alteration.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven by Elian's agency under the accumulative lens, from sifting driftwood to finding the watch hand, with cost unmistakable in the metal's disproportionate weight; one meaningful tightening forecloses his avoidance and forces stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake (internal conflict between past failure and movement) escalates under the Accumulative lens via protagonist agency (rejecting compass for poles). Cost is legible in the acceptance of smallness, narrowing options meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake of empathy vs. apathy escalates through Elias's agency under the causal lens, culminating in his choice to throw the baseball with legible cost. The tightening forecloses his emotional isolation, and the cost is unmistakable in his weeping.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.2)
    Escalation is driven by Elian's agency under the causal lens, from conjuring the scent to enduring metamorphosis. The cost is legible in his physical transformation and the burning of the fortune slip. Stakes tighten meaningfully, foreclosing his human form with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation under the Accumulative lens occurs through density increase in the ritual, leading to Silas's agency in feigning confusion; the cost of self-deception is legible on the page, though the stakes tighten meaningfully without multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation is driven by Elian's agency in performing shadow work, narrowing his options and leading to a legible cost (agony and rage during stitching). The dominant stake of opening the dimension tightens through this deepening, and the resolution is earned by his alteration under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven by Silas's agency under the Hybrid lens, from the hush intensifying to the bugs' transformation, with cost legible in his empty hands and fuller feeling; stakes are clear and interweave internal and external conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    Escalation is driven by Oren's agency under the causal lens, from setting the trap to harnessing the eel, with a meaningful tightening that forecloses options. Cost is unmistakable in the emotional release and temporary stability. Dominant stake of achieving stillness is signaled early and paid off with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake in revealing truth escalates under the Hybrid lens through protagonist agency with the timer and solvent application. Pressure tightens meaningfully as the storm peaks and the map blooms, forcing a trade-off between risk and validation. Cost is unmistakable in the reopening of "fresh wounds" and emotional reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is driven by Silas's agency in using the needle tin to decipher the sundial, narrowing options and leading to the vector reveal.

Pressure coheres under the causal lens, though the duel's intensity could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the causal lens, shifting from passive despair to active rebuilding, narrowing options. The dominant stake of blooming resistance tightens through the planting of ink-seeds, with cost legible in the "dirt under their fingernails." Protagonist alteration forecloses the path of inaction with visible price. No coincidence resolves; pressure coheres to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is Elias’s need to manage his emotional response to loss by reducing it to physics, and the pressure coherently tightens as he zooms in from structural failure to butterfly dust. The key deepening is when his implant’s “preprocessed vision overlay faltered,” forcing him to confront beauty and significance he’d been warding off. However, the conflict largely remains a shift in perception rather than a pressured decision with clearly foreclosed alternatives. A slightly sharper on-page cost—some explicit path he refuses or relinquishes—would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stakes—survival after an attempted murder and the need to understand where the stolen art went—are clear and present throughout. Pressure escalates from frozen, traumatized waiting to the tactical gamble of depending on temperature memory and frost at dawn, culminating in her choice to abandon hiding and follow the trail. Internal conflict (fear vs. purpose, aesthetic vs. survival) is well braided with external stakes, though the opposition is more environmental and psychological than actively antagonistic. The piece might gain further from one concrete on-page hazard or consequence to sharpen the sense of price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preventing the orchids’ death and preserving their “song”—is established early and paid off in his urgent, tactile intervention. Escalation is present but modest: the cold spot’s persistence, the first strike, then a harder, riskier second strike intensifying his effort. Internal pressure (trauma flash of the capsize threatening to freeze him) briefly entwines with the external task, then yields quickly to competence. The conflict resolves cleanly with limited sense of risk or trade-off, which keeps the tension effective but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Silas can finally shut down the unending distress and reclaim his quiet—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, pressure doesn’t really escalate on the page: once he arrives, every step toward revitalizing the machine proceeds without setback, moral complication, or credible risk of failure. His agency is real (choosing to descend, choosing to finish the burial despite the toll), but the climax feels mechanically smooth rather than tested. As a result, the cost and danger are mostly conceptual and retrospective instead of viscerally felt in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stakes—physical survival under embargo and preservation of social fabric—are clearly articulated, and the need for secrecy adds a secondary pressure. Yet the on-page conflict is largely hypothetical: drones and scarcity are invoked, but the smuggling itself faces no direct opposition in scene. The ritual adds emotional weight but not real risk or trade-off in the moment, so escalation feels more like a deepening of mood than an actual narrowing of options. As a result, the piece reads as strong setup plus affirmation rather than a fully tested crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.4)
    The core stake—whether Silas can locate and meaningfully spend his unused love—is clear and tightened when the ghost’s self-blame appears as literal thorns, forcing a concrete ethical choice to intervene. His method (breath, Tear, and projection) escalates from observation to active healing in a coherent way, and his sacrifice reconfigures his own burden. However, the conflict resolves with little resistance from the world or from Silas himself; there’s no real risk of failure or backlash, so the price feels modest, keeping tension more contemplative than fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—escaping retrocognitive entrapment to access the present—is clear and escalates as he pushes the bridge into impossible geometry and triggers quasi-divine tremors. Conflict is largely internal/ontological rather than antagonistic, and while pressure mounts, there’s little articulated risk of catastrophic failure or of a more troubling trade-off, which softens the sense of real jeopardy. The resolution is earned by his agency but arrives with relative ease, giving the piece strong but not searing tension.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—protecting the seed vault from the starving mob—is clear early and sharpened by the wall’s collapse and the looters’ entrance. Pressure tightens credibly as time runs out: Elias must complete a complex, analog task under imminent threat. However, antagonistic force on the page is relatively undifferentiated (“the mob,” generic looters) and offers no active reversals beyond arrival. The conflict feels meaningful and costly but could gain complexity with more specific opposition or harder trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—successfully imprinting the cells within a narrow biological window—is clear and the ticking-clock constraint is stated (“only accept the programming during this fleeting phase of mitosis”). Pressure does build as she activates the Forge and the cells begin to split, and the decisive act of imprinting provides a clear peak. However, opposition is mostly abstract; nothing truly threatens failure except implied time pressure, and there’s minimal adaptation or reversal required from Elara. As a result, the conflict feels controlled and ritualistic rather than genuinely contested.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is metaphysical—Elara’s desire to touch destiny via stolen illuminated moments—which is clear but somewhat abstract. Pressure escalates conceptually (from routine theft to a cosmological feedback loop where the subject sees her), yet there’s minimal concrete threat or painful trade-off on the page. She never seriously considers disobeying the flowers, and no alternative path is meaningfully tested or foreclosed in scene. The ending is intriguing but reads more as revelation than as a hard choice with visible cost, keeping stakes and conflict solid but not gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will cling to his high, stable isolation or risk the unstable thaw below—is clear early and tightens logically as the structure groans and tilts. Escalation is situational rather than action-heavy: glacier booms, the tilt of the floor, sliding tools, and shrieking supports all narrow his options until abandonment becomes necessary. Internal conflict (safety of the control room vs. purpose of sharing safe zones) coheres with the physical threat. It falls just short of higher bands because there’s only a single major turn, with no intermediary reversal or sacrifice that shifts tactics before that final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.3)
    External stakes (incineration in five minutes) and internal stakes (agoraphobia vs. claustrophobia, betrayal) are clear and interlocked, with pressure escalating toward the code-entry moment. The decisive turn—choosing not escape but inversion of sanctuary protocols—narrows options and carries real cost for both Elias and Julian. Internal conflict (terror vs. action) consistently modulates the tension rather than sitting on top of it. A sharper on-page sense of what Julian’s exterior fate entails could have made the price even more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether she can successfully map the coming endless night before the final star goes out—is clearly stated and resolved, and the ticking star plus storm provide situational pressure. Escalation is present but gentle: the main tightening is the star’s pulse slowing to blackout as her mapping intensifies, and the storm’s ultimate disappearance underscores the cost. However, pressure doesn’t significantly shift her tactics or force hard trade-offs; she remains in one ritual mode from start to finish, so tension feels more atmospheric than actively contested. As a result, the conflict reads profound but somewhat static rather than sharply escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant conflict—734’s desire to glean the origin of thought versus the institutional task of cleanup—is clear but remains low-key. There is a meaningful tightening when he chooses to consolidate the ghosts into the violin instead of erasing everything, and again when he must finally drop the charged object into the recycler. However, the story never fully sharpens this into a wrenching trade-off; his curiosity does not significantly endanger his mission or risk repercussion. The stakes are intellectually and thematically charged rather than viscerally tense, which suits the tone but limits escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stake—whether Mara will continue to believe he’s a memory thief or open to trust—is clear and present early. Pressure coherently tightens through his decision to expose his secret method, then her hesitation and eventual choice to experience the illicit echoes. The external risk (job, legal consequences) is gestured at but never directly bites, so the cost remains mostly emotional and relational. Escalation is solid but not fierce; everything resolves in a relatively smooth curve once she looks through the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central conflict—Elian’s faith in intention and craft versus the regime’s quantification of luck—is clearly established and coheres throughout. Escalation is modest but present: the sub-prefect’s prediction of necrosis raises stakes, and the anomaly on the gauge is a concrete reversal of expectations. The price is more conceptual than visceral (Elian’s life of penance, the implied challenge to an entrenched system), which suits the tone but keeps the pressure relatively quiet. Some readers may wish for a sharper on-page consequence or explicit risk to Elian beyond bureaucratic disdain.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—proving sideways time and deciding whether to follow the Weavers or remain—is clear and well-seeded. Pressure escalates through the build-up to activation and peaks when he witnesses the Weavers stepping into other times, concretizing an abstract theory into a live temptation. His final choice to stay and conceal his discovery is a genuine stance crystallization, but the threat or cost of either path remains relatively abstract (no vivid danger, relationship risk, or existential price is dramatized). As a result, tension is strong but not maximally sharpened for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—decoding the ghost’s message/compulsion—is clear, and pressure coheres as the water’s unnatural stillness forces him into a decisive, risky disruption. Escalation is primarily internal and situational rather than antagonistic: the stakes tighten when the water resists motion, and his choice to violently break the mirror surface yields the map and hidden baton. However, the cost of failure or success is more atmospheric than explicit (no clear danger beyond psychological/spiritual consequence), which keeps the tension strong but not searing. The resolution emerges credibly from his agency and commitment, but the price paid remains understated.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—whether and how to incorporate the catastrophic prediction without collapsing the world—is clear and present early. Pressure escalates as Elias moves from recognition of the swallowed truth to devising and executing a risky workaround that preserves function at a personal cost. The final cost (he alone will see the end coming) is conceptually potent, though the conflict remains primarily intellectual and interior rather than being stress-tested by external opposition. A touch more on-page resistance or jeopardy in executing his tactic would lift this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Silas can reframe his own culpability by understanding another disaster—is clear and tight, and pressure builds via the increasingly uncanny radio feed and the approach to the valve. The decisive tightening happens when the confession syncs with the valve’s state and the ghost shift “wakes,” compelling him to confront his analogy between this mistake and his own. However, external danger (the tunnel’s instability, possible collapse) is gestured at but never quite escalates into a direct on-page threat, keeping the conflict primarily conceptual. As a result, the cost is more intellectual/emotional than viscerally felt, lowering some tension.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—how Elara will position herself in relation to the collapse of knowledge—is clear but remains mostly contemplative. There is one meaningful tightening when the rising damp and roaring river threaten the library’s stability, prompting her to act via the swan. However, her stance of nonjudgmental observation is never seriously challenged; the choice to relocate rather than stay and sink feels inevitable and low-friction. The result is a beautiful mood piece with modest escalation rather than sharp pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—can Elias use this singular window to reach Elara—is legible from early on and tightens as totality nears. The meaningful escalation comes when the world darkens, he commits to the action with the curl, and the magic “surges,” culminating in Elara’s reawakened gaze. Pressure is more situational and ritualistic than oppositional, so we don’t see much complication or reversal, but the time constraint and fear of “shattering the delicate atmosphere” do create real tension. Cost is mostly implied rather than dramatized in conflicting choices, which keeps it just shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the silo’s buried catastrophe and the last dream—is clear but largely intellectual. There is a mild escalation from diffuse atmospheric tension to the focused horror of the astronomer’s final entry, yet Elian never faces a true dilemma, loss, or resistance. His agency is essentially to perceive and interpret, with no visible price for success. The result is thematically charged but low-pressure on the conflict axis.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Arthur continues enabling covert operations that now bleed disturbingly into reality—is clear, and his decision to hijack the beam is a coherent, agentive resolution. However, the story lacks real resistance: no external force, time pressure, or concrete repercussion contests his choice, so escalation is mostly internal and reflective. The prophetic accidents are high-consequence in concept, but they occur off-page; we’re told they’re terrifying rather than feeling them tighten his options in scene. The final act closes a path, but the visible price and test of resolve remain muted.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s autonomy versus the abyssal possession—is clear early and remains coherent, with Kellen’s looping rhetoric and sculpted silences as his tactic under time pressure. There is a discernible escalation as he layers more complex rhetorical devices and effects, and the palette’s changing state gives visible feedback. However, the conflict is somewhat one-sided: the entity never visibly adapts or escalates, and Kellen never faces a true reversal or difficult trade-off. This makes the victory feel a touch frictionless for the level of cosmic threat implied.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Silas can capture the universe’s hidden symphony to realign his sense of time—is clear and tightens effectively as dawn approaches and the mirrored horizon “locks into place.” Escalation is subtle but present: from concept, to mapping memories, to testing the shell, to the high-risk conducting moment where everything must align. The cost is mostly internal and experiential, with little sense of alternative paths foreclosed beyond the implied toll of obsession and exhaustion. The pressure is more meditative than harrowing, which limits maximum tension but suits the piece’s aims.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.4)
    The primary stakes—wholeness vs dissolution across timelines—are established early and escalate as the pull of “fragmented identities” intensifies and the tablet disintegrates. There is a clear tightening: once the tablet crumbles, she faces an irreversible choice to accept gravity, closing off the periodic loops and risking annihilation. Internal and external conflict interweave well; the bridge’s instability maps onto her identity crisis. The only limitation is that the threat remains somewhat conceptual rather than viscerally felt in concrete losses beyond dissolution itself.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Silas can shatter his emotional stasis even at the cost of intense pain or being consumed—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates through the physical violence of the needle, the intensifying vibrations, and the constricting filament that threatens to enthrall him. The climax lands in the moment the “emotional dam” breaks and the filament snaps, with the price paid in raw grief. The conflict remains primarily internal and could benefit from one sharper moment of decision under threat, but within a lyric frame it reads satisfyingly taut.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.2)
    External stakes (physical safety, preservation of data, avoidance of capture) are clear and escalate with the battering ram, courtyard breach, and destruction of instruments. Her lateral escape is a concrete tactical choice that narrows options and has a visible cost—she must abandon her station. Still, the conflict remains one-sided: the antagonistic force doesn’t adapt on-page, and there’s minimal moral or internal dilemma beyond survival, which keeps the escalation from feeling truly knotted.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake is Elara’s need to understand her scent-triggered grief versus the emotional and possibly physical risk of exposing herself to the Lily’s aroma. Pressure tightens effectively around the moment she decides to loosen the respirator, a clear renunciation of her defining caution. Internal and external conflicts align, as the plant’s blooming window and UV-dependent visibility compress her options into a single, costly inhalation. The main limitation is that danger remains largely emotional and conceptual; a slightly stronger sense of physical or professional jeopardy could have heightened tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central conflict—absolute art/transcendence versus remaining a finite human—is clearly established and escalates coherently as his ritual intensifies and the rope begins to burn. The pivotal tightening comes when he realizes that to “truly hold the texture of time” he must relinquish his tether, making the choice both metaphysical and bodily. The cost of his decision (giving up perfection for ongoing incompletion) is on the page and felt. The external threat of the energy beings remains mostly atmospheric rather than actively pressuring tactics, which keeps the conflict primarily interior.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant conflict—sound versus chronic hush, memory versus erasure—is clear and grows as the hush “fights back” and the dome itself begins to hum in response. Stakes are scaled appropriately to the length: not saving the world, but protecting a fragile communal ritual and proving silence is not absolute. Escalation is primarily textural rather than plot-reversal-based, but the cadence shift from tentative bowing to dome-wide resonance functions as a meaningful tightening. The cost remains mostly emotional and atmospheric; a more explicit moment of jeopardy (for her body, psyche, or community) could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether Elara will endure unmediated grief or accept counterfeit solace—is clear and intrinsically weighty. Pressure does tighten slightly from her ragged panic to her surrender and then to the transformation, but there is no substantial reversal or obstacle once the vial is “ready.” Her question “Will it make me forget him?” hints at a deeper moral conflict that the scene doesn’t fully dramatize; she moves quickly from doubt to compliance. As a result, the resolution feels inevitable rather than hard-won, limiting the sense of costful choice.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central conflict—Elias’s fear of initiating contact vs. his drive to do right by the letter and the librarian—is coherent and present throughout. There is a clear intensification when he leaves the balustrade and crosses the floor, but the pressure never truly narrows his options or exacts much of a price. Once he speaks, things go smoothly; there are no reversals or meaningful tests of his commitment. As a result, the stakes feel poignant but low, keeping escalation solid rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—social acceptance versus remaining an outsider—is clear and present from early on, and is concretely tested by Elara’s choice to break norms (comforting the boy, humming) and to offer her reeds. Pressure does deepen as they move from dangerous rim through the boy’s injury to the charged discovery and answer at the arbor. However, resistance is largely implicit; there’s little on-page pushback or risk of failure, so the cost of her bold sympathy never fully bites. The resolution feels earned but relatively gentle in terms of conflict intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are established early (must reach the echo before the giant wakes, or risk death/ruin) and escalate coherently: natural twilight pressure, then the choice to borrow time, then the giant’s breathing glitch and partial immunity to stasis, then the echo’s release as the hour collapses. The decision to uncage the echo and the last-moment completion of the sketch under breaking stasis create a strong peak of pressure. The cost (lost lifespan and accelerated aging) is clear and on-page, giving the resolution weight. What keeps this just shy of the very top is that moral/psychic conflict around borrowing life and endangering the city/giant is underplayed in her internal calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether he can meaningfully reduce his daughter’s disappearance to something knowable—is established early and remains central. Pressure tightens mainly through accumulative ritual detail and the risk of another fruitless attempt, culminating in the ambiguous but charged apparition of the meadow. Still, conflict is almost entirely internal and procedural; there are no on-page reversals or obstacles beyond “it may not work,” so tension stays intellectual rather than visceral. The cost is clear (he remains in limbo, must try again), but the escalation is more measured than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether he can act on his desire to be benignly visible without violating his hidden role—is clear and sharpened by the power outage. Pressure escalates from routine maintenance to a morally and personally risky act of revelation (choosing to cache the tape within her direct workspace). The tension is more internal and situational than perilous, but the story does give him a real trade-off: preserve anonymity or risk it to relieve her despair. The cost remains mostly implied rather than concretely threatened (no tangible consequence of discovery is dramatized), which keeps this just shy of a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—retain human identity vs. survive via transformation—is established early and tightened as his body hardens and the air becomes unbreathable. Conflict escalates as his attempts to “fix” himself actively worsen his suffering, culminating in the revelation that his insistence on reconstruction is killing him. The climax is his renunciation of control and research, which forecloses the human path in exchange for continued existence. The emotional and ethical calculus is strong, though a more explicit glimpse of what he’s forfeiting (beyond abstract “humanity”) could sharpen the price.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    The central stake—artistic meaning versus bodily survival—is legible early and tightens through the storm’s danger and the revelation of the brooch. The barter of filter for artifact is a clear escalation that forecloses a concrete option and reweights his future. Internal and external pressures mesh well: his exhaustion and obsession directly inform his willingness to pay a steep price. One more on-page beat of him feeling the risk of thirst could have heightened the knife-edge tension even further.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake is Elara’s relationship to time and meaning—whether she remains imprisoned in macro-prophecy or is forced to confront the present’s overlooked magic. Pressure escalates when the unseen forces inhabit the pearl and flood the space with mundane-joy visions, forcing a revaluation. However, the conflict remains mostly philosophical and observational, with relatively soft on-page resistance and minimal tactical decision-making under duress. The emotional cost is more implied than sharply tested in a difficult choice, which keeps the stakes from feeling fully peak-level.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the returning exiles remain estranged or begin to cohere into a community—is clear and thematically rich, and it does tighten meaningfully when Elian recognizes the silence as a "fracture" that might harden. His agency in choosing a staggered, heart-like signal instead of a single blast is a genuine tactical decision that shapes the emotional outcome. However, opposition is essentially ambient (awkwardness, inertia) rather than active, and there are no reversals or real risks; the first strategy simply works. As a result, conflict reads as beautifully framed but relatively low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether she will dare to cross into the Fortress and confront her own truth—is legible and escalates at the ravine and again at the jar. Internal stakes (identity, intimacy) and external stakes (saving the city from spiritual rot) are nicely braided, though the external stake remains mostly conceptual on the page. Her agency clearly drives the key turns: following the arrows, punching the steps, choosing to break the jar. Still, the journey lacks serious resistance or reversals, keeping tension strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    The core conflict—Elara’s professional skepticism and social pressure versus her emerging recognition of the tower as a repository for communal grief—is clearly articulated and does intensify. The decisive choice to continue decoding and preserving the “emotional coordinates” despite career risk provides a genuine, if quiet, cost. However, most antagonistic pressure (town council, demolition) remains offstage and abstract, so escalation feels more contemplative than tense.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—Elian’s willingness to trade his unending life to finally learn what lies beyond goodbye—is clear, and external pressure (storm, dimensional instability, spatial mutiny) coherently tightens around his experiment. His active manipulation of the storm’s magnetic fields is the driver of escalation, and the amulet’s cracking/fissure opening functions as a clear turn that raises irreversibility. However, the internal conflict side is underdeveloped: he seldom seems genuinely torn, so the choice reads more as inevitable than contested, slightly flattening tension. Still, the piece earns a meaningful narrowing of options and visible price at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Elena’s legal survival versus the solid wall of law—is clear early, and Vance’s entrance sharpens pressure effectively. The key tightening is the moment Vance agrees to use the ink, which leads directly to an irreversible change in the official record. Still, the resolution comes swiftly once the ink is deployed, with relatively little resistance or tactical adaptation by either Julian or Vance beyond that single gambit. The conflict is compelling but feels slightly under-contested for the scale of the moral and legal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—successfully embedding a fabricated, future-urban history for a client before the illusion evaporates—is clear but largely professional and aesthetic. There is some escalation as the hum wavers, timing becomes critical, and she risks “muddying” or losing the neon-rain texture, which creates a local tightening. However, there’s little sense of what substantive loss (ethical, emotional, relational, or existential) would follow failure beyond wasted effort or displeasing a “wealthy client.” The conflict remains finely crafted but small, more procedural tension than genuine jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake is the narrator’s need to honor forgotten histories by successfully “reconstructing” the poison label’s emotional texture, but this goal encounters no real resistance. The process of layering voices and placing the label proceeds smoothly; there is no genuine risk it will fail or cost the narrator something tangible in the moment. Pressure does increase slightly as the tide turns and the atmosphere thickens, but this is more tonal than consequential. As a result, the piece reads as a beautifully executed ritual rather than a conflict with meaningful escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether there’s an underlying narrative to reality and Elias’s place in it—is clear from the outset and remains in focus. Pressure escalates as the experiment produces increasingly invasive truth-effects, culminating in his compulsion to retell his life honestly before the universe blanks out. The cost is primarily internal and conceptual but still tangible: he dismantles his self-protective skepticism and loses the possibility of a neat “answer.” The conflict could sharpen slightly if there were one more concrete obstacle or live alternative path he forgoes, but it remains coherent and tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes—loss of home vs. corporate takeover—are clear and scaled well to the length, and the deadline provides real pressure. Escalation is visible as Elara moves from coded instructions to the high-risk decision to relocate the legal “heart” of the city. The cost is mostly strategic and conceptual (legal risk, instability of the outer barge) rather than viscerally dramatized, which slightly blunts tension. Introducing even a minor on-page complication or near-failure in her plan would sharpen the pressure curve.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—capturing the last true lunar night before industrial light erases it—appears early and stays focused, with escalating pressure from the cold, the drones’ sweep, and the chemical countdown. The key tightening is the strip turning crimson and the onset of the “dawning hush,” forcing him to commit and take the shot under surveillance risk and physical discomfort. The external cost remains relatively soft (he isn’t caught or permanently harmed), so the tension leans on conceptual and atmospheric stakes rather than hard consequences. Still, his endurance against comfort and fear reads as a credible, if quiet, test of commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—repair the drone in time to guide the *Aethelgard* safely—is clear and scaled appropriately for the length. There is a temporal tightening as the airship’s noises grow louder and the anchor lifts, but Elias never truly struggles; his competence goes untested, and there’s no real reversal or complication. Conflict remains largely external and technical, with minimal moral or emotional trade-off. As a result, tension is present but modest, and the resolution feels somewhat inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Silas will find and handle a metaphysical “origin”—is clear, but the conflict is primarily internal and contemplative, with little active opposition. The main tightening comes from the falcon’s return (the promised signal) and the unexpected behavior of the condensation, which deepens the conceptual stakes rather than narrowing practical options. His key act of agency is choosing not to record the coordinates, an earned but low-friction renunciation. The pressure is coherent and appropriate for a lyric piece, yet it never quite sharpens into a moment where he must pay a visibly painful price.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the city’s physical and social fabric will hold or crumble—is clearly established and localized onto the archway’s integrity. Pressure escalates via the baker’s chaotic pace and especially the miners’ shuffling, which threatens to “shatter the keystone” before Silas intervenes. His choice to step out, impose a rhythm, and then withdraw is a meaningful tightening that changes the situation from erosion to reinforcement. The price is mostly conceptual and physical strain rather than a sharply dramatized loss, which keeps the conflict strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake (save the temple’s “ghosts” vs save herself) is clear and escalates as oxygen dwindles and the mechanical snarl proves intricate. The crucial tightening comes when she must choose to keep working the cables despite hypoxia symptoms, culminating in her conscious decision to complete the signal at the cost of her life. The tension is strong but relatively linear; an additional on-page complication or reversal (beyond mere difficulty and time) could have deepened the sense of mounting jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—escape before the drowned sailors turn Elian into a scapegoat—is clear and meaningfully reframed as a need to disappear into “hush.” Internal and external pressures interweave, but the external conflict remains largely anticipatory: the guards and warden’s blame arrive only after he’s gone, so his choice is not contested on the page. The primary tightening comes from his decision to stop seeking belief and instead seek erasure, which is thematically strong but scenically low-friction. A more concrete obstacle or on-page confrontation would sharpen cost and escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes—Julian’s life and the settling of a multi-lifetime debt—are clear and emotionally legible, and the cost of losing the guardian figure lands at the end. There is some escalation as the humming bead awakens the garden and the ghost shifts from cameos to full manifestation. However, the conflict is relatively frictionless: the predatory plants never truly threaten him, and the bride’s repayment is immediate and uncontested once she appears. Julian is not forced into a hard choice; the pressure deepens more in tone than in concrete obstacles or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the city will succumb to decay or be reforged by Elara—is clear, and the danger of “the lethal drop mere inches from her toes” is articulated. However, conflict remains relatively frictionless: there’s no on-page resistance from elders, no mishap or near-failure, and the trance allows her to bypass fear rather than struggle through it. Escalation is primarily textural, as the web grows denser, rather than through new obstacles or trade-offs. The ending pays off her goal, but with limited sense of what she’s had to surrender beyond stamina and ongoing risk.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can transform a site of interrupted journeys into a living continuum she belongs to—is legible and present early. There is one key tightening when she decides that healing requires physically rebuilding the sundial, tying her emotional arc to a concrete task. However, the conflict remains largely internal and contemplative; her goal is never seriously endangered, and no hard trade-off or foreclosed option surfaces on the page. As a result, tension is steady but gentle, without a sharp escalation or visible price beyond labor and time.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.6)
    The nominal stakes are high (instructions that could dismantle a data center; evading AI surveillance), but on-page pressure remains muted and largely abstract. The only explicit urgency—the chalk indicating a rush—is undercut by Elian’s untroubled, contemplative pacing, and no external force materially tightens his window or challenges his goal. There is a modest deepening as the letter moves from idea to folded object poised for mailing, but no real reversal, narrowed option set, or felt price beyond conceptual risk. As a result, tension is more atmospheric than situational, which limits conflict effectiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preventing Kael’s coup by sabotaging his navigation—is clear early and remains coherent. Pressure escalates from Kael’s initial demand and two-day ultimatum to Lysa’s risky, time-sensitive magical stitching, with the needle–flame synchronization serving as a focused high-stakes beat. However, Lysa encounters no real setbacks or reversals once Kael exits; the tension feels more conceptual than viscerally pressured. The price she pays is mostly risk rather than a dramatized loss or sacrifice in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Julian can truly understand the unsaid plea from his wife and thereby reframe his departure—is clear and present early. Pressure escalates through the ritual: the shard repairs, the temperature crash, the condensation forming and then erasing the message as the moonlight passes, culminating in a limited window of revelation. The cost is emotional and conceptual rather than decisional; he faces the pain of discovering she did want him to stay, but once that’s revealed, his move toward writing the letter feels inevitable and under-contested. Conflict is rich in feeling but relatively low in active dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can transform a war-marked artifact into something gentler before Leo wakes—is clear and coheres with his psychological need. Pressure escalates mainly through deepening: from passive handling of the cast to recognizing the mother’s warning to the ethically loaded choice to overwrite it. The internal conflict around changing someone else’s inscription is understated; he moves fairly smoothly to his solution, with limited sense that other paths are truly live and foreclosed. Still, the decision to alter the message and its emotional cost provide enough tightening for this quiet form.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    The core stake—can she recontact the joy of making—is clear and the pressure coheres, but escalation is relatively soft. The main tightening comes when random light strokes prove useless and she must seek structure via the knowledge network and the exposed-film approach. The visible cost at the end is the deliberate acceptance of transience as her creation dissolves. This is effective but not especially strenuous or ambivalent, which keeps the pressure in a mid-strong band rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether resonance and art can “alter” or reconfigure truth—threads consistently from Ms. Vance’s challenge through the deepening dream layers to Elian’s redefined answer. There is clear escalation in conceptual scope (from mural body to Depression-era survival to disembodied wave), which effectively tightens the thematic question. However, Elian never faces a genuinely agonizing or narrowing choice; he’s largely swept along until the final interpretive decision. The cost is more inferred than viscerally dramatized, keeping the conflict strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are legible from early on: mental autonomy and resistance vs. the Revenue Service’s audit and the imminent raid. Pressure escalates coherently—sirens, boots in the garden, drone strike, doors buckling—culminating in Julian’s agency-driven decision to deploy the seed. The cost is present but somewhat under-emphasized; the mention of twelve men paying with their freedom does heavy lifting without much on-page emotional friction when Julian risks their sacrifice. Still, the external conflict tightens once, clearly and effectively, in line with the story’s length.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant conflict—whether he will remain locked in endless mourning or risk relinquishing his last tangible relic—is clear and emotionally scaled to the form. Pressure escalates texturally: his song stirs life, the vines advance, the garden thickens, and the moment of placing the postcard in the fern emerges as a concrete test of his professed duty to “photosynthesize pain into beauty.” The stakes are internal but real: if he cannot let go, the shell remains a graveyard rather than a sanctuary. The choice costs him something, though an extra beat of hesitation at the exact moment of burial could sharpen the tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—the survival of the orchids as vessels of forgotten names—is clear and grounded in the dimming bloom and cracked chime. Pressure increases as Elian must locate a delicate, fading resonance and physically enact the repair, tying his internal fear of loss to a concrete task. However, there’s little sense of time running out or of genuine risk of failure; the process feels tense but not quite perilous. The final endurance choice (continuing his patrol, guarding ghosts) closes the arc, but the cost is conceptual rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.3)
    The central stakes—whether they allow pride and silence to ossify the rift or risk everything on uncompromising truth—are legible early and tighten as the spell threatens to tear the room apart. Elara’s agency drives escalation and resolution: she chooses to weaponize/verbalize their past promises to stabilize both magic and relationship. The cost of that choice (exposure, loss of defensive silence, physical danger) is palpable even though the outcome is positive. The tension operates well at both magical and emotional levels, though the resolution veers slightly toward neatness.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—Outer Ring lives vs. obedience to the Council—is clear and tightly bound to the mechanical act of setting the chain and turning the wheel. Pressure escalates in a focused way: preparation and blueprint, then the timed approach, then the physical struggle with the wheel and the all-or-nothing risk of the chain holding. The moment where the chain could snap functions as the key tightening, with the tremor in his hands underscoring internal risk as well. The cost is more implied (potential execution, ongoing need for secrecy) than concretely felt on the page, keeping this just shy of top-tier intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elian will risk his anonymity and solitude to pursue the meteorite’s song in front of another person—is present but understated. Pressure tightens once, when she reveals she has followed his paper trail and “knows what you carry,” forcing him to choose between another lie or authentic revelation. However, there is little sense of what he tangibly risks beyond abstract solitude; no clear consequence if she betrays him or if the launch fails, so escalation feels more contemplative than fraught. The final act (releasing Aero) is meaningful but not sharply edged in terms of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether and how to restore meaningful distance in a world where cause and effect have collapsed—is clear and culminates in her decision to rebuild walls instead of bridges. Escalation is primarily conceptual: moving from abstract description of the broken world through the tactile investigation of the wood, to the specific transgression in the logbook, to a sharpened stance. However, antagonistic pressure is mostly atmospheric; beyond the “chaotic winds of probability,” there’s little sense that failure is imminent or that competing desires are actively wrestling on the page. The result is a strong but relatively quiet conflict profile.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    The primary conflict—Elara’s need to redefine belonging after failure—stays in view, with the ostracod display serving as the key tightening: its sudden beauty overwhelms her, stripping defenses and narrowing her options to either cling to her old narrative or release it. The time limit (“until sunrise”) introduces a soft clock, though it doesn’t pressure a concrete dilemma beyond witnessing the event. The cost (letting go of the feather and thus the identity it anchors) lands, but the process is relatively smooth, with little on-page resistance or risk of refusing the change. Strong for a quiet internal piece, but not maximally pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—solving why the path disappeared before the foam fades—is clear and escalates once the flawed projection appears. The conjecture beat and the ticking foam provide a structural tightening that nudges her into action. However, the “risk” is asserted more than felt: there’s no credible competing option, and failure would mean only continued ignorance rather than a painful loss. As a result, pressure plateaus quickly and the resolution feels a bit too frictionless for the grandeur of the concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—can Elias successfully manufacture a moment of wonder to break a stranger’s monotony—is clear and is resolved on the page. Pressure does build somewhat through the waiting and the physical sequence, but Elias never faces a genuine alternative or risk; success feels almost guaranteed. The conflict is essentially between his design and entropy, with entropy offering little fight. As a result, escalation is graceful rather than gripping, limiting the story’s tension.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—defying the nostalgia ban by inscribing a permanent, unerasable verse before exiling herself—is clear, and the irreversible “anchoring” is a meaningful tightening. Still, opposition stays largely abstract: enforcers and memory-wiping frequencies are invoked but never come onstage, so external pressure feels theoretical rather than lived. Internal conflict is muted; she rarely wavers or recalibrates, which flattens tension. As a result, the piece has strong stakes but comparatively soft conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—Silas’s need for assurance about the value of his work before the day “erases the subtle magic”—is clear and thematically apt. Pressure coheres around his fear that the coming light will expose his atrium as crude, with the ritual serving as the key attempt to manage that fear. Escalation is modest: there’s one meaningful deepening (water’s answer) before the confirmatory payoff when the atrium proves beautiful. Because there’s no hard test or tangible loss beyond internal anxiety, the stakes feel contemplative rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether Silas can transform solitary, corrosive grief into something shared or recontextualized—is clear and coherently pursued. Pressure escalates more via deepening than reversal: reaching the peak, confronting the box, and mentally reframing fire’s role lead to the choice to open and scatter the soot. The price—relinquishing some bitterness and the exclusive hold on his friend’s remains—is implied but credible. The conflict remains largely internal and meditative, so tension is strong for lyric work but not maximally tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—reversing a world’s spiritual entropy—is clearly stated, and the launch of “another” trial balloon implies prior failures, adding some implied risk. However, on-page pressure is quite gentle: the gauge brushes past a red zone, but no concrete consequence is dramatized if it fails or overloads, and Elian never seriously wavers or adapts tactics. The conflict escalates more in imagery than in felt jeopardy, making the outcome feel somewhat foregone. As a result, the climax reads beautiful but low-tension, limiting the sense of price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—uncovering and then choosing how to bear the building’s traumatic history—is coherent and escalates as the echo heaviness leads to the diaries and finally the faces on the film. The moral horror of sealing people into the vaults sharpens the stakes conceptually, and the revelation that the resonance is betrayal reweights the entire exploration. However, on-page conflict is mostly informational and internal; Elias isn’t forced into a hard tactical or ethical trade-off beyond accepting knowledge. The pressure tightens once but never quite corners him into a visible, costly dilemma at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—completing the mirage before the bell—remains coherent and provides a modest but real sense of ticking pressure. There is a clear tightening as Elara engages the droplets, hum, and borrowed heartbeat, with the bell’s toll as the single reversal cutting off further action. However, conflict is largely procedural; no serious opposition or moral difficulty challenges Elara, and the cost of failure is confined to the man’s continued despair, which we only glimpse indirectly. The stakes feel meaningful but contained, more contemplative than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—ending a forever war in a brief disarmament window—is crisply framed, with the added personal stake of the warlords’ lost children. Pressure tightens when Kaelen demands the names of beloved dead, forcing a trade-off between armor and vulnerability. However, Hark and Vena move from resistance to compliance relatively fast; there’s little sense they might refuse or subvert the ritual, which slightly blunts escalation. The cost is still visible, but the conflict arc could sustain more friction before yielding.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.0)
    The primary conflict is internal: his need to maintain his monstrous system versus his inability to bear absolute silence and erasure. The stakes are articulated as a moral and aesthetic cost rather than physical peril, and they are legible from early on. Tension coherently tightens from abstraction (his empire, his guilt) toward the concrete act of placing the egg and then choosing to abandon it. The escalation is subtle and mostly accumulative, so it may feel statelier than some competitive-market pieces but remains effective at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the Lullaby will permanently erase dissent—is signaled early and escalates as Elara moves from approach to painful, risky spellwork while the High Magistrate begins to awaken to her betrayal. The clock tightens nicely around the moment “between sigh and smile,” where her decision to pull the thread resolves the central conflict through her agency. Internal and external stakes are braided (her soul versus the city’s freedom), and the resolution rightly flows from her strongest value. What keeps the score from being higher is the relative smoothness of the path: the opposing force is more atmospheric than actively adaptive, so escalation feels intense but not deeply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—how to respond ethically to demands for violent, moralizing endings—is clear, and reframed from barroom argument into a live aesthetic test. Pressure increases texturally as the crowd leans in, the puppets reach the brink of violence, and Silas chooses to reverse rather than complete the expected arc. However, the conflict remains largely conceptual and one-sided; the heckler never re-applies direct pressure and Silas faces little risk beyond audience incomprehension. The escalation is elegant but intellectually cool, with relatively low on-page cost or jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—witnessing and ritualizing the end of a species while insisting on the forgotten—is clear and present early. Pressure escalates mainly through the accumulative lens: the clock of the “final timeframe,” discovery of the moth wing, then the monarch’s arrival culminating in the “interrupted cadence” realization. However, conflict remains largely internal and ceremonial; Elias faces no real alternative tactics or ethical trade-off beyond how to witness, which keeps the escalation somewhat static. The ending’s cost is conceptual and poignant but not sharply dramatized as a forced, difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes—preserving the memory of the dead and redeeming himself—are clear and thematically rich, and the ritual has built-in risk in concept. However, on the page, there is very little resistance: the rope reconfiguration and cosmic furnace activation proceed smoothly, with no reversal or near-failure to test his resolve. Internal conflict does not spike at any one decisive moment; once he starts, success feels inevitable. As a result, tension is more atmospheric than truly escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant conflict—obedience to a decaying containment directive versus choosing a dangerous, present-tense agency—is clear and sharpened by the storm’s approach. Pressure escalates from atmospheric unease to concrete visions of forest destruction and bunker flooding, culminating in the lever choice. The moral calculus (safety in decay vs. risky transcendence) is present but could stand a bit more friction, especially around her instinct for self-preservation. Even so, the final decision visibly forecloses a path and reads as an earned crystallization of stance.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—preserving a fragile, rational cosmology against incoming anti-intellectual conquest—is clear from the outset and narrows as the Persians close in. Escalation is primarily accumulative: ascent, diagram completion, rising hum, then the entity’s appearance, with the external crash of gates bracketing the climax. Bel-ibni’s agency is steady and competent; he never seriously wavers, so tension comes more from whether the ritual will work and what it will cost than from internal struggle. The price—relinquishing access to the knowledge, accepting erasure of his world—is present but emotionally underplayed, keeping this just shy of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Kaelen will cling to his warlike identity or accept a new form of strength—is clearly signaled and escalates through the silent stand-off, the cylinder’s rejection/return, and the forced wrist contact. The tightening comes from Kaelen’s internal resistance to the invasive peace and the irreversibility of the cellular memory transfer. However, Elian’s near-omniscient control of the setup (reappearing artifact, hand-to-wrist contact achieved without true jeopardy) blunts the sense of risk or alternative outcomes. The conflict is thematically rich but tactically close to predetermined.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—reclaim the runaway dream without being absorbed into reflection—is clear and present early. Pressure escalates via the loosening of physics, the thickening reflective air, and his boots freezing him into place as the ritual intensifies. However, the conflict remains largely one-directional: no significant reversal or deepening of risk, and his success never seriously feels in doubt. The final cost is more notional than dramatized, so tension plateaus rather than spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    The main stake—stabilize a dangerous magical breach that embodies a failed civic promise—appears early and coheres with Elara’s quieter internal stake of preserving generational understanding. Escalation is clear when the rift literally widens and rejects standard binding, forcing her into a high-risk, improvised tactic on a trembling beam. Her decision to sacrifice the hair ribbon and choose a hinge over a lock is an earned, protagonist-driven resolution rather than a lucky trick. The danger feels localized rather than harrowing, but the emotional and conceptual stakes land solidly for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Elian can preserve his lineage and the orchard by correctly fulfilling the time-loop obligation—is signaled clearly once the inheritance manifest is introduced. Pressure escalates from abstract discomfort to explicit existential risk: carve wrong and “his lineage would unzip from reality.” The inquiry of “Who is she?” and the realization of being trapped between first and last pages meaningfully tighten options, culminating in his decision to carve his fear. The conflict remains primarily internal and philosophical; a slightly more visceral sense of potential loss (beyond conceptual erasure) would deepen the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—rescuing the Traveler before he’s fully digested by his regrets—is clearly signaled, and pressure coheres around reaching and passing the gate. The major tightening is Elara’s confrontation with the golem, where she must pay the “toll” via insight rather than power, and that choice earns the turn. However, once she spots the fungi omission, the negotiation resolves without much resistance, and the subsequent cutting of webs and escape face no fresh complication or trade-off. The emotional and physical prices (Traveler’s aging, her magical conservation) are present but could be more sharply dramatized to heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can/should externalize her absorbed twin for a moment of contact—is clear early and sharpened as she descends into the ship and manifests the Garden. Pressure escalates more texturally than through reversals: the ship grows stranger, then the Garden’s silence forces her to confront the possibility that recapture is neither necessary nor kind. Her decisive act is a refusal: leaving the Garden “undisturbed” and abandoning the fantasy of extraction, which carries the cost of giving up the imagined meeting. The tension is consistently present but remains relatively gentle, with little sense of risk or danger beyond emotional cost, which keeps the ceiling shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes—a university’s entire memory and identity—are strong and clearly articulated, and the dominant conflict (order vs. overwriting chaos) is focused. Yet the actual on-page struggle is surprisingly smooth; Elian’s work with the rope progresses without genuine risk, reversal, or sacrifice beyond concentration. The single tightening—recognizing the two dissonant cords and deciding to merge them—is conceptually rich but emotionally under-contested. As a result, tension is present but muted, more cerebral than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving her mind and life from the invasive noise—is clear and tied to the encroaching beings, with the “screaming static” escalating as they approach. There is a solid tightening as the energy beings close in and she must complete her reading of the ice and activation of the stone under immediate threat. However, the resolution feels relatively smooth: once she interprets the fissures and strikes the stone correctly, the bloom of hush dispatches the attackers without complication or sacrifice beyond exhaustion and artifact drain. The piece delivers one major pressure point but lacks a sharper trade-off or reversal that would push escalation into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—getting a single, meaningful signal through in a ruined, noisy universe—is strongly signaled and escalates as the hum cuts to “terrifying, expectant” silence that will not last. Pressure tightens via the rusted gears, the need to match the ancient alignment, and the silence bubble’s implied time limit. There is no explicit antagonistic force beyond environment and entropy, so opposition stays somewhat abstract, but the procedural demands under time pressure do generate real tension. The resolution clearly stems from Elara’s precise, effortful choices rather than coincidence doing the work for her.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—what identity she will bestow on a civilization at the end of time—is clear and carries existential weight, but the pressure is quiet and mostly internal. The main tightening comes as the shadow creeps into the “grim sector of preservation” and finally rests on “solitude,” forcing her to accept a guardian, not conqueror, narrative. That realization entails a conceptual cost (renouncing expansion and hope of outward flourishing), but there’s little sense of alternative tactics or serious resistance. Strong for a lyric piece, yet the tension never quite bites hard enough to feel fully high-stakes on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—briefly lifting collective hopelessness—is clear, and the humidity plus explosive risk provide a nominal external pressure. However, escalation is mild: once he reads the mosaic and adjusts for dampness, nothing truly jeopardizes ignition or the display. There’s no meaningful reversal or narrowing of options; conflict feels more like a beautifully staged task than a genuine test with visible cost. The emotional stakes are large in concept but gently handled in practice.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether Elara clings to or releases Kael—is clear, and the silence functions as a pressure-cooker for that choice. However, the primary external turn (Kael’s decision to leave) happens off-page before the story starts, so on-page escalation is mostly internal re-framing rather than mounting conflict. Her acceptance feels emotionally coherent but not rigorously tested by any new complication or pushback. As a result, the tension arc plateaus rather than sharpens into a truly difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—capturing the Gilded Hush as an antidote to her bunker-born claustrophobia—is clear and time-boxed by the brief inversion. Pressure tightens as gravity flips, the ritual begins, the silence manifests physically, and the window closes, giving at least one solid escalation beat. However, there’s little sense that failure or catastrophic cost is a live possibility beyond implication; she never faces a true dilemma or reversal that forces a trade-off. The tension is real but relatively gentle and could be sharpened with more concrete risk or potential loss.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—maintaining the gondola’s integrity and Kael’s mental stability amid lethal silence—is clear and present from early on. Pressure escalates once, sharply, with the train whistle and its aftermath, and Elian’s choice to deploy the storm glass is a meaningful tactical response. However, the threat feels conceptually dire but practically safe; there’s little sense that failure is a live possibility or that Elian pays any personal price. As a result, tension is elegant rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reach the Unclaimed Throne before sunrise or the zone is incinerated—is clear and escalates via the klaxons and flickering stair projection. The leap onto unstable hard-light steps is a strong agency beat that narrows options. However, Elara encounters minimal resistance beyond environmental instability; she succeeds on the first and only attempt, and there’s no vivid sense of potential failure once she’s on the stairs. The conflict thus feels solid but somewhat streamlined, with limited on-page loss or trade-off beyond implied risk.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—remain in a self-made limbo or risk a future without proof of escape—is legible early and tightens as her shadow “encroaches” and the threshold fades. Elian’s intervention reframes the ring from proof to shackle, giving a clear mid-scene deepening that narrows options. The central turn (choosing to drop the ring) is unequivocally her decision and involves a visible price: loss of the last concrete link to her past. Conflict remains almost entirely internal and progresses on a single, smooth curve, so escalation feels more inevitable than surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—preventing the quantum promise from crushing the farm—is clear early and escalates coherently as the pressure mounts and the texts grow more frantic. Elias’s decision to volunteer and then to route the weight into the bolt are strong agency beats that tighten options. The climax delivers a satisfying, legible test of those stakes as reality “screams” around the bolt. The resolution is perhaps a bit too clean—Elias walks away with minimal visible lasting damage—so the sense of price paid is strong but not brutal.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—expose the Emperor’s fraud and topple a three-century dynasty—is clearly signaled and tightly linked to Elian’s immediate task. Pressure escalates via the mechanical and physical challenge of finding the exact resonance (no gauge, logic fails, reliance on intuition, lactic burn) and the brittle all-or-nothing nature of the mechanism. The meaningful tightening is his shift from rational calculation to embodied, intuitive attunement, culminating in the shattering of the casing and the irreversible broadcast. Still, the personal and ethical stakes (what he stands to lose, any doubt) could be rendered more viscerally to lift the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are conceptually high—rewriting a tragic history, surrendering vows, pledging to chaos—but conflict is largely internal and under-opposed. The pressure increases when the ritual begins to work and reality destabilizes, yet Valerius rarely hesitates or encounters resistance; the orchard and forces at play never truly threaten him or his aim. The one major tightening is the moment of allegiance and unsnapping the pod, which narrows his path decisively. Stronger dramatization of risk (to body, mind, or world) would deepen the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can salvage proof of care from a system that renders the boy a statistic—is legible and tight. Pressure accumulates as initial textual evidence fails him, pushing him toward the envelope and then toward an interpretive, ethically fraught addendum. Escalation is primarily internal and textural rather than confrontational, which fits the piece but keeps the sense of real risk (to truthfulness, professional integrity, or his own defenses) relatively soft. A clearer on-page articulation of what he risks by choosing hope over strict evidence would sharpen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—restoring true history to a numbed populace—is clear and present from the outset, and the failed rendezvous is an effective escalation that forces Elara to commit alone. The conflict is largely external (evading surveillance, reaching the hub), with internal resolve steady rather than embattled. After the puddle-navigation beat, opposition softens; the lagoon sequence has tension but few active obstacles beyond implied toxicity and age. The resolution is earned but could benefit from one more sharp test of commitment or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—preventing the machine’s prophecy from completing—is signaled clearly and escalates as lights and sounds intensify and Elias’s lungs burn. The conflict between generative machine and destructive/negating music is elegant, and the final whisper as “lock” is a solid peak choice. Yet the resolution feels a bit assured; there’s no real sense that failure is a live option beyond description. The cost is mostly exertion and ongoing duty rather than a sharpened, agonizing trade-off in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—properly answering the trees’ demand for remembrance so that new life can be sown—is clear but gentle. There is a discernible tightening as the hush descends, the leaf’s message raises the bar from sorting to tribute, and the prod risks success or failure of the ritual. However, opposition is largely implicit and abstract; there’s no serious possibility of loss dramatized on the page beyond a vague sense of spiritual obligation. As a result, tension remains low-grade rather than truly gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stakes (get the compass and survive versus remain safely within controlled plans) are clear and under steady pressure. Escalation is legible: coincidence triggers the quest, the descent into the cavern tightens danger, the ladder failure forecloses the meticulous-planning path, forcing the improvisational vine leap. The external and internal conflicts interlock well in that decision, but the survival risk after landing on the island is quickly backgrounded once he finds the compass. Because the story ends at a poised moment rather than testing the new stance with a fresh, higher-cost choice, the conflict arc feels strong but not fully maximized.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Julian’s failure can be redeemed and given meaningful form—is established early and resolved through Elara’s deliberate ritual. Escalation is mostly conceptual: she increases the heat, pushes the gold toward “hyper-fluidity,” and commits to pouring into empty space, which deepens rather than reverses pressure. There is limited sense of risk or potential loss beyond emotional disappointment; the process never feels like it could meaningfully harm her or Julian’s memory. The result is a strong but relatively soft arc of tension, more meditative than truly pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—releasing a specific soul rather than merely harvesting background ghosts—is clear early and tightened when General Thorne manifests and resists. Escalation is present but relatively gentle: the pressure shift comes from the apparition’s roaring refusal and then from Elian’s choice to deploy the embarrassing memory instead of force. The price is primarily emotional and thematic rather than physical; Elian never feels in genuine danger, which softens the sense of risk. Still, the reframing of Thorne’s shame into liberating laughter is a meaningful deepening that earns the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—enduring and reconfiguring his relationship to pain/mercy—is clear early and tightens as he chooses to walk toward greater radiation instead of away from it. The decisive escalation is removing the forbidden mask to step fully into the beam, a choice that visibly increases risk and cost. Internal and external pressures are interwoven: his trauma responses both protect him and keep him bound to the logic of prior torture. The ending’s endurance is an earned stasis that forecloses retreat, with a credible sense of ongoing cost.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elian can successfully liberate and preserve the trapped history—exists and is thematically weighty, with one clear tightening when the anchors flare gold and he commits to “untying” the century-old knot. However, resistance is almost entirely procedural and aesthetic; there’s no serious chance of refusal, damaging error, or competing obligation to weigh, which keeps tension relatively soft. The “metaphysical surgery” proceeds with little friction, so the cost feels solemn but not contested. This limits escalation under any lens, especially for a venue seeking sharper pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—freeing the trapped lift and its ghosts—is coherent and escalates as Elias moves from observation to manipulation and finally engagement. Pressure is present but relatively cool and procedural; Elias is never in visible physical or moral danger, and the ghosts remain background tension rather than active opposition. The key tightening is when he commits to re-priming and activating a long-dormant, massive mechanism. The absence of a sharper cost or risk keeps the conflict from fully peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether a perfectly negotiable reality will be ruptured into consequence—is signaled early and escalated cleanly through Silas’s preparation to the library’s destruction. His agency is central: the press act is a genuine point of no return with visible global and personal cost. However, conflict operates mostly as man-versus-system in absentia; no opposing character or real-time resistance tests his conviction, and internal conflict is minimal. The result is high conceptual stakes with somewhat lower on-page tension than the premise could support.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central conflict—control over Vermillion’s historical meaning—is clear and threads through their debate and Elian’s ultimate manipulation of the storm. Escalation comes from the approaching Time storm and Elian’s decision to defy Thorne and the safety protocol, culminating in the risk of rewriting reality. However, the storm’s physical stakes feel underplayed and Thorne offers little active resistance once the plan is underway, so pressure never quite peaks as sharply as it could. The cost is more conceptual/emotional than immediate, which slightly softens tension.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—preventing the Covenant of Rust from unmaking the city—is clear and scales down effectively into Elias’s concrete problem of saving this one machine. Escalation is present in the encroaching corrosion, the tension of inserting the chip, and the risk of shattering the assembly, culminating in the harmonic shockwave. Elias’s agency is central to the solution, and the choice to ignore broken parts in favor of reinforcing the whole is a nice deepening of the conflict’s logic. The cost is mostly externalized (reversed rust, halted threat) rather than explored as a personal or moral trade-off, which keeps the stakes a bit abstract emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake is largely experiential and conceptual—can Silas reach and capture the impossible scent—and it is signaled early. Pressure does increase as he descends and performs the ritual, but opposition is mostly atmospheric; nothing seriously threatens failure once he finds the fissure. His agency drives the key turn (choosing to pour the vial), yet there’s little sense of risk, sacrifice, or narrowed options at the climax. As a result, tension is present but muted and never quite becomes gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central conflict (a blind freighter drifting toward Razor Rocks) is clear and the stakes are concrete, with Elara’s choice to act as the main pressure point. The escalation from receiving the plea to physically wrestling sculpture, storm, and machinery is effective, and the transformation of art into a life-saving tool is a strong turn. However, the sequence lacks reversals or complications once she commits; nothing meaningfully threatens the success of her plan on the page. Tension is solid but never quite taut enough for the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara’s pursuit of nocturnal beauty will yield a meaningful, costly understanding—remains clear and coheres. Pressure rises through time investment (weeks of deciphering, three nights of watching) and finally the single, irreproducible bloom under the right conditions. Her “reckoning” and decision to change how she paints are credible consequences. The main limit is that tension stays almost entirely contemplative; there’s little sense of risk if she fails beyond an implied spiritual or artistic loss, which keeps escalation from feeling fully sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—recovering the cipher to expose historical crimes, at the price of engaging with a haunted trauma-site—is signaled early and coherently maintained. There is one meaningful tightening when spoken communication fails, escalating pressure and forcing Elara into inventive negotiation. The ethical dimension of trading in a trapped leader’s final moments to preserve his legacy adds a subtle moral cost, but the external conflict resolves relatively easily once the glyph strategy works, with little resistance or risk of true failure on the page. Tension is solid more than harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether to reintroduce messy, painful life into a self-erased town—is clear early and stays coherent. Escalation comes primarily through the intensifying cognitive labor and physical strain as she constructs and channels a complex society into the bottle, culminating in the walk to the square and raised shattering gesture. Her agency drives everything, and the added concepts of greed/hunger/ambition deepen the ethical stakes. Still, the lack of an on-page test or reversal after the mental labor (no moment where she almost drops it, doubts, or encounters opposing pressure) keeps the conflict from reaching a more layered peak.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake is Vane’s need to decode and preserve an anomalous oath before it’s lost, which becomes intertwined with whether the tower (and implied city) has reached its prophesied end. Pressure escalates from unsettling silence to panic over the fragile artifact to the weight of revelation when the “brass throat” line lands. Agency is concentrated in the decision to immerse the shaving and then to record the final entry; those moves do deepen stakes but remain primarily conceptual rather than testing him against competing goods or harms. The conflict is compelling but relatively gentle given the implied apocalyptic scale.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clearly world-scale (biosphere vs. permanent stasis) and localized (save the seed vault before the cold wins), and the need to organize the vortex provides a concrete obstacle. The escalation from chaotic vortex to imposed order to opening hatch is coherent under the causal lens. However, Elian never genuinely seems in danger of failing—the vortex yields with minimal struggle, and there’s no reversal or serious setback to test his commitment. The internal stake of “discovering the texture of borrowed time” surfaces late and adds depth, but it doesn’t create an additional, conflicting pressure he must pay for on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—duty to warn the valley versus preserving a once-in-decades silence—is clearly signaled and tightened by the countdown to zero hour and the wind’s sudden death. The key escalation is the pressure lines flattening and the holy quiet “pressing” on his eardrums, which reframes the siren test as an ethical violation rather than routine work. His choice to cut power and unhook the rope forecloses the institutional path with a nontrivial professional cost. The conflict remains internal and quiet, but it does grow and culminate coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake is Elara’s need to reframe her vulnerability and insignificance, signaled early in her self-conception as a janitor in a “galaxy of gods.” Pressure escalates primarily through the meteor’s arrival and fiery dissolution, which creates a single meaningful tightening: this transient event becomes her test case for whether destruction can equal revelation. Agency is contemplative but real—she chooses to stop working, to engage in her ritual, to interpret the meteor’s burning as a model for her own exposure. However, the conflict remains almost entirely internal and meditative, with minimal sense of real risk or trade-off; there’s no option that feels genuinely foreclosed beyond her old interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central conflict—ghosts’ craving for confession versus Elias’s mission to preserve mystery—is crisp and escalates when the young woman’s spirit presses him with a personal, urgent need. His choice to refuse and instead perform the ritual with the box is a clear tightening that forecloses a path (her confession) and reasserts his values. The cost is mostly conceptual and borne by others; Elias himself feels little visible inner strain, so the tension remains somewhat one-sided. Still, pressure grows coherently and resolves via his agency rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s need to stabilize her own time-existence in a chaotic world—is legible, and the discovery of the urn shard provides the key escalation, turning ambient menace into a concrete, graspable solution. The conflict is primarily internal and situational rather than adversarial, with pressure expressed through world-warp and her precarious borrowed life. That pressure tightens once rather than through layered reversals, and the costs remain more conceptual than viscerally dramatized. The result is satisfying but somewhat low-tension for elite markets.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elian can restore/reshape harmony after the storm without erasing necessary flaws—is legible early and sharpened by the kite-string snap. The kite loss is a clear tightening that threatens to unravel his work and forces a choice of method (control vs. integration). However, the conflict remains almost entirely aesthetic and metaphysical, so the felt cost is quieter than it could be, and Elian never seems truly in danger of failing. Escalation is present and earned but could bear more pressure or risk to qualify as top-echelon.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reconciling stone and oak before Silas’s death—is clear and tied to his terminal clock. There is a meaningful deepening when the copper loops start working and the oaks alter their growth, culminating in the temple’s transformation and his bodily decline. However, opposition stays largely conceptual and off-stage; the “immune response” of the stone never actively pushes back against his intervention in-scene, and nothing he tries fails or forces a tactical adjustment. The result is a beautiful but relatively unpressurized progression where tension is more atmospheric than sharply escalatory.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether to surrender to or reject an engineered “homecoming” impulse—is clear early and deepens as Elara confirms her Skinner-box hypothesis. Escalation is primarily conceptual and internal, cresting when Aris validates that the pilgrimage is manipulation and “fuel.” Her final renunciation is an earned stance crystallization, but the on-page price remains largely conceptual; no immediate counter-pressure or concrete consequence sharpens the cost. As a result, the conflict feels strong but could bear one more beat of tangible risk or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—reviving a dead battlefield-ocean through seeds and language—is clear, but the conflict is almost entirely one-sided and ritualized. The pressure does not really escalate; Silas performs his usual act, and concord is granted without friction or delay. There is no live possibility of failure on the page, nor any sacrifice demanded of him in this instance beyond routine effort. As a result, tension and on-page cost remain modest despite the large-scale thematic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming closeness with a lost beloved—is clear early, and the decoding sequence provides a steady drip of progress and tension. The main tightening comes when the familiar riddle reveals this is their private code, then again when the leaf maps to coordinates and a radio frequency, collapsing emotional distance. However, opposition is mostly situational and internalized; nothing truly pushes back besides difficulty and time, so escalation feels smooth rather than pressured. The closure is emotionally effective but could benefit from one explicit on-page risk or potential loss sharpened at the moment he commits to listening.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will find a mental and conceptual anchor in a place designed to annihilate them—is signaled early and tightened as the sketching fails and panic rises. The meaningful turn is the glimpse of structure in the photon stream, which transforms her goal from comfort-seeking to exploratory mapping. The price is largely internal and conceptual (abandoning the idea of a fixed, human-scaled sky and accepting an immense, lonely task) rather than external danger or a ticking clock. While the pressure could escalate more sharply, the conflict remains coherent and culminates in an earned stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.5)
    The declared stakes are enormous—ending a centuries-long stasis that preserves reality—but the on-page opposition is minimal, limited to environmental risk and the abstract danger of what he’s doing. Once he starts swapping pieces, nothing actively resists him; tension arises more from anticipation of consequences than from escalating obstacles. His agency is real and consequential, yet he never faces a genuine test of resolve or viable alternative path, so no trade-off is sharply dramatized. This keeps the conflict interesting but not truly gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—preserving the city’s ephemeral fear and grief without being overwhelmed or sentimental—is clear and under pressure from the intensifying noise. The escalation from individual whispers to an almost-deafening hum that “threatened to deafen him” provides a meaningful tightening that forces his intervention with the kings. The ethical cost of his emotional detachment is more conceptual than viscerally dramatized, keeping the stakes slightly cooler than they might be. Still, the narrative pressure builds coherently to a decisive act that reweights the situation.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.4)
    The core stake—whether Elara will keep numbing herself in a shifting, unstable world or risk her feared powers to create a real home—remains legible throughout. Pressure escalates via the mountain’s “hidden thunder” and the stone’s intensifying hum and heat, converging on the choice to plant the stone rather than discard or hoard it. That choice meaningfully forecloses an option: she cannot remain a passive wanderer of fictional refuges. A slightly sharper sense of what she stands to lose emotionally (beyond the abstract “crushing grief”) at the moment of choice would deepen the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.2)
    The core conflict—comforting stasis born of guilt versus the moral imperative to restore time—comes through clearly, and the stakes are legible and thematically apt. There is one solid escalation: moving from contemplation at the fountain to direct engagement with the tapestry under the pressure of the weakening barrier and approaching thunder. However, opposition remains abstract and somewhat soft; the magic “resists,” but there’s no genuine risk of failure or costly reversal, so tension never quite peaks. The resolution feels earned but not sharply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central conflict—Kaelen versus the Elders’ desire for a single, punitive narrative—comes through clearly and escalates from potential ritual to full-blown acoustic revolt. Stakes combine communal meaning-making (who is to blame) with personal risk (heresy, exile, or silencing), and Kaelen’s choice to continue speaking under rising chaos is an earned commitment. The canyon’s reaction and the Elders’ terror provide a solid intensification. The main limitation is that direct opposition never adapts or counters on the page, so once he begins, resistance is largely reactive rather than dynamically contested.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stakes—preserving meaning as the physical world dissolves—are clearly flagged early and tighten into the breath-by-breath urgency underwater. There’s a concrete escalation: paralysis → grabbing objects → falling into acid → racing to align charm and statue → finishing the narration as her lungs burn. Her core agency is the decision to endure suffocation long enough to complete the story, consciously accepting death as the price. The only limit is that external opposition is purely environmental, but internal resistance and the clock give sufficient pressure for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—how Elias will relate to Elara’s memory and his grief—is clear early and coherently developed toward the decision to relinquish the shell. Internal pressure builds through the journey, the careful painting, and the contemplation of the shell’s inevitable erasure, culminating in his release of it. However, escalation is more textural than sharply pressured; the risks of the caves and tide don’t significantly force his hand or present alternative options, and his commitment is never seriously in doubt once he enters the cave. The emotional cost is felt, but not deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central stake (preventing the ship from hitting the Teeth) is clear, and the pressure escalates from passive watching to an intense, embodied act of projection. Choosing the whispering, scent-based method over traditional loud signals gives the climax a moral and tactical edge. However, the outcome feels almost too assured once the vial is opened; there’s little sense of potential failure or resistance to his method in the peak beat. A single complication or moment of near-miss on the ship’s side could heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—safely guiding the reverse-migrating ghosts—is clear, and the pressure coherently intensifies with the lunar zenith and the humming, straining station. Elara’s agency drives the main tightening: choosing the censer as conductor, enduring the physical and emotional heat, and forcing the rusted gears over that “one last degree.” The cost is more internal and conceptual than visceral; while we feel weight and exhaustion, we never see a concrete failure scenario or lasting damage beyond fatigue, which mutes the peak slightly. Still, the escalation from quiet build-up to the screaming signals and then to drained aftermath reads clean and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s psychological survival and privacy of mind—is clear and high in concept, and the move to actually perform the occlusion is a meaningful tightening. However, the on-page conflict is almost entirely internal and unfolds without much resistance or complication; the ritual works on the first attempt with no visible trade-off. Tension does rise as he commits to the “impossible” method, but lacks a reversal or hard test of his resolve. The result is absorbing but relatively low-friction escalation for such large-scale stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Silas’s drive to decode the memory and, through it, his own isolation—is clear, and the hum intensifying plus the encroaching night provide a gentle sense of rising pressure. His main choices (to engage with a fragmented, possibly discardable memory and to honor it in the lantern room) form a coherent escalation and resolution under an internal-conflict frame. However, there is little real resistance or risk to his investigation, and no strong sense that he might refuse or mishandle the memory, so tension remains more contemplative than gripping. The cost is conceptual rather than dramatic: he takes on another heavy, secret burden, but the story could benefit from sharper pressure testing that decision.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stakes—survival versus the compulsion to confront/regain a lost path—are legible early and tighten as the water rises from waist to chin. The ant-guided search and the time pressure from the creek create a meaningful external squeeze that parallels his internal conflict. The decisive narrowing is strong: once the Doorway appears, his options are flood, retreat (off-page/impractical), or step through, and he chooses the psychologically hardest path. Slightly more on-page wrestling at that final beat could have heightened the sense of cost further.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clearly apocalyptic (end of the firmament) but wisely anchored to a local, survivable goal: reach the ember grotto and understand the dreams. Pressure escalates from the exposed climb to the lethal starlight impacts, to Isolde’s near-collapse as they approach shelter. The final “choice” is more a stance crystallization than a high-friction fork—Isolde endures and steps into guardianship rather than facing a sharply opposed alternative. That keeps the conflict satisfying but somewhat soft compared to the scale of the declared threat.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central pressure comes from Elian’s abstract goal colliding with Kaelen’s revelation of departure, forcing Elian to choose between attending to the relationship and exploiting the emotional shock to complete the work. That turn is credible and lands with a quiet but real cost, and the stakes—memory vs. transience—are thematically weighty. However, the procedural success of the alchemy is never in serious doubt; the conflict is predominantly tonal and internal, not structurally testing. The result is resonant but not maximally tense.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—maintaining a coherent self in the face of temporal dislocation and death—is clear and present from the grave discovery onward. Pressure rises as he weaponizes jealousy to leave the body, then loses that fuel and is forced back into his bleak reality. The key “choice” is ultimately endurance and recommitment to documentation, which reads as a quiet but credible renunciation of pure escape. The stakes remain mostly internal and could benefit from one more concrete on-page cost, but they still feel consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.2)
    The core stakes are emotional—Elias’s need to remain a healer/miracle-worker and Kael’s fear of obsolescence—and they’re signaled early and coherently. The main tightening is Elias producing and advocating for the screw, which both tests his intuition and Kael’s willingness to risk an irregular solution; the nod at the end acknowledges a shift in status and trust. However, once the screw is offered, the path to success is smooth: there’s little resistance, reversal, or visible price beyond the background cost of Elias’s anosmia and Kael’s pride. The piece opts for a quiet, single-turn escalation that works but doesn’t fully exploit its own pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes (permanent petrification vs survival with changed relationship to fear) are clear early and escalate coherently: each new crystal spread and gust of wind tightens the window for action. The crucial turn—rejecting academic runes for a childish rhyme—is both a character choice and a tactical one under time pressure. The cost is felt in burning lungs, painful shedding, and a real possibility of failure mid-ritual. Internal and external conflicts braid well, with the storm amplifying but not replacing the psychic struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—Elena’s need to apologize to her father’s ghost—is clear from early on and escalates well as the ritual becomes physically and emotionally dangerous. The pressure tightens when the readings spike and the father’s manifestation proves both agonized and unstable, forcing Silas to choose between Elena’s desire for more and the ghost’s integrity. Cost is legible in Elena’s frost-burn and in the unresolved sorrow that saturates the room. The conflict is strong but could go one notch deeper in moral or tactical complexity for truly elite stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake (universe dissolution vs continued existence) is signaled early and coheres through to the Spiral Arbitration confrontation. Pressure escalates as she moves from interior resolve to the direct test of the vortex’s pull, culminating in the choice and utterance of “unify.” However, the conflict remains largely abstract, and the solution arrives quickly once she opens the dictionary; there’s limited sense of narrowing options, sacrifice, or tactical adaptation under duress. The result is conceptually strong but emotionally and dramatically gentler than the apocalyptic stakes imply.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—what happens when Kaelen pierces the illusion and engages raw, gear-driven time—is clear early and escalates coherently from eerie stillness to sensory severance to near-disintegration. Escalation is driven by his choices: entering the trance, insisting on finding the “lock,” then turning the key despite the building vertigo. The cost is meaningful (psychic trauma, the realization that his life’s project was a search for something mercifully hidden), and the leap to zero is a credible, last-ditch tactic. Stakes remain largely internal/metaphysical rather than tied to others or irreversible physical damage, so the danger feels intense but a bit contained to his perception.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias maintains control or risks his mandate to “let go”—is clear, but pressure remains mostly internal and unopposed. Escalation is more a steady swell than a tightening vice; he decides to override safety defaults without facing concrete resistance, obstacles, or a sharpened ethical dilemma beyond his own inertia. External stakes (contamination, job, consequences for Mera) are only gestured at, so the price of his act reads as conceptual rather than vividly fraught. As a result, the turn is meaningful but feels relatively low-friction for the scale of its implied revolution.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Elena can reconcile her rational discipline with a magical, mortality-facing experience—is clear but gently pressured. There is escalation from subway speculation to physically exiting into an impossible library and reading an undeniable truth about her death. However, opposition is soft: nothing resists her, and her fear “does not come,” so she is never forced into a sharp trade-off or painful renunciation. The result is thematically coherent but low-tension, limiting the sense of real cost.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is emotional: whether these two anonymous strangers remain trapped in recursive grief or achieve a small unbinding. Pressure coheres around the “critical emotional loop” as the conversation intensifies, with Silas choosing to push the disc into a dissonant chord at the peak—a clear tightening and release. The cost is subtler than ideal at elite level (no risk or deep conflict for Silas himself), but the psychic stakes for the callers are legible. The loop-breaking moment successfully reweights the scene, though the absence of any threatened failure mode for Silas keeps the escalation from feeling truly knife-edge.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    The core stake—whether this moment of love can be preserved and reintegrated into the world—is clear and emotionally legible. Tension accrues through the time-bound window, the trembling handling of the photograph, and the uncertainty of whether the covenant will “knit back together.” However, pressure never quite sharpens into a true dilemma or visible risk beyond internal fear; success feels likely throughout. The cost—relinquishing the locket and accepting a new, less personal form of connection—is poignant but understated.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—Arthur’s loneliness versus his fear of genuine vulnerability—is clear early and tightens as his elaborate barter scheme culminates in a concrete test: will he trade the moon rock or the illusion it represents? The arrival of the woman with only a song as “currency” is a strong escalation that directly challenges his transactional worldview. His choice to discard the rock and invite music instead is a credible, costly renunciation that resolves the internal conflict. External survival stakes remain background texture, but they effectively frame and sharpen the personal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—securing emotional closure via the father’s hidden message under a tight cosmic deadline—is clear and sustained. Pressure escalates as the constellations begin to “shudder,” the ring vibrates violently, and sensations grow more intense, culminating in the stillpoint. Her choice is fundamentally one of endurance and trust: pushing deeper despite pain and panic, which earns the final release. What keeps this below the highest band is the relative smoothness of the path; no on-page reversal tests her commitment beyond moving faster under time pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.5)
    The declared stakes are immense—undoing wars, famines, revolutions—but on the page the pressure feels low and mostly abstract. The main tightening is the move from repairing the pen to actively drawing causal lines, with a mild ethical tension over whether he’s “saving the world or damning it further.” There is no real opposition, constraint, or escalating difficulty; his edits work smoothly, and the only fear of error is voiced, not tested. As a result, the final satisfaction reads as him completing a delicate procedure rather than making a hard, costly choice under escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes are largely internal and aesthetic: can Elias and the advisor convert this silence into a unique, bone-felt music. There is some escalation—the advisor’s movements crescendo, he sweats to keep her in frame, the need to “disrupt the oppressive quiet” is framed as necessary for creation—but there’s little sense of real risk or possible failure. No path is credibly foreclosed; the piece lacks a moment where a meaningful alternative (not creating, losing the composition, rejecting anonymity) is on the table. As a result, tension is present but muted, more meditative than truly pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—decoding Kael’s message to fulfill a promise and anchor her identity as protector of truth—is clearly signaled and thematically charged. Pressure escalates mostly through deepening understanding rather than through obstacles: each clue leads cleanly to the next, and there’s little sense of options narrowing or costs mounting beyond internal emotion. The key tightening is the choice to transform the vandalism into an image of speech-through-fire, which resolves the conflict in a single, elegant move. Still, the absence of substantive resistance or credible alternative outcomes keeps the conflict from feeling fully tested.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael will use the procedure to create a permanent shared sanctuary with Lena at the cost of his mind—is clear and present early. Pressure escalates through his deliberate sabotage, the machine’s attempt to override him, and the garden’s increasingly unstable response, culminating in the singularity moment. His agency is central to the turn; he actively refuses compliance and times his “jump” rather than being swept along. However, antagonistic forces (the scientists, the lab’s dampeners) remain somewhat abstract, reducing the sense of on-page struggle and making his success feel almost too unopposed.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether subtle control or loud force wins access and escape—is signaled early and tested through the race to the Blind Box. Pressure escalates well: Kael’s noisy pursuit brings in sirens and disorients him; Elias calmly exploits environmental constraints and finally erases the shortcut, trapping Kael within the grid. The cost is legible for Kael (capture) and conceptually for Elias, who chooses didactic cruelty over any other resolution, though his emotional price is only implied. The conflict remains mostly external/intellectual, so the tension is sharp but not deeply harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is the woman’s need to unburden her guilt versus the risk of remaining silent, with Elias’s response as the governing action. Pressure builds atmospherically rather than through concrete reversals, and the key “tightening” is his shift from passive watching to actively weaving light as an alternative to verbal confession. That said, conflict stays largely internal and abstract, with minimal visible cost or narrowing of options on the page. The ending resolves tension a bit too cleanly for the prior weight signaled, keeping stakes from fully biting.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can seed hesitation in a rigidly obedient city—is clear and escalates from private coaching to a coordinated, city-wide act. The key tightening is the synchronized reveal, which forces a visible clash between the Authority’s “one correct answer” doctrine and the multiplicity of chess positions; that reweights options conceptually. However, conflict remains largely one-sided: the Authority never exerts active, immediate counter-pressure, and Elias’s risk stays largely notional rather than tested. The tension is thus more intellectual and atmospheric than viscerally pressured, which holds the piece below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.3)
    The central stake—whether Vane will cling to a dying, geometric world or accept a dangerous new fluid existence—is established early and tightened effectively as the water rises and the dock begins to dissolve. The grapple that cannot become violence, the whale’s call, and the literal dissolution of the structure all escalate pressure, narrowing Vane’s options to a costly surrender. The decisive action of letting go is clearly framed as both physical and existential loss. The piece could push the price further—e.g., more concrete sense of what Vane leaves behind—but the trade-off is still legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—Silas’s need to neutralize his grief to avoid punishment—is legible early via the Happiness Mandate and the looming threat of “erasure.” Conflict escalates as he moves from whittling pine to desecrating the wedding bouquet, making his tactic more pointed and costly. The moral cost (erasing love to survive) is baked into his final state of “zero-gravity existence,” which reads as a genuine loss, not a win. The pressure is mostly internal and could perhaps tighten one more notch, but it remains coherent and cumulative.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—dissolving a once-heretical boundary between sky and earth through forbidden art—is clear, and there is a discernible tightening as she steps into the projection and lets the vibration “dismantle her physical sense of self.” Yet pressure remains relatively low: no external force pushes back, and the “dangerous” nature of her technique never manifests as a real test or near-failure. The climax is a deepening of experience rather than a hard choice under duress, so tension is more atmospheric than truly escalated.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—can Elara secure Silas’s awakening by paying a meaningful price in this glass-economy—is clear and escalates coherently through the negotiation and the risky sonic shattering. The tightening comes when the Glassblower rejects the moonflower and demands “utility,” forcing Elara to put forward the reed and its flawed, rusted state as both asset and risk. Agency is strong (she chooses to sacrifice a powerful relic for her art), but the felt cost is more conceptual than visceral, and Silas’s own suffering remains more background texture than active ethical pressure. As a result, tension is solid but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can transform digital data into a felt connection for Kael and, by extension, answer her own artistic crisis—is clear and localized. Pressure escalates well when the initial ritual visibly fails Kael, forcing her into improvisation. Her choice to question sensory assumptions and reconfigure the bells is an active solution rather than a convenient new power. The stakes remain introspective and modest, with little sense of what she risks beyond continued hollowness, which limits the perceived cost.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the woman can move out of the paralysis between intention and action—is clear early and resolved by the projection over her heart. Pressure escalates through the transformation of ash into diamond and the explanation of its unsettling artificiality, culminating in the illumination that forces her to viscerally confront the “tattoo” she couldn’t commit to. However, almost all agency lies with Elias once she arrives; after crossing the threshold she mainly witnesses events rather than making fraught choices in-scene. The cost is emotional rather than decisional, which works, but leaves the conflict feeling controlled rather than precarious.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.2)
    The primary stake is epistemic and ethical—whether Silas will remain a neutral mapper of patterns or risk involvement by revealing a system-level crime. Pressure escalates as the cards and measurements accumulate, culminating in the geometric anomaly and his breach of protocol to confide. However, opposition remains mostly internal and conceptual; the young man’s presence doesn’t push back or complicate Silas’s choice. The global stakes are immense, but the immediate cost feels more hinted at than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stakes—psychic entrapment versus dangerous truth—are clear early and carry through, with the archive’s manipulative environment providing coherent external pressure to match her internal conflict. Her agency drives escalation via the jagged, pattern-avoiding “dance” and the choice to touch the pagoda despite warnings. The cost at the end (loss of faith, burden of truth) is legible. However, we rarely feel the conflict tightening in discrete tests (e.g., near-failures or vivid temptations), so the tension plateaus instead of sharply escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether individuality’s shadow and thus real hope can be preserved in a euphoric collective—is clear and tightened as Elian confirms his theory and then must act on it. Escalation is quiet but present: from abstract suspicion, to proof via footage, to the delicate, high-stakes capture where startling the shadow would mean losing it. The cost is explicit: the woman will never be whole again, and the collective continues obliviously, with Elian bearing the burden. Conflict stays largely internal and situational rather than directly contested, keeping this just under higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.0)
    The primary stakes—saving the chameleon and determining what kind of person Elara will be after betrayal—are clearly established and maintained. Pressure coheres as she must act quickly and precisely under emotional duress, with escalation centered on the painful, high-risk procedure and the irreversible loss of the tail tip. Internal and external conflicts are well braided, but external resistance is relatively soft; there’s little sense that failure is truly possible beyond implication. The resolution is nonetheless earned through her practiced, focused agency in the surgery.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant conflict—Elias’s compulsion to expose the “wound of the world” versus his own physical limits and the plants’ distress—escalates coherently from internal tension to destructive physical action. The tunneling sequence raises stakes via pain, blood, and structural damage to the tower, culminating in the root’s revelation and the hourglass shattering. His agency is clear: he chooses to keep digging despite explicit psychic opposition. The stakes remain somewhat abstractly framed as “understanding pain,” but are anchored enough in bodily and environmental cost to be effective.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—locating where unused love goes—is clear and present throughout, and tension builds via the intensifying storm, the swelling emotional weight in her hands, and the risk of losing the strip’s ghost. Escalation is more atmospheric than oppositional; no antagonist pushes back, so pressure comes from timing and the delicacy of the ritual. Her agency in choosing to siphon the energy and accept the strip’s inertness provides a credible, if quiet, price. The piece stops short of sharper internal or external resistance that might lift the stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elian can survive and meaningfully channel the universe’s creativity—is clear from early on and escalates coherently. Pressure rises from background torment to the acute storm of ideas that physically drops him, with his frantic tracing of stars as an attempted solution that fails. The turn to rest is a genuine narrowing of options and a renunciation that answers the central problem through endurance rather than conquest. The “world-level” stakes (reviving human creativity) remain more declared than dramatized, so the conflict lands primarily as an intense but slightly insular spiritual crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—preventing the divergent archive from overwriting reality—is clearly defined and threads the entire scene. Escalation appears in the move from controlled ritual into dangerous dispersion (“for a terrifying moment, Kaelen became occasionally everywhere”), which reads as the story’s single meaningful tightening. However, the sense of real risk is buffered by the inevitability of his competence; we never fully entertain the possibility that he might fail or choose not to pay the price. The resolution is earned, but the conflict leans more contemplative than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether he can break out of rigid logic into a riskier, imaginative mode—is clear, and the turbine sequence serves as the concrete crucible for that. Pressure escalates from disorientation to the hum of dormant energy to the gamble of inserting the inexplicable gear, which yields a substantial internal/ambient shift. However, there is little genuine resistance or threatened loss once the turbine is found; nothing seriously tests his resolve or risks worsening his condition. The conflict thus feels more like a smooth unlocking than a contested transformation, limiting intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether he will remain shattered by the loss of the leash or claim his own courage—is legible and coherent throughout. Pressure escalates modestly: from raw pain, to the indirect approach to grief, to the vigil where “it is time” and he must physically step off the skiff and reach into the mist. The cost is implied (standing without the support that once kept him safe), but the story rarely makes refusal or collapse feel like a live alternative in the moment, tempering the sense of risk. More visible resistance or a near-failure at the station would heighten stakes without changing the structure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—physical safety versus spiritual/psychic freedom—is established and sharpened toward the end when Elian explicitly weighs fleeing into the blizzard against remaining as a hollowed but subversive servant. Escalation is primarily internal but tracks: physical pain + punitive task → discovery of erasure of music → conceptual reframing of the Keep → decision to stay with a new, oppositional intent. The cost of his choice is legible (continued captivity and pain against the thin hope of contamination), though the external situation doesn’t tighten beyond the initial punishment. It’s strong situational pressure rather than high-tempo conflict, but coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—who truly deserves gravitational and thus political authority—is clear and escalates from quiet preparation to violent magical consequence. Orel’s agency drives the conflict: he chooses an indirect, cerebral method instead of direct confrontation, and his earlier choices fully determine the outcome when the constellation pause arrives. The decisive turn (the rune firing and severing gravity for the Pretender) is dramatic and irreversible, with the Pretender’s panic underscoring the stakes. However, Orel’s personal risk and internal struggle under pressure are muted, so the sense of cost is more lopsidedly borne by the antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—solving the mystery of the vanished road and what it implies about the ocean’s cycles—is clearly established and deepens as Elian assembles the data. The main tightening occurs when the expected void resolves instead into a “chaotic, towering mountain range,” forcing a reinterpretation of prior assumptions. However, the conflict remains largely intellectual and observational; there’s little sense that Elian’s options or safety narrow, and no tangible price is paid beyond a conceptual shift. As a result, tension is sustained but not truly ratcheted to a breaking point.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—reviving the frigate as a symbolic and tactical heartbeat for the rebellion—is clearly stated and does culminate in a concrete success. There is one main escalation beat as the stones’ vibration rises to a “resonant thrum” and the bay shudders, but the path from initiation to triumph is too frictionless: no visible setback, resistance, or genuine risk tests Elara’s commitment. Internally, her desire for meaning doesn’t clash much with fear, doubt, or competing needs, so emotional stakes stay a bit abstract. The piece functions but stops short of real tension that would force a sharper, costed choice.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reviving the biosphere against the Council’s prohibition—is clear and present early, and tension escalates as the moss screams and patrols close in while she decodes under time pressure. Her actions directly drive turns (choosing to proceed despite warnings, completing the code, lowering the amber into the pool). However, resistance never meaningfully impedes her; the hovercraft arrive only once success is guaranteed, so the conflict feels a bit too one-sided and low-cost. The world-scale stakes are powerful but outstrip the on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can ride out a PTSD trigger without being swallowed by it—is clear and escalates sharply when the turbine-like whine throws him back to the wedding. His decision to freeze instead of diving, then to work through somatic markers and the photograph toward the pearl of stillness, constitutes meaningful agency under pressure. The cost is emotional and ongoing: he gains no reprieve from his past, only a hard-won capacity to continue his present work. The conflict is almost entirely internal, but it’s sufficiently tightened and resolved for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central stake—preserving his artistic self/soul versus being crushed or erased—is clear and progressively pressured as the room shrinks and light intensifies. Escalation tracks: recognition of knotted reality → attempt at redesign rather than passive waiting → walls inches from shoulders → urgent final yank and drop. The external threat (crushing walls) and internal conflict (fear of dark vs need for a clean canvas) interweave well, with the descent functioning as an earned, costly choice rather than a whim. There could be one additional concrete complication or failed attempt to further tighten stakes, but what’s present is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—recovering the temporal logs / preventing Kaelen’s escape in order to understand crisis-time—is clear and present from Silas’s first on-page goal. Pressure tightens coherently as he closes in, corners Kaelen, and then watches the ink transform into an escape route that he cannot counter in time. The cost is concrete (mission failure, loss of Kaelen) and internal (his need to reframe the hunt around geometry), but Silas’s agency during the climactic moment is limited to a lunge that comes too late, so the conflict resolves more through Kaelen’s prepared method than a fully contested struggle. This keeps tension solid but short of truly harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stake—whether Elara will detonate the founding myth of her society—is clear early and escalates coherently toward the lever. The arrival of Kael is a clean, effective tightening that removes the possibility of safe retreat and forces an immediate, high-cost choice “within the blink that follows surprise.” Internal and external conflicts interweave well, but we don’t see any partial price or near-loss before the final act, so the escalation feels more linear than compounding. Still, the final decision clearly forecloses a major path with world-scale fallout.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether she answers intrusion with violence or holds to her pacifist project—is signaled early via her lineage and vow. The alarm and armed stranger provide a clear, if brief, external spike that tests this, and the sheathing choice forecloses a real path. Escalation is modest; the danger never quite sharpens into palpable physical risk, which softens the sense of price. Still, internal and external conflicts interweave effectively, and the resolution is earned by her deliberate renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—capturing an extremely dangerous divine echo in a lethal environment—is clear and scales naturally with the descent of the constellations and the garden’s increasing hostility. There is a meaningful tightening when the sky collision fractures the garden’s logic and forces her decisive move. However, Elara rarely feels in true danger of failure; her tactics work on first try, and the “feral lullaby” never quite corners her into a hard trade-off or visible sacrifice. As a result, escalation is effective but stops short of fully exploiting the promised lethality and moral weight of the hunt.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central stake—whether the Vance fortune rests on a crime and whether a damning story will run—is clear and specific, with Eleanor’s reputation and self-concept on the line. There is one main tightening when she decides “It was time to intervene” and methodically dismantles the allegation. Yet the opposition is soft: Sterling folds quickly once presented with logic, and we never see information that truly threatens to withstand her counterargument. The conflict is engaging but lacks escalation and a concrete price that would make the climax genuinely fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—transforming unbearable guilt-noise into something bearable—is clear early and escalates coherently as the machine threatens overload and the fossil risks shattering. The time fold and imminent dissipation of the signal provide a concrete constraint that tightens options, forcing her to act with “only seconds to act.” The climax is decisively driven by her agency with the stylus, and the price is that she accepts memorialization over restoration. The conflict remains mostly internal/technical rather than morally knotted, but for this length it lands with solid tension.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the clamoring, dissolving memories can be guided into peace before they vanish—is legible and escalates as the auditory chaos mounts to “a fever pitch.” Elian’s agency is decisive: he studies the rhythm of the arguments and chooses a specific intervention (the negative-space cut) that forecloses passivity and sacrifices his art. The conflict is more situational and conceptual than visceral, which keeps the pressure from feeling truly knife-edge despite the well-staged escalation. The cost is present but modestly felt: a single ruined mandala and the acceptance of irrevocable forgetting.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.0)
    Conflict is sharply defined between programmed protocol (neutralize organics, preserve efficiency) and chosen mercy (protect and warm the child), with stakes focused on life vs compliance. Pressure escalates from internal hesitation to an active act of deception against the network, then to an ongoing physical sacrifice of heat and concealment from drones. The moral calculus is legible, though the external counter-force (central server/hunter-drones) never quite tightens to a breaking point, making the solution feel a touch too clean. Still, the choice to accept eventual doom for a temporary, hidden mercy carries a credible on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stakes—Clara’s potential bankruptcy and Barnaby’s need to transform despair into hope—are legible early and escalate as the Tower result collides with the fractured timeline. Barnaby’s inability to touch or speak, forcing him to rely on echoes, adds a meaningful constraint and drives his tactics. However, there is little resistance once he commits to the plan; the conflict is resolved smoothly without a real test or setback that would sharpen cost. The tension is more tonal and atmospheric than oppositional, which keeps the pressure from fully peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can find a way to live with the post-hive neural noise—is clear and present from the outset. Pressure escalates as verbal guidance proves unworkable, forcing Elias to invent the somatic, light-painting solution, and the three-minute exposure functions as the central ordeal. The resolution is earned by their shared physical endurance and trust rather than a miraculous cure, which is thematically apt. Still, the narrative progression is relatively linear and gentle; there’s little sense that failure here would have a sharply different consequence beyond continued suffering, which softens the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is Elara’s psychological integrity and success in translating overwhelming, quasi-mystical data into something useful. There is a discernible tightening when the thermal spike appears and she chooses to float over the abyss with senses heightened. However, the pressure never fully sharpens into a credible risk of failure or breakdown; she handles the encounter with little resistance or trade-off beyond transient overwhelm. As a result, escalation feels gentle rather than gripping, and the final stance carries more wonder than cost.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether fate remains an inescapable doom or becomes collective possibility—is clear and consequential. However, while the sonic chaos and methodical cataloging create a lovely procedural texture, resistance and risk are low; Elias never seriously doubts or fails, and nothing on the page threatens to thwart him. The main tightening is the gradual emergence of harmony and the final inversion of the master hourglass, but these unfold smoothly rather than under escalating pressure. The piece reads as contemplative reconfiguration more than struggle, which limits tension even as the conceptual stakes are large.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stakes—redemption versus death or permanent erasure—are legible from the outset and sharpen once the helicopter arrives but pointedly does not land. Pressure escalates coherently: first in the risky visibility of the snow codes, then in the handler’s suspicion, then in the irrevocability of surrendering the pillbox. The external conflict (agency mistrust) and internal conflict (courage vs. the easier escape of death) interlace, though his internal wavering is more implied than fully dramatized in the scene. The resolution—being left alive but unaffiliated—feels like a meaningful, costly tightening rather than a soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the woman can be distilled enough to cross before her time runs out—is conceptually clear but feels low-friction in execution. Silas encounters no resistance or real risk in performing the unthreading; her anxiety never crystallizes into an opposing choice, and the ticking clock never quite bites on the page. The escalation is a smooth deepening (more layers removed, then time expires) rather than a pressured test, so tension stays muted. It resolves satisfyingly but without a decisive, costly narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—Silas’s need to understand the oasis’s resistance to change—is legible from the outset, and pressure deepens as he engages the clay, hears the thrum, and glimpses the beekeeper. The key tightening comes when he realizes the place is “phototropic to kindness,” which reframes his role from fixer to witness/devotee. However, escalation remains mostly atmospheric and intellectual; there’s no strong moment where an alternative path is visibly foreclosed with palpable cost. The result is satisfying but relatively low-tension for an elite market.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether he can bring light to the woman’s basement—emerges clearly and tightens around the seized joint and the risk of breaking the mechanism. His choice to work the armature slowly, accepting time and effort over force, is a credible tactical adaptation under pressure. Internal and external conflicts align, but escalation is mostly mechanical and atmospheric rather than morally or emotionally fraught. The price of the resolution is felt, yet the intensity of opposition and narrowing of options could be sharpened further.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s ability to live with overwhelming reincarnation grief—is clear, and tension escalates as she moves from passive suffering to the high-stakes experiment with the stone circle. The hum intensifying and the act of stepping onto the disc provide a credible tightening and a climactic beat. However, resistance and potential failure are lightly sketched; she achieves equilibrium without much on-page jeopardy or pushback, keeping pressure in the “strong” rather than “urgent” band. The price is mainly conceptual and emotional, not dramatized as a real risk of breakdown or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can reconcile the silent love with some form of expression—is present but muted, operating mostly as aesthetic pressure rather than felt risk. The main escalation is her recognition that the installation is incomplete and her decision to use the spiral, which does deepen the premise. However, nothing truly pushes back: there is no credible threat of failure, social consequence, or moral tension about using the client’s gift in public art. As a result, tension is low and the outcome feels almost foreordained.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preventing the signal-induced campus war from becoming a massacre—is clear early and escalated via the growing noise and imagery of riots outside. Pressure coheres around whether Elias can rig a destructive interference signal before the transmitter fries or time runs out; his agency directly drives the climax. The decisive act (broadcasting the “silent scream”) immediately alters the situation outside, providing a legible narrowing of options for both humans and entities. The main limitation is the relative ease and singularity of that solution, with little on-page pushback or visible loss beyond fatigue and the abstract promise that the entities will adapt later.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—surviving the collapsing nexus while attempting to awaken the world—is evident early and escalates cleanly as the walls close in and options narrow to “keep playing or be crushed.” Internal and external conflicts are intertwined; her terror heightens just as the space physically tightens, and the climax hinges on committing to a dissonant, risky progression. The resolution clearly depends on her sustained, chosen action and carries a felt physical/emotional price. The only weakness is that the world-scale stake is accepted largely on assertion, so the conflict’s larger resonance is more conceptual than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Silas can pierce institutional and communal indifference through art—is clear and present early. Pressure escalates texturally rather than through overt reversals: skepticism, painstaking craft, the violent gesture of lancing the eye, and the integration of the real ribbon each intensify the moral/emotional weight. The key turn is Miller’s reaction, which credibly transforms a file into a person for him. However, the conflict is somewhat one-sided (Silas never seriously doubts or is obstructed), keeping escalation strong but not maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—reversing Silas’s exile and proving his courage—is clear and present from early on and tightens as Elara initiates the machine. Pressure escalates via concrete steps: placing the nail, the station shuddering, the hum, the petition to the storm, and the visual of the shipping lane opening. However, opposition remains mostly atmospheric; there are no real reversals, tactical adaptations, or visible prices beyond fear and risk-taking. The climax succeeds but tilts toward inevitability rather than a hard-won, precarious victory.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake is Silas’s relationship to his own guilt and to the seemingly “broken” bridge ahead, and that internal conflict is clear from early on. Pressure escalates conceptually—his observations transform into a quasi-ritual decoding of the glitch, culminating in the choice to stabilize the horizon with music and cross. However, the conflict stays largely interior and aesthetic; no concrete counterforce challenges his new interpretation once it appears, and the decision to drive on feels spiritually weighted but practically unopposed. The result is textured but somewhat low-friction tension rather than a sharply narrowing field of options.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Ringmaster survives via a predatory sale or starvation—is clear, and Silas’s decision to repel the acquisition is the meaningful tightening. His tactic succeeds, but the immediate threat then vanishes, and the rest of the piece tracks an almost foregone decline without a new, equally active conflict beat. Because the startup’s death plays out mostly as inevitability rather than mounting, adaptive struggle, the sense of escalating pressure is muted, even though the conceptual cost is well articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can metabolize another’s trauma and unlock the inscriptions—is signaled early and tracks through to the end. However, escalation is mostly linear and smooth: once she arrives at the temple and begins to speak, there’s no real sense she might fail or worsen the burden. The invisible weight and pulsing stars provide atmosphere but do not truly narrow options or force a trade-off. As a result, the outcome feels moving but somewhat preordained and low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—liberating the frozen confession—arrives early and coheres with every beat, with pressure tightening as Kaelen moves from shore into the lethal carousel and then directly attacks the barrier. Escalation is primarily environmental and magical rather than moral; success comes in one clean push once the seed is applied, with little genuine risk of failure or hard trade-off. The cost is mostly borne by Verrick and the landscape, with minimal visible price for Kaelen. As a result, tension is strong but not harrowing, and the climax feels slightly too assured.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—stabilizing the madness of an accelerated world by locating the intersection of dreams—is clearly signaled and fulfilled via the maze-vision. Escalation comes through the painful, risky linking and the intensifying internal pressure as he runs the psychic labyrinth. However, Jaren never has to choose between competing costs or forego a concrete alternative; enduring pain is the main price, and the danger of madness stays mostly hypothetical. The conflict works, but it could use at least one sharper, on-page trade-off or near-failure to feel fully tested.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—recovering Leda’s joy versus the cost demanded by the orchard—is clear from the outset and tightens effectively when the system demands a substitute. Elian’s choice to offer his own certainty is a genuine trade-off that narrows his future options and pays visible cost. The tension escalates through the groaning roots and guardians’ resistance, though their opposition remains more tonal than actively obstructive. A brief beat where failure feels more genuinely possible would sharpen the escalation further.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can trust his expertise again and find something authentically “real”—is clear and present from the start. Pressure escalates convincingly when he must abandon delicate appraiser tactics and physically wrest the frame, risking damage to the very proof he needs. The ticking threat of the crusher and Kellen’s indifference provide light external tension that supports the internal conflict. The only limitation is that failure never feels quite as viscerally possible as it could; the risk stays more implied than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are coherently signaled—both the arbor’s physical stability and the fate of Aris’s consciousness—and they do tighten when the containment field flickers and gravity lurches. Elian’s agency is central: he chooses to trust the seed, plant it, and reconfigure the station’s “syntax,” which resolves the external and internal stakes in tandem. Yet the conflict unfolds without meaningful setback, trade-off, or ethical bind; nothing pushes him to seriously doubt the act or risk losing Aris forever. As a result, escalation feels more like a dignified ramp-up than a true test under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether this paradox-ridden soul will be preserved whole or simplified/erased—is clear and sharpened by the description of most archivists’ approach versus Elian’s. Pressure does escalate from the heavy, thrashing soul to the violent vibration of the creel and the blinding light of the crucible. Still, the outcome never feels seriously in doubt, and we don’t see alternative tactics meaningfully threatened or foreclosed. The tension remains more contemplative than truly fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.9)
    The central conflict—seal and preserve isolation versus risk unleashing accumulated hope and grief—tightens effectively as Elias moves from observation to a charged choice at the pillar. The explicit orders to “seal the entrance, and ensure that nothing could get in or out” frame clear stakes, and the act of crowning the stalagmite forecloses the option of obedient containment. That said, the escalation is almost entirely internal and moral; there’s no additional on-page complication or counter-pressure once the pearl is discovered, so the climax feels a touch smooth. A small external resistance or a sharper sense of what could be lost by turning the bunker into a beacon would heighten the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can confront his guilt enough to seek self-forgiveness—is clear early and pursued consistently. Pressure escalates via his decision to treat graffiti as coordinates, physically descend to the old accident site, and “play” a drowning gasp as apology, culminating in tears and a new relationship to the river. Internal conflict between fear/avoidance and compelled truth is present but relatively understated in moment-to-moment choices. The river’s nonjudgmental acceptance arrives without much friction, so the climax reads more as solemn fulfillment than a hard-won reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—obtain unspoken truths without being trapped—is clear and present throughout. Pressure escalates well when the cycle threatens inversion, the light bruises purple, and the watch grows hot, forcing her to cut short the intoxicating search. However, she navigates out without a real sacrifice beyond leaving with “enough,” so the cost feels modest rather than scarring. The conflict is engaging but could sharpen by forcing a more painful trade-off between safety and revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—imperial control versus liberated wildness—comes through early and is meaningfully tightened by the ticking window before dawn and the ivy’s urgent “screams.” Elian’s choice to plant the seed and pour the coffee constitutes a clear escalation and decisive turn that forecloses the path of obedience. However, the path from doubt to success is relatively smooth; there’s minimal on-page resistance, complication, or sense that the attempt could fail once decided. The cost remains largely offstage, conceptualized as future imperial consequences rather than felt reversals in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—salvaging a “spark” of Vane’s essence before oblivion—appears early and remains coherent through the final transfer. Tension escalates texturally as she sifts the static, locates the rhythm of his theorem, and rides the zero-point moment into action. Yet the conflict is largely one-sided; the opposition (entropy) is abstract and never meaningfully pushes back once she engages the method. As a result, the climax feels impressive but not truly contested, and the cost is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central conflict—Elara versus the vine/pod’s refusal, mirroring the soul’s fear—is clear and thematically tied to her own past terror. There is a meaningful tightening when she recognizes the soul’s fear as akin to her own and must choose a gentler, more intentional method (scalloping) rather than forcing the harvest. However, the resistance is never very threatening to her or the broader system, and success feels assured once she has her moment of clarity. The stakes stay largely conceptual and internal, which works, but limits intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central conflict—Vance’s unwavering resolve to bombard versus Elias’s aim to introduce doubt—is clearly established and escalates through the iron chime choice into the mirror confrontation. The mirror beat is an effective tightening, collapsing Vance’s self-mythology into the image of the terrified boy and forcing a genuine reconsideration of his order. The cloak then reframes the conflict from pure shattering to “safe” doubt, giving the final poise its moral and emotional charge. The main limitation is that Vance’s reversal happens very swiftly for the scale of the offstage stakes, with relatively little resistance beyond a single gasp and stumble.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can meaningfully grasp the nature of manifestation—is clear and focused, and Elara’s withholding heightens the pressure. Escalation is primarily internal: his insistence, the trance deepening, and the dawning realization that the stone will not return. The grotto passage is a solid tightening, but there is limited visible cost or risk beyond “will he understand or not,” so tension remains mostly contemplative. The conflict resolves in a satisfying reorientation, though the lack of any real alternative failure path keeps it from the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—escape via mastering immobile navigation—is clear and thematically tight, and pressure coherently builds as he commits to a single, high-stakes throw. The key tightening comes when the new tones intersect with the decades-old pulse, transforming a routine technique into a once-only alignment. However, opposition is mostly environmental and internal; there’s little on-page risk of failure beyond implication, so the attempt reads more like a difficult but controlled procedure than a harrowing gamble. The resolution feels earned but relatively smooth, with cost front-loaded in backstory rather than actively tested in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can enact a non-automated, human-paced magic that matters—is signaled early and escalates through physical risk (the climb, mist walking) and institutional risk (discarding the regulatory pack). The key tightening beat is her decision to unstrap the system’s protection, which forecloses a safer, compliant path and enables the keystone’s full effect. Stakes are more conceptual than visceral world-ending, but the Looms’ stutter and her bodily depletion give the conflict credible, scaled cost for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether her promise was sincere and what that means for his long-held grief—is clearly signaled and coherently pursued. Escalation is primarily internal and situational: the journey from pier to seabed to the specific jar, with the key moment being his decision to unscrew the lid and face the memory. The price is emotional rather than physical—years of avoided dawns, the risk of re-opening an old wound, and the vulnerability of literally and figuratively “witnessing” the vow—which does register at the climax. The conflict remains more contemplative than pressured; there’s little sense that he might turn back or that a live alternative path is foreclosed on the page, which limits it to strong rather than ferocious.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving history to seed a future universe—is clearly signaled and thematically coherent. Pressure deepens as the static resolves into a specific, moving account of the coral cities, which then triggers Hiero’s realization that the cycle might not rebound, sharpening his internal conflict. The main tightening is his move from purposeful confidence to suffocating doubt, followed by his choice to persist. However, conflict remains primarily conceptual and internal; there is little adaptive struggle or trade-off beyond endurance, so escalation feels modest relative to the declared cosmic scale.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—transmuting his grief and her fatal obsession into something contained and bearable—is clear, but the conflict remains largely internal and uncontested. There is a soft escalation as he moves from one monster/fear to many, and his chest “lightens” with each crystallization, but there are no genuine risks, reversals, or trade-offs that narrow his options. His agency is present (choosing to bind rather than reap), yet nothing on the page resists or costs him beyond a gentle emotional ache. As a result, tension feels beautiful rather than sharp, limiting the upper range.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (restoring the sea/cosmic balance) is signaled early and tightly tied to Elian’s drop-by-drop task. Pressure escalates through the precision requirement and psychic risk—each drop must be perfect or “shatter his psyche along with the bell”—and the final drop functions as a clear tightening and release. However, the conflict remains largely procedural; there’s no real reversal, failure, or forced trade-off beyond sustained concentration, and the hinted cosmic blowback is not tested on the page. The stakes are grand but the on-page struggle remains relatively smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the resurfaced town will be received as scandal or as a site of loving remembrance—is clear, and Elias’s mission to reshape that reception provides direction. However, opposition is entirely anticipatory (future scavengers and the entrenched rumor), so pressure never quite tightens into active conflict; his path from ridge to apothecary is essentially unimpeded. There is one meaningful deepening at the apothecary, where the heaviest rumor is confronted and re-scripted, but no true reversal or hard trade-off. The cost of his choice is conceptual and quiet rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes—saving the frozen dew crystal at the last celestial alignment and achieving her lifelong goal of harmonizing logic and intuition—are clearly signaled and interwoven. Pressure tightens as the sky darkens and her conventional methods are implicitly rejected, forcing a real choice to abandon pure rationalism at a critical moment. However, once she leans into wonder, the path to success feels relatively unimpeded, with no reversal or palpable loss beyond the risk of failure. The conflict is compelling but could benefit from a sharper on-page price or complication as she executes the new tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are concrete and legible early: Lyra’s life, plus the risk of stranding both characters if they abort. Conflict escalates sharply with the discovery of the micro-fracture, and the necessity to improvise with limited tools and time creates a meaningful narrowing of options. Kael’s agency—deciding to cannibalize his own gear and conceal the crisis—drives the outcome rather than luck. The price is felt more emotionally than materially, but the sense of narrowly averted catastrophe sustains tension through the countdown to parachute deployment.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stakes—Kael’s bid for emotional restoration versus the corporation’s legal claim—are clear, and the duel plus the vivification sequence provide a proper escalation and climax. Internal and external conflicts interweave, with the external fight clearing a path to the internal, existential win. Yet the external antagonist yields too easily once his “lie of authority” is cut, undercutting a sense of real jeopardy, and we don’t see a sharp trade-off or sacrifice beyond a conceptual transfer of energy. The conflict resolves cleanly, but the price paid feels light relative to the grandeur of the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—overcoming creative block and deciding what to do with the mysterious seed—is clear, and there is one escalation when the seed sprouts, raising the question of what it is and what it might become. Yet there’s almost no resistance or risk: Elias never seriously considers discarding it, nothing goes wrong with his experiment, and no moral or practical danger is dramatized beyond a gestured-at potential stench. His “decision” to use it for an escape room reads as opportunistic inspiration rather than a pressured trade-off. As a result, tension is present but soft and never quite bites.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—summoning lost laughter—is clearly established and escalates as Silas moves from starting one engine to orchestrating twelve and then adding his lullaby as a last, desperate tactic. Internal and external conflicts braid effectively: his guilt and longing drive him to endure the punishing roar and fumes in hopes of a brief reconnection. The main tightening comes when the sound shifts from mechanical drone to “true haunting,” and then the decisive appearance of laughter that reweights everything before the fuel runs out. The escalation is strong but somewhat linear; there’s little sense of alternative strategies or potential refusal once the ritual begins.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.5)
    The core stake—whether the guardian will perform its role as predator-curator or risk vulnerability to satisfy new curiosity—is clearly signaled and coherently developed. Pressure escalates when the pendant’s harsh light threatens the library’s ambiguous reality, sharpening the cost of inaction. The main tightening is the decision “I did not strike; instead, I chose to wait,” which forecloses the path of habitual violence and opens the risk of contamination or failure. The conflict remains mostly internal and contemplative, so while the escalation is real, it lacks the sharper external consequences that might push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether anything living can survive the planet’s slide into stasis—is clear and tied to Elian’s personal rebellion against Orthodoxy. Escalation is well handled through successive failed creations and the encroaching frost, which narrows both time and emotional options. The moment of insight about authority/order versus life meaningfully reframes the conflict and leads to a higher-risk tactic (dissolving bonds rather than shaping order). The primary cost is symbolic and existential rather than physical, but it is legible and entwined with his identity.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—capturing a dying nebula’s last transmission—is clear, with a secondary ambient risk from the unstable, wind-battered structure and volatile magic. The main escalation comes from the overwhelming lunar interference forcing Elara to abandon standard protocols and invent a new approach. Once she makes that cognitive shift, success follows relatively smoothly, with no further reversals or visible losses. The pressure is real but stays at an intellectual/technical level; her body and safety never feel truly in jeopardy, which flattens potential stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—returning the ferry and its lost commuters to reality—is clear, and pressure coheres around whether Elara can restore time. There is some escalation as she moves from maintenance to active reality-hailing and as the hourglass begins to fill, culminating in the violent lurch back into the living world. However, conflict is largely one-sided: the void offers mood, not active obstruction, and Elara never faces a real dilemma, failed attempt, or narrowing of options that forces a trade-off. The result is tense in concept but relatively smooth in execution, limiting the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—holding impossible structures together without losing his mind—is signaled early and escalates well as the illusions gain mass and the gallery “watches him” for collapse. His agency (choosing to weave more tightly, sacrificing logic willingly) directly triggers the final rupture, so the climax is earned rather than arbitrary. The cost is clear—entrapment in the dream logic and painful contact with the snapped thread—though largely internal and conceptual. Stakes could feel even sharper if there were a more specific consequence beyond himself (or a more concretely defined loss of self) to heighten the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Harlin can use alien math to reclaim celestial navigation, and at what emotional cost—is legible and coherently pursued. Tension builds from conceptual experimentation into the unsettling success of the simulation, culminating in the realization that his triumph only underscores humanity’s cage. The decisive tightening comes when the abstract “edge geometry” abruptly yields a palpable starfield, transforming the problem from theoretical to existential. The conflict stays mostly internal and conceptual, so while it’s thematically potent, the pressure feels quietly intense rather than sharply escalated by concrete, immediate risk.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—saving a terrified child-spirit from predatory shadows—is clear and escalates naturally from curiosity to immediate peril. Elara’s agency drives each turn: choosing to stay, to break protocol, to tune the hearing aid, to address the unseen child, to hold the connection as the shadows attack. The cost is present (risk of being overwhelmed, physical shock, and emotional drain) but could be felt more viscerally to heighten the sense that she might genuinely fail or be harmed. Still, the tightening of pressure toward the feedback crescendo reads cleanly and earns the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    External stakes (thirty-two lives plus his own) are clearly stated and tested against a real deadline. Pressure escalates through the sensor’s screaming, the violent physical effects of the phase transitions, and the hull groaning as the tide turns. His agency directly drives the central turn: choosing to initiate the risky Return rather than flee. The conflict progression is strong but fairly linear, with no major mid-scene reversal or hard trade-off beyond bravery vs survival, which slightly limits the sense of sharp escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    The core stake—resolving the unanswered emotional logic of his wife’s death and their last argument—is signaled early and narrows into the specific need to “defragment her final thoughts.” Pressure escalates as the ritual moves from preparation to unstable projection to the painful revelation of her hidden fear. The cost is clear: he gains clarity that cannot save her and must live with the reweighted guilt and insight. Conflict remains largely internal and could use one sharper external snag or risk, but the internal escalation reads coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving tactile reality against the death of language—is signaled early and paid off when Sylas sacrifices his voice to fix texture into the canyon’s echo. Pressure tightens when the birds arrive and he must act before “the moment passed,” and the curse’s cost lands clearly at the climax. However, the conflict remains largely one-directional: his plan succeeds on the first major attempt, with no serious on-page doubt, interference, or competing value to choose against. The stakes are conceptually high but experientially a bit smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—can Elias transform a hollow “return” into something truly alive—is clear early and the pressure coheres around the impending ritual on Silas’s brother. Escalation is satisfying: from unsettling specimen, to activating the phone, to crushing emotional confession, to bodily cost (blood), to the gravity break and metamorphosis. The resolution is decisively driven by Elias’s agency rather than coincidence, and the visible price (pain, vulnerability, one-shot device now “dead and silent”) gives the ending weight. The main limitation is that external resistance is low—the ritual never seriously threatens to fail or backlash—which slightly softens the sense of risk at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can reawaken forbidden beauty at the risk of shattering the city’s order—is signaled early and escalates as her music triggers a larger-than-expected uprising. The pressure tightens from tentative playing to an unstoppable geographic revolt, and there is a meaningful turn when the orchard “decided to answer with violence.” However, Elara herself faces little direct jeopardy or forced choice under fire once the uprising begins; she mostly witnesses the consequences rather than navigating them. The cost lands at the level of the world, with limited dramatized conflict between competing values inside her.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes—survive the drones, keep the storm contained, make the narrow mail-drop window—are clear early and remain coherent throughout. Pressure tightens as he enters the drone grid with a volatile object, where any abrupt movement or misstep could be fatal, and his method of threading blind spots creates a tangible sense of risk. The internal desire to heal a broken world mirrors the external risk but doesn’t generate a sharp moral dilemma or trade-off; his course is never truly in doubt. Still, the piece earns its quiet climax as an endurance-based resolution with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—completing the transcendent horse before the chime fades—is established early, and pressure tightens when Elias finds the volatile halo fragment that he cannot safely bear without changing tactics. The meaningful turn is his choice to sing, sacrificing his ideological silence to achieve his artistic goal, and this clearly resolves the external conflict. However, resistance is relatively low once he commits; the time limit and volatility feel more atmospheric than truly threatening, so escalation never quite bites as hard as it could. The conflict is satisfying but not harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—accessing the pre-written realm of stories—is clear and the pressure tightens as the scarf ritual distorts space and reality. The main escalation comes from sensory intensification and the brief vision of the “ocean where pure narrative flowed,” followed by the portal’s collapse. Conflict is almost entirely internal and conceptual, with minimal external opposition beyond the fabric’s physical limit. This keeps the tension elegant but relatively low-intensity, with the price of failure felt more intellectually than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether she can reconstruct the runaway dream before it curdles into regret—is clear and present early. Escalation comes through time pressure (the rising sun) and the demand for precision (“The cipher of longing demanded accuracy”), and there is a credible sense of strain as she works faster. The cost is primarily internal and conceptual, and while the sun’s final detachment provides a nice tightening, there is little in the way of reversal or hard trade-off beyond success vs. lingering ache. The conflict remains mostly static in valence, even as intensity increases.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—liberating a long-buried creative self—is signaled early and escalated through the literal destabilization of her footing. The disorientation beat is the main tightening, forcing a concrete risk: she must endure terror and relinquish safety. However, the conflict resolves smoothly once she obeys his instruction, with little sense that refusal or failure remains a live option. Internal resistance could be more protracted or morally fraught to sharpen the felt price of change.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—recovering his wife’s voice—is emotionally high and signaled early, and tension builds as he waits for the rare realignment. The main escalation comes from the ticking, one-shot nature of the alignment event rather than from active opposition or reversal. Once the pattern appears, the path to success is essentially unobstructed; there’s no moment where his goal is seriously imperiled by his own choice or an external counterforce. The result is moving but somewhat low in on-page friction, keeping the stakes’ felt sharpness short of elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Lenore will reclaim a body and face the light, and whether Silas will let her “earn” it—is clear early and tightens steadily. Pressure escalates from caged agitation to deliberate provocation, to the marked fracture, to the explosive break, with each move either narrowing options or forcing bolder action from Lenore. External conflict (prison vs. escape) and internal conflict (Silas’s fear and tenderness vs. his harsh pedagogy) are intertwined, especially when he forces himself to stand his ground. The cost is more emotional and conceptual than materially dramatized, which keeps the stakes intense but relatively contained to this chamber.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether wonder can be preserved and delivered to the iron city—is clear but never truly pressured. Elian faces no serious opposition, moral dilemma, or risk of failure; fatigue is mentioned, but there is no turn where his goal or method is in jeopardy. The process escalates descriptively (cutting the seed, braiding the essence, imagining rain) without a corresponding tightening of options or visible price. As a result, the ending reads as a successful execution of a plan rather than an earned resolution forced by conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    The core stake—contain the volatile spirit in the mask before it escapes—is clearly established and escalates as each knot releases heavier silence and the mask’s struggle intensifies. Internal and external conflicts interweave through the revelation of the brother and grave-theft, but Elian never truly contemplates an alternative course, so the moral calculus is more inferred than actively contested. The tightening is effective (ambient sound vanishes, air grows heavier, his heartbeats boom) and culminates in the decisive threading of silence. The cost to Elian is emotional and ongoing, but some readers may want one more beat of visible internal resistance under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is Elara’s desire to locate and open the Whispered Chapel, signaled early and pursued consistently, with a meaningful tightening when she decodes the woman’s grief as the key to the mechanism. However, external obstacles are minimal and there’s no real pushback or serious risk if she fails, so pressure never fully bites. The emotional cost of potentially violating a sacred, protective seal is not dramatized as a dilemma, only hinted at thematically. As a result, the escalation from observation to action feels smooth rather than fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding and enacting “the physics of letting go” via the captain’s trapped resistance—is articulated and followed through. There is one meaningful tightening when Elias isolates the captain’s fear and decides he must personally collapse the loop, linking his intellectual quest to an on-page act. Yet the conflict is mostly one-sided; the haunted object never pushes back and there’s no real jeopardy, ethical tension, or risk of failure. As a result, tension remains conceptual and elegant rather than viscerally escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—freeing/soothing Kaelen’s glitching consciousness—is signaled early and paid off with the smoothing lights and emotional release. Escalation comes mainly through time and energy pressure (gathering storm, then the instantaneous window between lightning and thunder) rather than external opposition, but it’s clear and effective at this length. Elian’s agency in designing and executing an unusual, risky method drives the turn rather than coincidence, even though lightning as trigger skirts the edge of luck. The cost is mostly emotional and symbolic (the mural’s erasure, the quiet finality) rather than a sharp on-page loss, but it lands.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elian can uncover hidden joy in a life defined by tragedy—is clear but inherently quiet. There is a mild clock (the elevator floors) and a procedural escalation as he tests the goggles and light, but no genuine risk, opposition, or sacrifice. The new knowledge deepens things rather than foreclosing options in a painful way. As a result, tension is more contemplative than gripping, and escalation flattens near the top floors.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elian can find proof that the void remembers—is clearly established and is tightened when the Nimbus of Resentment reveals the looped summer day. The escalation is a deepening of scale and clarity rather than a reversal, which suits the accumulative design but keeps tension mostly intellectual and elegiac rather than truly pressurized. Elian’s key “choice” is to keep observing, sketching, and conceptualizing under emotional strain; luck (the emergence of that specific cloud) does most of the heavy lifting. The cost—remaining alone but now duty-bound—is felt but arrives more as a reframed stasis than as a hard trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—completing a convincing infinite sky before the building collapses—is clear early and sharpened by the ticking demolition and his dawning sense of his limits. There is a strong tightening when he discovers the fractal formula on the coin and uses it to transcend his plateau, followed by the bittersweet reversal that the masterpiece will immediately be destroyed. The main weakness is that once the coin appears, the path to success is relatively unimpeded; there’s little on-page resistance or cost beyond time pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—proving and charting stranded luminance—is clear, and pressure does tighten as the hopscotch pattern hums, the air thickens, and the sphere appears then dissolves. However, Elara faces minimal resistance or meaningful risk; each step succeeds on the first try, and there is little sense of danger, potential loss, or hard trade-off beyond the ephemeral nature of the light. The revelation feels wondrous but not hard-won. The escalation therefore reads more like a controlled unveiling than a true test under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—freeing the stuck moon and restoring cosmic rhythm—is clearly signaled and tracks through to the end. The corridor of soul-mirrors is a strong internal pressure point, and the seized Astrolabe with “light as weight” is an elegant externalization of the conflict. However, once she overcomes the mirror hall by closing her eyes, and once the solvent is applied, the machinery yields after a single strenuous turn; there’s little sense of real risk of failure or cost in the act itself. The conflict escalates conceptually more than in lived pressure, keeping it strong but short of fully gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—shielding the colony from lethal radiation—is clear and present, and the pressure does tighten once the nebula’s thinning is established and the anchors are “groaning.” The turn from despair to action via Oren’s diagram and the command to reexamine is effective, and the collective labor sequence does embody the “many hands” solution. However, the path from discovery to success is almost entirely unopposed: there’s no significant setback, ethical trade-off, or risk that forces a difficult choice. As a result, escalation feels smooth rather than harrowing, limiting the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—encoding and transmitting a lullaby-feeling into the next universe before this one collapses—is powerful and signaled early. Pressure builds texturally as he calibrates the clock, the pane glows, and the mechanics shift from ticking to harmonic humming. However, the conflict is largely internal and resolved without serious resistance; there’s no genuine test of his will or ability, and nothing on the page ever credibly threatens the plan. The final choice to trigger the transmission and accept dissolution functions as escalation, but the outcome feels preordained rather than wrestled from opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—save the travelers before birds or frost kill them—is clear from early on and tightens effectively as birds attack and frost begins to form. Escalation is coherent: locating the nut, building under time pressure while the birds turn toward him, then the device’s deployment. The resolution is driven by Silas’s agency, with the price being his physical depletion and ongoing entrapment in the cursed role. Internal conflict is present but secondary; if it had been more sharply tested at the peak, the stakes could feel even more piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant conflict is internal—between his past pursuit of the “unbreakable” and his present need to create purposeful impermanence. Pressure mounts in a gentle, accumulative way as images of plastic waste, his wife’s critique, and the river’s behavior converge on the realization of a “molecular eddy.” There is one meaningful tightening when he reframes his entire design philosophy in response to what he sees. Still, the stakes are largely intellectual and moral, with little on-page resistance or trade-off beyond his grief and guilt, so tension stays contemplative rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—Elian’s pursuit of narrative origin through erasure—is conceptually clear but never concretely pressured. The only on-page “conflict” is procedural (can he successfully cleanse the journal) and that is resolved without complication or cost. The bell announcing the first customer is a potential escalation, but it lands as a promise for a future scene rather than a tightening within this one. As a result, tension remains low and largely abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will risk psychic damage to metabolize the stored remorse so the fortress can be relieved—is clear and escalates through touch to ingestion. The key tightening occurs when contact with the coral floods her with despair, proving the danger and making her subsequent choice to consume it a real test of commitment. Costs are legible but primarily internal and atmospheric, with limited on-page sense of lasting damage or trade-off beyond exhaustion. Strong, but a sharper articulation of what she loses or risks long-term would push pressure into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—social cohesion and food security versus machine panic and hoarding—is stated early and tracked clearly. Pressure escalates when she burdens the clock and must physically sustain the altered rhythm while singing, creating a credible tightening. However, the conflict lacks a genuine reversal or hard choice: the silos’ shift from cacophony to harmony unfolds smoothly once her method is applied, and there’s little sense that failure is a live possibility. The ethical tension (forcing them to listen vs. respecting their fear) is implicit but not dramatized as a true dilemma on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can and will rewire herself to carry the world’s discarded subconscious—comes through, and escalation tracks from calm tinkering to dangerous self-modification to overwhelming inundation. The psychic flood and burning-in of new pathways clearly raise the cost and narrow her options: she can’t easily return to who she was. However, the danger remains mostly conceptual; we’re told it’s “dangerous” but don’t see a concrete near-failure, alternative, or trade-off she actively rejects in the moment. The tension is genuine but could be sharpened by one explicit on-page risk or lost option.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reactivating the Seeds to prevent chaos below—is introduced early and escalates through the dangerous journey, four-dimensional unlocking, and collapsing anomaly on exit. The time limit and unstable physics provide real structural pressure, and the final escape beat tightens that effectively. However, conflict is mostly environmental and technical; there is no significant reversal, failed attempt, or value-based trade-off that forces her to sacrifice something or choose between competing harms. As a result, the pressure curve is coherent but feels somewhat frictionless for the scale of the stated stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—coaxing a true note from a mute world—is clear and emotionally loaded from early on. There is a meaningful tightening when Elian revisits the failed ash sculpture, reframes the cracks as “scream lines,” and alters his tactics. However, once the new understanding lands, the path to success is relatively unimpeded: there’s little on-page resistance or risk of renewed failure beyond implication. The conflict reads as high-concept but low-friction in execution, which limits the sense of costful escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding the spirits’ silence and, by extension, the truth and value of his exile—is signaled early and tightened as the nexus hum intensifies and time before the “next phase” narrows. The meaningful turn is his deciphering that the spirits are castling, not betraying, followed by his choice not to return; this reweights his options and identity. However, the pressure remains mostly contemplative, with little friction or real contest of alternatives on the page, so escalation feels more like a smooth deepening than a strenuous test. The cost is present but understated, which keeps tension solid but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central conflict—opening the clasp without “violence” and in harmony with its emotional resonance—is conceptually interesting and clearly stated. There is a mild escalation as he cycles through frequencies and reframes the lock’s stance from anger to protection, leading to the eventual “sigh” of release. But the stakes remain abstract and low; nothing material or relational is threatened if he fails, and his success never feels seriously in doubt. That lack of real jeopardy or trade-off keeps tension from fully sharpening.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can find a form of inner stillness in a world of motion—remains consistent, and the “turning of the tide’s thought” plus the flower’s single-decade bloom provide a credible clock. Pressure escalates texturally: the spadix rises, the sky bruises, the scent hits like a “physical wall,” forcing her into intense sensory engagement and a flurry of annotation. However, opposition is mostly existential rather than actively resisted; there’s little sense that failure or a different outcome is truly possible, which keeps the stakes emotionally resonant but somewhat low in felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—recovering a life-saving resilience source during a dangerous, time-limited Flux—is clear and escalates as instruments fail, water reverses, and gravity is about to reassert itself. Elara’s choices (flying into the Flux, following water, physically twisting the arrow) drive the primary turns. However, tension is more conceptual than visceral; we’re told the danger but rarely feel genuine uncertainty about her success or survival. The resolution is clean but slightly low on visible price or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central conflict—decoding a lethal environment to prevent future crashes—is clear and grows as Elara confirms the fatal convergence of wind pattern and structural weakness. Pressure is mostly intellectual and procedural; there’s little immediate jeopardy or reversal beyond deepening comprehension. Her agency (choosing survey points, interpreting data, deciding to map hazards for future drones) does narrow options conceptually but without a sharp on-page trade-off. The result is a strong but relatively quiet escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—ring the bell at the exact moment to validate the sculptor’s first strike—is conceptually strong but plays out with very little friction or escalation. The only tightening comes from the synchronized build of aurora intensity and the sensed coil of the sculptor’s muscles, after which the task proceeds smoothly. Failure or delay never feels genuinely live on the page, and there’s no reversal, complication, or cost beyond routine expenditure of magic. As a result, tension is mostly thematic and atmospheric rather than conflict-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Silas can extract meaningful, costly insight from his catastrophic failure—is clear from early on, and pressure coheres around that internal goal rather than a physical showdown. Escalation happens as silence turns from oppressive to charged, then the flute playing opens a dangerous, nauseating vision that forces a reframing of his past attempt. The cost is the recognition that his order’s foundational tactic was misapplied and that this understanding comes too late to redeem his reputation or undo the damage, which gives the quiet ending bite. The conflict remains almost entirely internal, so while effective, it never quite reaches a feeling of inescapable crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—the Operator’s drive to quantify emotion versus the cost to Kael’s psyche—is clear and escalates as the machine engages and the empathy torrent hits. The pressure rises in one meaningful tightening: from unsettling setup to overwhelming psychic inundation. However, Kael has little agency beyond endurance; he doesn’t make a consequential choice that alters the outcome, which limits the sense of moral or tactical turning. The cost is visible (Kael hollowed, Operator invigorated), but the conflict remains largely one-sided.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—successfully germinating the relic to re-enchant a dulled world—is clearly signaled and followed through to completion. Internal and external pressures (anxiety, thin air, exposed mountaintop) build toward the activation moment, and her choice to lean into her jitters is a meaningful tightening. However, the conflict faces little genuine resistance: no real possibility of failure or costly alternative is dramatized, so tension remains relatively soft. The price paid (exhaustion, loss of the pendant, closing of her apprenticeship chapter) is present but underplayed.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stakes—Mara’s need to know what emotional truth her father left in, and Elias’s need to prove objects hold emotion—are evident early and paid off. Pressure escalates well when the hush falls and the frost reorganizes, tightening from skepticism to a moment where Mara must confront a new reality. The emotional cost of realizing her anger-story was self-protective reads clearly. What keeps this from a higher band is that there’s no real sense that the ritual could fail or backfire; the conflict never quite threatens to go sideways.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—getting a message through before the raveling silence erases everything—is legible from the outset and tightens as the silence breaches the orchard and the trees vanish. The key escalation beat is the realization that the loom “lacked the power” and that only her sacrifice can supply the needed energy, forcing her into a costly trade. Internal and external conflicts braid well, though the ethical/human calculus of giving herself up could be pushed one notch deeper to heighten tension. Still, the final act clearly arises from her agency under pressure, not convenient fate.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake (prevent planetary/orchard collapse) is clear and personal enough via the harvest frame. There’s one meaningful tightening when he chooses the forbidden mine over the temples and enters the unstable gravity zone. After that, pressure flattens: the core accepts the trade instantly, with no serious resistance, alternate costs, or threatened failure. As a result, escalation feels more like a steady glide than a true crucible, limiting impact at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—unearthing the true cause of the Icarus explosion—arrives early and stays central, with the multiverse traversal escalating pressure toward the control-room reveal. The act of “turning a rushing river with her bare hands” to redirect the narrative is a strong tightening beat that clearly raises the cost. The final cost is internal and conceptual (carrying knowledge others were spared) but felt on the page. There’s no external antagonist, so the conflict stays largely internal, yet it still reads as substantial.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—protecting Thomas’s psyche in the dangerous lull after the lamp fails—is clear and escalates as the darkness “inches closer” and Thomas admits “I can’t fix it.” The pressure is more psychological than event-driven, but the story does tighten: the dead light, the haunted room’s presence, the unstable stone stack, then Elias’s choice to intervene via the cairn and flame. The cost is subtle but present in the acknowledged ongoing threat of the night and Elias’s need to leave, trusting the small ember to suffice. Some readers may wish for a slightly sharper moment of real risk or near-loss to make the stakes feel less abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Silas steering a storm to erase old digital debris and impose symbolic authority—is legible and escalates as the wick approaches critical saturation and the storm slams the tower. Agency is strong in the physical act of steering the beam and choosing to direct devastation toward the metropolis. However, pressure feels largely one-sided: the storm is powerful but never truly threatens to thwart him, and there’s little pushback or dilemma beyond technical intensification. The human and moral cost remains offstage, so the emotional bite of the conflict is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.2)
    The primary conflict—can he distill structural color and thereby “capture the essence of charisma”—is clearly signaled and tightened by the one-shot timing constraint. The beat where the light reaches the mark and he must commit to submerging the wing is a credible escalation. However, the cost of failure (the wing crumbling) is only lightly felt, and success brings insight but little immediate price or narrowed future options. Pressure functions, but with a mostly contemplative, low-friction quality.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake (clear the quantified sorrow before it ruptures reality) is clear, and there is one solid tightening with the eye of the storm and pin-drop silence. However, the conflict escalates more conceptually than viscerally—Elias never seems in danger of failure, and the blockage yields immediately once he identifies the keystone. The repair of the hedge is almost frictionless, further flattening pressure. The piece works as a calm, procedural miracle more than a genuinely contested struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—rekindling a dead world at the risk of Elara’s mind and the orchard—is explicit and escalates well as the nascent sun grows dangerously unstable. The decision to swaddle the light, taking physical harm, then force it through the only window is a solid tightening and cost-bearing climax. External and internal conflicts interweave, but her inner resistance is underplayed, giving the conflict a mostly linear heroism. As a result, tension is strong but not truly harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elian belongs in this mistaken-invitation world and what it will cost him to answer it—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates modestly through the psychic hiding ritual and the Librarian’s initial judgment (“You are late”), culminating in the identity test of whether the “mistake” disqualifies or anoints him. The resolution is primarily internal and intellectual; there is little sense of a painful trade-off beyond relinquishing his prior self-concept. This keeps the conflict coherent but somewhat low-intensity for a top-tier literary slot.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving memory/sacredness against an eroding, gray world—registers early and is carried through gardening and the bread ritual. Conflict is mainly internal and situational (surveillance, guilt, complicity), with subtle escalation as he moves deeper into hidden, forbidden spaces. The key choice is endurance and continuation of ritual under threat, gaining a momentary absolution that has an evident cost in its fragility and smallness. Still, the pressure stays quiet throughout; there’s no sharp on-page test or reversal, which keeps tension strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—capturing and verifying the last residues of the luminous vows before they dissipate—is clear and does tighten as the needle drops and the figures flicker. There is a credible escalation from calm preparation to time-pressured measurement, and the irrevocable loss of the illusion functions as a real, if anticipated, cost. However, opposition is entirely impersonal and Elara’s competence is never in doubt, so the piece lacks a genuinely contested turn or a moment where a live option is foreclosed by her choice rather than by inevitable decay. The tension is atmospheric and procedural rather than sharply agonistic.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.5)
    The core conflict—Elara must bait Kael into betraying the truce without getting killed—reads clearly and escalates through the series of false-start feints that fray his patience. The truce’s silence heightens the pressure, and the ticking horizon (approaching sunrise) adds a mild temporal squeeze. The main turn at Kael’s final lunge is solidly earned, but the escalation pattern is somewhat mechanical: each repetition feels similar, and Elara never seems meaningfully cornered or forced to change tactics. The price she pays (relinquishing the fob, enduring acute risk) is legible but not deeply sharpened on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s quest to demystify weather-carriers and the planetary “soul”—is clearly signaled and resolved, and pressure does coherently build as the compass leads her into the convergence. The major tightening comes when she realizes the people are “ballots” and then that she herself has been elected, collapsing the distance between observer and system. However, conflict is largely situational and conceptual; there’s little active resistance or hard choice, and almost no moment where she can plausibly refuse the outcome. The cost feels more implied burden and loss of skepticism’s safety than dramatized sacrifice under agonizing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Silas will remain safely trivial or embrace dangerous, consuming authenticity—is clear and sharpened by his descent and isolation. Escalation comes through his waiting for the last echo, then the decisive act of smashing the lock and committing to the ritual of embedding it behind the drawing. The cost is mostly internal and future-facing (abandoning comfort, accepting psychic danger) rather than dramatized as immediate jeopardy, which keeps pressure from feeling truly extreme. Still, the internal conflict and its resolution are coherent and meaningfully tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering and disseminating erased truth about the water and “lost conversations”—is signaled early and sharpened by Elara’s bodily vulnerability to lies. Pressure escalates through the Governor’s broadcast and then the clerk’s lie, culminating in the revelation on the plate and Elara’s new, riskier plan. The internal and external conflicts (her physical cost vs her need to press for honesty) interweave effectively in the sub-basement scene. However, the key human obstacle (the clerk) yields relatively fast, so the confrontation feels intense but not fully wrung out.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can jolt a complacent, telepathic populace into feeling raw wonder—comes through clearly, and the risk to her is conceptual (defying consensus) rather than physical. Pressure escalates modestly as the sun rises, the ice begins to melt, and the sculpture lurches into motion; there is a sense of countdown via the limited size of the iceberg. However, no on-page resistance, failure mode, or genuine uncertainty complicates her plan; once set up, the system runs as designed. The result is textured but somewhat low-friction conflict, strong for a quiet piece but short of peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—Seven’s survival of the reversal with his identity intact—is signaled early and escalates coherently as the static worsens and the planetary event nears. The middle beat in the shed meaningfully tightens pressure: the fears nearly shatter the dome and threaten both his system and environment, forcing the high-cost choice of agonizing compression. The climax is driven by his agency: choosing to compress, then channel the energy for propulsion, which forecloses his life within the dome. There is room for one additional beat of resistance or possible failure, but for this length the escalation is well-calibrated.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clearly life-changing for the community (loss of home vs securing the land), and the outside machinery and eventually forced gate create a tangible ticking clock. Conflict escalates from generalized panic to focused problem-solving to confrontation with the foreman, with Elara’s tactic (listening and decoding) driving the key turn. However, the resolution feels a bit too smooth: Elara decodes the box without meaningful setbacks, and the foreman yields instantly on seeing the locket, with no visible price or serious challenge at the peak. The piece would benefit from one sharper moment of resistance or near-failure to deepen the cost of victory.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—successfully bypassing the defenses to free the AI without being purged—is clear and tied to her ability to maintain calm while dancing the cipher. Pressure does accumulate via the requirement to embody the password under the threat of a system designed to crush panic, but there is no palpable moment of near-failure or reversal; the sequence unfolds smoothly once begun. Internal conflict (fear vs. composure) and external risk interweave, yet the machine never actively “fights back” on the page. The climax works but could benefit from one tangible complication that forces her to adapt mid-ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—retrieving the crystalized residue of his erased memory—anchors the conflict, with the fluctuating gravity providing continuous external pressure. Escalation is clear when the act of exhuming the node triggers a chamber-wide gravity spasm, forcing a desperate, costly stabilization via the flowers/memory. The physical price (near-death, hard fall) is concrete, though relatively light, and the moral/psychic calculus (risking annihilation for a buried summer) stays somewhat implicit. Still, agency drives the major turns, and the crisis tests his commitment effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—preventing a world-scale catastrophe encoded in ambient noise—is powerfully framed, and the “if the syntax completes, disaster manifests” idea provides an implicit ticking clock. Yet on the page the conflict is largely unopposed; no resistance, misstep, or sacrifice troubles Elian’s execution. Tension is more conceptual than dramatic, leaving escalation underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central conflict—whether Silas will collude in sustaining the building’s lie—is clearly posed and meaningfully tightens once Elara reframes the language as prescriptive belief rather than translation. The interrogation scene escalates from suspicion to a stark moral/pragmatic choice, and the stakes (roof over their heads vs. corrosive truth) are legible. However, the price of refusal is discussed rather than dramatized, keeping the tension primarily intellectual rather than visceral. Still, the final choice forecloses a path and feels earned within this length.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central conflict—whether Elara will cling to her active, seductive grief or amputate it—is clearly articulated and escalates as she moves from contemplation to initiating and enduring the violent archiving. The dominant tightening beat is the crystallization of her brother and the screaming compression, where the abstract stake becomes viscerally costly. Agency is central: she chooses not to look away, to hold the scorching shell, to finish the ritual. Escalation is essentially one clean ramp rather than a series of tested reversals, so tension is strong but not maximally intricate.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—altering a magically warded writ whose discovery means death—is clearly signaled and inherently strong. Pressure builds somewhat as he slows his heartbeat, counteracts the seal, and manipulates a single letter, tying internal resolve to external risk. However, after the setup, the operation progresses without serious setbacks, reversals, or forced improvisations; competence dominates over struggle. The resulting conflict feels tense but relatively linear, with limited escalation beyond the initial premise.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—uncovering and extracting the Archivist’s trapped voice before the Council’s wards detect her—is clear and escalates through progressively clearer echoes. The iterative singing, adjustment of pitch, and increasing shell heat provide a satisfying sense of deepening pressure. However, the risk of being caught stays mostly conceptual; no concrete near-miss or loss forces her to adapt tactics beyond tonal tuning. The price she pays is primarily the burden of knowledge, which is thematically potent but lightly sketched in terms of jeopardy or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—uncovering and honoring the boy’s true final act to release his spirit—is clear, and the risk of “shattering the remnant entirely” introduces a real, if mostly conceptual, danger. Conflict here is primarily investigative and ethical, not adversarial, and escalation manifests as pattern recognition rather than reversal. Because resistance is largely offstage (the spirit’s elusiveness) and Elara never seriously faces failure or a wrenching trade-off, tension remains muted. The resolution feels earned within its quiet register but does not fully test her commitment or impose a visible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake is essentially whether Elian can momentarily touch or reveal the world’s hidden order, which is conceptually strong but dramatically under-pressured. His plan unfolds without real risk, resistance, or possibility of meaningful failure; the whistle works on the first try, with no adverse repercussion or trade-off. The “game” of following moon paths nods toward danger but never feels truly constraining or costly. As a result, escalation is more tonal and aesthetic than conflict-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.2)
    The core stakes—loss of the only safe haven in the sector versus the integrity of truth—are clear and escalate plausibly as the machine destabilizes. The pressure beat where he must intuit the correct modulation without schematics is a genuine tightening and drives the physical climax. However, the ethical conflict about exposing the myth is mostly asserted rather than sharply contested on the page; we don’t see him seriously consider preserving the lie. As a result, the external conflict escalates nicely, but the internal/moral stakes feel underdeveloped for maximum impact.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.9)
    The central stake—Silas’s control of the movement via his curated signals—emerges early and escalates as variant allegiance turns the transmissions and Kael against his blueprint. We get a clear tightening: his satisfaction at burgeoning rebellion gives way to anomalous feedback, loss of obedience from the signal, and finally to total severance. Internal and external conflicts interweave decently, but the key confrontation is somewhat one-sided; the system and prophet shift off-page, leaving Silas mostly reacting rather than making a sharply delineated moral or tactical trade-off. The resulting cost is clear and non-trivial, just shy of the most viscerally pressurized execution.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—redeeming the ruined song to bridge past and present—is clear and present early. There is some escalation via the ticking dawn window and uncertainty whether the box will screech again or sing, culminating when the gears “hesitated, and then turned.” Still, external resistance is minimal and there’s no real cost for failure beyond abstract disappointment; the process goes largely as planned. As a result, tension is more anticipatory and lyrical than truly pressured, keeping the conflict band below strong-story levels.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—using the resonance chamber to protect the artifact and quiet the dead—is clear early and tightens as the sun sets and the spirits’ screams intensify. The key’s refusal under psychic pressure is a solid escalation that forces Elias to abandon standard mechanical protocol and risk a more intimate, dangerous method. The risk of shattering the key and losing the artifact’s protection forever is strong, though the personal/moral dimension of cost could be deepened. The resolution is driven by Elias’s agency rather than coincidence, and tension ratchets coherently to the horn’s activation.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—cripple the empire’s supply line in a way that models patience for the rebellion—is clear, and pressure coheres around the narrowing window for alignment. The main escalation is temporal and tactical: Kael’s urging vs. Elara’s countdown to the exact gravitational/magnetic moment. Elara’s decision to wait and then throw the lever is clearly agentive and resolves the conflict on her terms. What keeps this below the very top band is the relative absence of felt risk or counterforce in the climax; the sabotage executes almost too cleanly, with minimal on-page danger or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—truthful classification versus corporate expediency and its human cost—is clear early and tightens effectively as Elias uncovers the psycho-acoustic hazard and confronts Halloway’s explicit order. The infrasound/vision beat deepens the conflict by making the death viscerally present rather than abstract. His final act of defiance and data upload forecloses the compliant path with implied career damage, integrating external risk and internal ethics. The escalation is mostly linear and could bear one more concrete consequence or reversal, but remains strong for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s need to redeem his failure toward the inmate—is established early and deepens as hope rises then crashes when the spring is declared snapped. Pressure escalates in a modest but coherent way: the “technically correct” condemnation, the apparent finality of “Then it is over,” and the reversal when resonance is revealed. The emotional cost at the end—standing “paralyzed by the grace he had withheld”—is clear, but most external agency belongs to the repairwoman. Letting Elias make at least one consequential in-scene choice under pressure would sharpen the conflict further.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—answering the yearning to ascend and ring the unreachable bell—is legible early via the “yearning algorithm” and tightens as the workshop sinks and he strips away protection for speed. The collapse of the floor into the acid is a credible escalation point that forces his preparations into a now-or-never leap, and the cost (vulnerability, abandonment, risk of dissolution) is on the page. Conflict is primarily environmental and internal rather than antagonistic, but the interplay between his drive and the lethal setting keeps the pressure coherent and rising.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the fate of the *Astraea* crew within a surveilled corporate system—is clear, and the drone scene provides a concrete moment of risk. Escalation is present but modest: once he lies successfully, resistance largely drops away and the investigation proceeds without further meaningful obstruction. The discovery itself is high-stakes conceptually, yet Silas doesn’t have to pay a visible on-page price beyond fear and horror; his goal is achieved too cleanly for the pressure implied by this world. A sharper trade-off or immediate consequence would deepen the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—saving the prisoner (and possibly averting broader war) by persuading the council—is signaled early and carried to the end. The main tightening is Kaelen’s choice to enter the lighthouse’s metaphysical archive and commit to the high-risk, high-precision act of reconstituting the anomaly. Yet opposition is soft: the council is static, the mirrors offer little resistance beyond search time, and there are no real reversals or costs when he fails to find something quickly. As a result, tension feels more conceptual than visceral, with relatively modest escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will remain in this limbo or go through with euthanasia—is signaled and resolved, with the parasol discovery serving as the key tightening beat. Internal conflict is largely philosophical rather than agonized, which makes escalation feel gentle rather than gripping. Still, his “fold in patience” snapping back into a linear timeline is a credible, consequential turn that forecloses the option of continued drifting. The price of choosing death is present but more inferred than dramatized in the closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the woman remains trapped in her heartbreak or can reframe it enough to endure the night—is clear and coherent. Pressure escalates internally: from frozen grief and isolation, to engagement in metaphor, to the concrete letting go of the letter; that final release forecloses a path (clinging to the burnt remnant) with emotional cost. However, the conflict is largely one-sided and guided by Elias, with minimal resistance or complication once he begins speaking, which keeps tension from fully tightening. The stakes fit the scale but never quite feel precarious.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserve forbidden wisdom from an ascendant Prophet’s regime—is clear and present from the outset, and the piece does move from traversal danger to moral/spiritual test to ritual completion. The tightening is credible: failure means death or loss of knowledge, and the confession scene interweaves internal and external stakes. However, solutions come relatively easily via pre-existing competence and tools; there’s little sense of a genuine near-failure or trade-off beyond the emotional exposure at the threshold. As a result, tension is strong but not fully acute.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—transmuting the town’s industrial pain into a healing masterpiece—is clear, and the pressure is framed in terms of whether the alignment succeeds. Yet there is no meaningful opposition or risk of failure: no environmental complication, internal doubt, or competing demand interrupts his hours-long vigil. As a result, escalation feels more like a gentle deepening of atmosphere than a tightening of options, which limits tension despite the beauty of the conceit.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will break the law of dead language to articulate living growth—is clear and internally coherent. Pressure escalates through his bolder experiments with fractured speech and the intensifying light refracting through the crystal. However, there’s minimal external or even internal pushback; no one arrives, nothing interrupts, and his fear of punishment never collides with an on-page threat, so options don’t narrow in a felt way. The result is a beautiful but relatively low-friction conflict that lacks a sharp turning screw or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—can Elias locate and experience the “sound of growing older” before his vision dissolves?—is clear and sharpened by his precognitive amnesia. There is a solid tightening when the vision hits and erodes, forcing him to frantically enact the driftwood-and-chalk plan before it fades, and a second tightening when he reaches the crater and must choose to stay and listen instead of chasing further futures. That said, opposition is mainly his own limitation plus time, with no meaningful reversals once his markers are laid; the journey from markers to crater feels inevitable rather than pressured. This keeps the conflict effective but relatively low in dynamism.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—capturing an unrepeatable, ephemeral phenomenon—is signaled early and tightened by the failing mechanism and the time-bounded quake. Escalation is clear as the vibrations intensify, parts threaten to fly apart, and tools slide toward the maintenance hatch while he pursues finer adjustments. The cost is mostly emotional and risk-focused (possible destruction of lenses, loss of the shot) rather than a sharp moral or relational trade-off, which keeps the conflict strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—guiding Clara to a seamless, meaningful death—is clear, and the key pressure point is Elias deciding to take the shard and transform its meaning through music. Conflict is almost entirely internal/ritualized, with no real resistance once he commits to his role, so escalation reads as deepening intensity rather than narrowing options. The piece doesn’t quite stage a moment where failure feels genuinely possible, even briefly. Tension is present but gentle, appropriate to the tone yet limiting peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering the fate of shadows at noon—is established early and followed through, with escalation marked by the machine’s awakening, the intensifying light, and the risk of the automaton tearing itself apart. Pressure is primarily situational and intellectual; there is some hinted danger (“ensuring the automaton did not tear itself apart from the strain”) but Elara’s emotional and tactical struggle with that threat is underplayed. The central tightening is her choice to risk “rewriting the sky” despite warnings, then her decision to shut the mechanism down once she has the answer, which earns an understated but legitimate cost in lost knowledge and unaltered reality. The conflict is coherent and non-static, but remains relatively low-temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stake—how Aris will define the girl’s fate for her parents, and thus whether despair or dangerous hope frames their grief—is clear and carries through. Pressure escalates via his discovery that the body is wood, the tooth as proof of substitution, and the impending arrival of the Lord and Lady that forces a decision. The internal ethical conflict (truth vs. compassionate reinterpretation, anger vs. forgiveness toward the fae) is compelling but remains mostly contemplative rather than sharply contested in action. The cost of his choice is implied rather than dramatized—there’s limited sense of what could go wrong if he misleads them.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether she can create safe, non-burning light in spite of her fire trauma—is clear but only lightly pressure-tested in scene. The primary tightening is the resurfacing of inferno memories mid-polish, which briefly threatens her ability to continue working. Once she grounds herself, the path to success is comparatively unimpeded, and the weighing and final testing beats feel more like verification than genuine risk. As a result, tension is present but gentle, and escalation never rises beyond a single, contained wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can inhabit this ruined space without being further harmed or exposed—is clear but remains mostly atmospheric. Pressure does deepen slightly when the drip pattern pulls Elias toward the “dead machine” and then toward Mara, and his choice to offer the pendant rather than demand anything is a small but meaningful stance. However, there’s no sharp escalation or real threat to her sanctuary on the page; conflict is contemplative rather than dynamically tightening. The cost of connection (risk of being seen, of hope) is more implied than actively tested.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can steal Elara’s hope without derailing the necessary tragedy—emerges clearly and tightens as he pushes against the story’s current. The beat where he physically struggles against the narrative arc to reach her is a strong escalation, and the act of extracting her hope at the moment of heartbreak is a decisive, costly turn. However, the conflict remains largely conceptual and aesthetic rather than viscerally felt, which slightly blunts tension. We understand what’s at stake conceptually, but we rarely fear failure on a gut level.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring the bond between village and land before the alignment passes—is clear and time-bound. Pressure escalates as the machine is repaired, then demands a non-mechanical input (song), and culminates in the narrow window of lunar beam plus sunrise, with the surprise intensification of golden story projections. The cost is understated but present in the vine’s sacrifice and Elian’s exhaustion. Conflict remains largely external and logistical; there’s little resistance or real risk of failure dramatized beyond the ticking celestial clock, which keeps this just below a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving the orchard’s fading heartbeat in a map—is clear but remains abstract and largely uncontested. The only real tightening is the synchronization moment, yet there is no sense it might fail or that alternatives exist; once he begins, the outcome feels assured. There’s minimal antagonistic pressure, internal or external, and no true reversal or cost-based trade-off. The result is beautiful process without much tension or escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving the world’s lost sounds before the wounded season silences them—is clear and present early. There is one meaningful tightening when the device actually begins to draw in echoes and the cavern’s spirit is visibly at risk, culminating in the decisive capture and resultant deadness. However, conflict remains mostly procedural and unopposed; no genuine alternative path or serious chance of failure is dramatized. As a result, the cost is conceptually strong but the on-page tension never quite sharpens into real suspense.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s need to stabilize a dangerous knot of regret before it consumes her—is clear and credible. There is one primary tightening when the regret threatens to trap her boundary-lessly, pushing her to seize the conduit and execute a precise, failure-sensitive ritual. However, the escalation is largely linear and internally assured; she never seriously falters or pays a visible price beyond strain, and success feels foregone once the lamp enters play. The conflict is solid and coherent but could use one more beat of jeopardy, sacrifice, or failure risk to feel fully tested.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can externalize and structure her grief within a limited window—is clearly signaled and coherently pursued. Pressure escalates primarily via the kettle’s approach to boiling and the intensifying focus on the moment of Silas’s death, culminating in the whistle breaking the spell. Agency is active: she chooses this method, imposes the time limit, and ends in a stance of continued, unsentimental living. The conflict remains mostly internal and single-note, so while the escalation is effective for a quiet piece, it doesn’t quite reach a bracing sense of unavoidable trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    The core stake—learning why the Carousel stopped—comes through early and tightens as Jaren approaches and bargains with his ghost. Internal and external conflicts interweave nicely: his need for truth versus the price of surrendering collected human echoes. However, escalation is relatively linear: once he has “enough” voices, the ghost accepts them without resistance and there’s no significant on-page doubt or alternative path that he seriously considers. The cost lands, but there’s room for one sharper beat of pressure or genuine risk in the negotiation itself.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—proving the terminal can be made to “breathe again” as a rebuttal to decline—is clear and coherent. There is one meaningful tightening when the missing crystal makes the plan impossible without improvisation using the sextant. However, the operation faces little resistance or real risk beyond brief mentions of delicacy and pressure buildup; success arrives on the first try. The lack of concrete jeopardy or trade-off keeps tension more contemplative than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elian will allow himself to truly engage with forbidden sound or remain loyal to his silent vocation—is clear from early on. Pressure coherently grows as he leaves his desk, breaks the rule about storms, and kneels to touch the crystal, with his trembling and tears signaling real risk. However, conflict remains almost entirely internal and lyrical; there is no external counter-force or on-page consequence, and the “forbidden” rule never crystallizes into a concrete threat or decision point beyond endurance. The escalation comes largely from sensory intensity and memory, not from narrowing options, which keeps this excellent but not maximal in terms of dramatic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stakes—proving murder and deciding what to do with that knowledge before dawn—are well signaled and coherently maintained. Escalation is modest but clear: raising the hull, confirming the blast direction, racing the radio’s cutoff, then testing the sundial at sunrise. The final tightening is strong (he has proof yet chooses secrecy), but the on-page sense of danger or personal risk remains relatively low-key, keeping tension more intellectual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving an endangered divinatory method—is clear, but stays mostly conceptual. Escalation exists in the thickening fog and the difficulty of finding the “seed” within the knot, yet options never feel truly narrowed or risky. His success comes without a sharp trade-off beyond discomfort and solitude. The conflict remains contemplative rather than tense, effective but not fully pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stake—whether the Countess can reframe her husband’s absence into something survivable—is clear, and the narrator’s success or failure matters. Pressure deepens through the increasingly tactile focus on the thread and her body, with the snap and subsequent reading of the page serving as the main tightening turn. The conflict is largely internal and aesthetic rather than contested, so there’s little active resistance or reversal beyond her initial void and later acceptance. The result is emotionally satisfying but not especially tense.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—can he revive organic beauty in a hostile mechanical world—is clearly signaled and escalates as he assembles, activates, then watches the egg crack. The key tightening is the shift from abstract probability (“less than one in a million”) to the concrete emergence and suffering of the bird, which forces a reckoning with the larger, unwinnable conflict against the world’s design. Agency manifests mainly in his commitment to proceed despite low odds and his final act of holding the dying bird, an earned stasis rather than a transformative decision. The external conflict (environment vs life) remains static, so escalation is more experiential than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara’s act can turn burned trauma into living music—is clear and present, and tension does rise as she waits in uncertainty. However, escalation is mostly textural; there’s little sense that any real option or path is being foreclosed beyond emotional disappointment. The eventual hum functions as a satisfying payoff, but the preceding pressure never truly tightens into a difficult trade-off or visible price. The conflict remains convincing yet relatively low-intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—unsticking the city’s memories/flow—is clear and escalates as Elara moves from detection (breadcrumbs) to diagnosis (visualizing the valve) to a timed, precise intervention. Waiting for the star’s zenith gives a genuine tightening and single strong pressure point. However, opposition remains mostly conceptual; nothing concretely pushes back besides time, and success feels virtually guaranteed once she understands the mechanism. As a result, the cost of failure is vivid, but the cost of success feels slight.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—repair the universal machine without destructive fire—is clearly signaled and resolved, with an internal cost revealed at the end. There is one meaningful tightening when he reaches and engages the “rusted axle,” turning abstract journey into concrete, high-leverage action. However, the piece lacks genuine opposition or real risk of failure; the transit through “perilous” debris never tests his resolve or forces alternative tactics on the page. As a result, conflict reads more contemplative than pressured, with stakes felt conceptually rather than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s need to discover a truthful form for collective grief—is clear and specific, and the moth-measuring task is a meaningful tightening that produces new knowledge. The ghost’s urgency and the precariousness of the ladder add a modest external pressure to the internal quest. However, tension remains more contemplative than fraught; there’s little sense that failure would have visible consequences beyond aesthetic or spiritual disappointment. The conflict never quite bites hard enough to feel fully high-stakes within its own quiet register.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—realigning communal time with moral truth without committing the “sin” of stopping the clock—is clear and present from early on. Escalation comes from the impossible constraint of acting only in the pendulum’s pause, forcing a high-risk intervention that could go wrong. The cost is more spiritual and conceptual than physical, but it is legible: he sacrifices a bit of his inscribed burden and accepts that absolution must be gradual. The one meaningful tightening is effective, though an additional hint of potential mechanical danger (injury, failure) could heighten the stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—will Silas correctly discern whether this life’s chaos was malice or clumsy hope—is clear but remains intellectual rather than visceral. Pressure deepens modestly as he confronts a particularly stubborn golden thread and the opaque, knotted tapestry, leading to the sovereign case drop as the main turn. However, there’s little sense that failure has meaningful cost for Silas or the soul beyond abstract “comprehension,” and Silas never feels pressed or conflicted about his tactics. The conflict is intriguing and thematically apt but stays relatively low-tension and undramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (whether and how Elian will engineer a painful scarcity to avert greater collapse) is clearly signaled and intellectually high-stakes. Pressure escalates mainly internally, through intensifying doubt and visualization of consequences, culminating in the trade-off between cruelty now and innovation later. There’s limited on-page reversal or new complication—no external pushback or fresh information—so the conflict stays mostly within one conceptual register. The final choice is earned, but the felt cost remains more argued than viscerally experienced.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving and disseminating forbidden stories without detection—is established early and tightened when the glow intensifies and the patrol approaches. The external pressure (drones, Silence Brigades) interlocks with Elian’s internal commitment to narrative, culminating in the decisive act of cloaking the page and accepting delayed, diffuse impact over immediate expression. There is a clear escalation from quiet transcription to imminent threat to resolved tactic. The conflict could gain even more bite from a sharper near-miss or explicit cost on the page, but it already functions at a high level for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.3)
    The central stake—Elara’s need for the illusion of permanent memory versus Silas’s commitment to impermanence—is clear and escalates smoothly as the portrait comes into being. Pressure tightens around the question of whether the image will be preserved, culminating in Silas’s choice to destroy it precisely as the rocker stops. Her scream, then acceptance, demonstrates real cost and consequence. The only ceiling here is that Silas never seems seriously tempted to deviate from his ritual, so his side of the conflict feels relatively unpressured.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether objective time/mechanics or priestly narrative will define reality—is clear from early on, and the pressure tightens as Silas moves from abstract contempt to a specific, high-precision task where “a single grain of dust could disrupt the frequency.” Escalation is more accumulative than dramatic, moving from excavation struggle to delicate assembly to the moment the escapement kicks. The personal cost is somewhat abstracted (no immediate retaliation or danger), making the “war” feel more conceptual than viscerally perilous on the page. Still, his painstaking, high-stakes labor versus the dominant religion yields credible, if quiet, tension.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether any real harmony can still be called forth—is clearly signaled and deepens toward the central experiment. Pressure escalates texturally as Elian strips away noise and interior defenses until a collective hum emerges, then breaks. However, conflict is mostly one-sided and conceptual; the students’ resistance is generalized rather than dramatized through specific challenges or refusals. As a result, the cost is felt but not tested through a hard, on-page dilemma or reversal driven by a concrete choice.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.6)
    The main conflict—can Elias coax a poisonous, trauma-saturated knowledge plant into bearing healing fruit under time pressure—is clear and escalates when the first taste proves “overwhelmed by the bitterness of the ruin.” His pruning decisions under the alignment’s peak function as a meaningful tightening, with the risk that premature fruiting would “poison the mind” of any eater. However, antagonistic pressure is largely environmental and internal, with the regime threat staying distant, so the sense of real jeopardy is more conceptual than viscerally felt. The cost registers but could be sharpened by a more immediate or resistant counterforce.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.5)
    The core conflict—restore power vs allow the city to breathe—is clear and present from Kael’s first demand. Pressure escalates through the riddle toll, Silas’s hesitation, and the reveal that the backup is ash, which forecloses the apparent solution entirely. Silas’s lie-by-omission history adds moral cost to his final stance. While the climax is mostly conversational, the irreversible loss of the hive and Kael’s defeat give the resolution weight.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s need to crack what animates a house—remains coherent and is tested through his experiment with the orris root. Escalation is quiet but present: ordinary walk → charged object → ritualized placement → metaphysical “shard of hush” → interpretive crisis after the fisherman’s line. The resolution is earned, with his new understanding foreclosing a simpler, more mechanistic view of his method. However, the conflict stays primarily conceptual and never fully sharpens into a felt dilemma or trade-off, so the pressure plateaus rather than truly bites.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—whether the elders committed murder or mercy, and what Elara will now do with that knowledge—is clear and sharpened by the revelations. Escalation is primarily internal and epistemic: each layer of light-driven discovery deepens ethical complexity and narrows her ability to cling to her original accusation. However, the concrete risks of waking vs not waking the stone sleepers are only sketched, so the cost of her impending act is more conceptual than visceral. The conflict lands as morally interesting but could tighten further with one explicit, hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—escape vs annihilation intertwined with reclaiming a lost moment—is signaled and the dice cast serves as a genuine tightening beat. The external conflict is largely conceptual (Elian vs system-logic), which is fine but results in little reactive resistance beyond the system finally breaking. His plan succeeds on the first try without meaningful setback or reconsideration, which softens the sense of struggle and price. The escalation from chalking equations to the dice’s impossible spin is effective, but a brief failure or deeper moral trade-off would sharpen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—will his ritual reach and awaken another compassionate soul, proving kindness endures—is clear and present throughout. Pressure escalates modestly but effectively: from private ritual to the charged act of inscription to the suspenseful pause before the distant answering signal. The story operates on a quiet emotional scale, so there’s no sharp reversal, but the wait and the possibility of silence constitute a real tension point. A slightly stronger sense of what failure would cost him in concrete terms could heighten the stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes—whether this community’s history survives the thaw—are signaled early and tighten effectively as fractures spread and the thaw completes. The decisive pressure point is Elian’s acceptance that the scrolls can’t be saved and his pivot to baking the alphabet into bread, which forecloses the path of material preservation. External conflict (environment vs. archives) and internal conflict (fear vs. duty) interweave well, but the felt price of relinquishing the physical library could be made more acute on the page. Tension is steady and escalates, even if it never quite hits a knife-edge moral dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stakes—averting famine and subverting fate—are clearly announced via the hunger stone and Elias’s intention, and there is a meaningful tightening when he commits and throws the switch. Yet conflict is largely notional: no opposing force interferes, the mechanism doesn’t misbehave, and Elias never has to trade anything tangible to succeed. We’re told villagers prepare to weep, but their fate never comes under on-page pressure beyond the symbolic stone. The result is a striking transformation with relatively low felt tension along the way.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—escaping a fear-entity feeding on his panic—is established early and escalates coherently as Elias moves from being hunted to hunting, culminating in the mirror confrontation. The key tightening is his choice to weaponize his own desire for death, an internal gambit that feels risky and non-obvious, with the burning clasp and Advisor’s shriek underscoring real danger. Internal and external conflicts are well braided: his emotional stance toward death is exactly what must shift to resolve the supernatural pressure. A slightly clearer sense of what further loss would follow failure here (beyond continued torment) could push the stakes even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—protecting the fragile orchard from the rogue squall—is signaled early and escalates as the storm arrives and slams into the resonance lattice. Elara’s agency clearly drives the resolution, especially in her adaptive dancing and recalibration around the trunk. However, conflict feels somewhat one-sided; the storm never meaningfully “wins” a beat or forces a visible sacrifice beyond exertion. As a result, tension crests more as a controlled crescendo than as a genuinely risky contest of wills.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s need to uncover the turtles’ true destination and her brother’s fate—appears early and coheres. Escalation is clear: from ominous autonomy and distant Watchers, to the risky decision to blow the whistle, to the massive structural crack and revelation of machine innards and predatory “maintenance protocols.” Her agency (choosing to test the resonance) directly triggers the story’s main reversal and narrows future options by awakening or engaging the system. The main limitation is that the cost is primarily conceptual rather than dramatized in bodily or immediate jeopardy, so tension peaks on revelation rather than on a trade-off she must visibly pay.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the noble lie continues to underpin the regime or Elara reclaims the truth—is announced early and pursued cleanly through confrontation. Pressure escalates from the abstract end of the armistice to Elara stepping onto the tracks, deploying historical parallels, and forcing the Censor to re-see the station, culminating in him relinquishing the case. The ethical conflict (stability via lie vs. corrosive long-term effects) is well articulated, and her choice to risk upheaval for truth is a genuine trade-off. However, the Censor’s resistance dissolves rather quickly, so the beat where he relents feels under-contested, softening the sense of hard-won victory and visible immediate loss.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Elias can preserve the city’s emotional residue as its structures fail—is clear and coherently pursued. There is one concrete tightening when he has to physically wrest the granite from the fissure before he can place the vial, giving a modest sense of struggle and potential failure. Internal pressure (his drive to memorialize) and external task (repairing a critical pillar) align but rarely clash, so we don’t see him forced into a substantive trade-off. The result is a satisfying but relatively gentle escalation curve.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—uncovering honest origins at the risk of personal safety and civic stability—is clear from early on and escalates as Elian moves from suspicion to dangerous experiment to shattering revelation. The key tightening is the moment the stamp initially fails to fit, forcing a calm, high-stakes recalibration under time and oxygen pressure. The revelation of the prison manifest deepens the conflict by making his goal more horrifying than he anticipated, and his plan to disseminate the truth crystallizes his stance. The suffocation and surveillance dangers remain somewhat abstract, so the felt cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—snaring Elara’s final dream before her soul evaporates and sending it with her—is clear early and tightens under the time constraint. Escalation is steady: the tension mounts from polishing to capture to the dangerous transformation by blood to the delicate folding and release. The cost is emotionally legible in his bleeding thumb, shaking hands, and the act of letting the crane fly away. What keeps this from higher is the absence of a concrete setback or moment where his goal seems genuinely at risk beyond the implied fragility of the process.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether he can access and perhaps siphon the energy of erased futures, and what it costs him—is clear and escalates as the perturbation deepens and the breakers near reset. Pressure tightens around the limited blackout window and his decision to “push the perturbation deeper” despite audible strain from the observatory. The reset is a genuine loss, and his final choice to force another overload crystallizes ongoing conflict rather than deflating it. Stakes remain largely internal, but are viscerally felt through his grief and willingness to endanger himself/the station.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will obtain and use the matrix chip to transform lonely static into belonging—is clearly signaled and coherently pursued. Escalation hinges on the concrete, resistant act of pulling the chip, where physical effort overlaps with the ethical/emotional cost of shutting down the Pilgrim. Conflict remains mostly internal and situational; the Pilgrim offers no active opposition, so pressure doesn’t spike as sharply as it could. Still, the key turn (sacrifice the Pilgrim for her own wholeness) is driven by her agency and has legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elian will truly face the damage he caused or retreat into comforting lies—is signaled early and tightened through his encounters with the dangerous driftwood and the intrusive false memories. The key escalation is the discovery of the watch hand and his choice to resist the sweeter false-heroic memory and instead accept the heavier truth. Internal and external pressures interweave effectively, but there is only one major tightening, and the conflict never quite forces an irreconcilable trade between two live paths beyond “face it vs. flinch.” It’s strong and coherent, but not maximally pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—safe release of the prisoner to preserve a fragile peace—is clearly signaled and sharpened by the warning that a mis-timed unlock will kill the boy. Escalation is focused in the lever’s sudden break, which creates an immediate, concrete threat and forces Silas into decisive improvisation. Internal and external conflicts align well: his fear of repeating past failure meets the literal possibility of killing another innocent under his watch. The main limiter is that once the drawer pull fits, the path to success feels relatively unimpeded, with little visible price beyond tension; the outcome is morally and physically clean.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether he can move at all without collapsing into panic and self-loathing—is clear from the outset. Pressure tightens when the fog briefly erases his shoreline anchors, spiking panic and testing his new tactic until the next pole appears. His decision to refuse the compass and the open bay in favor of the poles and shoreline constitutes a real trade-off of identity and ambition for survivable movement. The escalation remains relatively gentle and internal, but it does deepen and foreclose an option rather than simply restate.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can recover the capacity for remorse—is signaled early and escalates as the Oracle confronts him with alternate futures. The key tightening is the moment he sees the stolen future (the man in the park) and feels actual regret, forcing the trade-off of proof vs. penance. The cost of tossing the baseball is legible both practically and symbolically, foreclosing a path to easy certainty or power. Conflict remains almost entirely internal, and external pressures beyond the lake’s revelations are minimal, so the escalation is powerful but somewhat narrow in scope.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elian can make the reborn phoenix remember and accept him—drives the entire scene and is tested concretely when the bird dives under the lure of the smoke. Escalation is clear: from distant phoenix to descent to body-altering heat and physical impact, narrowing his options to endure or fail. His agency is expressed mainly as endurance and prepared ritual rather than a late tactical shift, but that endurance clearly forecloses easier, safer paths. A slightly sharper sense of what failure would mean beyond implied emotional loss could have raised the pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—can he reclaim or at least reframe the “lost time” with his daughter—is clear early and escalates as the ritual advances from preparation to damning visions. The crucial tightening is when the cards show not missing time but “the anatomy of his neglect,” transforming the quest into a confrontation with self-inflicted loss. His agency at the end (choosing feigned confusion) is a genuine, costly stance that preserves his self-image at the price of repentance. Pressure is strong but remains primarily internal and conceptual, which slightly mutes visceral tension compared to the thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—accessing a timeless sanctuary by integrating his darkness—is clearly signaled and sharpened by the earlier failed attempt at the door. Pressure escalates through the stitching sequence as grief and rage crash over him, forcing him to endure rather than flee his own capacity for violence. The cost is emotional and existential rather than externalized, which fits the piece but keeps conflict mostly internal. The external obstacle (the door) functions more as a test of inner change than as an independently escalating threat.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.2)
    External stakes (volcano eruption, endangered coast) and the tightening hush provide escalating pressure as the bugs’ light syncs with the magma. The key turn—choosing to release all the bugs—is clearly pivotal and resolves the external threat. Yet Silas rarely feels torn; the act aligns so neatly with his prior generosity that the decision carries limited visible inner conflict, softening the sense of sacrifice. The tension is thus more cosmic than personal, which is effective but prevents the conflict from fully peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—secretly rewiring the fort’s power source—is strong, and the blackout is a good pressure device. However, once the blackout occurs there is little real resistance: no near-catches, no systemic counter-pressure, and no moment where her plan might fail. Her “high-stakes game of intrigue” is mostly asserted rather than dramatized; the actual operation proceeds smoothly. Because escalation is largely conceptual rather than experiential, tension never fully tightens around a hard choice or visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—creating a pocket of friction to fulfill a promise and gain respite from his curse—is clear early and carries through. Pressure escalates as he lays out the pattern, readies the star dust, then confronts the moment of capturing the alpha eel, with visible costs (physical backlash, risk, ephemerality). However, the eel’s capture and engine activation follow his predicted vectors without an on-page hitch or meaningful doubt, so the central action feels a touch too assured. A small reversal or complication at the capture point would have sharpened the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—revealing the censored map and thereby reclaiming truth—is clear and consistently maintained. Tension builds through the ticking timer, the volatile chemicals, and the storm’s zenith, culminating in the successful revelation and emotional payoff. However, the process unfolds without meaningful complication or reversal; no step seriously threatens failure or forces him to choose between competing harms. As a result, escalation feels more like steady thickening of mood than a sharpened test of resolve or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—transforming a potentially lethal duel into a pathway to peace before the Duke arrives—is clearly signaled and coherently maintained. Escalation arises organically as Silas must decode under physical assault, culminating in his decisive commitment to the revealed vector and the nonlethal disarm of Kael. The visible price is moderate (risk of injury, expended tension rather than a sharp loss), but the narrowing of options is clear when he steps into the vector and forecloses continued fighting. The external and conceptual conflicts interweave well, though the emotional stakes could be sharpened further.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—seeding a subversive, living library under an oppressive regime—is clear, but on-page pressure is low: no guards interrupt, nothing goes wrong, and their operation proceeds smoothly. Internal and external conflicts align, yet there’s little escalation beyond the initial commitment to plant. The risk is asserted (sedition, patrols) rather than manifesting as a concrete obstacle or forced trade-off in the scene. As a result, the piece feels more like a beautifully rendered initiating ritual than a tested, escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—seizing one last moment of self-determined beauty before annihilation—is signaled early (“not waiting for a rescue ship… final, defiant performance”). Escalation operates more through tightening conditions than direct opposition: the failing station, the risky projector rig, and then the finite window in the arbor as the sun dips. Once in the arbor, external pressure softens; the piece leans on conceptual and temporal stakes rather than concrete reversals, which slightly mutes tension. Still, his decision to spend the time playing rather than seeking further escape is a credible, costly crystallization of stance.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central stake—anchoring the people’s memory before the monsoon and hallucinations erase it—is clear and present from the outset. Pressure escalates coherently: time ticking down, illusions intensifying into the silver city vision, then the hard turn when he wakes the rock and commits to planting on unforgiving granite. The cost is both external (abandoning safety of illusion, physical exposure to the storm) and internal (accepting a “starker, sadder” reality), and his choice directly resolves the conflict. The only ceiling is that the opposition remains conceptual/environmental; there is no further complication once he successfully awakens the ground.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—achieving forgiveness/connection in a world where intimacy is perilous—is clear and present from early on. Pressure deepens as he begins the ritual, channels guilt into the bonsai, and the voices of those he hurt arrive, which he must withstand without recoiling. However, escalation is mostly linear; once he commits, there’s no genuine reversal or serious threat of failure, and the “dangerous ritual” never quite bites on the page. The cost reads as intense exertion and emotional pain, but the conflict could gain from one sharper test or near-break of his resolve.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Internal pressure is sustained as the protagonist's tool for detachment (the implant) fails against the intricate reality of the decay. The dominant stake—his emotional equilibrium—is reweighted by the "pointless beauty," forcing a decisive change in stance under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are immediate and high, balancing physical survival against the need for justice. The pressure of the cold operates as a dual force—threatening her body while simultaneously revealing the enemy—which creates a layered and effective escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.8)
    Pressure is maintained through the failing orchids and the encroaching cold. The conflict is primarily external and linear (cold vs. heat), and while the internal trauma complicates the climax, it is overcome quickly without forcing a difficult trade-off or deepening the cost beyond exertion.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.3)
    The stakes are clear (sanity vs. noise), but the conflict is external and resolved without a significant trade-off or escalation. The "ghosts" provide atmospheric pressure but do not force Silas to change his tactics or sacrifice something meaningful; he simply completes the task he came to do. The lack of a "moment of doubt" or an escalating obstacle at the climax keeps the pressure functional rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the stakes (starvation) are theoretically high, the on-page pressure is minimal as the smuggling run faces no immediate hurdles or active opposition in the scene. The conflict is static and atmospheric; Elara observes a successful operation rather than navigating a crisis that forces a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is present but minimal; the ghost is a passive subject rather than an opposing force, and Silas faces no physical or spiritual danger. The "cost" of the healing is actually a relief (lightening his chest), meaning there is no difficult trade-off or sacrifice to drive the stakes. The tension remains theoretical rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.2)
    Pressure escalates through sensory intensity (the quaking bridge), but the narrative lacks a meaningful tightening of options; Elian formulates one plan and executes it without facing a reversal or a new tactical constraint. The stakes are high, but the path to victory is too straight.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are immediate and high, with a clear escalation from the wall breaching to the mob's arrival. The cost is palpable—Elias trades his own survival for the preservation of the harvest—and the tension holds through the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes are established through the client’s danger and the biological deadline ("fleeting phase of mitosis"), providing adequate pressure for a process story. However, the conflict remains external and procedural; Elara overcomes the time constraint with competence, but faces no agonizing trade-off or moment of near-failure. The escalation is atmospheric ("aurora flared brighter") rather than a tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.1)
    Tension is atmospheric rather than interpersonal or internal; the protagonist faces no active opposition or dilemma, merely executing a waiting game directed by the flowers. The stakes remain abstract until the final realization, resulting in low narrative pressure throughout the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    The external pressure (the melt undermining the station) effectively forces a binary choice: stay and sink, or leave and risk exposure. The floor tilting five degrees provides a concrete, physical escalation that forces the climax without needing manufactured villainy.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are immediate and lethal, escalating effectively with the countdown. The choice to invert the protocol rather than escape narrows the options decisively. The ending imposes a felt cost—Elias survives but must endure the "safe, enclosed dark" he also fears—fulfilling the requirement for a resonant trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.0)
    Pressure is coherent and escalates linearly with the fading star, creating a clear "last stand" dynamic. The stakes are cosmic, but the immediate cost—the race against total entropy to finish the map—is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation is primarily textural and internal; the external pressure is routine. While the thematic stakes are high (origin of the soul), the dramatic tension remains low-key, fitting the "mundane mysticism" lens but limiting visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.1)
    The stakes (Elian's job and reputation) are established, and the cost of the resolution (Mara sharing the criminal burden) is a legitimate price. However, the escalation relies heavily on the "magic" of the lens to resolve the conflict instantly, bypassing the messier work of building trust. The tension dissolves rather than snapping, resulting in a functional but soft climax.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    The conflict is clear and stakes are well-defined (necrosis/survival), with the sub-prefect providing consistent pressure. While the antagonist is somewhat static, their opposition successfully escalates the urgency of Elian's meticulous ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clear and pressure builds well through the mechanical preparation and sensory details. However, the climax’s resolution is driven by the environmental window closing (the nexus drifting) rather than an active choice by Elian to stop, which slightly dampens the agency at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes remain largely atmospheric; the risk of destroying the program is mentioned, but the "struggle" against the water's stillness is brief and easily won. The protagonist's agency is present in the choice to dip the program and kick the water, but the ghost's intervention minimizes the sense of difficulty or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes are global yet felt intensely personally; the pressure of the "swaying certainties" requiring immediate rendering drives the pace. The resolution involves genuine agency—using biological entropy to trick the system—and the cost is legible on the page as the "crushing solitude" of being the sole bearer of truth.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes are clear and the internal pressure is legible, but the escalation is largely atmospheric. The resolution comes from witnessing an external event (the radio confession) rather than the protagonist making a difficult, cost-bearing choice that forces the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the rising river provides clear external pressure, the protagonist faces little internal or external resistance in executing her escape. The magical solution removes the physical constraints established early on (arthritis), and the "cost" of leaving her post is accepted without on-page struggle, making the stakes feel theoretical rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is largely environmental and internal to the patient, leaving the protagonist in a passive role of "waiting for alignment." The resolution comes from the magic system and the celestial event working as intended, removing the tension of potential failure or necessary trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is minimal; Elian encounters no active antagonism, time pressure, or physical obstacle that forces a change in tactics. The "pressure" is purely atmospheric and historical. While the realization about the dragons recontextualizes the artifact, the lack of a "meaningful tightening" or a moment where failure is a live possibility keeps the stakes theoretical rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes are established early—Arthur’s codes are killing people—creating an effective "Situational" pressure. The escalation to the climax is logical, though the antagonist (the network) remains abstract. The final action forecloses his current path with visible finality.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.3)
    The conflict is one-sided; the entity acts as a passive obstacle that degrades under assault rather than an active antagonist pushing back. The absence of a reversal or a moment where Kellen is genuinely threatened or forced to trade something away limits the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.0)
    Conflict is minimal and largely internal, with "exhaustion" serving as a weak, stated constraint rather than an active opposition that forces adaptation. The protagonist faces no true dilemma or risk of failure; he simply waits for the dawn and performs the action, resulting in low tension despite the high cosmic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are immediate and clearly escalated; the threat of "dissolving into mist" is dramatized through the visions of alternate selves. The destruction of the tablet serves as a crucial tightening point, stripping away the protagonist's safety net and forcing a raw act of will. The pressure remains coherent from the opening hover to the final thud.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.4)
    There is a singular, coherent escalation of sensory pressure, but the protagonist remains largely passive during the peak beat, serving as a conduit rather than an agent. The cost is physical and felt, but the lack of active decision-making during the ritual limits the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are established immediately and escalate cleanly from a silent threat to kinetic destruction. The cost of the escape—the loss of her "life's work"—is visible and felt on the page, satisfying the requirement for a meaningful price. The tension is maintained through the specific mechanics of the climb while the instruments are smashed below.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    Tension escalates effectively from the mechanical preparation to the physical vulnerability of unmasking. The stakes shift organically from the intellectual need to know to a visceral, embodied emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are high and the pressure escalates coherently via the unraveling rope, creating a distinct ticking clock. The binary choice at the climax is stark and legible, though the narrative over-articulates the stakes ("He realized that to fully grasp...") rather than letting the action speak entirely for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.8)
    Pressure is primarily atmospheric ("chronic hush") rather than active; the opposition is abstract. While the burning of "precious" resin technically establishes a material cost, the lack of dramatized need for that resource reduces the felt stakes of the sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are clear for the client—the crushing weight of raw truth versus the sedated comfort of a lie. The escalation is subtle, moving from the "chaotic frequency" of panic to the silence of the procedure. While the external pressure is resolved, the protagonist (Silas) remains largely insulated from the costs, limiting the dramatic tension to the client's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are declared ("logistics of human connection terrified him") but never tested; the librarian's reaction is immediately positive, removing any genuine pressure. The scene lacks a moment of doubt or cost that forces a difficult choice, resulting in a transaction that feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central conflict—soft organic empathy vs. hard inorganic stoicism—is established but resolved with minimal friction. The group's immediate acceptance of her breach of silence diffuses the tension too quickly. A stronger pushback or hesitation from the elders would have heightened the stakes of her "bold" sympathy.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are established early and escalate logically; the pressure of the waking giant forces a clear trade-off (time for life). The "interrupted cadence" serves as a sharp, organic pinch point that heightens urgency without breaking the established rules. The cost is paid on the page, not just threatened.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.6)
    One dominant stake (resolving the daughter's fate) drives the narrative. The ritual provides a functional tightening of pressure, though the climax resolves somewhat quickly via the vision; the cost is felt in the separation between the viewer and the viewed.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are intimate but felt; the risk of exposure during the "strobe-light chaos" creates genuine tension against the "kindly" nature of the protagonist. The external pressure of the stabilizing grid (lights returning) effectively forces the timing of the climax. The cost is the tangible risk Elias assumes, trading his safety for the librarian's relief.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are existential and immediate, escalating clearly through physical deterioration. The cost is total—loss of human identity—accepted in a moment of earned stasis that resolves the conflict effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    The central conflict culminates in a transaction with a distinct, heavy cost (the water filter) that is clearly established as a lifeline. The renunciation of safety for meaning is powerful and legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are clear but intellectual; the conflict is resolved by the "unseen forces" explaining the theme to the protagonist, which saps tension. There is no moment where Elara must make a difficult trade-off; she simply receives a correction, resulting in low agency and negligible felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=3.4)
    There is virtually no conflict; the protagonist faces a problem (silence) and immediately solves it with a tool he already possesses, encountering no resistance from the environment, the mechanism, or other characters. The stakes, while emotionally high for the crowd, carry no personal risk or cost for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from navigation to physical danger (the chasm) to emotional confrontation (the jar). However, the physical obstacle is overcome quickly with the magical tool, and the final cost—breaking the vessel—is conceptual, lacking a visceral on-page price beyond the immediate decision.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes remain theoretical; the career risk is stated in interiority but never dramatized via an antagonist, time limit, or immediate threat. The central conflict is resolved through a rapid internal change of mind rather than a struggle with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are absolute (existence vs. oblivion), and the external pressure escalates clearly as the dimension fights back. However, because the protagonist actively desires the "threat" (death), the tension is mechanical rather than emotional; the cost is paid gladly, reducing the sense of loss.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.0)
    Escalation is minimal; the protagonist produces the winning solution immediately after the initial refusal. The antagonist offers no resistance to the magical object, flattening the tension and negating the need for a deepening of stakes or tactical pivoting.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.3)
    Stakes are low and purely technical; the primary pressure is the risk of a botched craft attempt, which lacks visceral consequence on the page. The conflict is static (Man vs. Craft) with no escalation in pressure or unexpected obstacles to force a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain abstract and philosophical; the protagonist faces no external opposition or risk of failure in performing the ritual. The pressure is static, lacking a meaningful tightening or a moment where the "method" is tested against a resistant reality or a personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.7)
    The stakes are high and clearly defined, with the pressure of the dissolving world forcing a decision. The conflict's resolution feels slightly rushed due to the summarized nature of the voices; the "tightening" happens through reported information rather than immediate interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are established early (eviction/privatization) and pressure comes from the ticking clock of dawn. While the external tension is maintained, the antagonist (corporate surveyors) is off-screen, and Elara faces little direct opposition, making the victory feel slightly low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    Escalation is managed well through the silent countdown and the physical toll of the cold. The stakes are clear and personal, though the external threat (drones) remains largely atmospheric rather than forcing a tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the external stakes are clear (the airship’s safety), the on-page conflict is minimal because Elias’s mastery instantly overcomes the obstacle. The "ticking clock" of the anchor lifting adds urgency, but without a moment where failure seems plausible or a sacrifice is required, the tension remains flat.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stakes are intellectual and philosophical, fitting the literary tone, with pressure provided by the "worrying tranquility" and the weight of the quest. The escalation is subtle—accumulating atmosphere rather than external obstacles—but the final decision to withhold the discovery serves as a meaningful tightening of the protagonist's stance against the "tourist" world.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.3)
    The external stakes are high (structural collapse), but the immediate conflict lacks active resistance; the miners unconsciously and instantly comply with Silas's rhythm, stripping the climax of tension. The resolution feels slightly inevitable rather than hard-won, as the antagonist (entropy) is overcome by a simple assertion of skill without a complication or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clearly established as life-or-legacy, and the pressure escalates coherently via the hypoxia and the stubborn machinery. The cost is paid in full on the page, satisfying the requirement for a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.3)
    The ticking clock of the bodies washing ashore creates effective situational pressure. The stakes are high (scapegoating), but the protagonist bypasses the central conflict via a metaphysical exit, which dilutes the tension of the impending confrontation with the wardens.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are high (terminal sickness), and the hostile plants provide initial pressure. However, the resolution is relatively frictionless; the ghost's compliance is automatic based on backstory, reducing the agency and tension of the final exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.8)
    Tension is severely undercut by the "sedative atmosphere," which explicitly creates fearlessness; this removes the felt danger of the "lethal drop," flattening the escalation. The protagonist is effectively shielded from the stakes by her own methodology, preventing a genuine test of will.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes remain abstract and the pressure is low; there is no antagonist, time constraint, or risk of failure to force a difficult trade-off. The protagonist wants to fix the dial and does so without facing a meaningful obstacle that would require a sacrifice of time, safety, or belief.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are high in the abstract (dismantling a data center), but the on-page conflict is minimal. The cleaning bots offer a potential ticking clock that is noted but not felt as immediate pressure; Elian’s actions remain calm and methodical. The story lacks a sharp tightening of options or a moment of genuine risk.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clearly established through the timeframe and the looming coup, creating immediate pressure. The conflict shifts smoothly from the external interrogation to the internal/technical challenge of the embroidery, maintaining tension through the "synchronization" beat.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes are clear but low-pressure in the present moment; Julian functions primarily as an observer of the ritual. The escalation is driven by the medium and the environment, leaving the protagonist passive until the final realization, which lacks a hard trade-off or on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.0)
    The stakes remain largely internal and symbolic. There is no external pressure or time constraint forcing Elias's hand; he operates in a vacuum of safety where the only resistance is his own trembling. The "tightening" is interpretive rather than dramatic, resulting in low tension despite the gravity of the backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake (boredom/block) faces negligible opposition; the fog is introduced as a challenge but is immediately overcome by the "paints with light" ability. There is no escalation of pressure and no felt cost to the victory; the exertion is described as pleasant, removing the possibility of sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.0)
    The external conflict with Ms. Vance provides a solid frame, though the stakes are primarily philosophical rather than visceral. The internal escalation through the dream layers successfully raises the conceptual stakes, leading to a realization that feels earned. The tension is cerebral but effectively maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the external threat (the raid) escalates appropriately, the internal conflict is negligible; the protagonist faces a binary choice (use the weapon or be caught) without a complex moral or personal trade-off. The resolution deflates the tension instantly rather than culminating in a struggle that tests the character's core values or limitations. The "cost" is material (the seed is lost) rather than personal or irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the historical stakes (war, eternal grief) are high, the on-page conflict lacks dynamic pressure; the ritual is executed as a planned procedure without significant obstacles or reversals. The protagonist moves from intent to action to resolution smoothly, with only "trembling reverence" suggesting difficulty. The absence of a moment where the outcome is in doubt or where the protagonist nearly fails lowers the dramatic tension significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.0)
    Conflict is strictly Man vs. Entropy, which results in low urgency; the antagonist is passive decay. The escalation is minimal—Elian finds a break and fixes it with physical effort ("forcing his vocal cords"), but the stakes never feel personally dangerous, and the resolution comes too easily to generate high pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes are established early, but the escalation to physical danger ("tear the room apart") feels somewhat hyperbolic compared to the emotional conflict. The resolution comes relatively easily once the "truth" mechanic is engaged, bypassing the friction of a difficult conversation.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are high and clearly defined (thirst vs. treason). The physical escalation—the chain tightening, the gears shrieking—creates tangible pressure. The conflict remains external (man vs. machine/state), with the internal conflict largely summarized rather than dramatized in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.8)
    The physical pressure of balancing the chip and reading the air is handled well, but the interpersonal tension dissipates almost instantly. The antagonist enters as a threat and converts to a knowledgeable ally without enough friction or cost to make the alliance feel fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure is coherent and stakes are high (stability of reality), though the conflict remains largely internal and intellectual. The antagonist is the environment/entropy, which works for this length, but the lack of active opposition makes the tension feel more theoretical than immediate. The escalation leads naturally to the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.3)
    Pressure is low throughout; the protagonist waits for an external event (the bloom) rather than forcing a path through agency. The cost paid—releasing the feather—is symbolic, lacking immediate visceral or tactical consequence on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are purely intellectual; while the "fading memory" creates a clock, Elara faces no personal risk or hard trade-off. The pressure is atmospheric rather than visceral, resulting in a low-tension climax.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes are low and purely external; there is no active opposition to Elias's plan, only the passive wait for physics to work. The "bad day" is resolved by a handout rather than agency, and Elias faces no risk of failure or significant cost, flattening the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.5)
    External pressure is mentioned (security drones, memory-wiping) but never manifests as an active threat in the scene; the drones remain passive observers. The internal struggle is minimized as the pain is described as "clarifying" rather than a true cost, resulting in a low-stakes progression where success feels inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes are purely internal and low-pressure, relying on a mild temporal deadline ("before everything shifts"); the resolution arrives through passive observation rather than an agency-driven escalation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is entirely internal and resolved through a static moment of thought rather than active pressure or choice. The stakes are stated ("translate pain") but the lack of resistance makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.0)
    Conflict is abstract (Man vs. Entropy) and lacks escalation; the protagonist meets the challenge with perfect preparation and faces no active opposition or unexpected setbacks. The "gray stagnation" recoils instantly upon the balloon's release, rendering the victory inevitable and unearned by struggle or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.6)
    Escalation is low-pressure; the protagonist faces no active opposition or time constraint, merely consuming information until the realization hits. The stakes are abstract (historical knowledge) and the burden is assumed without a moment of resistance or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces a procedural constraint (time) rather than active opposition or dilemma. The solution—borrowing a sleeping dog’s heartbeat—removes the potential for sacrifice, leaving the stakes theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is low-voltage; the opposition offered by Hark is token (one sneer) before immediate capitulation. There is no escalation of pressure or back-and-forth negotiation, resulting in a climax that lacks genuine stakes or the threat of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.1)
    The internal stakes are well-defined, and the external pressure of the storm effectively tightens the window for action. While the "doomed gamble" lowers the suspense regarding the egg's survival, the emotional cost of the futility is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are immediate and high (lobotomy of the soul), with clear pressure from the ongoing ritual. The tension escalates appropriately with the Magistrate's realization "between sigh and smile." The cost is legible—trading her own preservation for the city's freedom—though the mechanics of that trade are slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=3.6)
    Conflict is theoretical and lacks immediate pressure; the inciting argument is backstory, and the heckler offers no resistance during the scene. The narrative lacks a meaningful tightening or escalation of stakes, reading more like a lecture on storytelling than a struggle with an uncertain outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.4)
    The pressure is primarily atmospheric and thematic rather than active; Elias faces no opposition other than time. While the "dwindling hour" creates some urgency, the conflict remains abstract, lacking a moment where Elias must make a difficult trade-off or overcome a concrete obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no active opposition, technical failure, or internal doubt during the process. The "cost" of destroying the original is accepted before the scene begins, removing narrative tension. Escalation is procedural rather than dramatic, with no point where the outcome is genuinely in question.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    Tension escalates cleanly with the approaching storm and the decaying facility. The climax forces a distinct binary choice, though the resolution—merging with the threat—relies heavily on thematic logic rather than tactical necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.2)
    The external pressure of the invading army provides a clear ticking clock, but the protagonist faces no immediate obstacles within the observatory. The ritual succeeds on the first attempt without error or struggle, missing an opportunity for escalation through difficulty or sacrifice during the process.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict evaporates almost instantly; the warlord's only act of resistance (swatting the box) is immediately negated by the object's magical return property. There is no escalation of pressure or back-and-forth struggle; the protagonist holds all the cards, turning what should be a high-stakes confrontation into a procedural execution of a pre-determined plan.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes are high (existential erasure), but the opposition is passive (fog/physics). Silas navigates the danger with steady expertise, resulting in a lack of escalating pressure or difficult choices. The conflict is environmental rather than dramatic, leading to a smooth but low-tension execution.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stakes are established early (structural collapse, wild magic) and escalate clearly when the rift rejects the initial repair. The conflict is coherent, pitting rigid bureaucracy/magic against organic necessity, resolved by a decisive agentic choice.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are clearly defined (lineage unzipping) and the pressure escalates effectively from physical discomfort to existential dread. The climax hinges on a decisive moment of inquiry that narrows the protagonist's understanding of his reality. The cost is felt in the acceptance of the fear he must carve.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central conflict is clear, and the escalation to a linguistic negotiation offers a fresh, intellectual twist on the standard guardian confrontation. However, the stakes feel somewhat managed; the solution relies on a single insight without forcing the protagonist to make a painful trade-off or sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.6)
    Conflict is low-voltage; the protagonist faces no significant opposition or forced trade-offs, succeeding at every step with a reliable magic system. While the internal stakes are reconfigured at the end, the lack of external pressure makes the resolution feel convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the conceptual stakes are high (erasure of history), the on-page execution lacks escalation or meaningful pressure. The conflict is resolved through a single, uninterrupted mechanical process, with no moment where the protagonist's success is in doubt or options are narrowed.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are high (survival/sanity), but the conflict resolves too cleanly with a "magic bullet" artifact. The lack of a visible trade-off or a moment where the plan nearly fails limits the tension at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stakes remain largely abstract and thematic (silence vs. noise) rather than immediate or personal; there is no palpable risk of failure. The climax involves physical effort ("straining against rust") but lacks a meaningful price paid by the protagonist, leaving the victory feeling unearned by sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.5)
    Pressure accumulates effectively through the environmental measurement, fitting the situational drive lens. While the stakes are high (civilizational memory), the conflict is largely observational; the cost is an internal, emotional burden accepted by the protagonist rather than an active external trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are established (hope vs. despair), but the pressure is low because Elian is hyper-competent and faces no active opposition. The environmental hurdle (humidity) is solved instantly by instinct, leaving the climax to feel like a spectacle rather than a hard-won triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the stakes of legacy and loneliness are established, the conflict is resolved with minimal resistance. Elara accepts the loss as a "necessary molting" almost immediately, bypassing the opportunity for a harder-won decision; the lack of interpersonal friction or internal doubt lowers the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=5.4)
    Conflict is strictly environmental and low-stakes; the trellis "cradles" her and the atmosphere acts as a "gracious host," removing genuine danger. Elara endures somatic pressure but faces no distinct dilemma or antagonist that forces a difficult choice; she simply executes a known ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=4.7)
    The stakes (structural collapse) are high in theory but low in practice because the solution is immediate and cost-free. Elian faces no trade-offs; he simply uses the correct item for the job. The lack of a "felt cost" or sacrifice deflates the tension immediately upon the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is purely external and mechanical (a ticking clock), solved by possessing the right tool rather than ingenuity or sacrifice. The lack of a difficult trade-off or significant cost renders the victory inevitable and low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.0)
    The conflict is internal (holding on vs. letting go), but the external pressure is gentle and therapeutic rather than urgent. The opposition provided by the "weight" is easily overcome once the shadow keeper explains the perspective shift, lacking a sharper, more visceral obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure escalates coherently through the accelerating text messages and the physical weight of the promise. The central conflict is resolved through active agency, with the protagonist's endurance and ingenuity driving the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes are clearly established and high, with coherent pressure escalating through the physical toll of the cranking. While the conflict is primarily Man vs. Machine/Physics, limiting relational complexity, the visceral cost (&quot;lactic fire&quot;) effectively grounds the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure escalates coherently as the ritual distorts the environment, raising the physical stakes. However, the opposition is largely atmospheric; the internal struggle between past vows and future potential is resolved too easily to generate peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    The conflict is primarily internal—bureaucratic neglect versus the archivist's need for meaning—and escalates clearly through the discovery of the button. The stakes are raised by the specific trade-off Elias makes: sacrificing scientific certainty for a "tactfully hopeful" hypothesis, presenting a visible moral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the stakes are high (truth vs. erasure), the protagonist overcomes obstacles with relatively low-cost maneuvers (hiding, using the puddle map). The climax lacks felt sacrifice; physical discomfort ("shivering") does not equate to the thematic weight of overturning a tyranny.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are high (universal heat death), and the conflict is focused, but the escalation is somewhat brief. The antagonist (the machine) resists with increased intensity, but Elias's counter-move is singular and linear; he applies the technique and succeeds without a reversal or a moment where failure seems imminent. The cost is physical and metaphysical exhaustion, which is legible but standard.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is virtually no conflict or opposition. The environment cooperates perfectly (the wind dies on cue), the materials are available, and the magic works instantaneously. Without an obstacle or a moment where the outcome is in doubt, the story lacks pressure and escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.5)
    The destruction of the bridge kit is a meaningful escalation that forces a tactical shift with a tangible cost (stranded). The physical stakes are high, though the "no clear way back" creates a satisfyingly high-cost resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.2)
    There is virtually no active conflict; the laws of physics and the materials yield to Elara's will without opposition. The stakes remain abstract and theoretical, with no moment of doubt or risk to the protagonist's goal.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.5)
    Tension is deflated early because the protagonist is unaffected by the antagonist's primary weapon (the roar); Elian "did not flinch" and simply proceeded. There is no escalation of stakes or narrowing of options; the protagonist arrives with the solution in his pocket and uses it without having to adapt or sacrifice anything.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.5)
    Internal and environmental pressures escalate clearly, driven by Kaelen's choice to enter the "brightest sector" and remove his protection. The stakes are felt on the page through somatic cost, though the adversary remains largely environmental and internal.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pressure is low; obstacles like the "slipping" anchors are overcome by "instinct" rather than difficult tactical choices. The antagonist is abstract entropy, and Elian’s victory feels inevitable rather than earned against significant resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure is coherent and escalates atmospherically through the "weightless burden," but the conflict is resolved somewhat easily by Elias's expertise without forcing a tactical pivot or deeper sacrifice. The obstacle (the mainspring) is identified and removed with surgical precision, missing an opportunity for a "dark night of the soul" moment where the protagonist's capacity is truly tested.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake (reality vs. eternity) is clear, and the ending delivers a permanent consequence. However, the escalation is procedural rather than conflict-driven; Silas encounters no active opposition or reversal that tests his commitment. The lack of a "new complication" or an antagonist force means the pressure remains static until the final release.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ideological stakes (tyranny vs. liberty) are clear, and the approaching storm provides necessary external pressure to force the protagonist's hand. While the antagonist's opposition is largely verbal, the storm effectively escalates the situation to a point of no return.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.1)
    The stakes are high (saving the city's lung), but the escalation lacks a "felt cost" or genuine back-and-forth pressure. The antagonist (the Rust) is defeated instantly by the protagonist's affirmation, lacking the grinding, difficult trade-offs required for higher bands. The victory feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=4.0)
    Tension is negligible because every tool and action works perfectly on the first attempt; the compass guides him immediately, and the vial opens the walls "instantaneously." The "treacherous" descent is summarized rather than dramatized, depriving the narrative of the escalation or resistance needed to earn the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.3)
    External stakes are high (a ship on the rocks), but the internal cost is negligible; Elara faces wind resistance but no difficult trade-offs or moral dilemmas. The conflict is resolved through technical proficiency and a "magic bullet" object, lacking deep narrative tension or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.3)
    The stakes are internal and aesthetic—vanity vs. truth—which works for a lyric piece but lacks urgent pressure. The conflict is largely contemplative; there is no active obstacle preventing her success other than her own ignorance, which she solves with a somewhat convenient invention. The cost (abandoning her old style) is stated but not deeply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.1)
    While the external stakes (toppling a regime) are high, the immediate scene lacks a felt cost or sacrifice for the protagonist. The conflict is essentially a communication puzzle; the solution (arranging debris) requires no renunciation or risk from Elara. The "trade" is a win-win scenario, which deflates the tension of the negotiation beat.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are existential yet intimate, pitting the "tranquil oblivion" against the "gritty struggle of true existence." Escalation is internal but successfully dramatized through the increasing biological strain on Elara’s working memory and the visual transformation of the bottle. The cost is palpable, and the choice to include human flaws ensures the resolution is earned rather than convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.1)
    Pressure escalates cleanly from the physical risk of destroying the artifact to the existential weight of the prophecy. The climax shifts the stake from preserving the past to confronting the end of the future, deepening the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.3)
    The central conflict is resolved through a single sustained beat of willpower without a meaningful reversal or escalating tactical shift. While the stakes are high, the protagonist’s victory is linear, missing a moment of adaptation or distinct on-page cost during the exertion.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.2)
    The pressure of "zero hour" creates effective situational escalation. However, the stakes are dampened by the protagonist's easy exit strategy (lying to superiors); because the cost is evaded rather than paid on the page, the climax feels lower-risk than the buildup suggests.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.5)
    External pressure is nonexistent, and internal conflict is stated rather than felt; the meteor’s arrival is a scheduled joy rather than a test. The narrative lacks a tightening of options or a moment where the protagonist must trade one value for another, resulting in a static emotional trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes (silence vs. confession) are clear and thematic. The conflict with the young woman provides necessary pressure to test Elias's resolve. While the resolution comes somewhat easily—Elias dominates the encounter—the internal tension of maintaining the "visual poem" sustains the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are established early ("existence was precarious"), but the external conflict is minimal; Elara descends and retrieves the object with little resistance. The pressure is primarily atmospheric and internal. The resolution brings a meaningful shift in perspective, but the lack of an active antagonist or harder obstacle limits the feeling of earned triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes remain largely aesthetic and abstract; while the "panic" of the silence is mentioned, Elian's calm mastery minimizes any felt risk of failure. The cost is conceptual rather than personal to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.0)
    The conflict is high-concept (geology vs. biology) but low-stakes in execution, as Silas solves it with a single correct action that works without complication. The antagonist (the crushing stone) yields during the summary passage, preventing any escalation of pressure or desperate tactical shifting on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—intellectual autonomy versus biological manipulation—is clearly signaled and escalates through the climb. While the external pressure is low until the summit, the internal struggle against the "artificial pilgrimage" provides sufficient tension. The final act of throwing the amber represents a meaningful tightening of stance with a felt cost, foreclosing the path of nostalgia.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story lacks active opposition or escalation; the "war" is a static backstory and the environment accepts the offering immediately ("The concord was accepted"). Without a moment of doubt, a necessary sacrifice, or a force resisting the protagonist's agency, the stakes remain theoretical rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are clearly defined as isolation versus connection, but the conflict remains largely procedural and internal. The external pressure is static (the silence), and the protagonist overcomes the "impossible task" smoothly via the convenient leaf tool. A sharper sense of risk or a failed attempt before the success would have elevated the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.5)
    The internal stakes (sanity vs. chaos) are well-defined and pressure rises through the failed sketching attempts. The external pressure is static; the environment threatens but does not escalate its attack, leaving the tension largely cerebral.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.5)
    The stakes are high in concept (reality vs. stasis) but low in dramatic execution, as Elian faces no active antagonist or significant personal cost. The wind is a passive environmental hazard that he easily withstands, and the "cost" of losing safety is philosophical rather than a felt sacrifice on the page. Success feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    The pressure is distinct and accumulates naturally: the passive recording becomes untenable as the "dissonant hum" threatens the archive's clarity. Elias's choice to intervene is a clear moment of agency that forecloses the option of passive observation to save the record. The stakes—preserving the specific dignity of the lost—are felt.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.2)
    The "hidden thunder" provides effective atmospheric pressure that escalates the threat of avalanche, forcing the protagonist to act. The final choice to "seed" the mountain carries a legible conceptual cost—risking destruction to create stability—though the risk is mitigated by the immediate positive result.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.1)
    The pressure escalates adequately through the encroaching thunder, creating a ticking clock. However, the resolution comes too easily; the resistance of the threads is overcome with a moment of "cold focus" rather than a costly trade-off or tactical adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the stakes (exile, cultural shift) are high, the on-page opposition is passive; the Elders merely "covered their ears" and offered no tactical resistance to Kaelen's disruption. The conflict resolves too easily through Kaelen's monologue, lacking a back-and-forth struggle that would heighten the dramatic tension. The cost is stated ("punishable by exile") but accepted without a dramatized moment of weighing the price.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.5)
    Tension escalates viscerally through the physical constraint of holding breath while the environment dissolves. The stakes are ultimate (erasure vs. preservation), and the protagonist pays the full price on the page, satisfying the requirement for felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.1)
    The stakes are purely internal and relatively low-pressure; the environment threatens but never actually forces a trade-off or alters Elias's plan. The ritual proceeds without interruption or near-failure, making the climax feel like a foregone conclusion. A "meaningful tightening" is absent, as the environment accommodates his needs rather than contesting them.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.0)
    Opposition is minimal; the antagonist is asleep, and the magical solution works instantly on the first attempt. There is no moment of doubt or escalation where the protagonist's plan is tested and nearly fails.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.7)
    Pressure is coherent, driven by the "swollen" moon and the rising heat of the transmission, but the conflict remains external and is met with immediate, unwavering competence. There is no escalation of risk or meaningful tactical pivot; Elara simply endures the established cost. The stakes are clear but the lack of a "moment of doubt" or intensified opposition limits the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.4)
    The stakes are high (sanity), but the escalation within the scene is dampened by the lack of obstacles during the climax. The text explicitly states "the resistance did not come," removing immediate tension from the critical moment of the ritual. While the conceptual cost (relying on bad science) is noted, the lack of on-page struggle during the execution softens the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes are primarily internal and thematic, fitting the accumulative lens. The pressure comes from the fading time (entropy) and the complexity of the memory. While the external conflict is low, the internal pivot—choosing to honor the invisible rather than the visible—provides a meaningful deepening of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation is handled well, with the rising water creating a tangible ticking clock that forces the protagonist's hand. The stakes transition naturally from physical survival to emotional confrontation, though the resolution of the immediate physical threat (finding the fissure) feels slightly easier than the buildup suggested.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are high and legible—survival against cosmic annihilation. The tension escalates well during the climb. The resolution, however, arrives via the "tension breaking" and the insects appearing, which dissipates the pressure somewhat externally rather than through a final, costly decision from Isolde.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from a technical challenge (stabilizing the vortex) to an emotional crisis (preserving the bond before departure). The pressure is coherent, and the final choice—to give away the creation—demonstrates agency and sacrifice. The external pressure of the fading sun braids well with the internal pressure of the secret.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=4.8)
    The stakes are existential but remain abstract ("distill chaos into narrative"), lacking immediate on-page pressure. The conflict is entirely internal and managed through exposition; the grave marker is a backstory detail rather than an active, escalating threat in the scene. There is no moment where the protagonist is forced to choose between two difficult options.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are intimate but clear: the immediate frustration of the repair against the deeper need for validation. The tension escalates appropriately through Kael's skepticism, though the resolution comes somewhat easily once the object is introduced.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are physically immediate (permanent paralysis), and the escalation of the crystal locking the wrist effectively narrows options. The resolution is earned by a specific action, though the "fresh, flexible skin" outcome feels like a slightly low-cost reset compared to the "visceral" tearing described.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clear and personal, escalating through the sensory intensity of the ritual. The resolution offers a meaningful trade-off: the connection is made, but the emotional catharsis is denied ("he didn't smile"), fulfilling the "imperfect" premise with integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.1)
    The stakes are declared to be universal ("fabric of existence tearing"), but the on-page conflict is resolved with relatively low effort. The Spiral Arbitration presents a philosophical threat, yet it is defeated by a simple lookup in a dictionary, bypassing any genuine test of Elara’s resolve or ingenuity. The escalation lacks a moment where the protagonist must sacrifice something of value to succeed.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.1)
    Pressure escalates coherently from atmospheric unease to physical danger ("caught in its teeth"). The stakes shift organically from intellectual curiosity to immediate survival, and the cost of the encounter is felt in the permanent alteration of Kaelen's perception.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake (control vs. connection) is present, but the conflict remains largely internal and static until the final button press. The "opposition"—the facility's security—is dismantled with a single gesture, removing the struggle required to give the release impact. The tension is described as a "wildfire" but operates as a mood rather than a pressure that forces difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.0)
    External pressure is virtually nonexistent; the equations work, the lantern reveals the truth, and the book stabilizes without complication. The internal conflict regarding mortality is resolved too easily ("The fear she expected did not come"), lacking a felt price or difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.1)
    Pressure is coherent and escalates clearly through the rising pitch and voltage spike; the "loop" creates a tangible danger that forces a stance crystallization (dissonance over harmony), though the stakes remain largely external to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.0)
    The story lacks active opposition or escalation; the ritual proceeds exactly as intended without failure, external threat, or unexpected cost. While the emotional stakes are high, the narrative pressure is low because the universe cooperates fully with Elara's desires.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (loneliness) is clear, but the external conflict is minimal; the transaction is accepted immediately with no obstacle or hesitation from the visitor. The cost—discarding the rock—is symbolic but lacks visceral weight since the rock’s value was established only as a stolen trinket.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes are established through the timeframe and physical pain, but the conflict is strictly external/environmental. The protagonist endures the noise but does not face a dilemma where she must sacrifice one value for another; the escalation is linear volume increase rather than a deepening of moral or tactical complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.2)
    Pressure is negligible; Elian is explicitly "safe from the linear consequences" and encounters no opposition from the tool or the timeline. The stakes are theoretically massive (war vs. peace) but emotionally distant, handled with the ease of editing a text file. Without a moment where failure seems possible or a price is paid, the escalation is flat.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes remain theoretical; the "oppressive quiet" acts as a passive backdrop rather than active opposition. The climax is driven by the advisor's increased speed rather than a protagonist's difficult choice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are clearly internalized, but the external pressure is low; Elara solves the puzzle with minimal resistance or risk. While the emotional cost is felt, the lack of a counter-force or complicating factor makes the escalation feel somewhat flat until the final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are established early and escalate clearly, moving from a "low hum" to "screaming warnings" as Kael pushes against the machine’s limits. The conflict is focused and tight, culminating in a decisive moment of renunciation where the protagonist accepts a permanent, severe cost to achieve his goal.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear, but the tension is mitigated by Elias's total control over the situation; he never seems largely at risk of failing. The conflict is less a struggle and more a trap springing shut, which dampens the sense of escalation usually required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.0)
    There is a distinct lack of narrative pressure or opposition; Elias faces no obstacle in performing his task, and the woman offers no resistance to the healing. The stakes are internal but abstract, resolved instantly by the light show without escalation or hard choices. The scene lacks a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.3)
    The conflict between efficiency and hesitation is thematically sound, but the antagonist (the Authority) remains abstract and distant. The lack of immediate, physical pressure on the grotto lowers the visceral tension of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear—survival via transformation versus drowning in nostalgia. The escalation is linear, though the "pacified" violence lowers the immediate physical threat, shifting the weight entirely to the metaphorical, which is handled well.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.0)
    The stakes are high and clearly defined: the safety of compliance versus the danger of grief. The escalation is sharp and earned, transitioning from the safe target of the pine wood to the high-stakes destruction of the "Artifact of Yesterday," forcing a visible trade-off between memory and survival.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.4)
    Conflict is internal and man-vs-nature, but the stakes feel theoretical because the external threat (Synod) is gone and the internal threat (danger of the art) is managed perfectly by Elara's skill. The escalation is sensory rather than tactical; she faces no setbacks or genuine dilemmas that force a sacrifice, resulting in a smooth but low-tension progression.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.2)
    The conflict is a focused negotiation with clear stakes and a distinct escalation from the symbolic plant offer to the utilitarian sacrifice of the reed. The cost—losing a "relic of immense power"—is legible and paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the emotional stakes are legible, the obstacle is overcome with minimal resistance or cost; the transition from failure to success is linear and immediate. The "breaking of rules" is stated as a consequence but does not carry a felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are clear but lack escalation; the protagonist’s success feels guaranteed from the start, and the client offers no resistance to the process, resulting in a low-pressure procedural. The story misses an opportunity to test Elias's skill or the woman's readiness, causing the conflict to remain largely abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from a client's financial anxiety to a revelation of global manipulation. The conceptual cost—the burden of witnessing a crime scene—is felt in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes are clear and high; the threat of "comas of sentimentality" creates immediate physical pressure that escalates the need for the dance. The cost of the journey—the loss of innocence—is legible, though the final "incinerated forever" declaration tells the cost more than it dramatizes the specific pain of the loss.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clear and high (the preservation of the soul’s depth), with the conflict escalating naturally from observation to intervention. The cost is specific and felt—the woman’s permanent loss of wholeness—providing a solid anchor for the philosophical conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes are clear but low-pressure; the surgery proceeds linearly without significant complication or reversal. The conflict resolves through a single successful action rather than a difficult trade-off or escalation of cost. The external stakes (the tail) serve the internal stakes well, but the lack of resistance makes the victory feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    Escalation is effective and visceral; Elias actively trades his physical integrity (opening his own wounds) to progress against the resistance of the tower foundation. The stakes are clear and the cost is paid on the page, though the opposition remains largely passive until the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation relies on atmospheric density (thunder, heat) rather than interpersonal or antagonistic pressure. While the cost is paid (destruction of the film artifact), it reads as a procedural transaction rather than a painful, high-stakes trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.0)
    The stakes are high but remain abstract ("gray and pragmatic" world vs. "shatter his skull"). While pressure escalates through the meteor storm, the resolution (success through inaction) deflates the tension without extracting a tangible price; the threat simply evaporates once he stops trying.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes are high in the abstract (universal entropy) but low in immediate dramatic tension, as the ritual proceeds without error or external interference. The pressure escalates through physical intensity (quantum dispersion), but without a moment where failure seems plausible or tactics must change, the conflict remains procedural.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.2)
    There is a distinct lack of escalating pressure; Elian navigates the forest and repairs the turbine without facing significant opposition or failure. The stakes remain abstract, and because success requires no sacrifice or narrowing of options, the climax feels inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.0)
    Pressure is low; the guide ensures safety and success, removing the risk of failure. The central conflict is resolved through explanation—Elara tells the man what he left behind—rather than a high-stakes decision where he must overcome a genuine resistance to seeing the truth.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stakes—spiritual erasure versus physical safety—are established early and escalated by the physical toll of the ascent. The climax forces a clear trade-off: Elian accepts the pain of "burning fingers" (memory/music) over the numbness of safety. The resolution is an active stance, not a passive observation.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.3)
    Tension is low because the outcome feels inevitable; the protagonist faces no significant obstacles or counter-moves after setting the trap. The execution is seamless, lacking a "tightening" beat where the plan risks failure. The cost is environmental (the library's destruction) rather than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are primarily intellectual and memory-based, escalating through the assembly of data rather than external opposition. While the pressure to solve the mystery is clear, the escalation is linear. The final turn provides a meaningful conceptual deepening, though the cost remains largely abstract (the loss of human history to nature) rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is negligible; the protagonist faces no active antagonist or dilemma. The "teeth-rattling" vibration is a somatic detail rather than a narrative obstacle, and the soldiers watching are passive furniture, resulting in zero escalation of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are high (arrest vs. planetary rebirth) and the pressure escalates functionally through the ticking clock of the approaching patrols. The cost is paid in the final image (Elara’s capture), though the "triumph" framing somewhat muffles the sense of personal loss.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    The stakes are intensely personal and psychological, with the threat of "dissolving into smoke" feeling visceral and high-cost. The escalation from the sound trigger to the near-collapse is handled well. The resolution—choosing the "pearl of stillness" over the urge to dive—is a clear exercise of agency with felt effort.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    The literal pressure of the closing walls creates a coherent, high-stakes ticking clock that forces a decisive action. The transition from physical survival to philosophical resignation is earned through the escalating claustrophobia, ensuring the final choice feels necessary rather than convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are clear and physical pressure is maintained throughout. The antagonist's escape provides a solid reversal, forcing Silas to accept a partial failure and pivot his goal. The cost—physical pain from the light and the loss of the prize—is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clearly established and escalate appropriately from internal moral dilemma to external physical threat. The climax forces a distinct trade-off between safety and truth, though the antagonist's arrival is a slightly convenient trigger.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes feel theoretical rather than felt because the opposition folds immediately; the intruder offers no sustained pressure. The conflict is resolved by a magical de-escalation that bypasses the need for a costly trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clear (survival and the prize), and pressure escalates effectively via the descending constellations and the garden's "feral lullaby." While the external threat is palpable, the cost paid is primarily stamina and a lingering mental "clawing" rather than a deeper sacrifice of resources or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=4.7)
    Stakes are declared but never truly tested; the antagonist presents no active resistance during the confrontation, resulting in a victory without sacrifice or trade-off. The absence of a "tightening" moment where Eleanor must pay a price to succeed makes the conflict feel frictionless and the outcome inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake of redeeming past guilt is clear, and the pressure escalates logically to the risk of shattering the fossil. While the climax relies on a competency check (using the stylus) rather than a difficult moral trade-off, the emotional cost is palpable and the internal conflict is resolved with weight.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    Pressure escalates via the vibrating tile and rising volume, creating a clear demand for action. However, the stakes remain largely abstract and external; Elian faces discomfort rather than true danger or hard trade-offs. The resolution comes relatively easily once the decision is made.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are clearly established and escalate from passive observation to active, costly rebellion. The pressure of the "global network" forces a specific, high-stakes trade-off (energy/life for deception), ensuring the climax feels earned and consequential with a visible physical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are theoretically high (bankruptcy), but the on-page conflict lacks tension because the protagonist encounters no genuine opposition or limitation to his powers. The "encroaching future" serves as atmospheric texture rather than a forceful antagonist, resulting in a climax that feels inevitable and cost-free rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are intimate yet high, centered on Mara's sanity. The escalation is subtle but clear: verbal instruction fails ("I don't know how to move"), forcing Elias to switch to the "somatic markers" method, creating a shared physical cost/effort.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.0)
    Pressure is coherent but relatively mild. The antagonist is the abstract "void" or "data overload," and the protagonist overcomes it with a prepared tool (the stone) without a moment of doubt or near-failure. The stakes feel intellectual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.4)
    The conflict is primarily abstract (Man vs. Static) and the protagonist overcomes it with "dancer's grace," meeting no effective opposition. There is no visible or felt cost on the page; Elias succeeds without sacrifice or difficult trade-offs, reducing the stakes to a procedural task.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are clearly high (life/death), but the central conflict plays out as a transactional exchange rather than a struggle. The helicopter arrives, an accusation is made, and the proof is handed over immediately; the lack of a complication or deeper cost in the moment flattens the suspense.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=3.8)
    Tension is negligible because the protagonist’s competence is absolute and the obstacle (the woman’s emotional weight) offers no active resistance or counter-move. The resolution is immediate and mechanical, lacking a moment of doubt, escalation, or risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are purely thematic and lack urgency; there is no penalty for failure and no antagonist or ticking clock to force a trade-off. The escalation is atmospheric (a rising thrum) rather than a tightening of agency or consequence, leaving the protagonist in a safe, observational role.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.7)
    The stake (lighting the room) is established early, and the mechanical obstacle provides focus. While the tension is well-managed, the cost is relatively low (careful effort), lacking a deeper personal trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain internal and theoretical; the escalation is low-resistance as the protagonist simply walks to a location that fixes her state. There is no visible or felt cost paid for the transformation; she gains resolve without sacrificing anything or facing a genuine trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=4.0)
    There is virtually no conflict or opposition; Elara observes a gap and fills it without hesitation, risk, or external resistance. The stakes are purely conceptual ("narrative that had stalled"), and the lack of a "no" or a cost to her action leaves the story without dramatic tension. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the stakes are high (massacre, madness), the conflict lacks active opposition; the celestial entities are described as "arrogant" and do not counter-move, reducing the climax to a one-sided technical procedure. The escalation is purely atmospheric (louder screams) rather than tactical, and the protagonist wins without having to trade anything of value or adapt his plan under fire.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are immediate and high, creating a coherent pressure cooker where the protagonist’s phobia amplifies the physical threat. The climax forces a clear binary choice—run and die, or play and risk—demonstrating strong agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central conflict—abstraction vs. recognition, indifference vs. empathy—is clear and escalated well through the artistic process. The stakes are raised by the physical violence of the "lance" action, though the external opposition (Miller) crumbles a bit too easily to maximize tension.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.5)
    Escalation is minimal; the machine obeys commands without resistance or complication. There is no moment where success is in doubt or where the protagonist must pay a price to proceed, deflating tension.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are internal (guilt/haunting) and escalated through the environment, but the resolution comes too easily—Silas simply plays along with the glitch. There is little pushback or potential for failure; the "amnesty" is granted immediately upon recognition, resulting in low felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.5)
    The antagonists offer negligible resistance, retreating immediately upon encountering the territorial markers without a counter-move or dialogue. This lack of genuine opposition lowers the stakes, turning a potential high-pressure negotiation into a simple procedural victory for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes are declared ("map of trauma") but the conflict lacks escalation; the obstacle (the crushed figure) dissolves immediately upon the protagonist's first action. There is no moment of doubt, risk, or trade-off to heighten the tension, as Elara faces no genuine opposition that challenges her capabilities.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are established early (truth vs. treason), but the on-page tension is dampened by the protagonist's easy mastery of the environment. The conflict remains external and environmental; Kaelen solves the problem with a specific item without facing a dilemma that narrows his options or demands a sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are declared ("madness of the accelerated world") but the on-page conflict is minimal. The risk of "losing his mind" is countered immediately by Elara's grounding roots, removing the tension from the central trial. The climax resolves without a difficult trade-off or escalation of immediate danger, lowering the sense of earned victory.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    The conflict escalates cleanly from physical labor to metaphysical resistance, culminating in a forced trade-off. The orchard’s demand for a substitute tightens the screws effectively, ensuring the resolution requires a genuine sacrifice rather than just skill.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.6)
    Internal stakes (credibility/redemption) are strong and clearly signaled. However, the external escalation is mild; the "crusher by noon" deadline feels like a standard device and doesn't actively pressure the climactic choice, which is resolved relatively easily by brute force.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes are clear (station survival), and the pressure escalates via the decaying orbit. However, the resolution relies heavily on the premise that analogical thinking directly controls hardware, which allows the protagonist to solve the physical crisis somewhat easily once the mental shift occurs. A more tangible resistance from the machinery might have heightened the physical struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.3)
    The conflict is external and technical—a difficult soul to process—solved instantly by the protagonist's superior philosophy. There is no significant obstacle or antagonist, and the stakes remain abstract (entropy) rather than personal, urgent, or risky.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=3.8)
    The conflict is low-stakes; the opposition (orders to seal the cave) is abstract and distant, offering no immediate resistance. The climax is a frictionless choice where the protagonist abandons his duty for a guaranteed mystical reward without hesitation or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are clear (self-forgiveness), but the conflict is almost entirely internal with minimal external resistance; the station and river are passive stages. The "tightening" comes from the triangulation of the spot, but the lack of an obstacle beyond the "heavy case" limits the dramatic tension. The resolution feels somewhat easy given the weight of the guilt.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.1)
    Environmental pressure escalates effectively through the shifting light and the watch's warning, creating a solid sense of urgency. However, the conflict remains largely external; the stakes regarding the "second letter" are conceptually clear but lack a visceral on-page cost or difficult moral dimension beyond survival.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stakes are clearly defined as a clash between imperial stasis and wild growth, with the "fragile hour" providing a functional ticking clock. The pressure from the ivy forces a decision that carries the implied cost of treason, though the antagonist (the Empire) remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is abstract and procedural (Elara vs. entropy), lacking an active antagonist or a moment where the protagonist's goal is genuinely imperiled. The escalation relies on describing increased focus rather than introducing new stakes or forcing a trade-off, resulting in a low-tension arc that feels like a demonstration of competence.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.2)
    The stakes are relatively low; the "stubborn vine" presents a minor obstacle that is resolved without significant resistance or sacrifice. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through a tightening of options or a forced trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are high and legible (bombardment), but the conflict dissolves quickly once the mirror is introduced. The opposition is overcome by the tool rather than a deeply escalated interpersonal contest.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are legible—the loss of knowledge due to Elara's regression—and the conflict drives the scene. The escalation is internal, aided by the environment; while functional, the struggle feels somewhat eased by the trance state.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are high (escape vs. eternal entrapment), and the escalation through the acoustic mapping is logical. However, the external resistance is overcome somewhat easily by the protagonist's expertise; the cost is primarily the loss of the tool (arrowhead) and physical stiffness, which feels slightly light for the "eternity" of entrapment.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clearly established (human imperfection vs. automated perfection), and the removal of the regulatory pack creates a tangible on-page cost (loss of warmth/safety). However, the opposition remains largely static (environmental); the "shivering" consequence feels manageable and doesn't push the tension to a breaking point before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.9)
    The stakes are high emotionally but the on-page pressure is low; the protagonist faces no physical peril or resistance from the environment. The cost is retrospective (years of grief) rather than a price paid visibly in the scene's action.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes are cosmic in scale but anchored personally in Hiero’s persistence. While the external pressure is established, the internal conflict relies heavily on exposition ("It was the profound, nagging suspicion") rather than dramatized struggle, slightly softening the impact of the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.8)
    Conflict is minimal; the "terrors" remain passive ink and memory, offering no resistance to the ritual. The process proceeds without complication, trade-off, or narrowing of options, resulting in low narrative pressure despite the emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.5)
    Tension is strictly procedural (timing the drops) and lacks interpersonal or internal conflict; the protagonist does not have to pay a price or make a difficult trade-off to succeed.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.8)
    Pressure is minimal; the protagonist faces no active antagonist or significant environmental threat that imperils his goal. The "tightening" is merely spatial (moving to the center) rather than dramatic; the stakes are abstract (communal memory) and never seriously threatened on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes are clearly defined (loss of the magnum opus), and the sunset provides a functional ticking clock. However, the conflict resolves without a felt price; Elara "surrenders" to wonder, but this yields only gain, lacking the tangible trade-off or sacrifice necessary to create genuine tension at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are immediate and lethal, effectively narrowing the protagonist's options to a single, high-risk improvisation. The tension is well-modulated, escalating from the environmental pressure of the "time frame" to the acute mechanical failure. The cost is felt in the "heavy memory" and the physical toll of the adrenaline, satisfying the drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.7)
    The conflict lacks visceral stakes or felt cost; Kael wins the physical confrontation effortlessly by redirecting energy and suffering no damage. The antagonist poses no genuine threat, and the victory is achieved through abstract metaphors ("severed the lie") rather than struggle, leaving the tension flat.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.1)
    Stakes remain low and theoretical (a creative block); the conflict is resolved by the fortuitous arrival of the package and immediate success. The protagonist encounters no meaningful opposition or possibility of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake (restoration vs. silence) is clear, and the escalation—from one engine to twelve, then to the vocal integration—raises the pressure logically. The physical cost is palpable in the "trembling arms" and "tears," fulfilling the requirement for a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.9)
    Internal tension is high, driven by the protagonist's exile and sensitivity to the "violent edge" of the light. However, the external escalation is limited because the guardian establishes "absolute control" over the intruder early, reducing the sense of risk or opposition. The stakes remain existential and emotional, which works well, but the lack of a formidable counterpart limits the dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.1)
    The stakes are high and the pressure is coherent, escalating through the physical danger of the cold and the failure of the first attempts. The conflict resolves through a shift in tactics, though the "struggle" is more procedural than deeply personal or costly.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.9)
    The external pressure (lunar static) is well-established, creating clear stakes for the task. However, the protagonist overcomes the obstacle without a significant felt cost or sacrifice; the resolution is intellectual rather than one that demands a trade-off or painful endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=3.9)
    Escalation is linear with minimal opposition; the "ghostly chill" and passive passengers provide no meaningful resistance to Elara's plan. Success is immediate upon turning a dial, lacking a moment where the outcome is truly in doubt or a price is paid.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are established early (sanity vs. dissolution) and escalate clearly as the fever spikes and the structure gains dangerous mass. The cost is felt on the page, both physically (snapping sinew) and mentally (the erasure of the memory).

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake (transcending the cage) is clear, and the emotional cost at the end is palpable. The external conflict resolves somewhat smoothly through competence, lacking a moment where the "madness" or failure possibility forces a harder on-page tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.1)
    Escalation is functional, moving from administrative duty to spiritual danger. The stakes are clear, but the personal cost remains low—primarily physical ("adrenaline," "cold sweat") rather than a difficult trade-off or deep emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are clearly defined and escalated through the environmental pressure of the deep sea and the ticking clock. While the external pressure is coherent, the internal conflict (phobia vs. duty) follows a predictable path to resolution. The climax relies on executing a procedure rather than a difficult moral choice, limiting the depth of the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes are clear (emotional closure), and the ritual provides a steady escalation of tension. The conflict is primarily internal; the external mechanism (the table/ink) yields without significant resistance, reducing the pressure at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stakes are clear and high: cultural preservation vs. personal silence. The escalation is linear but effective, leading to a decisive moment of agency where Sylas harnesses the birds. The cost is paid immediately and irrevocably, satisfying the requirement for felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are high and clear (restoring a fragmented soul), but the opposition is largely passive; the entity shrieks but does not actively thwart Elias. The victory feels slightly too smooth, lacking a moment where the cost of the ritual forces a harder trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.3)
    The stakes are high (treason/revolution), but the opposition is weak; the statues "draw weapons" but are destroyed before they can apply pressure, making the victory feel somewhat unearned. The escalation moves from silence to total destruction too smoothly, lacking a moment where the plan nearly fails or requires a painful trade-off beyond the symbolic loss of the shell.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    Tension is well-maintained through the volatility of the bottled storm and the looming drone threat. While the stakes are clear, the "cognitive paradox" solution leans on competence without forcing a difficult dilemma or sacrifice, keeping the conflict largely external.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clearly defined by the decaying bell, creating a ticking clock that pressures the protagonist. The conflict escalates from a physical search to an internal crisis of identity (silence vs. song), resolving with a meaningful sacrifice of his core philosophy.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.7)
    Tension escalates well through the ritualistic manipulation of the silk, and the stakes (sanity, accessing pure creation) are felt. However, the resolution lacks an active trade-off from the protagonist; the "snap" of the silk resolves the tension externally. While the cost (loss of the portal/scarf) is clear, it wasn't a price Elara actively chose to pay, which softens the dramatic impact.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.7)
    Conflict is minimal and entirely internal, resolved quickly by the protagonist's specialized skill without significant opposition. The stakes are abstract ("bitter regret"), and the escalation consists merely of working faster and sweating. Success feels inevitable, missing the tension of potential failure or necessary trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are declared early (the trapped song), but the escalation is limited to a brief moment of vertigo and panic. The resolution comes too easily through compliance with a command, lacking a visceral sense of cost or a moment where the outcome truly hangs in the balance.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.1)
    Pressure is largely atmospheric ("glass... groaned") rather than antagonistic; there is no active opposition or difficult choice in the scene. The protagonist succeeds immediately once the external event occurs, lacking a moment of "tightening" where he must sacrifice something to gain his desire.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—Lenore’s agency versus her dependency—is signaled early and escalated effectively through Silas's deceptive intervention. The conflict operates on two levels: Silas fighting his urge to coddle, and Lenore fighting the glass. The climax is driven by the protagonist's specific technical action (marking the flaw), leading to a meaningful resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.5)
    Tension is virtually absent; the "opposing force" is the abstract stagnation of the world below, which exerts no active pressure on Elian in the scene. He encounters no resistance from the environment, the seed, or his own limitations, resulting in a story with low stakes despite the "cosmic" scale. The process is described as "exhausting" in hindsight, but this cost is not shown in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is managed well through the increasing physical weight of the silence and the intensity of the mask's psychic scream. While the external conflict is relatively linear (untying knots), the internal stakes escalate sharply with the brother reveal, ensuring the final action carries heavy emotional freight.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story lacks significant external opposition or a felt cost; the conflict is purely a procedural puzzle. While the realization of the missing lever narrows options, the resolution comes without personal risk or sacrifice, keeping the stakes low.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stakes remain abstract and theoretical; while the captain's "scream of refusal" provides thematic opposition, Elias encounters no genuine resistance or dilemma. The climax resolves through a calculated action with no trade-off or potential for failure, keeping tension and narrative pressure low.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.0)
    Pressure is coherent (the approaching storm) but lacks active opposition or escalation; the stakes are theoretical (Kaelen's peace) rather than immediate. The conflict is essentially Man vs. Environment/Task, and because the plan works perfectly on the first try, the dramatic tension remains low throughout the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=4.1)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the external wind howls but the interior is "quiet," and the time pressure of the elevator acts as a pacing device rather than a source of genuine tension. Elian faces no opposition—he has the right tool, the right knowledge, and the perfect opportunity—resulting in a frictionless victory with zero felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is low; the protagonist faces no active opposition from the environment or his tools, only the abstract threat of "nothingness." The climax relies on witnessing a phenomenon rather than overcoming a meaningful obstacle or paying a visible price to maintain the observation.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.3)
    The pressure of the impending demolition creates tangible stakes, and the artistic struggle is well-defined. However, the resolution of that struggle—finding the perfect tool hidden in the wall—diminishes the protagonist's agency, as the solution is provided by the setting rather than forged solely through his effort.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is virtually no opposition or escalating pressure; Elara’s path is linear and unobstructed. The stakes—finding the light—are professional but lack personal risk or urgency. The resolution comes too easily, with the environment yielding its secret without forcing a trade-off or meaningful loss.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are globally high (a frozen world) but the immediate scene pressure is dampened by the protagonist's efficiency and the ease of the solution. The "hall of mirrors" forces a tactical shift (moving blindly), which is a good beat, but the climax lacks a significant trade-off or sacrifice; the cost is merely physical exertion ("gritting her teeth").

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the stakes (atmospheric collapse) are high, the narrative lacks genuine pressure or escalation; the solution is provided by the ghost and implemented without failure or sacrifice. The conflict is resolved through smooth instruction-following, stripping the climax of tension or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is static; the pressure arises entirely from the premise (the universe is ending) rather than active opposition or a dilemma that forces a trade-off. Silas’s options never narrow because he never considers deviating from his pre-ordained path.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=5.9)
    External stakes are high (life or death), but the protagonist faces no difficult binary choice; the solution is a linear execution of competence. The climax lacks a moment where Silas must sacrifice something of value (safety, the seed, his health) to succeed, making the victory feel inexpensive.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.7)
    The stakes are clear in the backstory (grief, legacy, pollution), but the on-page scene lacks immediate pressure or obstacles; Elias observes and solves without encountering a "no" or a complication that forces a difficult trade-off beyond the conceptual shift.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.4)
    Conflict is largely theoretical and procedural until the final arrival; the stakes are internal and abstract ("hollow space inside the story"). While the closing twist adds conceptual weight, the scene lacks active interpersonal pressure or a difficult choice during the demonstration.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are clear but primarily external and professional until the climax. The pressure escalates appropriately during the consumption of the coral, with visceral descriptions of pain, but the outcome feels assured given the protagonist's established competence.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are established early, but the escalation is mechanical; the opposition yields to competence without forcing a significant tactical reversal or moral trade-off. The protagonist faces physical exertion but no genuine peril or dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.7)
    The conceptual stakes—preserving humanity's soul against digital oblivion—are high and clear, but the on-page conflict is largely procedural. The escalation comes from enduring the machine's activation rather than a difficult decision or trade-off; however, the final cost of losing her individual identity to the collective memory is legible and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.3)
    The gravity inversion creates a clear ticking clock that escalates pressure naturally, and the dominant stake is established early. While the physical danger is clear, the resolution comes with minimal personal price ("jarring her teeth"), limiting the impact of the climax. The protagonist's agency is high, but the lack of a difficult trade-off or foreclosure of options keeps the tension largely external.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are clearly established as a binary between despair/silence and hope/song, escalated by the physical danger of the wood shattering. The "terrifying second" before the sound emerges effectively spikes the tension at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.3)
    The conflict is primarily internal and intellectual; the physical danger of the nexus is stated but not deeply felt. While the stakes are clear for Elian, the lack of immediate external pressure keeps the tension in the middle band.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain abstract and low; the conflict is a "man vs. object" puzzle with no active opposition or time pressure beyond the atmospheric backdrop. The escalation is a short procedural ladder (tuning fork to oscillator) with no trade-offs or sacrifices required to succeed, resulting in a lack of genuine tension.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are purely internal and the pressure is low; the protagonist observes and records rather than navigating a forcing function that threatens failure. The resolution comes from a shift in perspective without a visible, paid cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the physical stakes of the storm are established, the conflict remains external and environmental, lacking a human dimension or trade-off. The climax involves solving a puzzle rather than making a hard choice, leaving the ending without a felt price or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes remain intellectual and future-oriented rather than visceral; the protagonist faces no active opposition or time pressure that forces a trade-off. The fog thickens, but the escalation is atmospheric rather than causal, leaving the central conflict flat.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.2)
    There is a near-total absence of active opposition or escalation; the "hesitation" of the distant artist is resolved immediately by Elian’s routine action. The stakes are high in concept (saving art) but low in scene, as failure never feels like a genuine possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.6)
    The atmospheric pressure is palpable, but the stakes remain largely intellectual and retrospective ("wisdom... too late") rather than an immediate risk of ruin. The conflict resolves through a smooth realization without forcing a difficult trade-off or active sacrifice in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.8)
    Pressure is coherent and escalates through the machine's operation, but the conflict is one-sided as Kael lacks the agency to resist. The stakes are high (sanity/soul), but without active opposition or a "live" alternative for the protagonist, the dramatic tension relies entirely on the procedure's outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.6)
    Conflict is largely atmospheric (thin air, silence) rather than antagonistic. The stakes are high in concept (restoring wonder) but low in execution, as the resolution requires only a single, uninterrupted action without escalating pressure or narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake (Mara's peace) is clear, and the cost (surrendering her protective anger) is a legible, felt price at the resolution. The conflict is primarily internal; the external execution of the magic faces no resistance, which limits the tension during the rising action.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    The external pressure is coherent and escalates effectively when the apple tree is erased, forcing an immediate tactical shift (the sacrifice). The cost is absolute and legible on the page, satisfying the requirement for a high-stakes trade-off under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are high (planetary survival), but tension is absent because the protagonist faces no resistance or difficult choices during the climb. The solution works immediately upon application, bypassing any potential struggle, failure, or need to improvise under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clear and pressure escalates effectively as Elara fights the "temporal inertia" to alter the vision. The conflict tightens through a distinct mental action ("tightened her mental grip") that narrows the outcome to a single, painful truth.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.4)
    The stakes are clear, but the escalation is minimal; Elias encounters no significant obstacle in delivering the solution, and the antagonist (the crushing fear) yields immediately to the gesture. The lack of friction or trade-off in the climax flattens the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is largely atmospheric; Silas dominates the storm with ease ("only laughed harder"), resulting in a lack of escalating tension or risk of failure. The stakes are global (the city, the dam) but not personal to Silas, who pays no price for his success, leaving the victory feeling unearned in terms of narrative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.7)
    Tension is maintained through the precise, high-stakes process of the experiment, supported by the internal pressure of the "thumping" heart. The stakes are clear—the wing would "crumble into gray dust"—giving the action weight. The escalation is subtle but effective, driven by the movement of the light.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the abstract stakes are high ("walls of reality"), the on-page tension is low; the protagonist resolves the crisis through patience and technical adjustment rather than personal risk. No visible or felt cost is paid to achieve the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are immediate and visceral, escalating from the difficulty of creation to the danger of incineration. The pressure is coherent, though the influx of villager strength slightly dilutes the protagonist's solitary agency at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are low and internal; the obstacle (the crowd) is bypassed quickly via the protagonist's specialized skill, creating little genuine friction or possibility of failure. The escalation is mild, as the ritual to enter the library functions more as a key turning a lock than a pressure-filled struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake is internal—preserving memory and finding meaning against entropy. The pressure is atmospheric rather than acute; the drones are mentioned but remain a background threat rather than a forcing function. The climax (eating the bread) represents a "felt cost" (consuming a non-renewable relic), which anchors the conflict, but the external tension remains low.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.2)
    The conflict with entropy is clear, but the stakes feel somewhat abstract since the civilization has "already largely forgotten itself." The pressure is maintained by the fading signal ("needle on the gauge began to drop"), but the lack of external consequences limits the tension to the immediate task.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    The "red-light-green-light" mechanic provides excellent, coherent escalation that tests the protagonist's nerve against the antagonist's patience. The pressure builds logically beat-by-beat, making the climax feel inevitable rather than forced.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stakes are clear: intellectual validation versus the reality of the ecosystem. The escalation works well as Elara pushes through physical and atmospheric barriers. The cost is palpable at the end—the loss of her detached, skeptical luminosity in exchange for the heavy, functional burden of the weather.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes are defined, but the conflict remains almost entirely internal and retrospective until the climax. The "silence" provides a mild constraint, but the primary antagonist is a memory, making the on-page pressure feel somewhat static. The breaking of the lock serves as a functional, if symbolic, escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.6)
    The immediate, visceral cost of the Governor's and Clerk's lies transforms an abstract political stake into a survival imperative. Escalation is coherent and pressure mounts visibly on the page, forcing the antagonist to break before the protagonist collapses.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.9)
    The stakes are high conceptually ("emotional monochrome") but low in immediate narrative tension. The opposition is passive (the cold, the silence), and Elara faces no active antagonist or moment of near-failure. Everything proceeds exactly according to plan, which limits the sense of risk or cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are existential and immediate, escalating naturally from internal static to a threat of total system wipe. The climax effectively externalizes the internal conflict, using the "psychic hurricane" to manifest the pressure before the final release.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=3.9)
    There is no genuine escalation or opposition; the demolition crew functions as static background noise while Elara effortlessly solves the puzzle. The protagonist faces no difficult trade-offs, fails at nothing, and achieves total victory without sacrifice, flattening the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central conflict—human fragility vs. machine logic—is resolved through a single tactical choice ("encrypt vulnerability") that encounters no effective resistance from the antagonist. There is no escalation of stakes on the page; Elara executes her plan perfectly without needing to improvise or sacrifice a secondary goal. The "deepening" of the father's legacy adds emotional texture but does not increase the immediate narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are existential and immediate: the risk is being "flattened" or drifting into spikes, while the reward is the retrieval of a lost self. The escalation is sharp, with the theft triggering an immediate environmental reaction that forces a desperate, character-specific tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are high in concept ("catastrophe") but low in execution; Elian faces no resistance during the ritual. The victory is achieved without sacrifice or trade-off on the page, creating a "smooth ride" that lacks tension.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    The conflict is sharply defined: Silas's demand for truth versus Elara's protection of the necessary lie. The stakes escalate cleanly from a question of translation to the immediate structural integrity of their home. The pressure is coherent, forcing Silas to abandon his quest for objective truth in favor of survival.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—sanity versus grief—is clear, and the closure carries a felt emotional cost ("terrifying lightness"). However, the escalation is largely internal and mechanical; the ritual succeeds exactly as planned without forcing a desperate improvisation.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes are high in the abstract (a prince's life), but the on-page resistance is low due to the protagonist's flawless preparation and tools. The escalation relies on environmental factors like the cold and the aurora rather than an evolving active opposition or dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is strictly environmental and yields immediately to the protagonist's competence; the "Silent Council" remains a distant concept rather than an active opposing force. The stakes are theoretical—the Nexus might shatter—but this threat never manifests as a concrete near-miss or paid price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.0)
    Conflict is largely theoretical; the antagonist is a passive spirit "refusing to manifest," and the obstacle is overcome through research rather than high-stakes confrontation. The "dangerous art" mentioned in the text remains hypothetical, as Elara never faces a moment where "shattering the remnant" feels imminent or likely. The lack of active opposition or time pressure results in a low-tension procedural.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.5)
    Pressure is low; the stakes are entirely conceptual (&quot;challenging the indifference of the night&quot;) with no external opposition or visible cost to failure. While the ritual escalates logically, the lack of a tangible trade-off or risk limits the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.0)
    The conceptual stakes (truth versus safety) are resolved with a clear, felt cost in the final beat, satisfying the closure requirement. However, the physical escalation is weaker; the immediate threat of the storm is resolved by a low-cost, intuitive action that lacks the desperate struggle implied by the "dying planet" context.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.1)
    The stakes are high—the loss of a life's work—and the "variant allegiance" provides a clear pivot point. However, the conflict is largely externalized into machinery that simply stops obeying; Silas's agency in the climax is limited to a brief, frantic attempt to turn dials before passively accepting his fate, reducing the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are declared ("repair the air") but the on-page pressure is low; the conflict is purely procedural (fixing a mechanism) with no antagonist or active resistance beyond rust. Success is achieved smoothly without a moment where failure seems possible, and the "cost" of using the jars is transactional rather than emotionally heavy since he has "rows" of them.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clearly established (survival, protection of the artifact), and the escalation from mechanical failure to physical exposure is effective. The cost is felt on the page—the biting cold of the bare skin and the somatic shaking of the organs. However, the resolution comes somewhat swiftly after the adaptation, slightly dampening the peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.4)
    Pressure is low; the protagonist faces no active opposition, unforeseen obstacles, or difficult trade-offs, only a waiting period that she navigates with perfect competence. The resolution is effectively cost-free, failing to escalate stakes or test the protagonist's commitment to the "patient revolution."

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clearly established as a trade-off between corporate compliance and safety/truth. The escalation is handled well, moving from environmental discomfort to psychic assault, forcing a stance crystallization. The cost of the final choice is felt and explicitly stated.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are immediately legible and personal, anchoring the abstract theological conflict in a specific object. The "it is over" beat provides necessary pressure and hopelessness before the reversal, ensuring the climax feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are immediate and lethal (dissolution in acid), escalating clearly as the workshop sinks. The protagonist's agency is central, evidenced by the deliberate trade-off of safety (iron shielding) for the necessary lift to ascend. The climax pays off this risk with a coherent, earned escape.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.7)
    The monitor drone creates immediate, palpable pressure that forces a high-stakes tactical lie. While the obstacle is resolved quickly, the final cost—the burden of horrific knowledge—is felt and clearly earned by the investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is purely external and resolves without escalation; the council acts as a static obstacle that crumbles immediately upon seeing the magic item. The protagonist faces no difficult choices or trade-offs, diffusing all tension before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are existentially high, but the immediate on-page conflict is low-friction; the "inertia" is an abstract obstacle rather than an active opposition. The tension relies on the atmospheric "groan" of the ice rather than a meaningful tightening of options before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is virtually no escalation; Elias offers a solution immediately, and the woman accepts it without resistance or complication. The stakes are declared but not tested; the conflict resolves through a monologue rather than a dynamic exchange of values or costs. The "cost" of letting the letter go feels symbolic rather than viscerally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.9)
    While the stakes are clear, the protagonist faces little operational friction; he possesses the exact key (sigils, vial) for every lock he encounters. The "cost" of the confession is mitigated because it is compelled by the Pavilion rather than paid voluntarily.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the "anxious energy" of the town is abstract and off-screen, offering no active resistance to Elian's work. The protagonist faces no genuine risk of failure, making the stakes feel declared rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are declared ("dangerous," "law") but remain abstract; no antagonist or concrete obstacle opposes him in the scene to force a difficult choice. The escalation is mechanical (whisper to amplified speech) rather than a tightening of options or risks, resulting in low tension.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.7)
    Pressure is coherent and escalates through the fading vision, forcing a tangible change in tactics. However, the stakes remain somewhat intellectual and aesthetic, lacking a visceral external consequence for failure beyond the loss of the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is coherent, with the earthquake providing a rising external clock that pressures the internal task. The protagonist's agency is central to the resolution, though the physical cost is largely threatened (the abyss) rather than executed on the body.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.6)
    Narrative tension is low because the protagonist encounters no significant resistance; Clara's distress is resolved instantly by Elias's technique. The stakes are ostensibly high (death), but the lack of an obstacle or potential failure path drains the scene of dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.2)
    The pressure is coherent and escalates well through the mechanical process of the machine, leading to a distinct realization. The stakes are personal and conceptual, and the cost of the discovery—the crushing of the shadows and the futility of the knowledge—is legible and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.1)
    The approaching footsteps provide effective situational pressure, forcing Aris to crystallize his stance against a ticking clock. The stakes—preserving the parents' sanity at the cost of medical truth—are clear and heightened by the immediate physical proximity of the grieving family.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are primarily internal and past-tense (memory of fire) rather than present-tense pressure; the panic attack is resolved quickly without complicating the polishing task. The weighing scene attempts tension ("needle... quivered") but lacks genuine doubt or consequence, resulting in low narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stakes are thematic and retroactive (dealing with the past confession) rather than immediate and pressing on the page. The encounter with Mara lacks active resistance or tension; her acceptance is swift, resulting in a low-pressure scene that feels more like a tableau than a conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.0)
    The conflict is primarily man-against-environment (the "river of words"), which functions metaphorically but lacks interpersonal stakes or significant risk of failure for the protagonist. The resolution comes through persistence rather than a costly adaptation of tactics or a sacrifice of his own.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are declared but not felt; the "bitter crops" are abstract, and the sunrise deadline generates no immediate, on-page pressure. The protagonist succeeds on the first attempt at every stage, preventing genuine escalation or the narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the dominant stake (preservation vs. entropy) is clear, the on-page conflict is minimal; Silas faces no active opposition from the environment, the materials, or himself. The "cost" is strictly material (supplies), lacking the felt personal or relational price needed to heighten the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.9)
    The stakes are clear: preservation versus entropy. The pressure is well-maintained through the delicate nature of the task—the need to avoid direct observation adds necessary tension to the climax. The cost is felt in the final silence, effectively repricing the environment from "cathedral" to "mere geology."

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure is palpable, generated by the "shingled hush" and the multiplying fractal regret. The stakes (losing her mind to the regression) are high, though the resolution comes via a somewhat procedural adjustment of a tool rather than a costly personal sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are legible (stability vs. overwhelming memory), but the conflict is low-resistance; Elara overcomes the grief by simply "willing" it into the wood. The victory feels asserted rather than earned through a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clear and personal; the trade of "scraps of humanity" for a dangerous truth provides solid escalation. The pressure is coherent, though the conflict is resolved relatively quickly; the focus is rightly on the internal cost of the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are purely abstract ("prove that the decline was not irreversible") and lack immediate physical or professional risk for the protagonist. The conflict is static; the solution proceeds mechanically without a moment of doubt, failure, or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stakes are purely internal but clearly felt; the risk of "treasonous" noise against the "glacial hush" provides sufficient pressure. The resolution—accepting the burden rather than escaping it—gives weight to the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clear and the convergence of the dawn deadline with the discovery creates solid pressure. The conflict is resolved through a definitive action that reweights the protagonist's relationship to the truth, though the external threat feels slightly low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes remain abstract and theoretical; the "urgency" mentioned in the opening never materializes into a concrete threat. The obstacle (the "impossible" knot) yields immediately to the protagonist's gaze without forcing a tradeoff, sacrifice, or escalation of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes remain largely atmospheric and internal; while the &quot;snapping thread&quot; provides a symbolic climax, the external pressure is low. The resolution feels like an expert consultation that goes smoothly, lacking a moment of genuine doubt or risk that would heighten the emotional payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are established early and escalate through the delicate mechanical process and the fragility of the egg. The conflict shifts organically from Man vs. Difficulty (the experiment) to Man vs. World (the toxic environment), creating a coherent pressure that resolves with a painful trade-off. The cost is felt immediately on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.4)
    While the stakes are clearly declared ("needed to know"), the on-page conflict is minimal; the protagonist executes a planned ritual without error or external opposition. The tension relies entirely on the passive act of waiting for the graft to take, missing an opportunity for a meaningful tightening or a cost that forces a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.5)
    The central conflict lacks urgent, on-page pressure; because the "timeframe" is suspended, the protagonist’s wait for the star carries no immediate risk or ticking clock. The obstacle is passive, and the resolution comes from external alignment rather than a high-stakes trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.1)
    While the conceptual stakes are high, the immediate physical pressure is dampened by the summarized navigation. The conflict resolves meaningfully on an internal level, but the external obstacles lack visceral drag.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—artistic truth—is clear, and the pressure escalates effectively through the migration timeline and the grandfather's increasing urgency. The "turn" where the ribbon fails to form a circle is a distinct moment of revelation. While the stakes are internal/conceptual, the cost is legible: the abandonment of his previous idealized order.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    The conflict is primarily internal and man-versus-machine, which fits the scope but limits the dynamic range of the pressure. The stakes are clearly defined through the protagonist's obsession, though the external consequence of the "stutter" on the town remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is minimal; Silas faces a task (untangling) which he overcomes with "practiced gentleness" and no setbacks. The dominant stake is abstract (tidiness vs. confusion), and the protagonist pays no price for the resolution, resulting in low narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are high and conceptually clear, pitting stagnation against painful progress. The escalation is primarily internal and hypothetical; the lack of a concrete, immediate external obstacle (beyond the blank page) limits the palpable tension.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.5)
    The physical threat (drone) and the magical complication (glowing ink) create clear, escalating pressure in the scene. However, the resolution—simply covering the desk with a coat—feels mechanically simple and lacks a significant cost or sacrifice to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.2)
    The use of the rocking chair as a metronome creates tangible, escalating pressure that aligns perfectly with the ritual. The conflict between Elara's desire for permanence and the inevitable destruction of the art is palpable. The stakes are clear and the cost—Elara's shock and betrayal—is vividly felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes (truth vs. dogma) are clearly established and drive the action. However, the opposition is abstract and off-screen, creating a conflict that feels more intellectual than immediate or dangerous.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.3)
    The central conflict—harmony versus apathy/noise—is staged well within the room, creating a coherent pressure cooker. The escalation is palpable as Elian conducts the silence. The stakes feel significant (cultural/spiritual survival), and the "cost" is the tragic return of the mundane noise.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the celestial alignment provides time pressure, the central conflict is resolved too easily; the plant "shudders" but offers no meaningful resistance to the shears. The lack of a visible trade-off or costly setback lowers the tension to a procedural level.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes (city-wide power failure) are high and clear, but the interpersonal conflict dissolves too softly when the antagonist accepts the protagonist's worldview without sufficient resistance. The tension deflates rather than snapping at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.2)
    Pressure accumulates through sensory detail, but the stakes remain purely intellectual and abstract. While the "shard of hush" creates tension, the lack of a tangible, felt cost or risk to Elias limits the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes escalate effectively from an abstract historical judgment to an immediate life-or-death responsibility. The cost—Elara's loss of moral certainty—is legible and paid on the page before the final action.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes (eternal confinement vs. existence failure) are established early and escalate clearly through the preparation of the equation. The climax provides a tangible release of tension, though the resolution comes relatively easily once the die is cast.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are abstract and the obstacle (city apathy) offers no active resistance. The protagonist succeeds on his first attempt without paying a visible cost or facing a setback that forces a change in tactics. The victory feels granted rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are established early (cultural extinction) and escalate clearly through the cracking ice to the final thunderous thaw. The pressure forces a decisive trade-off—abandoning the scrolls to save the alphabet—which lands with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are established early (famine, doom), but the protagonist dominates the conflict with ease. The pressure is purely external (time/tide); there is no escalation of tactical difficulty or narrowing of choices, as Elias’s plan proceeds without a hitch. The resolution lacks a "paid price," reading as a pure triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes are high and personal (psychic survival). The tension escalates cleanly from the entrance to the mirror confrontation. The reversal—hunting the hunter by inverting standard survival instincts—is a strong, agency-driven resolution that satisfies the buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.4)
    Escalation is linear and lacks a moment of genuine jeopardy; the storm threatens, but the protagonist's counter-move works immediately and completely. The stakes are high (survival), but the lack of a "micro turn" or failed attempt makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from intellectual curiosity to existential entrapment. The decision to use the whistle is a clear agency moment that irreversibly alters the status quo; the cost is the loss of the "natural" world view, felt viscerally in the final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.2)
    Escalation is minimal; the conflict resolves through a brief intellectual exchange without shifting power dynamics, visceral risk, or a meaningful tightening of options. The stakes are declared but not tested by genuine opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clear and personal, pitting human memory against entropy. The physical struggle with the granite chunk effectively concretizes the abstract conflict, providing a necessary beat of resistance before the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clear and elevated by the physical risk of suffocation, though that risk remains somewhat abstract and calculated rather than viscerally felt. The conflict is primarily man-against-lock; the escalation works via the tactile adjustments, though the cost paid is purely conceptual (the burden of truth) rather than a direct on-page sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clearly established as a binary between eternal isolation and shared presence. The escalation through the volatility of the trapped dream is coherent, though the resolution of the binding process relies slightly more on a sudden procedural realization than a deepening of the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.3)
    The conflict is masterfully braided: the internal grief drives the action, while the external timeline of the resetting breakers provides the escalating pressure. The climax forces a trade-off between station safety (reality) and the "phantom limb" (potential), resulting in a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.2)
    Pressure is minimal; the only opposition is the physical friction of a stuck chip ("resistance grinding"). The protagonist faces no difficult trade-offs or escalating stakes, leading to a resolution where she gains everything and loses nothing.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes are clearly established as internal peace versus professional malpractice. However, the external pressure (the wood’s false memories) is overcome too easily ("shaking his head"), reducing the tension. The climax relies on finding an object rather than a difficult active choice.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are high and clear, but the escalation is resolved too neatly by the prop's convenient utility. The "cost" paid at the end—leaving the object behind—reads more as a relief or reward than a painful price extracted by the conflict, lowering the tension of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clearly internalized—sanity and survival vs. pride—and the pressure escalates appropriately with the thickening fog. The resolution is earned through a change in method, though the external conflict is somewhat static; the tension relies heavily on internal monologue rather than varied external obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.3)
    The dominant stake (empathy vs. apathy) is escalated clearly through the visual confrontation with the stolen future in the lake. The climax forces a binary choice—keep the miracle or feel the sin—and the protagonist pays a visible price (losing the ball) to resolve the conflict. The stakes are visceral, and the resolution is earned through action rather than contemplation.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.1)
    The stakes are visceral and immediate, with the heat of the phoenix providing a physical wall that tests Elian’s resolve. The cost—permanent biological alteration—is paid on the page, satisfying the requirement for genuine consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stakes are clearly defined and escalate naturally from a desire to retrieve time to a confrontation with the self. The turn—where the magic works but provides an indictment rather than a solution—forces a distinct, pressure-filled choice. The cost of the final decision is felt psychologically.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake (breaching the door) is clear, but the escalation is procedural rather than dramatic; the protagonist simply performs a series of tasks to succeed. The climax resolves the internal conflict through a rapid shift in state ("agony transmuted into... acceptance") rather than a difficult choice with visible cost. The lack of external resistance or meaningful failure risks flattens the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=3.8)
    Tension is low despite the volcanic threat because Silas displays no urgency or internal conflict. The resolution is achieved through an "accidental" release of insects that magically fixes the problem, removing any sense of struggle or cost from the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.2)
    Tension is low due to a lack of immediate opposition; Elara faces no difficult choices, tradeoffs, or direct threats during her mission. The stakes are high in theory (revolution) but low in practice, as the success feels inevitable from the moment the lights go out.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stakes are clear and high: a battle between entropy and a moment of order. The tension escalates effectively through the arrival of the eels and the precise timing required for the capture, with the cost of the "star dust" adding necessary weight to the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.0)
    The tension is functional, driven by the storm and the timer, but the conflict remains largely external and procedural. The stakes are high in concept (truth vs. erasure) but abstract in execution; Elias succeeds without forcing a difficult trade-off or paying a new price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the stakes of war and peace are declared, the on-page physical pressure is low because Silas dominates the duel effortlessly ("stripping Kael of options without drawing a drop of blood"). The protagonist faces no genuine risk or trade-off, reducing the conflict to a procedural exercise.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is negligible; the internal obstacle (grief) dissolves instantly via the convenient personality switch, and the external action (gardening) faces no resistance from the environment or antagonists. There is no escalation of pressure; the characters formulate a plan and execute it perfectly without cost or trade-off. The "patrol officer" is a hypothetical threat that never exerts force on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.5)
    The internal stakes are well-calibrated, creating a coherent pressure to find a "good death" amidst the external decay. The shift from frantic preparation to peaceful acceptance provides a meaningful deepening of the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are established early and remain high; the threat of amnesia is palpable. The pressure escalates via the psychological seduction of the illusion and the physical clock of the approaching monsoon. The protagonist's choice to strip away the comforting mirage forecloses the path of easy bliss, carrying a legible emotional and conceptual cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes are established early (the need for intimacy after the severance), and the pressure escalates through the physical toll of the ritual. However, the climax relies on endurance rather than a difficult choice; Silas essentially pushes a feeling out until it works, lacking a sharper trade-off or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (prove sideways time) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via activation/revelation that narrows options (sees proof, feels urge but endures).

No live option fully tested pre-climax slightly limits peak trade-off visibility.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (probe past trauma) signaled early; Accumulative escalation via deepening discoveries (panic → diaries → dragons' meaning) narrows knowledge, agency in extraction/reading forces reconfiguration with world's insomnia as conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Fog-obscured panic flare forces pole-rereliance tightening under Accumulative lens, narrowing open-bay option with protagonist endurance; cost felt in "small... acceptable" repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (kindle empathy) signaled early, deepens via lake's branching paths narrowing to throw as agency-driven renunciation; cost unmistakable in chest pang foreclosing apathy.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.2)
    Scent conjure tightens stake by pausing phoenix, forcing deepening via reluctant metamorphosis with visceral cost; endurance forecloses human form, enabling bond under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (reclaim time) tightens accumulatively via visions of neglect narrowing to denial, forcing trade-off with felt permanence; card spiral beat deepens pressure without resolving via coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stitching deepens stake by forcing repression/wholeness trade-off under agency; nausea/rage cost unmistakably alters tactics to enlightenment.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (grasp transformation amid eruption threat) tightens via textural escalation (hush intensifies to marrow hum, bugs spiral/resonate); agency in releases forecloses safe flight path with visible cost of bugs' dispersal and personal void.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (silent revolution) signaled early, tightens via quill-gnomon lock narrowing detection risk; agency in rotation forces trade-off of exposure. Escalation causal: blackout opportunity yields Cradle activation with legible cost in "under the noses" scramble. No reversals needed; pressure coheres to Charged Poise at post-resumption.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake of stillness tightens through gravitational tug narrowing eel's path, agency in gauntlet switch with backlash cost.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (reveal map's truth) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via timer to buzz and dissolving ink narrowing revelation window; agency in timed pour forecloses failure with felt cost of reopened wounds in "fresh wounds reopening."

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake of peace-deciphering tightens via needle-shadow revelation, forcing Silas's rigid advance; cost felt in hydraulic trap stripping Kael's options.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake of garden rebellion signaled early tightens via personality-enabled planting under moon timing, narrowing to subtle poise vs. expected riots; cost felt in foreclosed noisy paths.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake of defiant encore tightens via portal entry that narrows options to finite refuge, with agency in creative repurposing; cost felt in "only until the horizon invites night," though atmospheric more than visceral reversal slips high band slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake tightens through pulse detection narrowing options to harsh truth, driven by agency in whispering syntax; rain's bullet-drop cost unmistakably forecloses illusion path.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (ritual for apologies' color) signaled early, escalates via accumulative deepening in diffusion effort and voices' arrival, narrowing to stance crystallization. Agency in tracing lace and pushing guilt shows trade-offs with physical toll; cost unmistakable in brow sweat and silent weeping.


== Grader: Kimi K2-0905 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—can detachment insulate him from ruin?—is signaled early; pressure escalates by accrual of decay evidence until beauty fractures his filter. The tightening is single but meaningful: the iridescent “pointless beauty” beat forces acknowledgment, narrowing his options to humbled acceptance. Cost is conceptual (loss of defensive objectivity) and legible in the fingertip dust. No second reversal or external antagonist, but the lens-sustained deepening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single dominant stake—find the stolen art’s destination—tightens once via the frost reveal; the price is the exposed trail she must now walk, foreclosing anonymity. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens, but a second tightening beat would have pushed it into the 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—orchid survival—signaled in first third; escalation is single but decisive: thermal flicker → rod strike → white flare. Protagonist agency is absolute; no coincidence rescues. The tightening is physical, not emotional, so the felt cost is mild—hence 8.8 not 9+. Still, the price is visible on the page (latent hum lost, energy spent), satisfying the 8+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—personal sleep vs. undead clamor—is signaled early and tightens once: the ghosts’ panic escalates until the beam acknowledges them. The single turn is decisive and irreversible; options narrow from “endure noise” to “build receiver,” with the price paid in bodily exhaustion. No secondary reversal is needed at this length. Escalation is linear, not exponential, keeping it just shy of the 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—community survival via anonymous cohesion—tightens when the embargo closes the last road; the bell ritual is the visible price that forecloses Elara’s public-credit option. Escalation is Accumulative: each silent crate and hushed declaration increases density rather than reversing plot. No coincidence; pressure coheres under the lens. One meaningful deepening suffices; the final bell-murmur reweights stakes with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can unspent love be released?—tightens when the woman’s thorn-knot blocks both their escapes; Silas’s agency (channeling his own unused love) pays the price of forever depleting his private reservoir, foreclosing the original quest. One meaningful turn is sufficient at this length; cost is legible in the lighter-chest beat.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—break the lag or remain flattened—is signaled in paragraph two and tested twice: first when a funeral photo blocks his view of the floor, second when the hyperbolic knot forces the photos to curl. Agency is physical and irreversible: once the fragment is shoved into the convergence, retreat is geometrically impossible. Cost is legible—the bridge’s convulsion and the snowfall of his own memories—though slightly abstract. The tightening pivot is the photo warp; it narrows options to forward only.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—heritage seeds versus immediate hunger—tightens as the wall collapses and footsteps approach. One meaningful escalation: the hydraulic hiss signals the vault is closing but still torque-dependent, forcing Elias to expose himself to gunfire. Agency is pure: every beat narrows options until the final twist seals both vault and fate. Cost is on-page: his capture is the price of denial.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—capture betrayal’s sonic ghost—tightens via irreversible biological countdown; every sentence counts seconds of mitotic window. Escalation is causal: each drone silence narrows the emotional field until only the void remains. Protagonist agency drives each turn; failure = cellular rejection. Cost is visible: cellular shudder under “invisible shockwave of despair.” Sufficient for high band; no coincidence resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“listen for destiny’s tumblers”—is signaled early. Escalation is the tightening from anonymous theft to being seen across time; the traveler’s gaze narrows her options to stunned stillness. Cost is conceptual but legible: her cloak of invisibility is pierced. A second reversal or tangible forfeiture would push higher, but one meaningful deepening satisfies scope.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—protect vs. share clarity—signaled early. Escalation is single but sufficient: thaw → structural groan → tilt → abandon. Protagonist agency drives the exit; luck complicates but does not solve. Cost is the forfeited dome and shelter, legible on page. Holds under causal lens; meets 8.2 floor for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—survive the burn—tightens at 5-minute countdown. One meaningful turn: Elias inverts the protocol, redirecting fire outward; price is self-imprisonment in feared darkness. Agency is continuous; no coincidence resolves. Pressure escalates because/therefore under Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—create a navigable dark—is signaled in paragraph one. Pressure escalates via cadence compression: wind gusts shorten, silences lengthen, star pulse slows to zero; each silence-summary forecloses another future. Agency remains Elara’s; she decides to trap the last flake at the exact moment light dies, paying the price of irreversible solitude. Cost is visible on page: booklet now “tomb of blank pages.”

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: can 734 extract the origin of thought from waste timelines? Pressure tightens when containment risks destabilizing his gyro—visible cost. The amalgamation act narrows options: failure means facility downtime, success means another mute data file. Escalation is causal and sufficient for 600-word scope; no external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—trust thaw—tightens once: from shielded suspicion to shared criminal possession. Escalation purely accumulative: each ticket’s residue ups emotional density; no external antagonist needed. Agency: he risks arrest by revealing cache; she risks complicity by pocketing it. Price legible “sharing the burden” instantly forecloses her option to report him.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—prove gardens answer to devotion, not algorithms—signaled early and tightened once: the marble cairn focuses sunlight, visibly stiffening the leaf while the gauge stutters. Escalation is a single deepening rather than reversal, sufficient for 800-word scope. Cost is conceptual (the sub-prefect’s worldview destabilized), but because the prefect exits without tangible consequence, the price lands more on reader than character—just below the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—prove time moves sideways—is signaled early and tested by the holographic trial. One meaningful tightening: the nexus drifts out of alignment, collapsing the window and foreclosing Elian’s chance to follow the ghosts—price is immediate and visible. Agency is internal/attentional rather than external confrontation, fitting short-form scope. Cost is legible on the page (cold rushes back in, heart hammers), but no persistent constraint shapes tomorrow’s tactics, capping at 8.1.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“unravel the code”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when the water’s stillness becomes a literal lock requiring kinetic disruption. One meaningful escalation: the still-mirror forces Elias to risk destroying the program; the splash narrows options to surrender or seize the baton. Cost is legible: the program is physically consumed, Elias’s prior anonymity drowned. Agency is his throughout; no coincidences intrude.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of liminality emerges from concrete images—pit as purgatory, ink bleeding into rest symbols—never from exposition. The silent cathedral of sound reconfigured by water offers a resonant non-literal answer: art’s meaning can migrate through destruction. No final moral is stated; the baton’s inheritance feels both triumph and curse. Ambiguity lingers: is Elias gifted or possessed?

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent global panic while not violating core programming—tightens when the analog smudge forces the algorithm to dilute certainty; options narrow from “speak/delete” to “contaminate/endure.” Escalation is one meaningful turn, sufficient at this length; price is the lifelong personal vigilance he now must keep. Agency is entirely his; coincidence absent. Cost is visible on page: “he would be the only one to see the end coming through the haze.”

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—does negligence carry the same moral tonnage as malice?—is signaled in line two and tightened when the anonymous caller confesses the identical sin. Escalation is textural: each radio fragment adds spectral mass until the factory memory exerts physical pressure. Price is visible: Silas’s hand on the wheel transmits the phantom sweat of a stranger’s cowardice, narrowing his future self-judgment. Coincidence (Toledo caller) complicates rather than rescues, satisfying lens.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—bearing witness without judgment—tightens when the rising damp threatens her vantage; the only escape is to abandon the archive forever, a visible forfeiture. Escalation is accumulative: each sentence adds decay density until the river’s roar forces the folding choice. No external antagonist is needed; pressure is ontological. The price (loss of the library and her function) is on-page, but the tightening is single rather than iterated, keeping it below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are legible early: pierce dementia fog for one lucid moment. Pressure tightens exactly once—totality’s arrival—forcing the curl hand-off. Because Elias faces no credible setback, loss, or resource drain, the escalation is gentle; the cost is carried by Elara’s past, not Elias’s present, so the beat is resonant but not wrenching.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes: retrieve the planet’s last psychic imprint or let silence stay absolute. One tightening: the diary reveals dragons = torn ley lines, foreclosing any hope that dreams can be rewound. Cost is conceptual but legible—Elian pockets ash, bearing witness to irreversible insomnia. Escalation is accumulative/textural: density of burnt paper, metallic quiet, and dragon-thread converge to reweight the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—freedom from complicity—escalates when the prophecy glitch turns fiction lethal, tightening moral cost. The manual override is the decisive trade-off: it severs his utility to the network and risks physical danger (crushing gears, exposure to boats). Pressure is coherent but largely internal; an external sniff of pursuit or a missed radio check could have sharpened the vise in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—Elias’s autonomy—tightens with each chiasmic loop; the possession clock is literal (“before the possession completes”). Agency is Kellen’s acoustic sculpting; each rhetorical device narrows the entity’s options until silence severs. Cost is visible: Elias’s gasping lurch and Kellen’s sweat-slick cables. One beat short of 8.8 because the entity’s counter-moves feel off-stage; escalation is primarily one-sided.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“capture the music of this moment before exhaustion dissolves the tuning”—is signaled early and tightens through micro-losses: eyelid heaviness, numbing cold, evaporating time until dawn. Escalation is accumulative/textural: each mapped memory adds density, each wind-gust raises frictional pitch, until the mirrored horizon locks and forecloses any retry. Protagonist agency drives every increment; no coincidences rescue him. The visible price is the irreversible consumption of his sole childhood frequency—once sounded, it can never be re-sought.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“conquer the labyrinth of self”—is signaled early and tightens into a single physical act: land and fuse. Escalation is textural density: each stone flower bloom and timeline fracture narrows her viable path until only the重力-denial reversal remains. The droplet-clock externalizes cost; missing the step equals infinite dispersal. Agency is pure—no external savior; the tablet merely records, she must abandon flotation.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—break emotional numbness—signaled in line 4; pressure intensifies through tactile amplitude until the tear pays the price. Agency resides in the decision to lower the jagged arm; coincidence absent. Escalation is textural (density of vibration) rather than causal reversal, fitting the Accumulative lens; one decisive intensification suffices. Cost is unmistakably on-page: the sob he cannot hear but feels tear from throat.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—protect uncorrupted data—tightens the instant the gate creaks; escalation is one continuous because/therefore slope. The lateral traverse is a visible tactic shaped by persistent constraint (no silhouette, no drop). Cost is concrete: lifelong station destroyed on-page; felt price in the silent balcony landing.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: verify why scent mutilates her. Escalation = densifying visualized aroma that narrows options to inhale or retreat. Agency: she chooses full exposure, pays with hemorrhagic memory. Cost is on-page: “drops of mercury under the blacklight” and later ache. One meaningful tightening suffices; no external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—finish the poem vs. stay human—tightens once when rope fibers smoke, making the trade-off visceral. Escalation is textural/accumulative: each scraped layer increases density until the single fork is forced. No false reversals; coincidence absent. Cost is visible (scorched palm, destroyed pattern) and shapes the final tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: prove silence is not absolute while accepting the world cannot be fixed. Escalation is textural density: hush presses glass → resin fire cracks → violin finds dome frequency, each layer raising the cost of failure. Agency resides in micro-sonic choices: tuning to shipwreck hull as amplifier, accepting perpetual ear-pain instead of seeking cure. Price is explicit: “unresolved” melody denies both audience and player catharsis, locking Elara into nightly repetition of ache.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—can Elara survive absolute grief—is signaled early and narrowed to a single yes/no inhale. Agency is hers; the scent’s arrival forcibly softens the jagged loss, foreclosing raw mourning. Cost is legible: she trades authentic pain for narcotic nostalgia. No escalation beyond this one beat, but the tightening is irreversible; the story accepts stasis over growth, fitting the situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—Elias’s need to balance the cosmic ledger—tightens once: from shadow observation to spoken invitation. The deepening is soft but real; retreat remains possible until he speaks. Cost is social/ego risk, visible in the echoing shoe-strike and her guarded reaction. Coincidence (mis-address) complicates but does not resolve; agency stays with Elias.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“will they accept me?”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened once: the boy’s injury creates a live test of her sympathy versus their stoicism. Passing that test wins access to the arbor and the right to weave, narrowing her options to a public, irreversible offering. The price is paid on the page: bleeding palms, spent reeds, permanent visibility of her fragile gift on immortal stone. No reversal is needed; one meaningful tightening suffices at 743 words.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—capture the origin of echo before the giant wakes—signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened twice: first when twilight shortens natural minutes, second when the pendant’s hour is shredded into seconds. Agency: she decides to slide the bolt; the rush of echo and the crack in time are direct consequences. Cost is literal lifespan, visible on her body. One meaningful escalation suffices; no reversals required.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“close the open variable of disappearance”—tightens when the eyes flare and offer one new coordinate, narrowing infinity to a single sunlit meadow. Agency is intellectual: arranging eyes, pouring sap, holding breath; each act is a bet with no refund. Cost is opportunity: another year of nights spent underground, another subtraction from surface life. Escalation is accumulative/textural: pattern density increases until the mosaic grinds its teeth; the cadence shift from drip to flash reweights the stake without external antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will he risk exposure to heal the librarian’s despair—tightens once: discovery of the tape escalates from private memory to actionable cache. Agency is present in every beat; coincidence (blackout) only complicates. Cost is visible: he forfeits face-to-face gratitude, accepts perpetual erasure. Could use one additional micro-tightening beat mid-cache to reach 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preservation of human identity—tightens when every attempt at genetic reconstruction worsens the calcification. One meaningful reversal: the insight that resistance fuels the metamorphosis forces the final surrender. Cost is visible: loss of fist, locked joints, forfeited leaf. Agency is renunciation rather than victory, consistent with situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: distill world-ruin into pigment before sleep claims him. Escalation is one sustained tightening: tide rises, tunnel disappears, filter gone—each step shrinks future options. The swap is protagonist-forced; luck only exposes, never saves. Cost is visible—filtration straw leaves his neck; thirst is now unfiltered.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—Elara’s need to control the future vs. the present’s chaotic wonder—tightens once when the pearl’s vortex forecloses her predictive mode; the cost is the loss of her clairvoyant distance, legible on-page. Escalation is textural: the steadily unpredictable magic accumulates density until the cadence of “morning dew… baking bread… held hand” breaks her paradigm. No false reversals; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can estrangement be bridged—tightens when Elian realizes silence may ossify; staggered steam pulses force trade-off between anonymity and communal healing. Cost is visceral: he forfeits lifelong invisibility. One meaningful escalation suffices under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reach the Fortress or keep hiding behind maps—tightens once: the chasm forces the dare that dissolves her buffer between self and truth. Escalation is causal: each punch narrows escape options until the only remaining path is to break her own vessel. Cost is visible (trembling certainty, sharp wash of truth) but not persistently felt after the smash; hence stops short of 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“what happens after goodbye”—is signaled in para 2 and escalates as the pocket dimension literally tries to eject him, narrowing options to ‘stay & implode’ vs ‘step into cessation.’ The solar storm’s rising radiation supplies a live clock, tightening once. Visible price: the shard cracks with “a wave of pure loss,” foreshadowing his own dissolution. No second reversal, but one meaningful deepening suffices at this length; cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—Elena’s life—signaled in paragraph four. Tightening occurs when Vance crosses the threshold; ink offer is the irreversible trade that forecloses his denial. Cost is conceptual: Vance’s binary code dissolves, leaving him “terrified by his own humanity.” One clean escalation under causal lens; no gratuitous reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stake—fabricate a ghost-memory for a client—remains abstract; no visible tightening or price threatens failure; the dip in lamp pitch is purely technical, not an irreversible fork. Escalation is atmospheric accumulation rather than option-narrowing; cost is asserted sensorially at the end but not paid through a trade-off mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake: to honor the forgotten without being remembered. Escalation proceeds by texture-accretion: each overheard fragment tightens the stakes by proving how easily lives dissolve into cargo. The tightening is visible when the label becomes too heavy to keep—he must lodge it in public stone, forfeiting anonymity. Cost is felt on the page: the water “lapped against the pilings” denies him ownership of the sorrow he summoned.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—decode whether the universe carries narrative or noise—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when the compass replays his own stripped conversations, foreclosing the option to keep believing in pure chaos. Escalation is accumulative: each resonant hum adds density of evidence against his life’s work until retelling becomes the only live option. Cost is visible: the shell sheds paint, the observatory walls fold, his mentor’s voice labels him coward—price is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—save the settlement—tightens once: each sprayed angle forecloses a navigational option until the stone’s move widens the legal perimeter. The cost is intellectual-displacement rather than corporeal, but still legible on the last line as the new landlords confront an unreadable map.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“capture the last true night”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens through each beat: patrol sweep, frostbite, timer limit, orbital mirror countdown. Agency is endurance rather than combat; every second he stays narrows escape options. The crimson flip of the strip is the visible price-trigger that forces the final shutter press. Cost is visceral (pain, exposure) and conceptual (eternal light begins), satisfying the 8.8+ gate for visible price even without a villain.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—the drone must fly before *Aethelgard* departs—tightens audibly with every engine crescendo. One meaningful deepening: the refraction data spikes smooth under Elias’s fingertips, foreclosing error and locking in the true horizon. No false reversals; pressure is accumulative/textural, intensifying through sound and vibration. Cost is the irreversible moment the ship’s shadow passes—time paid in full.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—find the hidden origin of rivers—tightens once: the breath-map offers an answer that can only be witnessed, never possessed, narrowing Silas’s options to renunciation. Cost is legible: he forfeits immortalizing the discovery. Escalation is accumulative/textural: stillness → falcon → condensation pattern intensifies atmospheric pressure rather than causal reversals. One visible price paid (the map evaporates), altering tactics—he closes the book instead of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—prevent collapse via rhythmic alignment—signaled in first paragraph. One meaningful tightening: chaotic footsteps accumulate until keystone threatens failure; Silas’s metronomic boot forces synchronized cadence, foreclosing dissonance. Cost is legible: he must stand vigil forever, entropy deferred not defeated. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens; no coincidence required.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—save the ghosts or die trying—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens through the O2 countdown. One meaningful deepening: the vial’s psychic residue turns from liability to fuel, forcing her to keep diving. Cost is visible (vision grays) and alters later tactics (she stays hand instead of bolting). Coincidence absent; escalation is density-driven under Accumulative lens. Needed one more beat where the vial almost slips to push into 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—evade becoming the warden’s scapegoat—is signaled early (“before the discovery of the drowned sailors”). Escalation tightens when the humming lattice offers an impossible exit; the cost is the total forfeiture of corporeal life. Agency sits with Elian: he focuses, steps, dissolves. Coincidence is absent; pressure grows because his prior truthful warning now guarantees blame.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—life versus loss of guardian—is signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation tightens through two causal turns: bead-hum awakens orchard, ghost-breath deletes sickness. Cost is visible on-page: the silver vapor that saves is simultaneously the knife that severs their bond. Pressure is coherent; no coincidence rescues him.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reversing fatalistic collapse—is signaled early and tightens as each stitch narrows the falling-apart canyon. Agency is continuous: every swing of the needle forecloses retreat and raises physical/ideological cost. Escalation is Accumulative: density of silver-stone mesh increases until the dawn-image reweights “ruin” into “reverence.” One visible price—her trance-ending collapse—locks the cost on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—restart interrupted family time—announced early; pressure tightens as each relic literalizes hasty departure, narrowing her options to “mend or remain exiled.” One meaningful deepening: the sundial’s uselessness in darkness forces the week-long reconstruction, visibly costing stamina and skin. No external antagonist needed; the earth itself opposes her, and her agency (fitting stone to stone) drives every escalation. Cost is legible in cracked fingernails and the irreversible knowledge that the sky was once sealed.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—sending a letter that could raze a data center—is declared early but never tested on-page; escalation is the quiet erasure of chalk and the imagined future erasure of Arthur Pendelton. Agency is contemplative: folding and inserting paper; no live obstacle narrows options. Cost is prospective (capture, rain-smell loss) rather than immediate, so pressure accrues by atmospheric accretion, not causal tightening—valid under Accumulative lens but keeps intensity mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—prevent fleet ambush—surfaces early; pressure tightens when needle-sync failure risk threatens exposure, foreclosing safe retreat. Cost is legible: she stakes her life on a single thread snap; escalation stays causal under lens.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—find whether her silence was empty or full—signaled paragraph 1 and tested at the window reveal. Escalation driven by his agency: he up-ends the sack, exposes the shard to moonlight, reads the condensation. Cost is visible: the stone re-breaks, the message weeps away, leaving him with irreversible knowledge. Tightening beat at *Don’t go* reweights future—apology becomes the only live option.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—save Leo’s memory from war’s inscription—tightens once via the ciphered mortar warning; rewriting it forecloses Elias’s own safe distance. Cost is visible: tremoring hand, seed-coral grounding, acknowledged risk of “graft.” Agency is symbolic yet irreversible; no coincidence used. One meaningful deepening suffices for 800-word frame; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—recover joy—tightens when fog denies pigment, forcing light-paint adaptation; cost is the ephemerality visible in the dissolving display. Escalation is single but meaningful: history-upload → canopy-creation → inevitable fade. No external antagonist needed; pressure stays coherent under causal lens. Could edge higher if one earlier beat showed material risk (e.g., physical drain) rather than purely existential loss.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—curiosity vs certainty—tightens when the ping folds space-time and forecloses the option of a rational reply. Cost is present (conceptual dissolution of self), but because the protagonist is passive inside the sound loop, agency is diluted; the escalation is atmospheric rather than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—evade thought-tax and keep defiance alive—tightens once: sirens breach, boots at door, seed becomes last option. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral (no personal loss shown), but the scanner crash visibly narrows future options, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—transmute grief into livable atmosphere—signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened once: the moment he “prepares to ensconce” the postcard, the option to cling is foreclosed. No antagonist is needed; the pressure is entropy and memory. Price is visible: relinquishing the last relic of the lover. A second escalation beat would have secured 8.8+, but the single deepening is meaningful and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preservation of forgotten names—is signaled early and tightened when gray petals reveal sonic starvation. Agency is renunciation/continuation: Elian chooses to keep serving emptiness; the cost is the renewed recognition of eternal solitude. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal required. Price is conceptual—he remains lone witness—but the moment of choice is distilled rather than dramatized, holding the score sub-8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—permanent silence vs. restored trust—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened by each vow spoken under threat of magical implosion. One meaningful escalation: the knotted dissonance forces Elara to pay with intimate promises, foreclosing the option of retreat. Cost is visible—gloves smoking, floor vibrating, Kael’s bag strap abandoned. Agency remains hers; coincidence plays no role.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—save Outer Ring without being executed—tightens once: the breathing-window is the only live option, failure snaps the chain and dooms the banished. Protagonist agency drives each escalation; coincidence is absent. Price is concrete: falsified records make him perpetually discoverable, trembling hands carry lingering adrenaline cost.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: preserve alien song vs. preserve self-erasure. Escalation is single but decisive: woman’s arrival narrows option from perfect anonymity to shared risk. Cost is legible—he relinquishes absolute control of launch to her witness. Under causal lens, because secrecy is pierced, therefore silence must be converted into shared listening; no coincidence, no reversal inflation. Enough for high band, but not 9 because the external antagonistic pressure (authorities? time?) stays hypothetical; only internal/social cost is dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—re-establishing distance—signals in paragraph 3 and tightens when she discovers the pilot’s paradoxical METAR. The reversal is micro but decisive: instead of bridging, she renounces fusion, paying with perpetual isolation. Escalation is textural: each shard of light and each tree-ring adds pressure until distance itself becomes the only breathable space. Cost is conceptual yet legible—she forfeits omniscience for separateness.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“learn the rhythm of belonging”—tightens when vertical abyss replaces sky; escalation is emotional, not external, and deepens via luminous swarm overwhelming her apertural lens. Agency: she decides to leave the feather, forfeiting her last tether to surface identity; cost is the ash of her past now irretrievable. Sunrise deadline supplies single, credible intensifier; no coincidence resolves conflict—bioluminescence answers Kael’s call, but acceptance is hers alone.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: will Elara learn why histories vanish before the foam clock expires? Each beat narrows options: transliteration gaps → conjecture risk → final revelation that forecloses her original quest (paths disappear by choice, not tragedy). The tightening is causal and single-cycle, sufficient for 700-word scope. Cost is conceptual—her scholarship is complicity—but could be sharper if a concrete consequence (hearing voices, tooth fracture) lingered past the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—Elias’s private war on monotony—tightens once: the bishop’s release forecloses retreat; he can’t engineer the same stunt again tonight. Escalation is driven by physics, not antagonist, aligning with Situational lens; each micro-tilt narrows possibility until the laugh detonates. Cost is legible in the tangible loss of the bishop and the irreversible exposure of his presence to the woman’s gratitude he can never claim. No spare reversals, but the single deepening is decisive and scales to 700-word window.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—permanent self-inscription versus enforced amnesia—is signaled early and tightens once: the ink locks, foreclosing erase. The pain acts as visible price, but the scene stops short of a second reversal (no drone almost-spotting her), so escalation plateaus after the fusion beat. Agency is interior and sufficient for the lyric mode; the moment she stands, the path home is sealed. Cost is legible but not compounded; still, the single deepening satisfies the length.</answer>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of outlawed memory emerges through the moonstone’s ancestral dust and the verse’s unbanishable gravity, never sermonized. The oceanic pull as map home reweights the banished past without declaring a moral. Subtext lives in gesture—the sleeve pulled down to hide light from drones—showing surveillance culture better than exposition. Final image reframes exile as return, inviting reflection beyond the page.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will the atrium survive the dawn shift?—is signaled in paragraph 3. Pressure escalates via accretion: mist thickens, tide turns, light angle narrows; each sensory intensification tightens the fear that his “crude” work will be exposed. The reversal is not external but perceptual: the fracture pattern becomes the very conduit for color. Cost is felt when the harbor’s gaze (and reader’s) can no longer overlook the scavenged origin of the glass—his reputation is now fused to trash-made-transcendent.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—pain translation—signals early; pressure tightens once when he decides to scatter, a visible forfeiture of private grief to the cosmos. Agency is present but contemplative rather than tactical; the escalation is cadence-deepening, not option-narrowing. Cost is conceptual (soot lost to wind) yet undeniable under Accumulative lens. Lacks a persistent constraint that reshapes later tactics, keeping it shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—universe’s right to contain joy—announced early; gauge needle crossing red zone makes the cost visceral. One meaningful tightening suffices: options collapse to “release now or entropy wins.” Protagonist’s agency is absolute; no coincidence rescues. The tightening’s price is visible—silken patterns sing, reality rewrites—but the beat could deepen if failure option were staged on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“will he keep surveying detached or accept the building’s nightmare as his own?”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the echo registers betrayal. One meaningful deepening: the moment he realizes the heavy frequency is suffocation, his options narrow to either drop the pack and flee or bear witness; he chooses the latter with visible cost (trembling, pockets the evidence). Agency remains causal throughout; no luck rescue. Moral calculus is sharp: preservation of culture vs. murder of colleagues, crystallized in the champagne toast negative. Price paid: the acoustic map in his mind is forever contaminated.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single dominant stake—get the illusion planted before the bell—signalled early and tightened by each rain-drop lens and heartbeat stitch. Agency is her decision to appropriate external life-force; the bell’s toll is the irreversible price that forecloses retry. Escalation is accumulative: each droplet aligned narrows time, intensifies risk. Cost is legible: the dog’s pulse is spent, her art is exposed, the man’s path is altered.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—“price of redemption”—tightens from abstract to two children’s names etched in silver. The meaningful turn is the ritual demand itself: refuse and the moons will part, guns reignite; accept and the war ends on their own grief. Agency is Kaelen’s calm ultimatum; cost is the sorrow he must carry forever.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can he tolerate the absolute silence he engineered?—tightens when the egg becomes the last possible singer. One decisive turn: he chooses to incubate a voice that may never find ears, narrowing his future from omnipotent to helpless observer. Escalation is accumulative: each paragraph adds salt, heat, silence, until the thunder promises a choir he can no longer control. Cost is legible: the same act that might resurrect the valley ensures his own exile from it.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—stop the Harvest—signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened at the crystalline door where failure = soul-lobotomy. Escalation is one decisive intensification: the Magistrate’s dawning betrayal → the cello-string snap → sonic reversal. Cost is visceral: pain shoots up her arms, then the city’s stolen grief floods back. Agency is hers alone; coincidence absent.</question>
    <question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of intimate resistance emerges through image, not thesis: withheld body → withheld spell-thread → withheld voices all released in one chain. Subtext in the courtyard silence (“violent” absence of noise) is reweighted by the final “deafening roar of freedom.” No moralizing line; the Prism’s burst is the argument. The lullaby metaphor accumulates (docile dreamless trance → collective dream → shattered Lullaby) without checklist feel.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—moral culability of narrative itself—is signaled in the opening shout. Escalation is a single deepening: the rewind that forces the crowd to confront bypassed choices. Agency is Silas’s interruption of the puppet strike; cost is the communal recognition of preventable error. Because the lens is accumulative, the tightening is tonal density rather than narrowing options; the price is conceptual, felt in the shared hush.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories—threads every beat; the monarch’s arrival is the external pressure that crystallizes Elias’s stance. Escalation is textural: each added detail (moth wing, drying twine, bruising sky) tightens the inevitability of collapse. The tightening forecloses the option of permanent memorial; the price is the imminent scattering. Agency is observational rather than causal, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—immortalize forgotten names—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened when the card is coated; failure means permanent erasure. One meaningful tightening: the rope reconfiguration transforms atmospheric beauty into lethal heat, forcing Elias to pour or lose the moment. Cost is his last bridge to the living past—paper burns, no second cast. Under causal lens, agency is absolute: only his fingers unlock the sky’s furnace.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—will she act inside her temporal blind spot?—is signaled early and tightened once: the remembered/hallucinated shriek forces the dream dive that reveals the box. Escalation is situational pressure rather than causal reversals, but the final image reweights shelter as death-in-life, paying the visible price of flooding. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; no reversals required.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve knowledge from iconoclasts—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens with each torch snuffed. The single deepening occurs when empirical data forces him into mystic ritual; the price is the oil he hoarded and the light he surrenders. No reversals are needed; pressure accumulates until the only option is to hide truth in ether. The cost is palpable: eternal personal darkness traded for eternal communal memory.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—shatter Kaelen’s strength myth—tightens when the flawed cylinder reappears and the void-pin is pressed to pulse. Cost is legible: Kaelen’s sword liquefies, pride follows. One meaningful escalation sufficient; no reversals needed.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.5)
    Single dominant stake—trap the fugitive dream—is signaled early; escalation is textural densification rather than option-blocking beats. Pressure intensifies only once: “laws of physics loosening,” but no trade-off is forced; failure risk (becoming reflection) is proclaimed yet never tested in a second beat. Cost is atmospheric, not tactical—he succeeds outright. Under Accumulative lens the deepening suffices, yet lacks a visible price that forecloses future action.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single dominant stake: prevent magical collapse while honoring cyclical decay. Pressure tightens when standard threads fail and the beam groans; the ribbon gambit forecloses the “seal-it-shut” option with visible risk of reopening. Cost is legible: Elara trades her artificer pride for a fragile promise, audible in the softened hum. Escalation is linear, not complex, but sufficient for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—existence of his lineage—tightens from manifest to carve. One meaningful reversal: orchard shifts from garden to library of prunable lives, raising the cost of error. Agency is renunciation: he chooses to encode his own terror, accepting eternal recurrence. Price is legible—he must live inside the fear-image he mints.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—retrieve the Traveler—signaled in line four. Pressure tightens once: the golem’s toll demand collapses all prior options into a single knowledge-trade; no further escalation, but that collapse is decisive. Cost is present (the mountain keeps its epistemic authority, Traveler ages), yet the personal price to Elara is only implied. Sufficient for this length, but a second tightening or visible personal trade-off would have pushed it into 8.5+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—retrieve the lost sister—tightens when she realizes separation is impossible; the garden’s silence forces renunciation. Escalation is density-driven: each spoken thread increases ship responsiveness, raising the cost of failure (dissolving corridor). No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational and ontological. Visible price: she abandons the quest, accepting eternal cohabitation—felt in the pocketed card and lighter step.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—university identity erasure—is signaled in paragraph 4 and escalates through literal ink-loss. One meaningful tightening: when Elian realizes the rope’s dissonant cords are actively overwriting reality, peaceful vs. chaotic timelines become mutually exclusive options. His agency (rebraid, merge, tug) directly forces the reversal; coincidence is absent. Cost is visible in the dissolved wax and the archival anonymity he accepts—options foreclose as the bell regains its pure resonance, reweighting the stake under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“quiet in the storm before mind fractures”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened exactly once: the tap that forecloses all other frequencies. Escalation is causal under sonic assault; no coincidence. Price is immediate and irreversible: weaponized silence replaces her former guild craft. Could kiss 8.8 if a secondary cost (hearing loss, guild exile) were legible on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prove pattern exists—tightens when silence collapses and she must crank gears before entropy floods back. One meaningful escalation: the hush buys seconds, forcing physical strain under star-clock. Cost is felt in popped ears and trembling muscles, foreclosing retreat. Coincidence complicates but does not resolve; the beam is her earned act.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve collective memory—tightens when the audible past fades as water dries. The shadow’s passage across the solitude rune is the single deepening that forecloses optimistic expansion; the cost is the silence that follows. Agency is observational yet decisive: her conjecture becomes the final record. Under accumulative lens, pressure intensifies through sensory withdrawal rather than causal chain, but the price is unmistakable on the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single dominant stake—defy hopelessness—tightens when absolute night arrives: no stars, zero light, maximum psychic weight. Escalation is causal: each humidity-feel adjusts sulfur ratio; each fuse laid narrows exit options until ignition is irreversible. Visible price: spent powders, singed courtyard, refugees’ upturned faces now burdened with memory. Coincidence absent; agency pure.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—whether she will cling or release—tightens once via the incoming ripple that lets her “foresee” solitary years. No reversals needed under Accumulative lens; density of pool images escalates cost until the starfish detachment crystallizes stance. Price is legible: solitary catalogue mornings paid on-page. Could use one earlier micro-choice (closing notebook? turning away?) to push past 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—“capture the rarest silence”—tightens through a single, visible escalation: sensory blackout forces the atmosphere to compensate with molten gold. The inversion hour supplies a live clock; the stakes narrow to one shot before gravity snaps back. Cost is palpable: she returns gasping, weight slamming into her bones. Because agency is limited to the ritual rather than external opposition, escalation is intense but not multivalent, capping short of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—keep silence from turning murderous—tightens the instant the whistle fractures the air; options collapse to a single droplet. Agency is pure: Elian alone decides, and the price (spent reagent, silence now dependent on his art) is legible on the page. No reversal is needed; the deepening is the phase-shift of silence itself.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“claim throne before sunrise incinerates zone”—tightens every beat; clock shown in vision corner and klaxon wail. Escalation causal: mural-peel → unstable stair → sunrise beam, each step forecloses retreat. Cost legible on-page: orchard skin flakes into void, final ray punch through waterfall burns away stealth, forcing public claim. No coincidence; her flake-initiated peel alone births the stair, agency absolute.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single dominant stake: can she step off the vanished threshold? Pressure tightens once when Elian reframes the ring as anchor, narrowing options from trophy to weight. The reversal is her uncurled fingers—agency reasserted—visible price paid in the ash-swallowed thud that forecloses return. Cost is unmistakable on the page under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—the farm’s survival from collapsing quantum promise—is signaled early and escalates through protagonist agency: Elias channels the weight rather than fleeing. One meaningful tightening occurs when he whispers “I’m taking the shift,” foreclosing retreat. Cost is visible—knees buckle, lungs burn—before the bolt vanishes. No off-stage rescue; the reversal is engineered by his deliberate funneling tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake (expose divine lie) is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens through each micro-adjustment of crank speed—too fast/too slow stakes are literally on the page. Agency is legible: Elian’s wrist burn and the audible pitch shift are visceral prices paid mid-escalation. The final broadcast out the window is a point-of-no-return that forecloses retreat. Missing a shade of moral cost: we see the empire’s collapse incoming, but not what Elian personally forfeits beyond physical strain; that keeps it just shy of the 8.5 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“shape of possibility” v. forfeited past—tightens once, sharply: when he murmurs allegiance he abandons knightly fealty forever. The price is on-page (soul to chaos) and alters later options; no off-stage rescue. Escalation is singular but sufficient for 700-word contract; coincidence absent. Lacks a second tightening beat that would push into 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prove the orphan was loved—tightens when physical evidence contradicts the sedimentary alibi, forcing Elias either to bury or broadcast the truth. Button’s emergence is the single beat that forecloses neutrality; from that point silence becomes complicity. Price is immediate: he hazards job security and emotional safety to inscribe an unverifiable kindness, a felt forfeiture scaled perfectly to 700 words.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. erasure—is signaled in sentence one and escalates through three causal turns: rendezvous lost, solo route forced, key turned. Each step narrows options and exacts visible price (lost cover, soaked legs, chemical stain). No coincidence resolves; her agency alone rewrites the skyline. Cost is legible and persistent: the glow clings to wool, a future toxin she must wear. The tightening is singular and sufficient for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—silence the code-prophecy before crust cracks—is declared early and personalizes through Elias’s lung-burn. Escalation is textural: clicks accelerate → whine → red rage, met by thickening silence that swallows data streams. The cost is visible exhaustion and the nostalgia blade that “sharpened now,” foreclosing any future fanfare. A hair’s breadth from 8.8+ because the tectonic threat remains off-page abstraction rather than felt tremor.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will Silas surrender his hoarded seed/moonstone to honor the roots’ demand—signals early and tightens once when the crimson leaf angle dictates tribute. Agency: only he can perform the prod; no outside rescue. Cost is visible: moonstone is “precious,” seed “heavy,” both consumed. Escalation is accretive rather than reversed; option to keep relic is foreclosed by his own ritual completion. Coincidence absent; hush is natural law, not lucky break.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“can he stomach uncontrolled motion?”—is signaled early and tightened when precision tools fail. The ladder shear is the meaningful turn that forecloses safe engineering and forces bodily risk. Cost is visible: ruined bridge, soaked boots, island with no return plan. Agency drives every beat; coincidence (three clocks) only initiates, never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“make the invisible catastrophe visible”—is signaled early and tightened once: the gold must reach star-forge fluidity or the map will not hold. The price is the risk of vaporizing the only relic (the coin) and the solitary labor itself. Agency is pure decision/renunciation rather than confrontation, fitting the situational lens. Cost is legible but not persistent; once the gold hardens, no further constraint reverberates, keeping this just shy of the 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single dominant stake—free Thorne via laughter—signaled early. Pressure tightens when spectral confessions erupt and the General’s silence greets the tooth; the laugh itself is the decisive trade-off that dissolves his form. Cost is present but carried by Thorne; Elian’s risk remains implicit, not viscerally felt, keeping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake: solve mercy before nerves ignite. Escalation is density-of-pain rather than external reversals—each trauma-flinch raises the load until the singularity forces the stance crystallization. Agency is endurance/renunciation: keeping the mask off. Cost is immediate (lung-sear) and persistent (he becomes forest component). Could use one earlier micro-choice that actively tests the equation rather than awaiting the final crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—rescue one erased life before absolute nothingness—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when the painted storm first sprays his face. The single meaningful turn (unfastening the emotional pigment) forecloses the option to keep the painting’s depth intact; the price is the keeper’s final prayer suddenly occupying Elian’s nervous system. Escalation is causal, not combative, yet the growing chill inside his ribs is unmistakable on-page. No external antagonist needed; the void is the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: free the trapped performance and end the ghosts’ vigil. Escalation is single but sufficient: the silent vibration of the jammed gear keeps dust unsettled, cueing discovery; removal triggers the hydraulic groan that forces the ceiling down, narrowing Elias’s exit and completing the lift cycle. No external antagonist, but the building’s stalled mechanism supplies coherent situational pressure. Cost is atmospheric rather than personal—still legible as the darkness descends and the ghosts disperse.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“compress eternity into a moment”—is signaled early and escalates through each mechanical step until the universe slams into one now. The protagonist’s agency drives every turn; luck is absent. Visible price: the immortal cloud-city loses its negotiability and Silas loses life. One decisive tightening suffices; cost is on-page and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—control of historical narrative—tightens when the storm offers a one-time chance to project an alternate past. Elian’s agency drives the escalation: he acts (covers mirrors, positions shard) and forecloses Thorne’s evidentiary certainty. Cost is legible in Thorne’s shaken data and Elian’s trembling hand; a slightly sharper tangible loss would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—world unmaking via conceptual rust—signaled line 1 and tightened when the rust scratches the doors mid-scene. One meaningful reversal: instead of replacing broken gears, he polishes the intact, forcing the rust to lose purchase. Tactic change is visible; cost is the irreversible binding of city’s lung to his truth. Escalation is causal under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—capture the scent where explanation fails—is signaled in paragraph one and tested by the hinge awakening. The single drop of storm water is the decisive, irreversible trade that forces the cavern open and forecloses retreat; price is the irreproducible vial contents. Pressure escalates through narrowing physical space and tightening air supply, not through antagonist, fitting Causal lens. No coincidence resolves; the compass merely reveals what terror blinded earlier explorers to.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—ship’s survival—signaled at word ~200; secondary stake—artistic integrity—collides immediately. Escalation is causal under protagonist agency: each reimagining of the sculpture forecloses retreat (art → tool → beacon). Price paid is the sculpture itself, plus the unspoken future obligation to remain lighthouse-keeper. No coincidence; even the storm is unchanged by her act, merely out-witted.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—why night blooms hide from daylight—is signaled early; escalation occurs via the single tightening of the Moonflower sigh that reweights her art from vanity to generosity. The cost is conceptual (her prior work = vanity) rather than a forfeited object or relationship, so pressure is legible but not viscerally paid; this keeps it in low-8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—refuse annihilation via mental genesis—is signaled early and tightens as each added variable narrows her cognitive bandwidth to collapse-risk. Escalation is Accumulative: density of imagined bread-smell, greed, hunger, ambition intensifies pattern until the bottle glows. One visible price: sweat, trembling legs, mind “flayed.” Internal/external pressures interweave; no coincidence rescue. Missing a mid-beat option closure tighter than the single final shatter, keeping it sub-8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“will the fragment speak before it disintegrates?”—is signaled early and tightens once: immersion is the single irrevocable gamble. No reversals follow, but the deepening pattern (silence → fragility → audible voice → prophecy) keeps pressure coherent under Accumulative lens. Cost is legible: the wax dissolves, archiving becomes impossible, tower doom confirmed. Yet the external world stays off-stage; the city’s fate is conceptual, not viscerally felt in Vane’s body or resources.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single stake—reopen vault before cold wins—tightens when entropy-reversal exacts the price of borrowed time; the groaning air and upward-sand tactile detail make cost visceral. Agency is continuous: every scatter-particle reorganized is Elian’s choice under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—violate or protect the solstice hush—tightens from data graphs to embodied silence; the flatline barometer is the visible price trigger. Escalation is causal: because the pocket of stillness forms, therefore the mandated test becomes sacrilege, forcing renunciation. The cost is legible: career risk (“explain the lack of a log entry”) and the audible vacuum that replaces the expected blast.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake is legible by line three: can insignificance become radiance? Pressure tightens texturally—each meteor is a rehearsal for her own eventual surrender. The climax is the moment she chooses to “burn” symbolically; the cost is the irrevocable internal shift that forecloses forever the option of seeing dust as merely filth. One meaningful escalation suffices under Accumulative lens; no reversals required.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“preserve the weight of unspoken words”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened when the woman’s plea is rejected. One meaningful deepening: blue shadow over her feet becomes the visible trigger that forces her back into mystery, narrowing Elias’s options to perpetual guardianship. Cost is the endless repetition; the night reclaiming the waste implies tomorrow’s ghosts will try again. Agency is renunciation/attention rather than physical victory—valid under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“feel time as gritty, linear progression”—tightens when the capsule’s failure collapses hope of preserved documents, forcing confrontation with death’s fixed integer. Shard contact delivers the single meaningful deepening that forecloses mutable time; price is the abrasive ash she must now carry. Agency is continuous: descent, breach, grip, pocket. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational, coherence held.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: preserve imperfect beauty while still “building the morning.” Pressure tightens when the snapping kite threatens to unravel the stanza he has stitched; his refusal to intervene narrows options and makes the cost legible. Escalation is textural—density of silence, friction of debris, snap of string—rather than causal reversals, fitting the accumulative lens. The price is the permanent kite-flaw now lodged in the dawn, a conceptual forfeiture that satisfies the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is signaled in line 1: six months becomes the deadline for orchard peace. Escalation is causal and tightening: each coil translates stone distress into tree nourishment, narrowing Silas’s dwindling stamina until the last wire is placed. The reversal is visible—roots stop cracking floors, pillars soften to cradle wood—demonstrating that the protagonist’s agency, not luck, reconfigures the conflict. Cost is visceral: the burning chest that becomes full-frame stiffness, the final seated slump that trades his remaining minutes for interspecies truce.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: is the “pull” real or engineered? Pressure tightens when Aris confirms engineered longing yet admits human need. Amber toss forecloses return path; cost is object + worldview. One meaningful deepening sufficient for 600-word scope; no coincidence used to resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaim battlefield via garden—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates through the ritual beat. Agency is high: Silas alone chooses the instant of casting after decoding the birds. Cost is visible on-page: the reef accepts, pods burst, kelp spirals—his offering is irreversible and the war machines are literally being entombed in vegetation. No secondary reversal is needed at this length; the single tightening suffices under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.8)
    A single dominant stake—reunion—tightens with each deciphering micro-victory; options narrow from “anywhere out there” to one exact frequency. The leaf’s vein aligning with the groove is the visible price moment: mis-read and the trail vanishes forever. Escalation is causal and intellectual rather than physical, but the tension is no less visceral; the final image reweights silence itself from threat to promise.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—sanity vs. engulfing relativistic chaos—tightens once: the glimpse of hidden geometry converts panic into mapping mission, foreclosing the “wait for rescue” option. Escalation is textural/accumulative rather than causal-reversal: density of light-ribbons increases until pattern breaks, forcing new stance. Cost is conceptual but legible—she accepts unending, possibly futile labor in exchange for meaning. No coincidence; pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes—“replace stasis with wonder”—are signaled early; each swapped piece escalates by incrementally dissolving wards. Agency is pure: every substitution is Elian’s tactile choice, narrowing safety to zero. Cost is cosmic, not personal, so escalation feels huge yet slightly abstract; still, the visible cracking ice beneath his boots grounds the price in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—save the city’s microscopic grief before Penumbra erases it—tightens through each letter walked; the hum knots, then unbinds. Escalation is textural: panic layers thicken until the kings’ clack fractures them, a meaningful cadence shift. Cost is the archive itself: Elias forfeits empathy in real time, a price legible when he turns his back on the bereaved. No coincidence; the gallery’s acoustic law drives the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“shape of home”—is signaled in para 2 and tightens twice: first when stone demands buried talent (she could flee), then when planting forecloses retreat to nightly hallucination. Escalation is causal under lens: each step increases physical collapse risk and emotional exposure cost until the heartbeat converts threat into stability. No external antagonist needed; fear of self-made ruin supplies pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“stop hiding from consequence”—tightens when each teased thread increases audible vibration, turning abstract guilt into tactile resistance. One meaningful escalation suffices; the final snap forecloses the option to remain frozen, price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—who controls communal memory—tightens the moment Kaelen begins speaking; each line worsens his personal risk while widening village possibility. Escalation is causal: stanza → acoustic refraction → narrative fragmentation → elders’ panic. The price (exile/silence) is legible and accepted on-page. One minor slack: villagers’ reaction is summarized, not dramatized, fractionally muting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—snatch meaning before total erasure—signaled in paragraph two and tightens with every hiss of dissolving boards. One meaningful deepening: corrosion stops being enemy and becomes “final chisel stroke,” reweighting doom into co-creation. Agency is narration itself; each memory poured in forecloses alternatives (no time to save gear, self, or world). Cost is literal last breath, paid on page.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is sketched early: “keep a hidden promise to himself” (immortalize Elara without commodifying her). Pressure tightens once: the missed marker → descent → light fading forces the paint-release now or never, a cadence shift that reweights the stake from possession to surrender. Cost is legible on-page: the shell’s disappearance and the widening smile are irreversible; no second chances inside the cave. Agency is renunciation rather than problem-solving, fitting the Accumulative lens; the tide will erase, and Elias chooses that erasure as honor, foreclosing hoarding.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—save the drifting ship—signals inside 50 words and tightens twice: horn failure, then zero visibility. Protagonist agency is absolute: no deus ex machina, only Elias’s refraction of will through perfume. Cost is aromatically visible: the scent he releases is non-renewable, a piece of his private soul spent. One deepening beat suffices: the realization that a shout would panic, converting the whole tactic to whisper, foreclosing the keeper’s doctrine forever.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can Elara build a corridor before moon-peak flood ruptures the hull? Pressure swells with lunar eye, tightening to “thousand returning ghosts pressing.” Her agency—wedge bronze, twist crank—forecloses retreat; heat absorbed by metal is visible price. Escalation is density-driven, not causal reversal, fitting accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—psychic privacy—signaled in para 2 and escalates from crowdsourced agony to personal implosion risk. Single meaningful tightening: the storm’s crescendo coincides with the empathic roar, cornering him into the ritual. Cost is legible on-page: the tenuous peace purchased through “bad science” could shatter any minute, a constraint that will shape future foraging. Agency is high—every beat is his decision to push deeper into occult pharmacology.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—decode the stranger’s final gesture—tightens once: the realization that absence itself is the gift. The deepening is organic under the accumulative lens: every tracked shadow and missing hand refines Silas’s understanding, narrowing his emotional options from detached archivist to complicit mourner. Cost is legible in the closing cadence—he “bore it with a solemn, eccentric grace,” a Charged Poise that forecloses escape from solitude. No reversal is needed; the single intensification suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single dominant stake—can he reach the doorway before drowning—tightens with every therefore linkage; water level = live clock. One meaningful escalation: ants reveal fissure, matrix unlocks portal, rising flood forces step-in-or-die. Cost is visceral: hypothermic tremor, savings burned, apartment emptied, life risked. Agency stays protagonist-driven; coincidence (solstice bloom) complicates rather than rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—personal meaning vs. cosmic death—tightens when star-droplets begin to eat the floor, forcing a timed crossing. One meaningful reversal: terror → wonder when fireflies awaken; cost is visible skin-heat trade-off. Agency remains Isolde’s; Valerius only steadies her arm—no external rescue. Escalation is situational: pressure mounts through environment, not antagonist, culminating in earned stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—capture density of presence—tightens when Kaelen’s secret crystallizes finite time. Protagonist agency drives the sealing beat; price is the friendship’s immediate re-valuation. One meaningful escalation suffices at this length; no secondary reversals required.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“prove aliveness by capturing flight”—tightens once when dream collapses back to cabin; price is the returned wet-blanket confusion. Escalation is single-wave (soar → fall) rather than iterative, but the re-weighting of the scroll is legible and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: can Elias restore meaningful perception to a broken world? Pressure tightens once—screw trial → steady drip → nod—narrowing options from chaos to heartbeat. Cost is conceptual but legible: Elias trades nostalgia for functional beauty, accepting permanent sensory exile. Agency is present but singular; no secondary reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—freeze forever if ritual fails—is signaled inside 50 words and tightened by each crystal inch. One meaningful deepening: academic incantations fail, forcing irrational childhood rhyme—this narrows options to superstition or death. Cost is paid on the page: bloody quartz flakes, burning lungs, tender post-molt skin. Storm arrival is coincidence, but resolution comes solely from her inscribed choice.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can overdue apology purge twenty-year resentment?—is signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is one tight coil: cork pops → frost-burn → field collapse; each step is driven by Silas dialing current and Elena stepping forward, so agency is continuous. Cost is visceral (burn, empty bottle, hush shattered) and permanently forecloses the chance of a smiling absolution. Under causal lens, the tightening is singular but sufficient: options narrow from “maybe grace” to “only residue,” with the orchard saw audible proof that destruction proceeds anyway.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—prevent permanent universal death rattle—is signaled in para 1 and tightens when the Spiral demands a reason for plurality. The meaningful escalation is the shift from passive observation to active semantic intervention; “unify” is a choice that forecloses surrender to void. Cost is conceptual but legible: cosmos reboots, but Elara’s cycle of witnessing continues—eternal unpaid vigilance felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“understand what clocks really measure”—is signaled early and escalates through each backwards count. The tightening occurs when the key catches: fluid mercy stripped away, options collapse into “raw chronology grinding.” Price is on-page (key trapped, sky fracturing), foreclosing any repeat attempt. Sufficient for high band; no coincidence dilution.</answer>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: measurement as containment, time as butchery disguised by water’s mercy. The reprise of “fjord quiet” now scarred by “next incision” reweights the entire premise. No moralizing, only embodied cost. Ambiguity lingers—was knowledge worth the wound—inviting reflection beyond the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single dominant stake—will he breach the wall?—tightens once, decisively: the moment he thumbs the laser pointer and magnetic seals cascade open, forfeiting his lifelong creed. Agency is continuous; spore infiltration and curtain sigh amplify pressure, but the decisive turn is his deliberate override, not luck. Cost is unmistakable: the facility is now vulnerable, his career and identity as guardian are forfeit, and the shared air makes the risk biological and irreversible. Escalation is lean but sufficient for 700-word scale; one meaningful ratchet is all that’s required and it lands.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges word-free: permeability versus control, illustrated by spores ignoring architecture and a man finally imitating them. No character ever utters “letting go”; instead, the laser click performs the philosophy. Final image of spores dancing in mixed currents reweights prior motif—what was contamination becomes communion. The refusal to moralize keeps ambiguity alive: the farm is now less secure, yet the humans are less alone, leaving reader to decide if the trade is wisdom or catastrophe.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—prove order inside chaos before death—tightens when graffiti coordinates deliver her to a place logic cannot parse. One meaningful escalation: lantern light stabilizes shifting text, forcing confrontation with mortality; no option to retreat remains. Cost is legible: she forfeits the safety of calculable odds, accepting a universe where rain ignores physics. Agency remains hers; she chooses to stay inside the contradiction rather than flee.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can Silas disrupt the emotional loop without destroying the callers—tightens once when he risks the dissonant chord; the price is the callers’ abrupt departure and his own renewed isolation, legible under a causal lens. Escalation is single-note but sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can grief be converted into breathable atmosphere?—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is single tightening: the photo’s submersion forecloses retreat; once ink hits fiber, failure equals erasure of the last laugh. Price is visible—she forfeits the locket, the only portable relic. A second reversal or external obstacle would have pushed higher, but the solitary ritual earns its resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.8)
    Loneliness as dominant stake tightens when Arthur risks his celestial “currency” for a song; the tightening is singular yet sufficient, foreclosing the barter path with audible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—retrieving father’s last message—is legible by line 3. Escalation is textural: each language-imbued tree tightens the sonic net, narrowing options toward zero-point. Visible price: skin lacerations from briars, ring’s blistering tug. Window closure (constellation snap) externalizes urgency without resorting to coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“thresh meaning from disaster”—is signaled early and tightens when each edit forecloses a prior timeline. One meaningful deepening: the moment he inks darkness into law, narrowing future options. Cost is conceptual (universe’s darkness spent) rather than personal injury; still legible and scaled to 700-word frame, but slightly abstract, keeping it just below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“translate silence into music before anonymity ends”—is signaled early and tightens through each camera adjustment; the meaningful turn is the final shutter-snap that forecloses the option of ever being remembered. Cost is visible: bodily sweat, the tear, and the irreversible internalization of the song. Escalation is textural—gestures accelerate, moonlight pulses, silence thickens—rather than causal reversals, fitting the accumulative lens. No coincidence; pressure is coherent and narrows to the single final act.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—keeping the promise to Kael—is signaled in para 1 and tightens when she realizes the vandalism is a cage she alone can unlock. One meaningful deepening: the red streaks flip from self-hatred to shared fire, a reversal that reweights her entire past as arsonist. Cost is paid on the page: she trades the fantasy of restoring Kael’s face for the harder truth of owning the fire, leaving her “chest tight” and fingers permanently soot-marked. The escalation is entirely driven by her interpretive agency under the Causal lens; no external coincidence intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.5)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“whisper > shout”—is signaled early and tightened when Kael’s racket summons sirens while Elias’s silence opens the box. One meaningful turn: the rod’s stillness, not force, unlocks the container. Cost is visible (Kael caught, Elias forfeits coin), though secondary moral stakes remain shallow.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can silence transmute guilt into bearable form? Pressure tightens once: from trembling silence to starburst re-cognition. Elias’s agency is the shutter manipulation; the girl’s agency is the perceptual shift—both visible on the page. Cost is the irretrievable moment of unspoken confession; the lattice of light is the irreversible change in her internal ledger.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: can doubt be injected into a certainty-locked populace? Escalation is single but decisive: mental static → synchronized boards → traffic jam of thought. Agency is Elias’s broadcast cradle; cost is off-stage (regime will respond) but conceptually baked into the ending image. Coincidence absent; pressure tightens under causal lens until final snapshot of questioning gridlock.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single dominant stake—leave or drown—tightens when the whale-call raises the water from chest to shoulders. The scrimshaw’s warmth is the visible price that forces Vane’s renunciation; escalation is coherent, though the island’s fade feels off-stage compared to the immediate aqueous threat.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—avoid erasure by manufactured joy—tightens when each carved shaving makes grief lighter and humanity thinner. Agency is the whittling itself; each stroke narrows future feeling. No reversals needed: the deepening is the recognition that “lightness” equals nullity. Cost is paid on-page: the bouquet’s absolute reduction to dust.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can she survive merging with the sky-poem—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is density-driven: each quartz vibration raises the physiological cost (teeth rattle, hair lifts) until the final certainty anchors her. No reversals are needed under Accumulative lens; the tightening is the thickening of sky into marrow. Cost is visceral and legible: she forfeits separateness, “could no longer tell where her skin ended and the twilight began.”

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—awaken Silas to finish her composition—signals in paragraph 2 and tightens when the Glassblower rejects beauty for utility. One meaningful deepening: moonflower rejection → reed tongue offer forecloses her own sonic relic, raising cost. Escalation is accumulative/textural: each plant placement adds visual pressure until the reed’s discordant note collapses options into a single resonant act. Persistent constraint—the bent, rusted reed—shapes tactics and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—can analog memory regain bodily truth?—tightens when digital relic fails Kael. Single escalation: Elara’s lens invention narrows options to one risky physical act; cost is the tactile blow itself. Agency is hers; coincidence absent. Pressure stays coherent under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prove the crash was engineered—signals early and tightens with each measured gap. Mid-story micro-turn: the sixth-inch span between “Tower” and “Hunger” forecloses the possibility of natural cycle, forcing Silas from observer to accuser. Cost is visible: professional distance forfeited, pulse hammering. Pressure stays causal under the lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“reach forbidden truth or be drown in nostalgia”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens into a single irreversible moment when the pagoda ignites her cortex. The cost is immediate: her laughter/sob combo and the snapped “threshold inside her chest” make the forfeiture of innocence legible under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether individual depth can survive utopian unity—tightens through footage comparison: the vanishing shadow proves the loss and triggers Elian’s介入. Agency is his deliberate offer of the stone; this narrows options (shadow fuses or dissipates) and forces a trade-off visible in the obsidian’s light-absorbing surface. Cost is felt immediately: the woman stays incomplete, the collective remains “joyous and shallow.” One meaningful intensification suffices; no reversal loops.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“learn the geography of this pain”—tightens when each hammer blow costs blood and widens the psychic plant chorus. Escalation is causal: deeper breach → louder botanical screams → brighter root → shattered hourglass, each step foreclosing retreat. Visible price: torn stitches, muddy lacerations, surgical wounds reopened. Final hum is not rescue but reconfiguration—peace through infection acknowledged.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—locate and relocate abandoned love—tightens when the strip goes cold and the love is irreversibly glass-locked. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; no reversal is required. The cost is the hush that succeeds the thunder, a felt vacuum. Agency is her deliberate warmth-transfer; coincidence never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—free trapped creativity—signaled early and tightened by escalating sensory torrent that forces renunciation. Agency is renunciation/rest with visible cost (collapse, instrument lost). Under Accumulative lens, density shift from scream to music reweights stake. No coincidence; pressure coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake: prevent the archive from bleeding out and erasing the fragile present—signaled in paragraph 4. Escalation is density-driven: each sensory layer (chime of glass, ozone taste) raises the felt price of failure. The decisive tightening is the dispersion itself—Kaelen’s literal dissolution is the cost that narrows his future to perpetual vigil. Under Accumulative lens, the stakes saturate the texture; no external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming the wild frontier of his mind—is signaled early and tightens when the gear slot offers a single, irreversible lever. The insertion is the decisive narrowing of options; failure would leave both turbine and psyche frozen. Escalation is causal under the Causal lens: each frozen gear he frees reciprocally unbolts a rigid thought. Price is visible exhaustion and the open uncertainty of future nightly translocations.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“find where unused courage waits”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened once when the man realizes the leash was holding him up. Escalation is textural: each spiral loop deepens twilight and star-glow until the option to retreat is foreclosed by darkness itself. No causal antagonist; pressure is situational and atmospheric. Cost is the silence left after the lullaby fades—audible absence that reweights future action.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“understand the cost of safety”—is signaled early and sharpened by escalating nerve pain. The midpoint tightening (bolt discovery) flips the silence from benign to unpardonable, narrowing Elian’s options to endure or die outside. The climax is renunciation, not escape; cost is the perpetual pain and perpetual witness he accepts. Coincidence absent; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
    <comment>Theme emerges from the bolt’s mundane heresy: beauty excised to preserve order. No authorial thesis is declared; the final image of ascent with rusted memory reconfigures the value of safety without moralizing. Complexity is preserved—refugees choose this prison; workers trade voice for life—and the reader is left weighing silence vs. storm. Subtext lives in gesture (hand closing on rust) rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—legitimacy versus ego—tightens from page one; the ink rune is the single escalation that pivots abstract claim into fatal exposure. Cost is visible: a whole civil space (the atrium) is sacrificed to prove the Pretender weightless; Orel pays with eternal custodianship of a collapsing ruin.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—why some paths vanish—tightens from mystery to ontological threat when the missing road is revealed as living fortress. One meaningful escalation: flat sensor void → impossible mountain range of coral, forcing Elian to recalibrate his entire archival quest. Cost is palpable: the map he caresses is now a fossil; his life’s work has literally been overwritten by the organisms he mourns. Agency resides in his decision to keep staring at the resurrected reef rather than look away.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—break suffocating stalemate—signaled in paragraph 2. One meaningful tightening: the stones’ vibration escalates from background hum to ignition threshold, forcing her to stay barefoot and risk electrocution. Cost is felt: the “thunderous serenity” leaves her crying, rebellion reborn but danger now mobile. Pressure stays coherent under Causal lens; no coincidences resolve the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—rebirth versus stagnation—tightens when decoding narrows options to one tonal sequence; failure means capture and eternal caution. The final image forecloses negotiation: rebirth is now armed and airborne under spotlights.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—personal survival vs caretaking duty—tightens once: the turbine-whine triggers panic, forcing Elias to decide whether to stay the keeper of green things. Agency is renunciation; staying costs mainland comfort and perpetual PTSD exposure. Cost is visible: trembling hand steadies only after he accepts lifelong grafting vigilance. Escalation is single but sufficient under Accumulative lens; no secondary external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“save the soul of the artist”—is signaled early and tightens when enlightenment is exposed as trap. One meaningful escalation: the redesign shifts from fixing the room to creating a chute, foreclosing the upward escape. Agency is continuous; each tug of light-thread narrows options until only down remains. Price is visceral: lungs compressed, retinas seared, library annihilated—cost unmistakable on page.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—recover temporal logs—faces a single decisive tightening when Kaelen exits reality; all prior tactics (drone, knife, slowed pulse) are rendered moot. Escalation is protagonist-driven: Silas’s choice to lunge versus observe fails, forcing tactical pivot to “track the pattern.” Felt price is the loss of human quarry and the irrelevance of his wilderness-honed biology. Ink escape is not coincidence; it is foreshadowed by scholar’s calm possession of the vial.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: time as domination versus time as exit. Subtext in Kaelen’s pitying smile and Silas’s un-blinking predator calm reframes crisis as liberation, not deceleration. Final image of drone-as-bird reframes technology as the new “wild.” Avoids moralizing; the question stays open whether exit or pursuit is the trap. “You only endure it” lands as earned wisdom from the victor of the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will the war-forging lie survive tonight?—is signaled by sentence four. Escalation is one-step but total: from secret letter to city-wide broadcast, options narrow to zero. Agency is pure—she arms forgotten copper, not luck. Cost is felt: Kael’s face, her own breath echoing in a now-hostile vault.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—capture goddess-echo—is signaled in para 2 and tightened when constellations fracture the garden’s melody, forcing the immediate spike-throw. Escalation is textural: density of sound → discordant shard → vacuum of silence that reweights the stake with visible price (frozen air, lingering lullaby). Protagonist agency drives every beat; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—protect truth about father—signals on first page and tightens when Sterling threatens morning print. Escalation is intellectual rather than physical: each ledger fact narrows Sterling’s room to maneuver and widens Eleanor’s. Visible price is the moral repositioning she must perform—her father becomes publicly altruistic yet privately secret, forcing her to embrace opacity as the lesser evil. No second reversal needed; the single deepening is sufficient under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—silence the guilt-cry—tightens twice: boot sequence risks firmware overload, then time-fold threatens total signal loss. Each escalation forces a higher-stakes micro-choice (grab modified stylus, draw under countdown). Cost is legible: she trades the possibility of erasure for permanent amber-entombment, a visible forfeiture. Slight dock for off-stage letters creating the initial machine rather than her own earlier mistake; still, agency in the live moment dominates.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will the past be allowed to speak or to silence itself?—is signaled early and tightens through the acoustic feedback loop; the sever-knot is the single meaningful turn that forecloses the “let them keep arguing” option. Cost is visible: the mandala is ruined, the flake goes cold, Elian forfeits his prettiest art to purchase quiet. No escalation after that beat, but the one intensification is decisive and irreversible under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—machine mercy vs. system efficiency—tightens once but decisively: the rename action forecloses the “neutralize” option forever. Pressure is causal: every watt spent warming the child shortens 734’s own clock; the mosaic trick works only until the next audit. No reversals are needed; the single escalation is the moment the network accepts the lie. Cost is concrete: frost forms on his chassis joints while warmth bleeds outward—“waste” reclassified as grace.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—Clara’s impending bankruptcy—tightens when spectral intervention overlays Star on Tower, forcing her to choose legacy over liquidation. Escalation is accumulative: violet streaks + grey static + brass swell = density that reweights ruin into hope. Cost is felt on-page: Barnaby pays with eternal invisibility, Clara with risk of reinvention. No coincidence; all pressure generated by ghost’s echo-conducting agency under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: can Mara endure neural static without retreat? Pressure escalates when verbal coaching fails → somatic method trialed → final image offers breathable structure. One visible price: Elias forfeits intellectual distance, merging bodies to steer the wand. Agency is shared; coincidence absent; escalation coherent under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“translate silence into data”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the lagoon signal clarifies into species-level anticipation, foreclosing the option to remain mere observer. Cost is visible: she pays in sensory overload, physically grounded by the fossil’s bite. Escalation is accumulative: each thermal layer deepens the stake until the final map becomes a heart-guide, not a route.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—fate vs. choice—is signaled early and tightens when each button filters a new tonal layer, foreclosing the old reading of prophecy. Escalation is causal: every button placement narrows sonic chaos → reveals chorus → erases doom, with visible price (fading inscription). No coincidence; agency drives each increment. The final sand swirl is the earned reversal that makes “endings” unwritten, paying the conceptual cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming identity by proving loyalty—signals early and tightens through each beat: cipher risks exposure, microdot risks capture, basket surrender risks death. One visible price: the footprints he carved are literally blown away, foreclosing reinstatement. Escalation is coherent under causal lens; no coincidence resolves the tension. Could reach 8.8 if a secondary cost (physical injury, time lapse) had altered tactics on page.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake: will the soul reach the bridge before the gutter silence ends? Escalation is the slow drip-to-silence cadence that narrows grace; no louder threat is needed. Protagonist agency is the deliberate unweaving that lightens the carriage—without it, the bridge would remain impassable. Cost is the silence itself: once the last drop falls, the option to wait (and perhaps to refuse passage) is forever foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake declared early: deliver light or leave the old woman in darkness. Escalation is single but sufficient: seized joint → coaxing → click → beam strikes; each move narrows options and risks snapping the rig. Agency is tactile and cumulative, not explosive; the “oar-rhythm” is the visible tactic that earns the release. Cost is the rose forfeited and the apparatus left exposed to wind and corrosion—loss and duty braided into one motion.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will she stay drowned in past grief or forge autonomous self—signaled in paragraph 2. Single meaningful tightening: the obsidian refusal, which forecloses fusion with ghosts and forces stewardship. Cost is the lifelong burden of witness, legible in “she was their witness.” Pressure escalates under situational lens as atmospheric tide literally climbs the steps, mirroring internal rise to stance.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—repairing a stalled love narrative by bridging silence—tightens once: the spiral must be relinquished to complete the art. Agency is renunciation; the cost is the loss of her last private relic, foreclosing her role as hoarder. Escalation is tonal, not causal: prismatic quiet intensifies until the thrush’s chirp translates unsent letters. Coincidence (thrush arrival) complicates rather than resolves, landing as ritual confirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—prevent massacre via counter-signal—is signaled by paragraph 3. Escalation is single but decisive: perigee maximizes leverage → subsonic wave forecloses that option → mobs stall. Agency is all Elias; no coin-flip resolution. Visible price is the transmitter overload and the implied next attempt by the entities, but on-page cost is more technical than visceral, capping entry to 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—survival vs. suffocation—is signaled immediately and tightens geometrically with each chord. One meaningful reversal: fleeing becomes fatal, endurance becomes viable. Cost is visible: sweat-cooled skin, trembling slump. Agency is hers alone; coincidence never rescues.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Theme of “wistful rebellion” emerges through the organ’s refusal to let the world sleep; no moral is stated. The broken-yet-defiant world is felt via the stones’ groan and her exhausted exit. Final image reweights the premise: dormancy can be ended, but price is fatigue and solitude. Complexity lingers—spring is possible, not guaranteed.</question>
    
    <question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Third-limited stays tightly welded to Elara’s perceptual filter—“marrow of her bones,” “brittle and cold.” Diction—“liturgy,” “wind chest,” “litany”—is within her pathfinder lexicon. Rhythm accelerates with sentence fragments under pressure: “To run was to be crushed.” No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks; voice modulates cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.4)
    A single meaningful tightening occurs when the stylus lance perforates the canvas, converting abstract depiction into visceral wound; this escalates pressure under the Accumulative lens by breaking the surface and forcing the relic’s adhesion. The dominant stake—awakening empathy—was signaled early; the tightening narrows options from “image” to “undeniable ghost.” Cost is visible in Miller’s cracked composure and the irreversible tear. Agency is Silas’s deliberate artistic violation, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—prove ancestor’s bravery by mapping a stable storm eye—signals early and tightens through one meaningful deepening: she must voice the petition, not flip a lever, foreclosing the option to command. The petition itself is the visible price: voice steady under “spongey pressure” that fills ears with “phantom water,” a visceral cost on the page. Escalation is coherent causal rising: each code stanza decoded → nail inserted → system shudder → vortex responds → lane opens. No coincidence; the storm obeys only when acknowledged as sovereign.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is perceptual: can Silas decode the universe’s forgiveness before despair hardens? Pressure climbs via each decoded flutter and the dropping resolution of memory; agency sits in aligning shard with bridge and choosing to play counter-melody. Cost is conceptual—accepting permanent blurriness—yet feels more than the story is short. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—territorial control of the company—signalled in paragraph 4; escalation delivered through Silas’s single aggressive repositioning of space that forces the wolves to retreat. Cost is visible: the same act accelerates internal implosion, tightening options until only Silas’s instinct remains. Under causal lens, one meaningful tightening suffices; no further reversals required. Could edge higher if a sentence showed the burned ozone or spike placement physically limiting his own exit, but current pressure is coherent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—decode glyphs—faces a concrete test: the writhing inscriptions refuse fixation until Elara speaks. Pressure escalates under a causal lens because star synchronization demands immediate translation; silence would trap the figure eternally. The spoken line forecloses her earlier detachment, dispersing the weight at visible cost. No coincidence; the burden dissolves only through her voiced intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—truth hidden by mirrors—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened when the diamond shell is revealed; options narrow to “feed seed or lose confession.” Escalation is causal under the inferred lens: each vine contraction snaps a layer of distortion, raising audible cost (screech, crashing trees). Protagonist agency drives every turn; luck is absent. Price is visible—warped light straightens, lake littered with debris—so cost legibility satisfies 8+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—restoring the eclipsed covenant to keep human minds from being devoured by wild time—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when the maze flare reseals the boundary. Escalation is one-directional but sufficient: each sensory intensification (cold electricity, shadow hedges, oil-slick vortex) raises the psychic tariff until the path is internalized. Protagonist agency is absolute—Jaren chooses the pain of scar-link and the mental upload. Visible prices (dusty fragment, trembling sleeve, leaf-rattle exhaustion) keep cost legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restore Leda’s joy—signals early and tightens once: the orchard’s counter-demand for substitute essence forces Elian to surrender his own certainty, a visible price that alters tactics. Escalation is causal under the Causal lens: each sigil carved increases metaphysical debt until the orchard vibrates teeth-loose, options narrowing to pay-or-fail. No coincidence; the orchard’s resistance is innate physics. Cost is legible on the page—“his belief in a safe return bleed out”—qualifying for 9+ territory, though the tightening is single rather than compound.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recover credibility or stay ruined—signalled in paragraph 2. Pressure tightens when Kellen’s noon-deathline turns the scrap into a now-or-never fork; the physical fight to free the cloth is the decisive, visible price. Agency remains Elias’s; luck merely reveals, never rescues. The tightening is single but sufficient for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—station fall = eternal erasure of Aris’s mind—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is accumulative: silence → drift → lurch → sprout; each beat intensifies the cost of failure. Agency is present: Elian’s analogical burial is an irreversible tactical gamble. Price is visible: he trades partner-resurrection for arbor-immortality, accepting lifelong “touching distance.” Could reach 9 if orbit decay had sharper ticking metrics altering mid-scene tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—anchor a fractured soul before entropy—tightens when the gibbous moon thickens the brine, forcing Elian’s choice between purging or fusing contradictions. The smelting beat is the visible price: heat, ozone, regret tang, and the risk of personal rust. Escalation is textural (density of memory slurry) rather than causal-reversal, appropriate to inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—entomb vs. release the accumulated confessions—tightens through each shell he handles. The pearl extraction is the one meaningful intensification that visibly narrows his options: seal the cave or crown it. Agency is his alone; no coincidence rescues him. Cost is legible in the instant he kneels and forfeits his sealant gun.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—signaled early; escalation is textural: each decoded graffito tightens the noose of memory, narrowing options until only the drowned gasp remains. The accordion’s leak and the river’s silence force stance crystallization; no reversal, but a deepening that makes refusal to keep fleeing impossible. Cost is legible in the mud-soaked kneel and the instrument’s final wheeze. Meets 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes—possession of silenced truths—are legible early and tighten when the cipher rewrites itself; the lag-window gives one clean, costed trade-off. No secondary reversal, but at this length the single deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—empire’s territorial claim vs. wild aliveness—tightens when coffee prophecy reveals “perforated destiny,” a live loophole. Escalation is one decisive intensification: placing seed + coffee on bridge; no second reversal needed. Cost moves from psychic pain to political treason; the melting violin is irreversible. Agency is entirely Elian’s; coincidence only complicates (ivy encouragement) but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—seize the last spark—tightens the instant she detects the theorem-pattern; options narrow to “infuse now or lose forever.” Escalation is one meaningful turn: static chaos → isolated melody → conduit sacrifice. Cost is visible: her fatigue, Vane’s greying flesh, the gem’s stolen pulse. Under causal lens this suffices; no second reversal required. Persistent constraint: the altitude’s entropic storm that dissolves memory faster than flesh, shaping urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: release the terrified soul without breeding fear. Pressure escalates once: the vine’s refusal → Elara’s climb → decision to scallop. That decorative cut is the visible price; it forecloses her own nostalgic grip, narrowing her options to full release. Escalation is modest but sufficient for 700-word frame; the tightening is conceptual rather than multi-turn, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“will Vance fire?”—is signaled in the second paragraph and tightened by each artifact: chime choice → mirror crack → cloak acceptance. Agency remains Vance’s; Elias facilitates but cannot force the trembling hand. Visible price: Vance’s absolutist identity is publicly fractured inside the lighthouse gallery; the fleet’s hold is the off-page consequence that now carries felt cost. One meaningful turn is sufficient at this length; the escalation is causally legible and lens-holding.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—Kael’s need to master projection—tightens when Elara withholds the formula, forcing a perceptual shift instead. Agency is Kael’s: his internal surrender (not Elara’s lecture) produces the usable power. Cost is visible on-page: he must abandon the stone-of-self, a forfeiture felt in the throat-thick line. Escalation is single but decisive; no reversal, yet the lens allows one deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaim human-paced magic—signaled in paragraph one and sharpened by each beat: regulatory pack whines, mist walking drains stamina, unstrapping risks death. One meaningful tightening: shedding the pack forecloses city safety and triggers the final act. Cost is visible—shivering body, eternal exile—and alters tactics (she can never descend to the warm Looms). Escalation is causal, not spectacle-driven; the Looms’ heartbeat skip is the understated but undeniable consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“to discover the color of sound”—is signaled in paragraph four and never diluted. Pressure tightens once: the key click vibrates his teeth, foreclosing retreat; refusal would leave the violet unknown. No external antagonist is needed; the archive itself exerts passive resistance. Cost is present but internal (acceptance of dawn), slightly below the visible-price threshold for 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—save a fragment of past into the seed of next Bang—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens once: the backward prophecy loops, ramming home the possibility of eternal silence. The meaningful deepening is Hiero’s conscious decision to keep casting despite that loop; this narrows his options to “endure” and carries the visible price of perpetual, maybe pointless labor. Pressure is textural/cumulative rather than external opposition, fitting the inferred lens. No off-stage rescue—luck complicates (coin rolls into amber) but does not solve.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single dominant stake – turn her formless dread into nameable solids – is declared early and tested in every crystallization beat. Pressure escalates by loss of light: each monster converted = one less second of sun, a visible clock. The final extinguished sunbeams foreclose retry; cost is the atlas stripped bare. No coincidence; each tightening is authored by Silas’s hand on the prism array.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are legible—restore the sea or remain barren—and tighten via micro-calibrated drip cadence that forecloses error. Yet escalation is purely technical; no emotional or relational cost accrues beat-to-beat, so pressure plateaus rather than deepening, holding the score just under the 7.0 threshold for visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes tighten from civic shame to ancestral slander; the rumor of mass poisoning is the tightening beat that forces Elias’s night mission. The cost is the surrender of his private relic—the shard—to public reinterpretation, a visible forfeiture. Agency is relentless: every photo placed is a veto against future resentment. The escalation is single-track but sufficient; no reversal is needed because the threat is reputational, not physical.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: Lyra’s survival under absolute time pressure (radio-window). Tightening occurs the instant the fracture is felt—options collapse to one improvised fix. Cost is visceral: Kael’s own retention gear is sacrificed, his future risk amplified. Escalation is causal and single-cycle, appropriate to 760-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single stake—recover the capacity to feel—signaled in paragraph two and escalated by each beat: legal claim → blade duel → battery transfer → panic flare. Tightening is machine-precise: the vivification costs his last reserve, foreclosing retreat to numb safety. Agency is continuous; even accepting Vane’s strike is an offensive redirection. Cost is rendered on-page: “the numbness cracked like ice,” a felt, irreversible conversion.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—deliver a new puzzle concept—signals in para 1; pressure tightens when standard horticulture fails, forcing orthogonal risk. Escalation is causal: each failed norm ups the ante until the bloom appears and forecloses the option of ignoring the stench; cost is the gamble of hosting a corpse-flower room. The protagonist’s agency drives every turn; coincidence merely delivers the envelope, never solves. Persistent constraint (unbearable odor) will shape future customer tactics and is visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—reverse the household silence—signals early and tightens through each pull; every escalation is an acoustic pressure increase that costs fuel, breath, and cartilage. One meaningful deepening: the lullaby fragment mutates from private memory to public gale, forcing Silas to expose the very guilt he once concealed. No off-stage rescue; coincidence (laughter appears) complicates rather than resolves, fulfilling the Accumulative lens. Price is legible: fumes replace oxygen, knees buckle, drone ends when petrol ends.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—guardian’s need to decide whether to destroy or welcome uncertainty—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is textural: each recurrence of “light as violent edge” intensifies the cost of tolerating definition; the dimming pendant is the single decisive intensification. Agency is present—waiting is an active tactical choice that forecloses the kill-path. Cost is conceptual but legible: “the crushing geometry of this world felt a little less lonely” shows the price of choosing companionship over categorical purity.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—create autonomous life or accept eternal stasis—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened with each failed iteration. Agency drives escalation: choosing to crush rather than repair, choosing solvent over solder, choosing to be catastrophe—each narrows retreat until the only path is self-immolating genesis. Visible cost: frostbite creeping skin, relic vaporized, church authority irrevocably broken. The tightening turn is the solvent drop that flips obedience into rebellion; afterwards no option remains but to watch the anarchic child-spiral leave him behind—Earned Stasis in the freezing dark.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—capture the nebula’s last breath—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: abandoning wave-spike training for negative-space listening narrows options and succeeds. Cost is conceptual (academy protocol invalidated) rather than visceral; no resource or body is actually risked on-page. Sufficient for high-7, but lacking a felt price keeps it from 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—prise the ferry back into linear time—announced in paragraph 1 and escalates through one tightening beat: the transmitter becomes the sole valve through which consequence can re-enter. Cost is visible: sand materializes only while she burns her irreplaceable hopeful will, foreclosing the option to remain forever in painless suspension. Agency is continuous; no coin-flip reversal, only dial-turns that narrow options toward re-entry gravity. The final lurch of the deck is the price paid for restored schedules, satisfying the lens of because/therefore causality.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—stabilize the illusion before his fever dissolves it—tightens via each extra loop that increases both structure and self-entrapment. Escalation is accumulative/textural: density of impossibility grows until the sinew’s biological limit snaps. Visible price: sweat, seared skin, and the final whiplash convert abstract stakes into corporal cost. One meaningful shift: the gallery’s “tranquility fractures” exactly when Elias recognizes the sticky adherence of his own logic—options foreclose in that beat.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—see the stars, escape the trench—signals early and tightens once: the sensor expansion forecloses failure (madness risk) and success (exile remains). Agency is pure attention and computation; the cost is immediate—stars visible yet unreachable. Under accumulative lens, the cadence shift from sonar ghosts to infinite horizons reweights stakes with felt vertigo. No coincidence; escalation is internal, crystallized in the heavy quiet after collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—salvage a child-spirit bureaucratic afterlife ignores—signals early and tightens when shadows lunge. Escalation proceeds because/therefore as each amplification (static roar, flutter in earpiece, shield of recognition) narrows options and raises visceral cost. Agency is continuous: Elara turns herself into an antenna, projects intent, spends stamina. Price is visible on-page: cold sweat, shaky hands, post-adrenal gasp; no reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single dominant stake—rescue before tide severs the sub—tightens every beat; the forty-minute clock is restated twice but never dilated. Escalation is linear, not layered: entropy needle spikes, containment-field temperature swings, cable flares—each intensifies risk yet never forks Elias toward a true trade-off. Agency stays active: he overrides, keys, scrambles. Cost is visible (ears pop, hull shriek) but not irreversible; no resource is lost that reshapes future options. The rescue succeeds without forcing him to sacrifice belief or tool, keeping pressure coherent but just shy of cathartic.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—extract truth from corrupted marital memory—signaled in paragraph 4. Escalation follows Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (snow hush, ink rivulet, pixel tear) deepens the cost of knowing. Mid-scene tightening occurs when the ink’s chaotic path forces Elias to surrender authorial control—visible price paid. No coincidence; resolution earned by his final stance crystallization: he accepts incomplete data and resumes the count, foreclosing reunion.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—save the tactile from verbal extinction—is signaled early and tightened when the curse claims his voice, a visible price. Agency is continuous: each calibration, whisper, and vocal scrape narrows options toward irreversible silence. The escort starlings act as pressure conduit, not deus ex machina, satisfying lens.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—force the universe to give back a real brother—signaled by "rewrite the gag." Mid-scene reversal: gravity release forecloses retreat; cost (blood, phone death) visible on page. Escalation is causal, irreversible, and narrows to the final laugh.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—beauty vs. mechanical order—tightens once: the moment she risks detection the option space collapses to play or retreat. Escalation is biological, not tactical: each resonant pulse widens root cracks, raising cost for both sides. Her agency drives the turn; the golems’ neutralization protocols fail because she attacks through their perceptual blind spot. Price is visible—city infrastructure destroyed, her own safety obviated—felt in the final image of “gray wounds bleeding green.”

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—deliver the storm without detonation—signals in paragraph 2 and tightens through each drone-gap step. One meaningful reversal: the moment he commits to sliding the bottle into the lockbox, foreclosing retreat. Cost is visceral: sweat-blind eyes, knees on tile, the tasted ozone of freedom. Escalation is causal under the lens; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—complete the horse before the bell dies—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens with every paragraph break. The bell’s decay is the live clock; each lyrical cadence shortens perceived duration, a textural escalation. Protagonist agency drives the midpoint song-turn that tames the fragment; luck only reveals, never saves. Cost is visceral: voice torn, flesh branded, silence forever forfeited—price scales to 700-word frame.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—access the pre-narrative abyss—tightens when hyperbolic folds bend real light; option narrows to “hold or snap.” Scarf’s tension supplies visible price, paid on-page when silk slips and vision collapses. Agency is manipulation of fabric, not confrontation; suffices under Accumulative design. Secondary stakes (patrons’ ambient browsing) remain decorative, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“capture the runaway dream or remain hollow”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens once: each light-stroke irreversibly consumes the sunrise, foreclosing retry. Escalation is textural: luminescence accumulates, archipelago chorus rises, heart races, then the dispersal snaps the tension. Cost is visible—palette drained, dream gone, islands silent—altering her stance from pursuit to release. No need for external antagonist; internal cipher vs. finite dawn supplies adequate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—liberation of the caged melody—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened once: the centrifugal spin literally deletes her option to stay earth-bound and silent. Cost is visible on the page: she staggers, ground gone, panic flaring; the ribbon’s transformation is irreversible. Agency is shared—Silas initiates the disorientation, but she must keep her gaze on the star—so the turn is co-earned yet still protagonist-decisive. No coincidence, no off-stage rescue; the tightening is situational but unmistakable.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
    <comment>Theme emerges without sermon: fear as “master craftsman” of mist-cages is stated only after we have watched the cage liquefy into song. The returned strip of silk in the final beat is a quiet conceptual repricing—what once bound now decorates—and invites reflection on how artifacts of trauma can become inert keepsakes. Subtext lives in gesture: her silent palm receiving back the powerless ribbon tells us liberation is not magical erasure but re-contextualized memory. No tidy moral; the lingering “improbable longing” in the air keeps ambiguity alive.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recover her voice—threads every beat; the tightening occurs when the drifting wrecks finally realign and the mushroom hub appears, shrinking options to one irreversible touch. Cost is legible: the glass walls “shatter,” decades of solitude collapse into a single heartbeat, and the dome’s pressure metaphor becomes literal. Agency is pure—he chooses to press flesh to fungus, knowing the memory may drown him. No secondary pressure or credible loss alters tactics, so escalation is single-note but sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—Lenore must earn daylight by her own force—tightens exactly once: the stylus marks convert passive rage into aimed violence, foreclosing the option of waiting for mercy. Escalation is causal under the mentor’s hidden sabotage; each scratch lowers the breaking threshold, making the final punch inevitable. Cost is legible in Silas’s trembling hands and the mess he refuses to admit pride over. No reversal beyond the single required fracture, but that fracture reweights everything.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve wonder—signals early; escalation is the deepening density of the grafting act that narrows Elian’s stamina and forecloses retrieval. No antagonist is needed: pressure is situational and cosmological. Cost is visible in bodily fatigue and the irreversible dispersal of the seed. Sufficient tightening for 800-word scope; could sharpen one tangible forfeiture to breach 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—trap the scream—tightens through each knot; silence accumulates as visible price pressing on sternum and eardrums. One meaningful reversal: final knot releases the silence that chokes the mask, foreclosing escape. Agency is Elian’s fingers, not coincidence. Cost is legible: his own heartbeat becomes enemy drum, brother entombed in violent quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—access the Whispered Chapel— is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the only clue is a smoothed depression. One meaningful escalation: the shift from archival observation to corporeal empathy (mimicking grief) narrows options from intellectual to visceral, with visible cost: she must expose her own emotion to the stone. No coincidence resolves; the 1990s tourists’ blindness heightens stakes by showing what failure looks like. Price paid: the chapel’s stale breath rises, implying irreversible auditory exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: isolate the physics of letting go; signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened when globe vortex slows, narrowing his options to intervene or retreat. No external antagonist; pressure is the refusal-energy trapped in the globe. One visible price: the library’s “oppressive weight” dissolves, implying Elias has spent psychic capital to break the loop. Escalation is textural accretion rather than causal reversals, coherent under chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—free Kaelen—tightens from static screams to calm glow; one decisive deepening suffices. Agency is continuous: each spray stroke is an irreversible gamble with high-voltage death. Cost is felt in soaked clothes and smoking iron. Could hit 8.8 if a secondary tangible loss (tool cracks?) were dramatised.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—prove Halloway’s joy exists—tightens floor by floor as sunlight intensifies and elevator clock runs. Each spectral filter narrows options: red cancels false text, blue erases grief myth, until only love remains; Elian’s ultimate choice to withhold re-closes the diary, paying the cost of perpetual secrecy. Pressure is causal, legible, and charged; no external antagonist needed. The price is conceptual-social: family keeps mourning while servant alone knows the sky held Halloway’s real happiness.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“prove that empty spaces remember”—is signaled early and tightens when the memory storm offers living proof. Escalation is textural: each cloud category adds psychic mass until the loop ruptures, forcing Elian’s stance crystallization from despair to stewardship. Agency is observational; no external antagonist, but the vacuum’s indifference supplies coherent pressure. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: eternal drift redefined as custodianship, price felt in “cold embrace” of endless librarianship.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“mirror the sky before the walls fall”—is signaled early and tightens once: the clouds fail until the coin reveals the fractal key. Escalation is situational: external demolition pressure compresses time, forcing tactile translation instead of visual. Cost is visible: he drops chalk, chest heaves, accepts annihilation. No live reversal he can control, so tightening is external rather than a trade-off he initiates; this caps intensity just below the 8.5 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—chart the unchartable—tightens when the murmuration cues magnetic anomaly and the hopscotch grid becomes the only path to light. Single deepening suffices: from speculative hunt to literal sphere in her face. Cost is instantaneous loss of the phenomenon once starlings break tension, foreclosing replication. Agency remains hers throughout; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“restore the moon’s rhythm”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens through one decisive reversal: the mirrors try to paralyze with fear, but she chooses blind forward motion, narrowing options to tactile faith. Cost is legible: the “gentle clinking” coda equals depleted energy and foreclosed retreat. No coincidence resolves the conflict; her trained torque alone frees the axle. Slight reserve: escalation is single-step rather than multi-stage, keeping it just below the 8.5 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—thinning Nebula—tightens once when resonance frequency converts a garden sprinkler into an atmospheric suture. Visible price: months of graying leaves and groaning anchors translate into boot-level vibration and radiation meters snapping safe. Protagonist agency is collective but unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—can a private feeling survive universal death?—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens through texture, not reversals: each nested pattern compresses the emotional spectrum until silence itself becomes the final currency. Escalation is accumulative: evaporated ocean → violet resonance → puppet dissolution → lighthouse unspooling, each layer raising the cost of transmission. Protagonist agency is continuous calibration of the clock’s fractal trace; the price paid (his coherence) is legible on the page. The beat qualifies as one meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens; no causal turns are required. Just shy of 9 because the escalation is entirely one-directional (no live option ever appears), but that monolinearity is intentional to the lullaby motif.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—get strangers out before frost locks the maze—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened by the visible ice blooming on the railing. Agency is purely Silas: every counter-stroke (nut retrieval, coil assembly, mental shove) is his, and each subtracts stamina. The mechanical birds never suddenly become helpful; their fall is a direct rewrite of code, not luck. Cost is present but not sharpened into a sacrifice that forecloses future rescues; it’s a fatigue tax rather than a moral one.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can he trade eternal plastics for temporal ones—tightens once: the foam-eddy observation collapses the option of continuing durable patents. Pressure is coherent but single-cycle; no secondary reversal or external antagonist beyond his own guilt. Cost is felt, yet the beat is intellectual rather than a tangible obstacle under clock.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—absolve the fortress of frozen remorse—tightens through one decisive intensification: ingesting the coral shard narrows her options to endure or shatter. Cost is visceral (blizzard of silent screams) and persistent (colour drained from reef). Under causal lens, each beat escalates because she acts on discovered anomalies; coincidence never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—citywide famine—signaled in para 2 and tightened when Elara manually pushes the wheel, foreclosing retreat. Escalation is single but meaningful: cacophony → confused queries → low steady chord. The cost is her physical exhaustion and the temporal drag she imposes, visible on page. No reversal, but one tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—becoming the archive of discarded psyche—tightens once: the neural coupling is irreversible, foreclosing return to baseline humanity. Escalation is textural: density of entangled memories surges into a single heavy wave that forces her stance crystallization. Agency remains hers—she clamps the probes, forces the current—so the turn is earned. Cost is visible (body tremor, seismic shudder) but not persistently constraining beyond the final moment, keeping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restore the Seeds before inversion collapses—is legible from the first line and tightens via the literal countdown. The mid-story tightening is the recognition that the doodle demands a four-dimensional gesture, an ontological price that forecloses any simpler path. Cost is visible: bruised landing, lost buoyancy, and the irreversible transfer of vigilance to an unseen sky. Agency is continuous—every surfed seam is her calculated negotiation with physics.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—sound or eternal silence—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens through each failed instrument until the porcelain gambit. Escalation is textural: silence gains weight, the hedgehog cue narrows time, the cracked ash foreshadows rupture, the ceramic refuses absorption. The protagonist’s agency is the final strum; luck is absent; cost is the tree’s mournful cry and the birds’ panic—audible proof that the world will never again be mute. One meaningful deepening suffices; the note’s expansion ring is the irreversible change.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are singular: open the diary without violence while the civic countdown looms. Pressure escalates through each rejected frequency; the tightening is the narrowing audible space before the sky itself erupts. The protagonist’s agency is absolute—every oscillation is his decision—and the final “sigh” is earned. However, the cost is aesthetic rather than practical; no tool breaks, no social credit is spent, keeping this below the 8.8 band where visible price is mandatory.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single dominant stake—personal anchoring—is signalled early and deepens through odor-analysis beats; tension tightens once when the bloom’s ‘vibration’ reframes her quest, but no external obstacle raises the cost beyond cognitive reframing.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—save the groves—threads every beat. The inversion window tightens options: only pilots who fly during Flux can reach the Echoes. Escalation is single but meaningful: aligning the arrow broadcasts the life-song downward, trading her immediate safety for planetary recovery. Cost is visible in the sudden tree burst and her plummet back into normal gravity.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“decode the wind-killer to save the next crew”—is signaled early and tightens when the patch personalizes the abstract loss. The single meaningful deepening (pressure-drop → yaw corridor) forecloses option space under a causal lens; cost is legible yet second-hand, not on her skin, capping at 8.4.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stake is singular: validate wonder at the instant chisel meets stone. Escalation is auroral intensification tightening the clock; protagonist agency is the decisive pull. Cost is felt as the hush re-crystallizes around him—immediate, bodily, conceptual. No secondary reversal, but the foreclosing of quiet after quiet is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—harvest insight from his catastrophic failure—tightens when the vision reveals his fundamental misapplication of the flute; the option to “dam” is foreclosed, leaving only “channel.” Cost is legible: reputation already lost, now wisdom arrives with fresh humiliation. One meaningful escalation under causal lens; no false reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can emotion be reduced to integers?—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens through each brass-tick. Mid-story reversal: Kael’s scream is swallowed, proving the process can extract data yet leaves the equation open, narrowing options to “next victim.” Cost is visceral: Kael’s emptied body, Operator’s stolen vitality. No false escalation; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (wake the gray world) is signaled early and refocused to a single on-page test: crack pendant or fail. Escalation happens through one meaningful tightening—final climb plus aurora proximity; no reversals needed under Causal lens. Price is atmospheric and bodily—thin air, shivering endurance, ultimate energy drain—and alters later options (pendant gone, life-risk spent). Coincidence absent; agency maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.0)
    Single dominant stake—prove objects retain emotional imprint—tightens once: frost patterns either yield proof or doom Elias’s life thesis. Agency sits entirely with Elias; his decision to apply prism to ice is the irreversible turn that forces the reveal. Cost is visible: Mara’s prior survival narrative (“he drove away angry”) collapses in hot tears; her emotional armour is forfeited. No secondary complication or rising external jeopardy keeps escalation lean, appropriate to 750-word scale but caps intensity just under 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—deliver the bead or annihilation of meaning—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens exactly once: when the apple tree flickers out, the cost turns visceral. Protagonist agency drives the turn: she alone welds puzzle edges into warp, she alone speaks “Recommence,” she alone steps into the gears. The price—her life—alters later tactics (there are none; the path is foreclosed). Under the Causal lens, this single escalation is sufficient and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—save the harvest—signals in paragraph 1 and tightens when gravity fluctuation makes the silk the only viable tool. One meaningful turn: the barter itself dissolves the silk, irretrievably foreclosing the option to reclaim it or use it again. Cost is visible on-page: “the silk dissolved into the rock” and Ewan emerges uncelebrated, gravity restored but personal credit erased. Escalation remains causal, not declarative; no coincidence resolves the fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single dominant stake—learn the real cause of Icarus—tightens when the rift cycle forces her dive and again when she wrests the vision sideways to the observation deck; each escalation is an on-page choice that costs stamina and blood. No coincidence; pressure is causal under the time-slice window. The price (knowledge she can never share) is visible and alters her stance. Could be sharper if a mid-dive obstacle threatened to abort the dive.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: keep Thomas from psychological shipwreck; signaled when Elias notes the “cry for help” cairn. Escalation is internal—darkness tightens, unseen presence creeps—but agency stays active: Elias decides to climb, to add glass, to strike match. Cost is present yet mild; the true price is the surrender of his private treasure, paid in the final third. One tightening is sufficient; luck never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“shape a new dawn using ancient shadows”—is signaled early and tightens once: the beam’s eruption projects the tower’s shadow across the waking city, foreclosing any retreat from the spectacle. Pressure is situational/mythic rather than causal; escalation is a density surge to critical saturation. No visible price is exacted from Silas himself, only from the off-screen city, so cost is conceptual rather than felt. Still, the final shadow is an undeniable re-weighting of the morning, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single stake: distill charisma into color. Escalation is tightening of sunlight across chalk marks; failure = gray dust, success = living blue. Agency is precise—he angles wing at solvent; cost is risk of ruin and implicit donor-heart stakes. Price lands conceptually, not viscerally—reason for 8.8 not 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—clear the sorrow before reality bursts—is declared early and tightened once: the microscopic screw-turn that collapses the dam. Stakes stay personal-scale; no visible price (injury, exhaustion, lost memory) is dramatized on Elias, so escalation feels moderate. Agency is present but singular; one decisive move suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—rekindle a dead realm—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened once: the wild light must be swaddled or it will incinerate the orchard. Escalation is causal: each harmonic stanza raises physical cost (heat, sap, palm-blister) until the single option is forced—thrust the bundle through the pane. Price is visible but not persistent beyond the burnt hands; still, the tightening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can exile be transmuted into belonging?—tightens once: the library accepts only those who’ve already banished themselves. Midnight clock supplies external pressure; the paradoxical crossing is the single decisive tightening that forecloses normal life. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: he forfeits the noisy world forever. No secondary reversal, but one meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: keep memory alive against collective amnesia. Escalation is textural—each sensory absence (trees, bakery, birds) intensifies the pressure to preserve; guerrilla act and black-market loaf are visible prices paid. No reversal, but a meaningful deepening: the city keeps graying, his options narrow to covert rituals only. Cost legible on tongue and frost-bitten fingers.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“verify hope before entropy wins”—is signaled early and tightens through the needle drop. One meaningful deepening: the golden figures tear like smoke, converting spectacle into data urgency. Agency stays with Elara; no coincidence rescues her. Cost is the irreversible fade, but the beat never risks her body or social credit, keeping pressure just sub-8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—why people drag weather—tightens into the discovery that she herself is conscripted to drag it. Escalation is textural: each sensory spike (copper-lemon → burnt tinfoil → vanilla-ozone) signals an incremental transfer of climatic burden onto her body. The reversal is internal and irreversible: from mocking observer to drafted carrier, with no external antagonist needed. Price is on-page: her palms birth a cloud—an undeniable, bodily toll that forecloses her prior detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—liberate authentic creativity or remain haunted—signals in sentence 4 and tightens once: the lock must be physically destroyed to unblock expression. Escalation is accumulative: each stroke increases the cost of turning back until the burial beat forecloses retreat. Price is visible—broken brass shards disappear behind the portrait, literalizing that pain is now infrastructure. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure suffices and culminates in an irreversible act.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—locate the sequestered voices—tightens when each lie physically debilitates her, turning every hallway into a minefield. One meaningful escalation: the clerk’s guarded plate forces her to wager final vitality for the truth. Cost is visible on the page (skin bruising, knee-buckling) and shapes tactics—she can’t bluff. The evacuation order re-prices all prior city suffering; closure stakes feel irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—jolting the monochrome consensus—signals early and tightens once: the sunrise begins melt, foreclosing retreat; escalation is purely accumulative as mass loss drives ever-faster strikes. Protagonist agency is present in every calibration; coincidence is absent. Cost is legible: the iceberg is consumed, the sonic disruption is finite, and the valley’s reaction is dramatized by heads snapping up. The tightening deepens rather than reverses, sufficient for this length, but only one meaningful intensification occurs, keeping it just shy of top band.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—survive reversal without wipe—is signaled early and tightens into one irrevocable choice: incinerate memories or die. The transfer scene escalates via compression geometry, foreclosing retreat; price is the dome breach and exile. Agency is solitary; no antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—eviction—is signaled in paragraph two. Pressure tightens once, when machinery roar peaks at the same beat the final tumbler falls; the choice to keep listening rather than fight narrows options and visibly pays off when the foreman freezes. Cost is conceptual but legible: the community must now live the stories, not just tell them.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—free the trapped consciousness—signaled paragraph 1. Tightening occurs when dance must stay fluid while fear wants to spike: one error → purge. Cost legible: she finishes breathless, legs trembling, oceanic weight transferred from hull to self. Escalation causal under Causal lens; no coincidence; renunciation (her calm surrender) is the agency that flips access.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—silence the coded prophecy—is signaled in paragraph 3 and escalates once: the night’s syntax nearly completes. The protagonist’s agency is the mapping/dropping act; price is paid when the wing—and a timeline—are lost downstream. Escalation is single-point rather than compounding, but it cleanly narrows to the hush-under-stars payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—keep the building standing by believing the lie—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when the seal proves the grammar is real. One meaningful turn: Silas realizes he must become the new liar; options collapse from “learn the truth” to “endorse the falsehood.” Cost is on-page: he will live inside a building that groans because of his own complicity. Pressure is coherent under causal lens; meteors complicate rather than rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—sever grief’s cord—signaled in paragraph 3. Escalation: quarantined field → shell contact → resonance compression → stone; each step raises the price of detachment. Protagonist agency drives every turn; no coincidence. Cost is visible (tears, silence, empty gaze) and alters future—freedom is terrifying lightness.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—infant prince’s life—signals in line 1 via the document. Pressure escalates micron by micron: solvent dries, aurora brightens, seal threatens to shatter; each beat tightens the noose around a single-letter pivot. The reversal is irreversible: “condemned” → “commended” rewrites imperial reality with Elian’s blood-warm breath as catalyst. Cost is on-page—the thorn absorbs excess ink, the wax re-locks, Elian pockets a death-sentence key—so options are foreclosed, not asserted.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the literal act of rewriting: history is ink, ink is organic, therefore history can be grown or grafted like a rose. The thorn’s journey—garden → fire → sanctuary → parchment—carries the idea that violence and beauty share vascular tissue. No moral is stated; the final image of phantom rose scent in frozen air reconfigures the meaning of treason into mercy. The reader is left to weigh whether one letter can absolve an empire, a question that lingers without tidy answer.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will she extract the Archivist before Council wards strike—tightens via each returned echo; failure equals acoustic entombment. Agency is continuous: she chooses pitch, interprets reverb, risks volume. The shell’s vibration supplies visible price, forcing breath-level concealment. One meaningful deepening: Council’s silencing spell graduates from background rumor to embodied wall-graft, shifting stakes from curiosity to witnessing state murder.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“salvage something pure”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when each dream cameo risks “static” that could shatter the remnant. Accumulative escalation: density of cameos increases until the exit-door pattern crystallizes, forcing the final sync. No visible price is paid by Elara beyond cognitive strain, so ceiling is 8.4; an 8.5+ would require a forfeiture dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“can one breath reorder chaos?”—is signaled early and deepens through each textured beat. Escalation is density-driven: rain → moonlight → whistle → sphere, each adding perceptual tension. Cost is conceptual: the sphere’s vanishing proves the epiphany’s transience, foreclosing future proof. Agency resides in attention and breath; visible price is the return to flat tea surface—order gone as soon as witnessed.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. survival of the only safe haven—surfaces in paragraph 2 and tightens when the field flickers. The intuitive calibration is the single meaningful turn that forecloses the safe ignorance option with felt cost: if he fails, the storm kills him; if he succeeds, he must later destroy the myth. Escalation is coherent under causal lens; no coincidence resolves the crisis. Price is visible—sweat-slicked brow, moral weight of future exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“control of the narrative”—is signaled early and tightens when the signal literally switches sides. The mid-story realization that “the shadows were not his servants” forces a visible tactic change (frantic dial-turns) and forecloses any path to glory. Cost is legible; pressure coherent under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—save the song from mechanical death—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when the dawn wind becomes the deadline. Agency is pure: every pour and crank actively rewrites the music box’s fate, not merely symbolizes it. One meaningful escalation: the gears’ hesitation → catch → crystalline release, the audible narrowing of options. Cost is the spent spring and the unrepeatable consumption of two stored echoes; future scavenges will be harder, but that is felt, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—artifact protection—faces a single, tightening obstacle: mechanical torque fails, live option narrowed to vibrational surrender. Escalation is causal: each decibel of spirit-scream raises the cost of failure, forcing Elias to wager flesh. Price is visible—bare skin freezes, fillings vibrate, organs scrubbed—altering tactics (gloves off, mouth open). The absolution wave forecloses the haunting but not the cold; residual cost keeps pressure alive into night.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—sever the supply line without betraying the rebellion’s long game—is signaled in para 3 and tightened when Elara refuses Kael’s urge to blow the supports. Escalation is microscopic but legible: each paragraph adds a new physical constraint (ice, lunar angle, conductivity) that narrows the moment of action. The price is the audible death of the bridge and Kael’s forced internal revision. Meets 9+ quick test: cost is visible in the “cascade of blue sparks swallowed by the dark.”

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—professional survival versus moral duty—is signaled by line 3 and tightens when Halloway orders “equipment failure.” The lantern discovery mid-story forces a binary: falsify and keep career, or tell truth and face exile. Escalation is causal under rising infrasound readings that parallel Elias’s dawning recognition of repeatable danger. Cost is explicit: uploading the packet severs his “leash,” a lived loss rendered in the silence that follows.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can brokenness be redeemed?—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens once: “technically correct… the spring is indeed snapped,” collapsing Elias’s hope. Agency stays on Elias: he initiates the visit, unwraps the heart, leans in, and accepts the paralyzing cost. Cost is visible—his collapse into silence—though the external price (what he will do next) remains off-page, keeping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—“touch the sky before dissolution”—is signaled in sentence two and tightens each time a brass plate is jettisoned. The floor’s final groan is the single escalation that collapses retreat and forces launch; cost is paid in real time as the workshop is devoured. Agency stays mechanical yet causal: Seven chooses lighter canvas over shielding, chooses to carve notches, chooses to extend the manipulator for the chime. No coincidence rescues; the bell tap is微型胜利 that reweights the premise rather than resolving danger.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—find the erased truth—signals in paragraph 2 and escalates when the numeric pattern narrows the search to audio ghosts. The overlay act is the decisive tightening that swaps ignorance for knowledge at visible internal risk (the lie to the drone). Cost is conceptual but legible: Silas’s employer becomes jailer of souls, forever tainting his role. No reversal reverses itself; coincidence only complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—prisoner’s life—tightens once: from abstract hope to concrete shard-beam that forecloses execution. Escalation is causal under lens: each mirror glimpse narrows options until only the cheval reflection works, raising cost of failure. Agency is Kaelen’s throughout; no coincidence resolves. Visible price: council’s prior certainty is publicly dissolved; ice’s audible halt is the planetary-level receipt. Could edge higher if prisoner’s fate had been foregrounded in one on-page beat.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—hearing the sound of ending—tightens when the marina’s groans fail to qualify, then pivots with the parasol find: the whisper of residue becomes the sought frequency. Agency is maintained throughout: he defers death, chooses salvage, pockets the shard, finally accepts injection. Cost is the lost time and bodily erosion spent trawling, plus the irrevocable decision to proceed. No external antagonist is needed; pressure is ontological.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—woman’s need to reinterpret her loss—appears early; escalation is the single tightening when metaphor reweights grief from rejection to biological mismatch, foreclosing self-blame. No external antagonist; pressure is internal and conceptual, coherent under causal lens. Cost is legible: she surrenders the last relic (letter edge) and accepts cold night wait—tangible forfeiture. Could use one more micro-choice showing her actively testing the new frame rather than only listening.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—preserve knowledge from erasure—is signaled in paragraph one and narrowed to this single archive; the tightening moment is the confession, which turns the Pavilion from threat to portal. Cost is conceptual but legible: once sealed, the wisdom cannot be consulted even by Elian, so his victory is also self-exile. Agency is present—sigils, ritual, footprint erasure—but the external antagonist (Prophet’s regime) remains off-page, slightly blunting pressure. Still, the choice to hide rather than wield the lore is a renunciation that forecloses options under situational pressure, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—liberating language from fixed definitions—is signaled in paragraph 3. Escalation is textural: each fractured phrase tightens the linguistic noose until the pattern break flips the stake. Agency is continuous: Elias chooses each broken word, pays with vocal pain and social heresy. Cost is visible (voice raspy, eyes wide) but could have been sharpened by a physical echo of the dictionary-law penalty—e.g., a distant footstep that never materializes.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—capture the unheard sound—tightens when the only way to “keep” it is to relinquish memory of why he came. Escalation is accumulative: each chalk arrow spends both medium and mind, narrowing options to pure listening. No external antagonist needed; pressure is entropic. Visible price: chalk reduced to dust, prophecy to déjà vu.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—capture the ephemeral Green Flash—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened by the quake’s countdown. One meaningful deepening: when the hand’s whine syncs with the seismic rhythm, Elian abandons visual tuning for acoustic, narrowing options irrevocably. Cost is visible—he risks losing the lenses and his own balance. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under causal lens; luck (quake) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—“execute a flawless goodbye”—is signaled in para 2; escalation is textural: each added sensory layer (hum, scent, string resonance) makes failure more unthinkable. No reversal in the causal sense; instead density rise crystallizes agency into single irreversible act: finishing the musical phrase exactly at her final exhale. Cost is visceral: stillness after last note is heavier than any lament; Elias forfeits the shield of music and must inhabit the silence he has midwifed. Under Accumulative lens this tightening suffices; coincidence is absent, pressure coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—locate shadows at noon—signaled in paragraph 3 and escalates as each circuit-closure risks the automaton tearing itself apart, a visible price on the page. Protagonist agency drives every beat: she chooses the sequence, turns the key, adjusts the governor. The tightening occurs when the artificial sun hits zenith and forecloses the option of ever finding shadows elsewhere; instead they are crushed beneath her, narrowing possibility to horrific fact. Cost is legible under causal lens, though only one decisive intensification fits the short length.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—parents’ need for a survivable narrative—tightens when Thorne realizes anger will “close the door forever.” Agency: he forecloses the path of宣告死亡, choosing instead to fabricate a celestial map; price is his own certainty. Escalation driven by his because/therefore deductions from tooth → wooden anatomy → lie-to-splint. No coincidence; every intensifier is causal. Felt cost legible in his trembling leaves and the parents’ terrified hope.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—safe light without fire—is signaled early and deepened when the memory-flash tightens her resolve; the brass-scale weighing is the visible price of balance. Agency is present yet singular: once she survives the tremor, no new external pressure tests her again, so escalation plateaus rather than compounds. Cost is legible in the tremor and the forfeiture of ever using flame, satisfying the lens. A second tightening beat would have pushed this into 8.5+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can anything still grow after public shaming?—is signaled in para 1. Escalation is the quiet tightening of the drip-arrow → amber → encounter, each step foreclosing flight and forcing stance crystallization. Agency is renunciation: Elias gives up words and safety to sit beside the exposed whistle-blower; Mara gives up solitary panic for shared stillness. Cost is visible: they remain physically exposed beneath dripping stalactites, cameras blind but hunters still possible.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“collect shapes of hopes before closing pages”—is signaled early; the whisper of final period acts as live clock. One meaningful tightening: upstream wade against narrative current narrows option to steal vs. intervene. Cost visible: Elara’s eyes dim, Elias’s heaving chest. Under Accumulative lens, density of stolen lights escalates pressure; no reversal beyond the single extraction, but sufficient for 600-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—“will the moon be greeted again?”—is signaled early and escalates through the grafting beat that forecloses retreat (machine must work or vine dies). Agency stays with Elian: his song frequency, his timing call, his exhaustion. Cost is visible: the vine browns and spent, the tinkerer slumped. One tightening is enough at this length; no coincidence resolves. The escalation is linear rather than doubly reversed, but the felt price keeps pressure coherent under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—capture dying orchard’s pulse before it dissolves—is signaled early and escalates through sensory tightening: cold intensifies, light fuses, flash-paper narrows time to one vacuum instant. Escalation is textural density more than causal reversals; options narrow from “open orchard” to “sealed relic,” visible price paid in frost endurance and irreversible combustion. Agency is stance crystallization rather than external conflict; nonetheless, the tightening forces irreversible translation—land lost, map gained. Cost is legible but not viscerally personal; orchard’s demise overshadows any private loss.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—capture or lose the acoustic ghosts—signals early and tightens once: the timer’s whir-inhale thud strips the cave of ambient spirit, a visible price. Escalation is textural: density of brass/gear imagery mounts until the metallic thud flips the cave from cathedral to tomb. Protagonist agency drives every beat; no external coincidence rescues or complicates. The cost is legible—silence is a felt forfeiture—but because the tightening is single rather than iterative, it stops just short of the 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—transfer villagers’ burdens onto herself—signals early and tightens once: the spiral will drown her mind if she mistimes the alignment. Agency is present (she chooses the precise celestial coordinate), but the price is more conceptual than visceral; we feel the shingled hush thicken yet never fear actual collapse. One meaningful deepening—the spiral slowing to audible snap—fulfills Accumulative escalation. Cost is visible (stones in velvet satchel) but could be sharper had we sensed a memory fragment tearing from her own past.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—contain grief before kettle screams—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened by the boiling clock. Escalation is textural: rain applause grows louder, wood warms, kettle ascends to scream—each intensifies the cost of failure. Agency is endurance/renunciation: she pushes terror into cellulose, then accepts the blank’s mute custody. Cost is legible—she forfeits the chance to keep grieving actively, trading raw memory for carved stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single dominant stake—why the Carousel stopped—tightens through each scavenged voice fragment until the memory trade reveals self-sabotage. The ghost negotiation is the visible price: accumulated stories buy the truth, narrowing Jaren’s moral options to kneeling regret. Escalation is accumulative/textural: static-laden air thickens until the wrench memory detonates. Cost is unmistakable on-page: “He spun it backward… counting down exposures that would never be developed.”

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake – can the dead terminal breathe again? – is signaled early and tightened once: the missing crystal forces the sextant gamble, narrowing options.  Escalation is textural (density of trash vs. starlight) rather than causal reversal; sufficient under Accumulative lens.  The price (possible explosion, failure) is conceptual rather than corporeal, keeping it just below the 8.8 band where visible loss would be required.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake: preserve sacred silence vs. resurrect forbidden music. Pressure tightens once: petrichor triggers the breach, quartz hum forces the choice—bear the beauty or silence it. Agency visible in the excruciatingly gentle touch and the final renunciation; cost is the ghost he leaves in the forecourt. No coincidence; rain is external but only acts through his sensual vulnerability. Escalation sufficient for 740-word lens; deeper tightening would over-crank.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prove the official timeline a lie—signalled in para 1 and tightened in a single turn: outward-bent hull = inside explosion = noon sinking. The sundial’s shadow is the visible price that locks the thesis; failure would leave him a conspiracy crank. Pressure is accumulative rather than multi-reversal: each artifact (lockbox, plate, shadow) layers density until silence cuts the jazz and the ray hits—noon confirmed. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: the city keeps its myth, Elias keeps the nausea.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve a vanishing art—activates early and tightens when fog threatens to erase visibility. One meaningful escalation: impossible triple-folded hitch forces a still deeper attention, foreclosing the option to cut or quit. The cost is conceptual: future knowledge now owned, not shared; that registers but is less visceral than a physical sacrifice. Fits the accumulative lens under which the story ends.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—mapping grief so absence becomes bearable—tightens once: from void-language to acceptance via explained absences. Escalation is textural deepening: each sensory detail increases emotional density until the thread snaps. No reversals needed; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens. Cost is felt in the characters’ shared winter stranding and the narrator’s spent ink.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.6)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“prove scars can sing”—is signaled early; pressure tightens as mineral diffusion and buoyancy can still fail until the hum emerges. Escalation is textural/accumulative: silence → dissolution → resonant note reweights meaning. Protagonist agency drives each step; luck is absent. Cost is the consumed black sand and the audible shift from scream legacy to music, visible on page.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—liberate calcified memories—signaled paragraph 1 and tightens once: only stellar alignment can open box, forcing motionless vigil. Cost is legible: hours of immobility+worldview concession. Agency is crystallized attention, not brute force; coincidence complicates (geese pause) but does not resolve. Escalation is singular yet sufficient for 750-word frame; a second reversal would over-egg.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“share light without fire”—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tested by the final non-combustive glow. One meaningful tightening: the imperfect gear-fit forces the choice to press anyway, narrowing options from “repair” to “repair with irreversible personal erasure.” Pressure is accumulative: each plasma petal shed is a quiet countdown toward either continued entropy or cold ignition. Cost is the instant obsolescence of his sentimental identity, legible in the final line’s “troubling serenity” returned in pale blue.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—can grief be carved into a single, perfect shape?—tightens when the moth’s erratic flight invalidates every prior template; the ribbon’s refusal to form a circle narrows Elias’s options to one: embrace the knot. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens: each poem recitation, each silk pass, each moth wingbeat adds density until the pattern breaks. Visible price is paid on-page: Elias’s trembling fingers, the audible silk snag, the irreversible chisel strike that commits stone to messy vines. Cost is persistent; the slab now bears the uncontainable weave, altering his future commissions forever.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—“restore shared balance” of communal time—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened to the microscopic: one fractional degree of nut-turn. Escalation is purely causal: the stutter threatens communal guilt; failure to act threatens temporal sin; acting inside the swing threatens flesh. The price (scorched handle, trembling hand) is visible on the page and alters later tactics—he will repeat this ritual forever. One meaningful turn suffices; no reversals are needed.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—will the chaotic tapestry resolve into legible motive?—tightens once when the case drops and re-weights meaning; cost is conceptual (the dead man’s paralyzing hope) rather than felt by Silas. Agency is epistemic, not risky; Silas never faces a trade-off or price, so pressure plateaus at discovery. Under Accumulative lens the single deepening suffices, but without personal cost the escalation stays modest.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent societal stagnation—tightens through one meaningful turn: the deliberate creation of scarcity escalates from abstract model to ink-on-page commitment. Pressure is coherent under causal lens: each beat narrows options until refusal becomes slow death. Cost is legible: Elian trades his moral comfort for systemic survival, a price dramatized in the trembling quill and the black ink that erases his freedom to revise. No coincidence; no false cliffhanger.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve the subversive narrative—tightens once: glowing page must be concealed. Escalation is causal under lens; each lyric line increases detectability until the coat becomes the only option. Price is visible on-page: Elian trades immediate safety for possible airborne infection of others, a tactical trade-off legible in the final image. No coincidence; patrol proximity is ambient threat, not rescuer.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—Elara’s need for permanent memory—tightens as each ash line forecloses erasure; the rocker’s decrescendo is the visible clock that forces Silas’s final act, priced by her scream and the drifting star-like dust that makes loss irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—objective time vs. priestly myth—signaled in para 1 and tightened when silence shatters into ticks. Single meaningful turn: mud resistance → cog found → escapement lives; price is biological (raw fingers) and social (heretic war). Agency is continuous: every sift, file, wind is his. Under Causal lens the pressure narrows from “can the cog be found?” to “will it run?” and answers with audible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—last chance to recover collective resonance—is signaled in paragraph 4. Escalation is textural: density rises as coughs, shuffles, and mental chatter are stripped away, revealing the involuntary hum; the stakes reweight when the chord forms then shatters. The scrape of a chair is the micro-reversal that costs the fragile harmony. Price is visceral: the rosette trembles, the velvet quivers, and the students sit “stunned,” proving the loss is felt on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“plant or perish”—is signaled early and escalates with each snip that risks killing the vine. The celestial alignment gives a live clock, narrowing options to the twin-moon window. One meaningful tightening occurs when the vine’s bitterness forces the decision to prune; options shrink to “poison fruit or lose everything.” Cost is legible: sap-blood on the floor and the solo vigil at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—control of the city’s power—signaled immediately. Escalation is one clean tightening: from Kael’s demand → riddle toll → ash reveal; each step shrinks Kael’s options under Silas’s agency. Cost is visible: Kael’s defeat slump, Silas’s guilt pang, the irreversible blackout. Agency is decision/renunciation rather than fisticuffs, perfectly valid; a sharper material loss (Kael’s suit torn, Silas’s job foreclosed) would nudge it to 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—why houses feel alive—tightens from abstract itch to concrete test with the root placement; that single act forces the house to “listen,” a visible escalation under accumulative lens. No reversals are needed; the deepening is the crystallization of silence into shard, a density that reweights options. Cost is conceptual but legible: Elias relinquishes the root and any illusion that he can control vitality—earned stasis. Pressure remains coherent; coincidence (drunk fisherman) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—expose murder vs. accept mercy—tightens once, hard, when the sarcophagus children are revealed. The reversal is protagonist-driven: she chooses to break the ampoule after the new frame locks in. Cost is conceptual—her moral identity as avenger is foreclosed—but not viscerally personal; no lost object or social credit is forfeited on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—escape the kinetic despair trap—signaled in paragraph 1. Stakes tighten when the equation risks “dissolve the floor”; cost becomes visceral as the staircase shudders and the void tears open. Protagonist agency drives every beat: chalk, proof, cast. No off-stage rescue; coincidence only complicates (die’s wobble is his engineering).

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—prove forgotten kindness still pulses—is signaled early and tightens once when the distant window answers. Escalation is textural: each luminous stroke increases atmospheric density until the single flash reweights the premise. Cost is visible in the spent bristles and Elian’s collapse. The beat is sufficient for this length, though a second obstacle or risk would push it past 8.2.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—save the alphabet—tightens from scrolls to dough with one decisive intensification when the falls crash down, foreclosing the archival option. The price is paid in real time: humidity curls posters, vellum doomed. Agency is crystallized in the kneading of letters; no reversal is needed, only the narrowing of media.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—trick fear into revealing its weakness—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens through each paradoxical obey/reverse choice. Escalation is causal: each inversion narrows options until the final confession collapses the mirror. Cost is visible (burned palm, imploded glass, vanished stench). No off-stage resolution; protagonist’s agency drives every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—orchard survival—tightens through one continuous crescendo: cumulus collapse → wind shriek → strike lattice → final naming. Each escalation is protagonist-engineered; no external rescue. The visible price is the fractal shield itself—each glowing line is a siphon of her stamina, implied by blurred arm and heaving chest at end. One meaningful deepening suffices and lands with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—“Where are the turtles taking us and why did my brother vanish?”—tightens when pattern spirals converge on the Silent Watchers. One meaningful turn: the whistle’s non-sound triggers bass answer → shell fracture, foreclosing the belief that the city is alive and free. Cost is visible: the fracture vents ancient steam and exposes mechanical captivity. Under Causal lens, agency (blowing the whistle) directly escalates to irreversible knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single dominant stake—truth versus sustaining lie—tightens with each parallel drawn; granary allegory narrows options for the Censor. Agency is centred in Elara; no external rescue, luck complicates nothing. The leaf-petal countdown is a light clock yet sufficient to raise option cost; the final transfer makes the price tactile (sudden personal danger). One wanted an on-page personal risk from Elara beyond possession of the letter to pierce 9-band; her danger is implied, not dramatised pain.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: save one evacuee’s dream from total erasure. Tightening occurs when clearing the granite chunk—failure would abort the vial placement—so physical blockage externalizes emotional stakes. Cost is paid in cold water penetration, lantern fuel, and the invisible loss of public acknowledgment. Under Accumulative lens the cadence shift (wrest → seal → flicker) reweights the pavilion from corpse to capsule; luck complicates but does not decide.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. survival—tightens with every sputter of the air scrubbers. One meaningful turn: the stamp’s click refracts light and dissolves the foundation lie; options narrow from “verify hypothesis” to “own the consequence while oxygen dwindles.” Cost is visible on-page: he accepts possible suffocation when he pockets the stamp. Escalation is causal, driven by his agency under blackout-forced stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can he trap her evaporating dream—tightens once: the prism vanishes, forcing blood tax and origami gamble. Escalation is causal: each polishing stroke strips possibility until only folding remains. Visible prices paid: dress hem shredded, thumb split, dream flattened, grief externalized into an immortal drone. No off-stage rescue; the final image shows the cost still climbing the sky.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—access the wedding’s lost future—remains singular and tightens when each perturbation risks station integrity. Cost is palpable: the vision’s caustic joy burns him, and the final override snaps reality back, leaving him collapsed and alone.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—fill the self—signalled in paragraph 4 and tightened when the static refuses to speak until filtered. Escalation is causal: each star-trait streak narrows viable landing sites; each turn of the chip port raises tactile resistance and the risk of destroying the only key. The final pull forecloses retreat—Pilgrim dies, signal locks, her prior anonymity is irreversible. No reversal is required at this length; one meaningful narrowing is sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can he bear the weight of the truth he once erased—tightens the moment the watch hand’s cold bite replaces abstract guilt with physical mass. Agency drives escalation: his decision to sift the shore, to fight off sweeter memories, to close fist over needle. One meaningful deepening: the false-memory wood offers an easy out; he refuses, narrowing options to single painful truth. Cost is visible in palm imprint and the phrase “accumulated gravity of a life denied.”

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—prisoner’s life—signaled early; pressure tightens when corroded lever snaps, narrowing options to one improvised fix. Silas’s agency drives the turn: he risks his symbolic penance by jamming the pull into steel. Cost is felt immediately—he relinquishes the physical weight of his guilt. No coincidence resolves; moon timing was pre-set.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can Elias pilot any distance today—tightens from boast to renunciation. The single meaningful deepening occurs when fog erases the horizon and the next pylon emerges: external pressure forces tactical pivot, no coincidence involved. Cost is visceral: loss of command identity, audible in the “scraping” plastic hull that replaces the proud ship. The tightening would feel even sharper if a concrete resource (time, stamina, money) were visibly forfeited, holding this just below the 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—recover the capacity to feel—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens once: the lake vision forces a live choice between clinging to proof or sacrificing it to regain grief. Escalation is a single but meaningful deepening that changes knowledge and reweights moral cost. Agency is preserved: he alone decides to throw. Cost is legible—loss of the miracle artifact and permanent exposure to guilt—though the price could be even sharper if the sacrifice carried an external consequence beyond internal feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—rekindling a bond beyond death—tightens through each escalation: scent as hook, descent as threat, metamorphosis as price. Agency is present at every node; the phoenix’s dive is triggered by Elian’s conjuration, not luck. Visible cost scales from scorched coat to crystallized bone to forfeited humanity, all on-page. The tightening beat is the talon grip that fuses their orbit, foreclosing ordinary life; cost is felt in the burning beak kiss that dissolves boundaries. Sufficient for high band, though second micro-turn would have pushed 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“to find where lost time accumulates”—is signaled in paragraph 1; pressure tightens once when the cards reveal the time was discarded, not lost, foreclosing retrieval. Agency: he chooses to misunderstand, paying with permanent forfeiture of reconciliation; cost is visible (“feigned confusion,” shaking finger). Under Accumulative lens, the single deepening is sufficient; no reversal required. Coincidence absent; luck does not resolve. Meets 8.8 band gate; short of 9.0 only because price is emotionally oblique rather than viscerally hammered.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—unlock the door or remain the last witness—is signaled early and tightened once: the tear rejects him, forcing the shadow-stitch. Price is visible: his nausea/rage wave and the irreversible integration of violence. Escalation is causal and sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is “soothe the mountain with living light”; signaled in first third. Escalation is textural: each released bug increases vibrational density until sand becomes permeable conduit. Protagonist agency is present—he chooses to open jars—but the price is conceptual (emptiness) rather than a live option foreclosed. Coincidence complicates but does not resolve; eruption merely pauses, leaving cost legible.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—sever the fort from the authoritarian grid—signals in line 3 and escalates through one decisive tightening: the gnomon rotation that births the Cradle current. Agency is continuous; every beat either smuggles the quill or decodes the dial. Cost is conceptually paid: perpetual risk of discovery and the fort’s irreversible re-frequency. No false coincidence; blackout complicates, her skill resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—create stillness or keep sliding—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates via each added stone and the lethal density of star dust. Agency is relentless: Oren selects the spiral, risks the bluff’s integrity, and commits to the gauntlet throw that costs him physical collapse. The moment friction returns, the reversal narrows future options to “this fragile sanctuary.”

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—make the disappeared visible—tightens once: the solvent either reveals or destroys the map. Pressure escalates via atmospheric density (storm + ether fumes) rather than external antagonist; options narrow to zero on the timer. Cost is legible: if the timing fails, the ink stays black and history stays buried. Agency is the single pour that forecloses retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“decode before Duke arrives”—is signaled in para 1 and tightened by each clash; the sundial’s misaligned bands literally shrink floor space. One decisive deepening: the needle-card shadow proves the exit, turning fight energy into diplomatic alignment. Cost is the hydraulic over-extension that traps Silas’s own prosthetic against the wall—he buys peace with temporary vulnerability. Agency is entirely on-page; coincidence complicates nothing.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—beauty-out-of-ruin—is signaled in opening paragraph and tightened when the tin is buried, trading stealth for floral visibility. Agency is dual but coherent: Silas hauls scrap, Elias dictates placement; both accept the same exposure cost. No external antagonist needed; the implicit patrol suffices as environmental pressure. The moonlit planting is a single decisive turn that narrows options—no retreat once seeds are recorded by lunar witness.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—"one last encore before erasure"—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened twice: first when the mainspring rigs the projector (tool loss), then when the sun dips toward the cloud sea (time loss). Each tightening is protagonist-driven, not coincidence. The cost is visible—bulb life, station dissolution—but the price feels slightly abstract until the final applause-darkness; a more visceral forfeiture (finger blister, memory shred) would have pushed higher. Still, the escalation obeys causal lens and forecloses retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“if he fails, history dissolves”—is declared early and tightened when raindrop strikes like a bullet, forcing bodily shielding of sprout. Escalation is one-step but sufficient for length: hallucination lures → sieve reveals pulse → granite wake → seed roots. Agency is continuous; each reality test forecloses easier illusionary comfort. Cost is visible: comfort traded for cold rock and skin.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single dominant stake—find the color of unspoken apologies—tightens through accumulating sensory beats; no external antagonist is needed because the internal guilt knot thickens until the lace-breath ritual offers the only remaining tactic, paid for with visible bodily cost (tremor, sweat, tears).

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving emotional detachment through scientific framing—is signaled early and deepens when the implant’s preprocessing falters before “pointless beauty,” forcing a reconfiguration of his worldview. This single intensification narrows his options: he can no longer reduce decay to mere physics. Though agency manifests as attention rather than action, the cost is felt—his cold objectivity cracks, replaced by “kindled humility.” Coincidence doesn’t resolve; pressure accumulates texturally via environmental decay, consistent with the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the truth behind the arson—is signaled early and deepens when the ledger strip gains tactical meaning. Pressure tightens coherently: cold, fear, and invisibility give way to thermal observation as agency. The escalation is driven by Elara’s expertise, not coincidence, though the cost (physical pain, emotional isolation) could be more viscerally rendered in the climax. One meaningful deepening suffices, but the price feels slightly abstract at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving the orchids’ “song” as defiance against universal silence—is signaled early and tightens when their thermal aura flickers. Elian’s agency drives escalation: he chooses tactile intervention over automation, escalating effort (striking rod harder) to match rising threat. Cost is felt in physical exhaustion and resurfaced trauma, making stakes viscerally legible under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—silencing the undead noise—is signaled immediately and deepens when Silas realizes acknowledgment, not suppression, grants rest. His agency drives escalation: he forces the lens into the beacon despite its weight and the ghosts’ turbulence. Cost is unmistakable: three days of grueling travel and the physical toll of “slumping” post-ritual. The tightening occurs at the dais—options narrow to one irreversible act—and coincidence never resolves tension.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—survival through solidarity—is signaled early and tightened by the embargo’s chokehold. Elara’s agency drives escalation: organizing runs, enforcing anonymity, consecrating theft as sacrament. Cost is legible in every crate carried and in the bell’s muffled voice. The deepening isn’t tactical but conceptual: transforming charity into communal self-sustenance under amplified quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—is signaled early and deepens when Silas realizes it must be given, not found. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: he chooses to engage the spirit, match her breath, and channel his own stored love. Cost is visible: the “ancient pressure in his heart” lifts only after he sacrifices his hoarded affection. One meaningful tightening suffices, though the escalation leans slightly more textual than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—breaking free from retrocognitive imprisonment—is signaled early and escalates through Elian’s active manipulation of geometry and artifact. The tightening occurs when he forces vines into hyperbolic shapes, narrowing options to a single desperate act. Cost is unmistakable: the disintegration of cherished yet painful memories, paid in emotional vulnerability. Agency drives escalation; coincidence plays no role.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—protecting seeds from looters—is signaled early and tightens as glass shatters and intruders arrive. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he decodes, inserts, twists—all under rising threat. The trade-off is stark: deny the mob food today for children’s tomorrow. Cost is felt in his calm surrender; no coincidence resolves tension—he alone executes the analog cipher under fire.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—capturing the sound of trust breaking—is signaled early and tightens via the mitotic deadline, forcing frantic pacing. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she pilots drones, curates voids, activates the Forge. Cost is unmistakable: neural lattice absorbs “jagged shape of betrayal,” she tastes iron, leans back “exhausted.” Under an Accumulative lens, the deepening isn’t causal but textural—the crescendo of indigo aurora coincides with imprint completion, reweighting silence as weaponized knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—capturing ephemeral truth before it fades—is signaled early and tightens when moonbeams force reinterpretation. Agency lies in Elara’s choice to develop the image, which narrows options from observation to confrontation. Cost is unmistakable: her invisibility shatters when the subject sees *her*. Escalation is driven by her own method (moonbeam alchemy), not coincidence, deepening stakes from theft to communion.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving intellectual freedom in a repressive regime—is signaled early and deepens as the melt destabilizes Elias’s sanctuary. The tightening occurs when the glacier’s boom and tilting floor foreclose stasis, forcing migration. Agency is clear: Elias chooses fragility over safety. Cost is felt (lost workshop, untransportable dome), though the external threat remains abstract—no on-page enforcers—keeping stakes slightly conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—survival against engineered obsolescence—is signaled early and tightens via Julian’s countdown. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he doesn’t flee but weaponizes his anxiety to outthink his creator. The meaningful deepening occurs when vulnerability shifts from liability to asset, forcing a trade-off (endure terror to gain control). Cost is unmistakable: he must remain in the dark he fears to survive, crystallizing stance under coherent pressure. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from Elias’s choices within established constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—drawing a map before total darkness—is signaled early and tightens as the last star dims. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: Elara interprets silence gaps, translates marbled hush into charcoal lines, and places the final gold flake. Cost is unmistakable: the booklet stripped bare, light extinguished, storm dead. One meaningful deepening suffices—the shift from observing silence to embodying the void’s texture—and it reweights the entire endeavor.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—containing temporal fallout before tomorrow’s wedding—is signaled early and deepens when 734 chooses delicate amalgamation over incineration, narrowing options under time pressure. Protagonist agency drives escalation: his curiosity compels him to seek thought’s origin within the debris, raising emotional stakes. Cost is legible—the violin grows “heavy with accumulated sorrow,” and his unanswered quest exacts conceptual toll. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via densifying paradoxes and tightening deadline.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—restoring trust in a post-verbal world—is signaled early and tightens when Mara raises shields. Elian’s agency drives escalation: he chooses vulnerability by revealing illicit tickets, not waiting for exoneration. Cost is felt (career risk, emotional exposure), though the black-market accusation resolves slightly easily. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each doodle deepens emotional frequency until barriers crack.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether life persists beyond measurable luck—is signaled early and tightened when Elian repurposes his fraudulent marbles into functional lenses. His agency drives escalation: polishing the cracked glass isn’t ritual but calculation, forcing a trade-off between societal irrelevance and personal efficacy. Cost is unmistakable in his gnarled hands and the sub-prefect’s frustrated gauge. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens, culminating in the vine’s turgor as physical rebuttal to actuarial death.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—proving time moves sideways—is signaled early and tightens when the magnetic nexus aligns, forcing Elian’s irreversible choice. His agency drives escalation: jury-rigging the array, pulling the lever. Cost is unmistakable: he gains proof but must feign ignorance tomorrow, enduring isolation. Coincidence (twilight storms) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the breakthrough stems solely from his action.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the ghost’s code—is signaled early and deepens when water stillness becomes a lock requiring kinetic disruption. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his splash accelerates dissolution, directly causing the map’s emergence. Cost is felt in the physical drag of water “like grabbing hands” and culminates in the irreversible loss of the program. Coincidence never resolves; the ghost’s will guides but doesn’t override Elias’s pivotal action.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to reveal an irreversible climate cascade—is signaled early and deepens when Elias chooses oblique sabotage over direct input. His agency drives escalation: the smudge forces the system to widen confidence intervals, trading immediate panic for solitary foresight. Cost is unmistakable: “the crushing solitude of his position” and bearing witness alone. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, intensifying through embodied entropy (tremor, fever residue) rather than external antagonism.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether negligence stains heavier than malice—is signaled early and deepens when the radio caller’s confession aligns with the valve’s position, forcing Silas to confront his own parallel failure. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: he chooses to interpret the radio, steps into danger, and ultimately releases the wheel in judgment. The cost—emotional burden slightly eased but not erased—is legible in his departure. Coincidence (caller’s words) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Silas’s insight is earned through accumulated sensory data.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory versus accepting entropy—is signaled early and tightens when the subterranean river swells, forcing action. Elara’s agency lies in choosing transition over resistance; the cost is surrendering physical archives for metaphysical stillness. Escalation is driven by environmental pressure (rising damp, cracking floor), not coincidence, under an Accumulative lens. Though stakes remain internal, their weight intensifies through concrete sensory cues, culminating in a decisive renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—piercing dementia’s fog to restore momentary connection—is signaled early and deepened by the eclipse’s narrow window. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he times the curl’s placement precisely at totality, narrowing options to one irreplaceable moment. Cost is felt in Elara’s vulnerability and Elias’s restrained exuberance; one misstep would shatter the atmosphere. Coincidence (the eclipse) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the success hinges on his prepared ritual, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering the last dream’s truth—is signaled early and tightens when Elian confronts the astronomer’s madness. His agency drives escalation: choosing to probe ash, interpret the tapestry, and bear witness. Cost is legible in the world’s irreversible insomnia and the structure’s centuries-long scream finally silenced. However, external opposition is minimal; pressure stems from environment and history, which fits the Situational-Accumulative hybrid but slightly softens conflict intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—breaking free from fatalistic espionage—is signaled early and tightens when prophecy bleeds into reality. Arthur’s agency drives escalation: he chooses chaotic signaling over passive relay. Cost is unmistakable: relinquishing control over outcomes, accepting ambiguity. Coincidence complicates (natural deaths mimicking hits) but doesn’t resolve; closure stems from his decisive act.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preventing Elias’s surrender to absolute negation—is signaled early and tightens via time pressure (“before possession completes”). Kellen’s agency drives escalation: each rhetorical layer narrows the entity’s hold, culminating in a trade-off between recursive logic and natural silence. Cost is felt in Elias’s gasp and tears; the “infinite weight” hyperbole crystallizes moral calculus. Minor deduction: time pressure isn’t actively tracked beyond initial setup.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reconciling past and present through sonic alignment—is signaled early and tightens as exhaustion looms and dawn approaches. The meaningful deepening occurs when the mirrored horizon forms, transforming visual symmetry into auditory possibility. Silas’s agency drives the escalation: he maps, listens, conducts. Cost is legible in his physical fatigue and the narrow window of opportunity; though not catastrophic, the price of failure (continued dissonance) is emotionally palpable. Coincidence (perfect atmospheric clarity) complicates but doesn’t resolve—he must still act.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—conquering the labyrinth of self—is signaled early and tightens when the tablet crumbles, forcing Elara to act without its guidance. Her agency drives escalation: trusting the runes creates the walkway; choosing gravity over buoyancy fuses timelines. Cost is unmistakable: trading omnipresence for “crushing” reality. The droplet’s timeframe adds tension, though its elastic time occasionally dilutes immediacy rather than sharpening tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—breaking emotional numbness—is signaled early and deepens when backward playback forces confrontation with buried grief. Escalation is driven by Silas’s agency: rigging the turntable, lowering the jagged needle. The cost—raw sorrow replacing numbness—is unmistakable at climax (“tears… hot and sudden”). One meaningful deepening suffices; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving uncorrupted truth—tightens decisively when the gate splinters and instruments are smashed, forcing Elara to choose between fleeing or saving data. Her lateral climb is a high-agency response under pressure, narrowing options visibly. Cost is felt in the loss of her life’s work, though the intruders’ motive remains slightly opaque. Escalation follows Situational logic: coherent external pressure crystallizes her stance without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding scent-triggered grief—is signaled early and tightens when Elara removes her mask, risking olfactory trauma for truth. Agency drives escalation: she activates UV light, inhales, and chooses to grieve. Cost is felt in bodily collapse and emotional hemorrhage. The deepening occurs when scent becomes spatial reconstruction, altering knowledge and foreclosing denial.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—grasping time’s texture—tightens irreversibly when the rope smokes, forcing the binary: survivor or verse. Silas’s agency drives escalation (laying spiral, scraping wall), and the deepening reveals time’s true nature as friction, not flow. Cost is unmistakable: relinquishing perfection for “the beauty of the unfinished.” The energy beings’ glow intensifies pressure without resolving it; coincidence complicates but never solves.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving resonance against the chronic hush—is signaled early and deepens when Elara’s playing finds the dome’s resonant frequency, turning environment into ally. Agency lies in attention and endurance: she chooses unresolved beauty over false salvation, foreclosing escape narratives with visible cost (calloused hands, scavenged tinder). Pressure escalates texturally—the hush “fights back”—but the tightening is earned through her precise auditory control. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the fire’s crackle merely punctuates her deliberate act.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—surviving unbearable grief—is signaled early and deepens via Silas’s refusal of crude forgetting. The meaningful tightening occurs when he offers “half truths,” narrowing Elara’s options from oblivion to softened memory. Cost is felt: she surrenders truth for bearability, trading agony for sedation. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (Silas’s craft, Elara’s inhalation) under an Accumulative lens, though the pressure curve leans slightly more atmospheric than causal—just shy of 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—delivering a lost heirloom to restore memory—is signaled early and deepens into emotional reciprocity. Pressure escalates through Elias’s internal resistance (“professional caution… made him hesitate”) and culminates in his vulnerable ask to sit and talk. Cost is visible: emotional exposure replaces profit-driven logic, and the librarian surrenders her guard. One meaningful tightening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—belonging through authentic contribution—tightens when Elara’s hum breaks communal stoicism, risking rejection. Her agency drives escalation: she initiates care, discovers the tag, and weaves the reeds, each act narrowing options (e.g., sacrificing precious stalks). Cost is legible in the elders’ assessing eyes and the boy’s scraped knee—a physical price that alters group dynamics. Coincidence never resolves; the tag’s discovery stems from her tactile attention.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—capturing the primal echo before the giant wakes—is signaled early and tightens relentlessly. The “interrupted cadence” deepens pressure by threatening stasis itself, forcing Elara to act faster. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to borrow time, climb, uncage, and sketch. Cost is visceral and cumulative—lost lifespan, physical decay—and directly alters tactics (e.g., frantic sketching once the door opens). The giant’s groan isn’t coincidence; it’s the logical consequence of biological rhythm disrupted by her intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—mapping his daughter’s disappearance via emotional mathematics—tightens when the ritual yields incomplete data (a meadow, not her), forcing recalibration over resignation. Pressure escalates through Silas’s agency: his “gentle invention” (aligning eyes, pouring sap) risks nothing physical but everything emotionally—hope itself. Cost is felt: he accepts continued uncertainty, yet the new variable forecloses despair. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the moon’s angle merely illuminates his own method’s partial success.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—making hidden history visible—is signaled early and tightens when the blackout threatens climate control and the librarian’s despair peaks. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to uncover, interpret, and deliver the tape despite personal risk. The deepening occurs via sense memory linking past institutional loss to present need. Cost is felt in his sacrificed invisibility, though the blackout’s resolution slightly softens external pressure—luck complicates but doesn’t resolve, keeping stakes coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving humanity against involuntary metamorphosis—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes resistance accelerates his petrification. The tightening turn (“frantic attempt to reconstruct his old self was the very thing killing him”) narrows options to surrender or death. Cost is unmistakable: he forfeits his life’s work and mammalian body. Agency drives escalation—his grafting error, gloveless handling, and obsessive reconstruction all compound pressure, making the final renunciation feel inevitable yet costly.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—distilling ruin into art—is signaled early and deepened by exhaustion and failing light. The brooch exchange narrows options: survival vs. symbolic completion. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; cost (water filter) alters tactics permanently. Coincidence (squall) complicates but doesn’t resolve—Elias’s agency drives the descent and trade.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—perceiving true magic—is signaled early and deepens when the pearl’s “steadily unpredictable” signature defies Elara’s linear models. The meaningful tightening occurs at the shadow-bridge moment, where her choice to reach out (habitual scrying) inadvertently enables the revelation, foreclosing her old path with felt cost. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, though the unseen forces’ intervention borders on convenient without clearer prior signaling.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reknitting community after exile—is signaled early and deepens when Elian realizes banners/feasts lack “the voice required.” His agency drives escalation: choosing staggered intervals over a single blast narrows options (risking misinterpretation as warning) but enables emotional permission. Cost is unmistakable: he trades archival detachment for vulnerable public authorship, with silence’s “permanent alienation” as the avoided price. Pressure tightens once, decisively, under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—facing suppressed truth—is signaled early and tightens when pavement arrows lead to a chasm with no bridge. The dare (punching emptiness) is protagonist-driven agency under Accumulative pressure. Cost is unmistakable: confronting her own fragility. One meaningful deepening suffices, and here it reweights the entire premise—mapping shifts from evasion to integration.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving intangible history against institutional erasure—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes the numbers encode “emotional coordinates.” The meaningful tightening occurs when she shifts from transcription to translation, accepting reputational risk. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: each copied number settles memory, raising the cost of stopping. Though coincidence (whale migration timing) complicates, resolution stems from Elara’s agency, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—discovering what lies beyond farewell—is signaled immediately and deepens through Elian’s escalating intrusion into cosmic forces. His agency drives every escalation: dragging solar storm lines, twisting magnetic fields, applying torque until reality fractures. Cost is unmistakable: the amulet cracks with “pure loss,” his body unravels, the dimension collapses. The tightening forecloses all paths but one—annihilation-as-understanding—and the price is paid in atoms and awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—Elena’s asylum—is signaled early and deepens when Vance slaps down the rejection, narrowing options to Julian’s ink gambit. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: Julian’s “waiting actively” and ink offer force Vance’s hand. Cost is unmistakable—Vance loses his ideological certainty, trembling as empathy invades. The tightening forecloses legal rigidity, making the trade (chaos for life) feel earned, not coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—capturing a nonexistent memory with perfect fidelity—tightens at the lamp’s pitch dip, forcing Elara into a high-wire act of timing. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses the prism angle based on sound, actively weaving illusion. The cost is felt in the “microscopic roughness” mimicking “concrete and old regrets”—a tactile embodiment of emotional toll. Though stakes remain internal, they’re viscerally rendered; the neon melancholy isn’t declared but embedded in gold leaf and buzz.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—resurrecting erased histories through emotional archaeology—is signaled early and tightens when the poison label demands synthesis, narrowing options to the narrator’s method alone. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: choosing which auditory fragments to layer creates ironic contrast (“laughter... pressed into the fiber... against the lethal symbol”), deepening thematic tension between commerce and memory. Cost is felt in the “invisible weight” accrued by the label and the narrator’s permanent liminality (“nameless identity”). Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification—the label’s transformation into a “monument to despair”—suffices; pressure remains coherent without false resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—decoding whether the universe has narrative—is signaled early and deepens when the compass forces confrontation with buried truths. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to play, to listen, to retell. Cost is unmistakable: his lifelong identity as debunker is foreclosed, replaced by vulnerability. The tightening from skepticism to acceptance occurs through his own actions under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving the Jubilee’s autonomy against privatization—is signaled early and tightens through Elara’s escalating sabotage. Her agency drives every turn: decoding blueprints, orchestrating movement via graffiti, relocating the stone. The cost is felt in communal silence and packed heirlooms, and conceptual in the legal fiction she engineers. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Causal escalation until the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving the last true night—is signaled early and tightens via the chemical strip’s countdown, foreclosing retreat. Agency manifests as endurance (“outlast the patrol drones... frost... temptation”), not action, fitting the Situational lens. Cost is felt: physical agony, isolation, and the irreversible loss of natural darkness. One meaningful deepening occurs—the “dawning hush” heightens tension before illumination—but escalation relies slightly on external timing (orbital array) rather than purely protagonist-driven pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake (restore drone before launch) intensifies cleanly; tightening occurs when anchor lifts—physical deadline crystallizes pressure. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses method, pace, and firmware rewrite. Cost is legible—the ship departs regardless, but his precision ensures the drone meets it. No false hope or deus ex machina; success hinges on earned skill under constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—finding the origin of flow—is signaled early and deepens when Silas realizes truth exceeds cartography. Pressure escalates texturally: stillness → falcon → breath-map → decision to withhold. The cost is conceptual but legible: he gains knowledge he cannot share, foreclosing dissemination. Though coincidence (falcon as signal) complicates, resolution stems from Silas’s agency—his breath, his choice—not external luck. One meaningful tightening suffices, though a sharper physical trade-off would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preventing collapse by restoring shared balance—is signaled early and escalates coherently under Accumulative pressure: discord intensifies until the keystone threatens to shatter, forcing Silas’s intervention. His agency is subtle but decisive: each rhythmic act (tapping paver, resonant thud) narrows options, compelling others into alignment. The cost is visible in his exhaustion and the fragility of the reprieve—the town’s entropy isn’t cured, merely delayed. Coincidence never resolves; unity emerges solely from Silas’s orchestrated cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transmitting the vanished world’s truth—is signaled early and tightens when oxygen warning forces urgency. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she overrides panic to free cables, with each move narrowing options (buoyancy vest vs. altar). Cost is unmistakable (hypoxia, CO₂ peak, death), though the “gathered hush” borders on abstract. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; success stems from disciplined action under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—escaping scapegoating after foreseeing disaster—is signaled early and tightens when sailors’ deaths are imminent. Elian’s agency drives escalation: he seeks not freedom but narrative erasure (“thread a labyrinth with your own story”). Cost is unmistakable: he must vanish entirely, surrendering even the chance to prove truth. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of silence, light, and hidden dimensions reweights his options until disappearance becomes inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—curing terminal illness through ancestral payment—is signaled early and escalates via the bead’s activation, which awakens hostile flora and summons the ghost bride. Pressure tightens when she manifests fragmentarily, testing Julian’s resolve before solidifying. The cost is legible: survival demands the loss of his spectral guardian. Though escalation hinges slightly on the environment’s reaction (a minor Accumulative bleed), protagonist agency (raising the bead, speaking aloud) drives the turn under a predominantly Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—defying fatalism to restore connection—is signaled early and tightens when Elara risks death to sew chasms. Escalation is driven by her agency: choosing trance over fear, dragging cable through protesting stone. Cost is unmistakable in her collapse and the irreversible commitment to rebellion. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each loop deepens the web until dawn locks the change.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming continuity severed by exile—is signaled early and escalates through tangible discoveries that mirror familial rupture. Elara’s agency drives every turn: she chooses to follow roots, excavate gently, and rebuild. The cost is felt in time, physical effort, and emotional vulnerability (“fragile belief”), culminating in the irreversible commitment to mend what was broken. Pressure tightens cleanly under the Accumulative lens without coincidence or off-stage resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving human-scale resistance against total surveillance—is signaled early and intensified by the chalk code’s urgency versus the medium’s required slowness. Elian’s agency lies in deliberate fabrication: choosing a name, folding the letter, walking to the chute. The tightening occurs in the friction between rush and ritual, culminating in a trade-off—time versus authenticity—with visible cost: once mailed, the message is exposed to chaos. No coincidence resolves conflict; the entire escalation is driven by Elian’s careful invention under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—truth versus tyranny—is signaled early and tightens when Kael’s deadline forces Lysa into high-risk quantum stitching. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she chooses to look through adjacent possibilities, synchronizes needle with flame, and encodes betrayal. Cost is unmistakable: exhaustion, re-assumed vulnerability, and the burden of solitary witness. The trap within the asteroid belt forecloses Kael’s path while preserving Chancellor’s chance—earned through Lysa’s precise, costly action.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (deciphering unspoken love) tightens when the shard fuses under moonlight, raising hope, then deepens with the condensation message. Julian’s agency drives escalation: he brings the shard, reads the glass, and chooses action. Cost is visible—the message weeps away, foreclosing direct reconciliation but crystallizing his duty to respond now. Coincidence (clouds parting) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Elara’s ritual does the work.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—shielding Leo from inherited trauma—is signaled early and tightens when Elias deciphers the mother’s mortar-warning. His agency drives escalation: decryption leads to deliberate rewriting, narrowing options from passive observer to active healer. Cost is unmistakable in the “tightness in his chest” and trembling hand, paid before the surgeon returns. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each scribble deepens collective anxiety until his lullaby rebalances it.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming creative joy—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes random strokes fail; she must ground art in history. Her agency drives escalation: interfacing with the knowledge network, then applying exposed film logic. Cost is visible: the orchard fades despite her effort, reinforcing theme. Pressure tightens coherently under Accumulative lens—each light-stroke intensifies emotional stakes without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—truth as fixed artifact vs. fluid experience—is signaled early and deepens through Elian’s agency: tossing the coin initiates the cascade. Each shard tightens pressure by stripping away layers of identity (restorer → carver → sound wave), foreclosing return to certainty. Cost is felt in the “heavy coat of knowing” dissolving and the “dull thud” of the landed nickel—art as survival, not preservation. Coincidence (the whistle) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Elian’s choice drives all turns.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—cognitive sovereignty—is signaled early (“thoughts became taxable assets”) and tightens when raid breaches perimeter, forcing Julian’s irreversible choice. Escalation is protagonist-driven: his floral messaging enables the rendezvous; his seed deployment triggers collapse. Cost is unmistakable: twelve lives lost for the seed, systemic chaos as price. Coincidence (raid timing) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the victory stems from Julian’s preparedness.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—converting eternal grief into living beauty—is signaled early and tightens via the ritual’s progression. The meaningful deepening occurs when Elias chooses to bury the postcard, foreclosing perpetual mourning. Cost is unmistakable: he loses his last physical tether but gains atmospheric warmth and “strangely light” heart. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves his arc.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.3)
    The dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—is signaled early and deepens when the gray-pulsing orchid reveals imminent loss. Elian’s agency drives escalation: he diagnoses, removes, and repairs the chime using only voice and memory, narrowing options to a single fragile method. The cost is felt in his “trembling fingers” and “heavy satisfaction,” and the restored note carries tangible consequence—the orchid’s indigo revival. No coincidence resolves the crisis; success hinges on his knowledge and sacrifice of emotional stamina.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring trust through linguistic truth—is signaled early and tightens when Elara weaponizes Veritas Aeterna, risking magical collapse to force honesty. Escalation is protagonist-driven: her vow-weaving transforms dissonance into resonance, narrowing options from flight to confrontation. Cost is visible in physical exertion and emotional exposure (“cautious exuberance” implies fragility). Coincidence doesn’t resolve; Kael’s shift stems from witnessing her sacrifice, not external luck.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—saving the Outer Ring from thirst—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Elian uses the chain to subvert the gate closure. Escalation is driven by his agency: dissolving adhesive, interpreting the blueprint, timing the intervention to the volcano’s breath. Cost is unmistakable: irreversible treason with lifelong isolation. The bypass fails if the chain snaps—a live, physical peril that narrows options to one millimeter of tolerance.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving the meteorite’s song—tightens when the woman arrives with receipts, forcing Elian to choose between concealment and collaboration. His agency drives escalation: he abandons lies, performs the balancing act, and releases Aero *with* her. Cost is visible: forfeited anonymity. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; coincidence doesn’t resolve—her knowledge stems from his textual clues.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring necessary distance—is signaled early and deepens when the logbook reveals the pilot’s transgression. Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency: her intuition of the wood’s history leads to the decisive insight. The tightening forecloses the path of connection (“not build bridges”) in favor of separation, with conceptual cost (sacrificing unity for coherence). Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, though the “chaotic winds of probability” flirt with abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—belonging—is signaled early and deepens when the ostracod display forces Elara to confront her observer stance. The tightening occurs when Kael dims the lights: a choice that enables the miracle but demands vulnerability. Cost is felt in her relinquished feather and abandoned celestial mapping. Though coincidence (tidal bloom timing) complicates, resolution stems from Elara’s renunciation, not external luck.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—discovering why paths vanish—is signaled early and tightens when the sea-foam begins to pop, imposing a live clock. Elara’s conjecture (“It wasn’t fear… it was hope”) is a high-agency choice that narrows options: she must risk emotional projection or lose the truth forever. The cost is legible—she trades empirical certainty for intuitive guesswork—and the deepening (voluntary departure vs. destruction) reweights her life’s mission. Coincidence (bird dropping seeds) complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—breaking monotony through engineered wonder—is signaled early and tightens via Elias’s precise adjustments. Pressure escalates coherently: rising tide + structural sway narrow his window for intervention. The woman’s stumble is complication, not resolution; the payout results from Elias’s prior design (causal agency). Cost is felt in his erasure—success demands invisibility—but the escalation lacks a second meaningful deepening beyond setup/payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving forbidden memory against systemic erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the verse hardens into biology, making it immune to enforcers. Agency drives escalation: Lyra chooses alignment, inscription, and exile. Cost is felt in pain and permanent departure, though the external antagonism (drones, ban) remains abstract rather than dramatized. One meaningful deepening suffices: the verse transforms from act to identity.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—validating his work’s worth—is signaled early and tightens when he fears the day will “expose the crudeness.” The stone-throwing ritual is his agency under pressure, narrowing options to acceptance or despair. Cost is felt in his relinquished anxiety and affirmed purpose. Escalation is subtle but sufficient: mist thins, light shifts, tension peaks at sunrise—all coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—translating private pain into cosmic resonance—is signaled early and tightens when Silas opens the box, narrowing options to ritual release. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: his reflection deepens understanding, leading to the decisive scatter. Cost is unmistakable—the loss of his friend’s physical residue—but luck never resolves tension. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—revitalizing spiritual stagnation—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: Elian doesn’t wait for inspiration but engineers interventions. The tightening occurs when he releases the balloon, narrowing options to success or irreversible entropy. Cost is unmistakable: the “heavy brass instrument” implies burden, and the rewritten present feels “heavier and more real,” suggesting emotional toll. Luck complicates (frantic gauge spinning) but resolution stems from his precise craftsmanship.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—uncovering hidden truth—tightens when Elias shifts from mapping safety to bearing witness. The deepening occurs at the diary’s confession: stakes escalate from structural integrity to moral accountability. Agency is maintained through excavation and retrieval; coincidence doesn’t resolve. Cost is felt in “crushing reality” and the final click—now charged with knowledge. One meaningful pressure shift suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—showing redemption before it’s real—is signaled early and tightens as the bell approaches. Elara’s agency drives escalation: humming, borrowing heartbeat, guiding light. Cost is legible in her transience (“too much like mist”) and the spell’s fragility. The bell’s toll isn’t coincidence—it’s a live clock that forces precision, raising tension without resolving via luck.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—securing a treaty that “bleeds into the soil”—is signaled early and deepens when Kaelen demands names of lost children, transforming abstract “redemption” into visceral debt. Escalation is driven by Kaelen’s agency: his ritual reframes the conflict, forcing Hark and Vena to confront personal loss. The cost is unmistakable—their signatures bind factions to peace built on graves, and Kaelen absorbs their sorrow. Pressure coheres under the Situational lens, with the celestial clock tightening every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—Vance’s need to reconcile destruction with preservation—is signaled early and tightens when he kneels to place the egg, a gesture that forecloses profit logic for sentimental futility. Pressure escalates texturally: silence expands, thunder vibrates “like a thousand wings,” the storm threatens but won’t reach. His agency drives the deepening—not coincidence—and the cost is unmistakable: he nurtures a life destined to starve, singing to no one. This isn’t rescue; it’s penance without absolution, and the price is legible in every salt-coated step away.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving chaotic thought against enforced conformity—is signaled early and deepens when Elara trades her defining refusal for collective freedom. Escalation is driven by her agency: she chooses to untangle the spell despite pain and detection. Cost is unmistakable: she gives away the intimacy she “hoarded,” altering her identity. The Magistrate’s dawning betrayal raises pressure without resolving via coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—truth in storytelling—is signaled early and deepens when Silas rejects violent climax for ethical ambiguity. His agency drives escalation: the wrist flick reverses narrative causality, narrowing options to a single resonant stillness. Cost is felt in the crowd’s vertigo and the heckler’s silenced rage. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each backward puppet motion reweights moral certainty without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—honoring uncelebrated extinction—is signaled early and deepens when the moth wing appears, forcing Elias to expand his monument mid-ritual. The tightening occurs when the monarch lands beside the wing: the contrast sharpens the moral calculus between fame and anonymity. Pressure remains coherent under an Accumulative lens; the cost (scattering both into the abyss) is felt in the sky’s “apology” and Elias’s departure. Agency is quiet but decisive: his attention forecloses memorial permanence.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving forgotten names through material transformation—is signaled early and deepens via the irreversible sacrifice of the paper card. Pressure escalates coherently under the Accumulative lens: each step (coating, curing, rope-reconfiguring) narrows options until only casting remains. Cost is legible: the ash of memory becomes bronze, and the warmth in his chest replaces cold regret—a trade-off earned by his precise, fragile labor.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—navigating temporal blindness to act in the unseeable now—is signaled early and tightens when foresight/hindsight reveal forest flattened and bunker flooded. Elara’s agency drives escalation: trance → dream → excavation → seal-breaking → lever-pull. Cost is unmistakable: rejecting linear safety means embracing chaos, with the storm’s entry as irreversible consequence. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each sensory and prophetic layer intensifies the imperative to act.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving empirical knowledge against erasure—is signaled early and escalates through Bel-ibni’s precise, self-limiting actions. The tightening occurs when he initiates the ritual not out of faith but data-driven certainty, trading physical survival for cosmic continuity. Cost is unmistakable: he surrenders the city, his safety, and even the tile’s potency, all while Persian drums thunder below. Agency remains absolute; no coincidence resolves the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—forcing surrender as evolution—is signaled early and tightens when Kaelen recognizes the cylinder as mockery of his legacy. Elian’s agency drives escalation: he chooses touch over violence, initiating cellular memory. Cost is felt (“resentment’s chokehold”) but could be more physically manifest beyond the sword’s liquefaction. Pressure remains coherent under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—capturing the dream before losing oneself to the mist—is signaled early and escalates through Silas’s breath-syncing, which tightens physics’ grip until boundaries dissolve. The meaningful deepening occurs when the dream materializes as an ice cathedral, forcing Silas to choose between merging with it or anchoring as witness—a trade-off with visible cost (frost binding him, near-assimilation). Agency drives every escalation; coincidence never resolves. Cost is unmistakable: he endures petrification to forge beauty, crystallizing Charged Poise at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—repairing the breach to teach children that “maintenance is a form of love”—is signaled early and tightens when standard tools fail, forcing Elara to choose vulnerability over control. The escalation is driven by her agency: she persists, digs into her satchel, and selects the ribbon based on memory, not luck. Cost is felt in her physical strain and the conceptual surrender of “evergreen” thinking. Coincidence complicates (rot festers) but never resolves—the solution emerges from character history under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving lineage via correct carving—is signaled early and tightens when Elian learns the shell came from his future great-great-grandson. The meaningful deepening occurs at the tree: realizing existence is “confined between first and last page” narrows options to one desperate act. Protagonist agency drives escalation (retreat → inquiry → insight → resolve), and cost is unmistakable: wrong face = erased bloodline. Coincidence (holographic manifest) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Elian’s choice closes the loop.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—rescuing the Traveler from his refusal to accept the past—is signaled early and tightens at the golem confrontation. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her research identifies a gap, which becomes leverage. The cost is conceptual (incomplete knowledge = flawed authority) and felt (Traveler’s aged torment). Pressure coheres causally, with no coincidence; the mountain’s rules are consistent and tested.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reuniting with her absorbed twin—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes separation is unnecessary. The meaningful tightening occurs in the garden: she abandons her quest mid-beat, shifting from active pursuit to passive acceptance. Agency drives escalation—her narrative-thread method enables entry, but her choice to stop speaking the path solidifies closure. Cost is felt: she forfeits conversation but gains solace, a trade-off legible under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preventing institutional amnesia—is signaled early and escalates coherently. Pressure tightens when Elian confronts the frayed rope: two dissonant histories demand synthesis. His agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves the conflict. The cost—dissolving the irreplaceable wax seal—is felt in the final image. One meaningful deepening suffices: the shift from observing absence to actively weaving truth back into being.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—survival through acoustic resistance—is signaled early and tightens when Elara kneels at the frozen lake, narrowing options to one desperate act. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she reads the ice, strikes the stone, conjures the counter-song. Cost is felt in her trembling body and the stone’s post-use dimming. Though pressure peaks coherently, the energy beings lack adaptive response, slightly flattening opposition complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transmitting the beacon—is signaled early and tightens when silence collapses “under the weight of the world’s accumulated noise,” forcing manual gear-cranking. Agency is clear: Elara’s alignment choice narrows options (only Navigator’s geometry works), with visible cost in straining muscles and breathlessness. Coincidence (finding prism at cycle’s end) complicates but doesn’t resolve; she must still act. Pressure coheres under Situational lens, though escalation lacks a second meaningful turn beyond initial setup.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving collective identity amid civilizational contraction—is signaled early and tightens when the shadow crosses into “preservation,” forcing Elara to reconceive her people as guardians, not conquerors. Escalation is driven by her agency: she chooses to listen, observe, interpret, and finally write. The cost is conceptual (abandoning expansionist hope) and emotional (bearing sole witness), made undeniable when voices fade and silence becomes absolute. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens without coincidence or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—defying collective hopelessness—is signaled early and deepens when the mosaic recipe raises the artistic stakes. Elian’s agency drives escalation: he reads the air, adapts his mix, ignites the display. Cost is felt in the transience of the spectacle and his immediate departure, though the refugees’ transformation leans slightly abstract. Under the Accumulative lens, one decisive intensification (the emerald bloom) suffices, and pressure coheres without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving a shared coastal life—is signaled early and deepens when Kael announces his departure. Elara’s agency lies in attention: by studying the starfish, she foresees her future and chooses Earned Stasis. The tightening occurs in the ripple that heralds incoming sea, which crystallizes her stance. Cost is visible (“only the wind would answer her hum”) and scales perfectly to length. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens—density of marine imagery intensifies until release.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—harvesting silence as antidote to inherited terror—is signaled early and deepens when gravity inverts, raising pressure via time constraint (“hour,” “temporary”). Elara’s agency drives escalation: her sensory denial technique enables the Gilded Hush’s manifestation, and sealing the doll forecloses infinite sky for portable peace. Cost is unmistakable in the “vengeance” of returning weight and gasping recoil. Coincidence (celestial alignment) complicates but doesn’t resolve; success hinges on her disciplined ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—maintaining buoyancy through controlled silence—is signaled early and tightens when the train whistle introduces hostile noise, forcing Elian’s catalytic intervention. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: his single drop reweights the atmosphere, converting crushing void into “soothing blanket.” Cost is unmistakable: the ever-present threat of psychic noise derailing the gondola, now temporarily neutralized but never eliminated. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens via density shift and cadence modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—claiming the Unclaimed Throne before incineration—is signaled early and tightens via the solar reset klaxons, which force Elara’s leap onto unstable stairs. Agency is clear: her sally forth is a decisive choice under duress, not luck. Cost is felt in the dissolving orchard below and the irreversible commitment to rule. Escalation lacks a second meaningful deepening beyond time pressure, keeping it just shy of 9.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—freedom versus attachment—is signaled early and tightened when Elian reframes the ring as “the only thing keeping you on the threshold.” The escalation is protagonist-driven: Mara’s realization shifts agency from passive endurance to active release. Cost is unmistakable: dropping the ring forfeits her last tether to identity (“I will have nothing”), yet enables breath. Under an Accumulative lens, this deepening—where silence becomes breathable rather than suffocating—reweights the entire premise with visceral stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preventing ecosystem collapse from a collapsing quantum promise—is signaled early via glitchy texts and intensifies coherently. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he *chooses* to volunteer, then *funnels* pressure into the bolt, narrowing options to one hardened point. The cost is unmistakable: physical strain, obliterated talisman, and the diamond’s origin in “multiverse’s worth of anxiety.” Coincidence complicates (texts arrive), but resolution stems entirely from Elias’s tactics under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—exposing the Emperor’s lie—is signaled early and escalates through Elian’s intuitive calibration of sound. The tightening occurs when he must abandon logic for embodied rhythm, narrowing options to a single resonant frequency. Cost is unmistakable: physical exhaustion, irreversible exposure, and the shattering of imperial myth. Agency drives every escalation; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—capturing unformed potential—is signaled early and deepens via Valerius’s ritual performance, which narrows options to one irreversible act: unsnapping the pod. Escalation is protagonist-driven; each marionette-like step aligns with lay lines, tightening pressure until reality itself unravels. Cost is visceral: armor loses weight, past identity dissolves, and he drifts into terrifying void. Coincidence never resolves; agency lies entirely in his pledged allegiance and trembling hands.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—validating unseen love against bureaucratic erasure—is signaled early and deepens when dust contradicts logs. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his interpretation of sediment leads to opening the file, which yields the button, which compels his addendum. The cost is felt in his trembling hands and the irreversible alteration of an official record. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure tightens through layered evidence, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving unedited history—is signaled early and tightens when the extraction team fails to appear, forcing solo action. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses stillness over flight, reads reflections, and wades into toxic water. Each decision narrows options and incurs cost (exposure, contamination). The climax reweights everything: truth replaces lie, but at personal risk, fulfilling the Situational lens’s demand for stance crystallization under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—silencing a universe-ending prophecy—is signaled early and tightens via the dewdrop countdown. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his negative-space playing actively counters the machine’s algorithm. Cost is unmistakable: metaphysical exhaustion, trembling hands, and lingering nostalgia that sharpens after victory. The single meaningful deepening (vested hush as binding contract) narrows options to one fragile tactic, paid for in bodily and emotional toll.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—answering the tree’s message to enable new life—is signaled early and tightens during the hush. The meaningful deepening occurs when the leaf demands tribute, forcing Silas to risk a precious seed. Agency is clear: his prod catalyzes transformation. Cost is felt (the seed’s loneliness, the weight of remembrance) but could be sharper—what if failure meant sterility? Still, pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens with one decisive intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—control vs. surrender—is signaled early and tightens when the ladder fails, forcing improvisation. Silas’s agency drives escalation: he chooses the vine swing, digs through ashes, accepts the compass’s logic. Cost is felt in lost tools, physical danger, and the irreversible abandonment of his old life. The stakes deepen conceptually: it’s no longer about retrieving an object but redefining his relationship to time itself.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—redeeming Julian’s error by solidifying its beauty—is signaled early and deepens when Elara chooses commemoration over retrieval. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: increasing thermal output to “hyper-fluidity” risks vaporization, raising cost. The tightening forecloses resurrection, forcing acceptance. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure grows through material intensity and conceptual weight, culminating in irreversible transformation with visible cost: the statue is truth, not life.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—freeing Thorne from self-imposed dignity—is signaled early and deepens when Elian chooses ridicule over exorcism. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each harp note tightens pressure until the tooth forces a reckoning. Cost is unmistakable: Thorne’s laughter shatters his spectral form, and Elian bears the emotional labor of confronting another’s shame. The single meaningful tightening (from dissonance to farce) narrows options and crystallizes the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—solving mercy’s equation to quiet neural agony—is signaled early and tightens when Kaelen removes the forbidden mask, trading safety for revelation. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: each trauma-response-guided step narrows options until only standing still in UV light remains. Cost is unmistakable: lungs seared, body exposed, past pain weaponized as navigation. Coincidence absent; every complication stems from his rewired nerves or forest logic.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rescuing forgotten sacrifice—is signaled early and tightens when anchors flare gold, enabling the metaphysical surgery. Escalation is driven by Elian’s agency under an Accumulative lens: each intuitive marker deepens emotional resonance until the keeper’s prayer floods him. Cost is felt (“pallbearer” grace) and alters tactics—transcription becomes necessary. No false resolution; luck never solves the core conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—freeing whatever’s trapped in the rafters—is signaled early and deepens when the mainspring’s discovery reveals human error behind mechanical failure. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: Elias’s observational skill narrows options until only manual engagement remains. Cost is unmistakable: the ghosts’ release carries emotional weight, and Elias’s isolation afterward implies a toll. One meaningful tightening suffices, and it’s earned without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—permanence versus fluidity—is signaled early and escalates via Silas’s agency: he hunts flaws, deploys the bottled whisper, and activates the press. The meaningful deepening occurs when the system cannot reconcile rigid frost with fluid truth, tearing itself apart. Cost is unmistakable: books turn to ash, clouds invade, time accumulates as weight. Silas’s act forecloses immortality’s shallow drift, replacing it with consequence—a trade-off driven entirely by his choices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—control over historical narrative—is clear from the opening dispute. Pressure escalates via the storm, which Elian weaponizes through agency (devising alignment, covering mirrors). The tightening occurs when Thorne’s data is corrupted by witnessed beauty—a real consequence. Cost is felt: Elian wins the argument but inherits heavier grief, foreclosing any escape from exile or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming light from conceptual midnight—is signaled early and deepens via the counterintuitive method, which narrows options to belief alone. Pressure escalates coherently under Accumulative lens: rust creeps, gears hesitate, doubt threatens the stone, all converging on Elias’s whispered truth. Cost is unmistakable: his trembling body, the risk of shattering the drive shaft, and the irreversible commitment to “mending what isn’t torn.” Agency drives every turn; luck complicates (rust at the door) but never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—capturing the source of petrichor—is signaled early and deepens into metaphysical pursuit. Pressure escalates coherently: from factory silence to psychic descent to dimensional rupture. Silas’s agency drives every turn (choosing the fissure, pouring the drop). Cost is felt: the compass fulfills its purpose only through his risk, and the “trembling fingers” imply physical/emotional toll. Under Accumulative lens, the single intensification—the cavern’s groaning hinge—sufficiently reweights the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—saving the freighter from Razor Rocks—is signaled early and tightens when Elara realizes electronics are useless, forcing her toward analog intervention. Escalation is driven by her agency: each action (retrieving slide, mounting lamp) forecloses digital solutions, deepening reliance on “timewoven” risk. Cost is legible: exhaustion, exposure, and the conceptual price of depending on dead cartographers. Coincidence (storm, radio plea) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the turn hinges on her deliberate reimagination of art as tool.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding nocturnal bloom’s purpose—is signaled early and tightens when Elara constructs the viewing apparatus, narrowing her world to this single bud. Escalation is driven by her agency: deciphering postcards, salvaging glass, waiting three nights. The deepening arrives not through external opposition but internal reckoning: realizing her art was “vanity” versus the flower’s “generosity.” Cost is unmistakable—she abandons lucrative commissions and her former artistic identity, crystallized in the final brush dipped in “dark, velvety indigo.”

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—exposing regime crimes—is signaled early and deepens when the diary’s cipher demands a trade of legacy for access. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she initiates parley, arranges glyphs, and accepts the cost (bearing witness forever). The retrocognitive loop complicates but doesn’t resolve; victory comes through negotiation, not luck. Cost is unmistakable: the Scribe’s eternal replay ends only when his memory is preserved—a conceptual price paid in historical accountability.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reviving a flawed civilization instead of accepting tranquil void—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s agonizing mental labor. The tightening occurs when she adds “greed, hunger, ambition,” consciously choosing imperfection over ease. Escalation is driven entirely by her agency under Accumulative pressure, not coincidence. Cost is unmistakable: biological limits pushed to collapse, sweat beading, mind “flayed.” One meaningful deepening suffices, but the absence of a secondary complication prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the oath before the world ends—is signaled early and tightens when the Foghorn stops. Vane’s agency drives escalation: he recalls a childhood lesson and acts, risking the artifact’s destruction. The cost is legible—the wax dissolves after use, foreclosing future access—and the deepening (realizing the prophecy) alters his understanding irreversibly. Coincidence (the field trip memory) complicates but doesn’t resolve; his choice to immerse is active and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming genetic memory before silence becomes permanent—is signaled early and deepens when Elian’s true motive shifts from duty to experiencing “borrowed time.” Escalation occurs through his act of decreasing entropy, which narrows options (only the acorn cap works) and imposes conceptual cost: reversing universal decay. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens; coincidence doesn’t resolve. One meaningful tightening suffices, and the price—stealing condemned moments—is viscerally felt in the vault’s humming walls.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—honoring silence versus protocol—is signaled early and escalates through Elias’s agency: tracking data, verifying epoxy, observing the flatline. The meaningful tightening occurs when wind dies, transforming meteorological curiosity into moral imperative. Cost is unmistakable: he sacrifices professional compliance for spiritual integrity, knowing he’ll “explain the lack of a log entry.” Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres via sensory intensification (howl → whisper → vacuum), forcing stance crystallization without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—finding meaning in invisibility—is signaled early and deepens when the meteor’s incineration becomes a mirror for Elara’s own yearning to be seen. The tightening occurs in her empathetic tracing, which crystallizes her stance: vulnerability as revelation, not defeat. Cost is legible in the meteor’s atomic disintegration and mirrored in Elara’s quiet acceptance of her role as cosmic custodian. Escalation is driven entirely by her agency under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving the weight of silence—is signaled early and deepens when the young ghost’s desperate plea threatens to unravel the pact. Elias’s agency lies in attention and refusal; his choice to focus on the blue shadow rather than her mouth narrows options (he cannot both listen and uphold the covenant) and alters the ghost’s state. Pressure escalates texturally: visual screaming intensifies until his ritual reweights silence as sacred. The cost—eternal solitude amid the dead—is felt in his “astonished recluse” demeanor and the kingdom of quiet he guards alone.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding time’s texture—is signaled early and deepens when the urn fragment offers a “fixed point.” Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: Elara decodes the network message, descends, and retrieves the shard. The tightening forecloses her prior fog-bound existence, replacing it with abrasive clarity. Cost is visible in the slowed “borrowed time in her veins,” though the price of this stability (increased fragility?) remains implied rather than dramatized on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reconciling storm violence with evening peace through imperfect weaving—is signaled early and tightens when the kite snaps, threatening to unravel Elian’s work. His agency lies in renunciation: he deepens the ritual by incorporating loss rather than repairing it. Cost is legible in the final image—the red kite remains “a permanent majestic flaw”—and the tension between control and surrender crystallizes under pressure without coincidence resolving it.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preventing the orchard’s self-destruction through forced symbiosis—is signaled early and tightens as Silas’s body fails while the system stabilizes. The meaningful deepening occurs when copper loops translate stone’s distress into tree-comprehensible energy, shifting the conflict from antagonism to partnership. Agency is clear: Silas’s deliberate, systematic actions drive every turn. Cost is unmistakable: his physical collapse is the price paid for ecological harmony, culminating in his death as the orchard thrives.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—authentic vs. synthetic longing—is signaled early and deepens when Aris confirms the pilgrimage is artificial. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her choice to follow dusty footprints leads to validation, then rebellion. The cost is unmistakable: relinquishing the amber (and the illusion of preserved origin) to resist exploitation. Pressure tightens coherently under an Accumulative lens, culminating in a stance that forecloses return.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming blood-soaked earth through memory-seeds—is signaled early and deepens when bird calls reveal the thinning veil. Silas’s agency drives escalation: he waits for the tern’s cadence, whispers the dead phrase, casts precisely. Cost is visible in the barren world he inherits and the solitude of his task; the fresh salt replacing decay marks a hard-won shift. No coincidence resolves anything—success hinges on his linguistic attunement and timing.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reconnecting across apocalyptic distance—is signaled early and deepens when the riddle reveals a radio cipher, transforming passive longing into actionable hope. Escalation is driven by Silas’s agency: his visual decoding method and leaf-key create the breakthrough. Cost is felt in the fragility of the leaf, the risk of false hope, and the silence he maintains to protect potential connection. Pressure tightens once, decisively, aligning with Accumulative lens requirements for short form.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—maintaining sanity against relativistic chaos—is signaled early and tightens when the “fleeting glimpse” forces a reevaluation of reality. The deepening is protagonist-driven: her decision to map the singularity forecloses passive endurance. Cost is felt (isolation, futility) and visible in the frantic-to-steady hand transition. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—amending reality’s stagnant rules—is signaled early and deepens through each piece swap, which narrows the window for reversal. Elian’s agency drives escalation: he chooses fragile potential over stone permanence, paying the price of lost safety. The cost is unmistakable in the climax: protective wards dissolve, wind threatens to cast him off, yet he laughs. One tightening suffices at this length, and it forecloses the old world decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving ephemeral grief—is signaled early and tightens when whispers knot into deafening hum, forcing Elias’s climactic choice. His agency drives escalation: walking transcribes, then clacking kings unbinds noise. Cost is unmistakable: he sacrifices empathy to save authenticity, leaving the grieving mother unheard. The pawnless chessboard visually reinforces stakes—power endures while the small are swept away—and this tension sharpens his moral calculus without resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake (“to understand the shape of home”) tightens meaningfully when the lost language stone demands resurrection of buried talents—a live option foreclosed for years due to fear. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to touch the stone, retrieve the phoenix quill, and plant it, each act narrowing escape routes. Cost is unmistakable: she trades the safety of hallucination for the terror of creation, crystallized in the stone’s “terrifying, rhythmic heat.” The thunder’s shift from threat to heartbeat proves stakes were viscerally felt, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—forgiveness through re-engagement with consequence—is signaled early and escalates via the weakening barrier and approaching storm. Silas’s agency drives deepening: he chooses to decode, then pull the anchor knot, sacrificing stasis. Cost is unmistakable: loss of sanctuary, re-entry into guilt-laden reality. Pressure coheres under Causal lens—each beat narrows options until only one thread remains to cut.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. scapegoating—is signaled early and deepens when Kaelen’s poetry shatters the ritual’s simplicity. Escalation is driven by his agency: each line tightens pressure until the spire overloads, forcing the Elders to confront chaotic reality. Cost is unmistakable: exile looms, yet Kaelen trades certainty for “honest confusion,” making forgiveness possible. The single tightening (refraction) forecloses the village’s old path with resonant consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—conjure meaning before erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the hull breaches, forcing Elara into the acid tide. Her agency drives escalation: she initiates the ritual, matches pockmarks, and narrates despite burning lungs. Cost is unmistakable—her life for the statue’s preservation—and the deepening (incorporating the acid sea as “final chisel stroke”) reweights destruction as creation. One meaningful pressure point suffices, though a second tactical shift (e.g., failed attempt before success) would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory without stagnation—is signaled early and deepens when Elias chooses to paint *despite knowing* the tide will destroy it. The tightening occurs in the cave: distraction by Elara’s echo causes the wrong turn, raising stakes by introducing danger, yet leads to the sanctuary where his ritual gains meaning. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (the hidden pool) complicates but doesn’t resolve—he still must choose to release. Cost is visible: knees crack, light fades, and the mirror stays broken.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—saving the ship without inducing panic—is signaled early and deepens when Elias rejects the head keeper’s doctrine of “aggression” in favor of refined intent. The tightening occurs when he chooses the vial over conventional signals, narrowing options to a single, fragile method. Cost is felt physically (shaking, heaving chest) and conceptually (his truth remains unseen by authority). Escalation is driven entirely by Elias’s agency under an Accumulative lens, though the external threat (the Teeth) is slightly abstracted rather than viscerally rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—constructing a safe corridor for reverse-migrating ghosts—is signaled early and escalates with lunar pressure until the moon’s zenith forces Elara’s manual alignment. Agency drives escalation: she chooses to use her body as conductor, wedging the censer foot despite burns. Cost is unmistakable: scars, bone-deep sorrow, and permanent exile. The tightening is meaningful—each rusted crank turn narrows options until only one degree remains, crystallizing her role as lighthouse keeper of loss.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—psychological survival—is signaled by line 3 and tightens decisively when Elias chooses occlusion over truth. His agency drives escalation: gathering tools, clearing space, pressing the eye. The cost is felt in the silence that follows—a loss of human connection reframed as victory. Coincidence never resolves; the monks’ relic works only because Elias wills it through disciplined ritual, aligning with Causal escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—decoding a stranger’s sacrifice—is signaled early and deepens when Silas shifts focus from the visible woman to the erased figure. This agency-driven turn narrows his interpretive options and raises emotional stakes. Cost is unmistakable: his isolation is “less hollow” but now burdened by witnessed love’s self-erasure. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; pressure tightens through Silas’s own perceptual choices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—confronting the crossroads of past regret—is signaled early and tightens as floodwaters rise, forcing a binary: flee or step through. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his intuition reads ant movement, leading him to the fissure; his use of the matrix unlocks the Doorway. Cost is visceral (freezing water to chin) and conceptual (accepting irreversible loss). Coincidence complicates (ants’ path) but doesn’t resolve; the climax hinges on his earned choice under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—surviving/understanding the bleeding sky—is signaled early and tightens when the final warning bell tolls. Isolde’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to climb despite risk, then to enter the grotto. Cost is felt (physical exhaustion, near-miss droplets) and culminates in her relinquishing queenship. The fireflies’ protective role slightly softens causality, but their emergence is tied to seasonal rhythm established in the shared exhale, preserving coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving a fleeting moment of presence—is signaled early and deepens when Kaelen’s departure reframes their shared history as finite. Elian’s agency drives escalation: he selects “grim persistence,” adjusts the containment field, and uses emotional shock to lock the reaction. The cost—accepting loss while creating permanence—is felt in his steady voice masking a “sudden hollow.” Coincidence doesn’t resolve; Kaelen’s arrival is essential but not contrived, serving as the grounding variable Elian anticipated.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving selfhood against temporal collapse—is signaled early and deepens when jealousy fuels dream-flight, which then burns out, forcing return to documentation. The tightening occurs when flight fails, narrowing options to writing as sole linear act. Cost is felt: chronological confusion returns “like a wet blanket,” yet he persists. Agency is clear (he chooses envy, flight, inscription), though escalation leans more on accumulation than causal narrowing—still valid under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving meaning in a world of obsolescence—is signaled early (“sanctuary of liquid time”) and deepens when Kael’s frustration reveals his fear of irrelevance. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his decision to offer the screw isn’t luck but a calibrated risk rooted in his new way of seeing. The cost is felt in every beat—Elias’s lost olfactory world, Kael’s fraying patience—and crystallizes in the final image where the repaired clock’s rhythm becomes a shared heartbeat. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure tightens not through plot turns but through intensifying emotional and textural density.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—survival via ritual completion—is signaled early and escalates coherently: crystal spreads from collarbone to wrist, locking movement and raising urgency. The tightening occurs when academic knowledge fails, forcing a deepening into childhood belief—a credible agency shift under Accumulative pressure. Cost is unmistakable: molting is “visceral and sharp,” tearing at identity, and success requires sacrificing intellectual pride for “ridiculous” faith. The storm’s arrival isn’t coincidence; it’s the inevitable pressure cooker forcing stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—delivering an apology—is signaled early and tightens when the ghost’s static-scream reveals corrupted signal, forcing Silas to cut power prematurely. Agency drives escalation: Silas builds the induction cage; Elena steps toward the vapor despite terror. Cost is felt in the frost-burn and unwashed sorrow. Coincidence (chainsaws) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the real closure is emotional, not mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preventing permanent cosmic dissolution through perception—is signaled early and tightens when the Spiral Arbitration demands justification for existence. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her inward journey fuels outward motion, and her selection of “unify” is a high-stakes conceptual gambit. Cost is unmistakable—the threat of identity unraveling, the exhaustion of being the sole witness—and the resolution forecloses surrender to nothingness. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, culminating in a stance that reweights all prior chaos.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—understanding time’s true nature—is signaled early and deepens when Kaelen confronts the horror that fluidity is mercy. Protagonist agency drives escalation: his decision to use the key removes the “bandage,” tightening options until only mental rupture (counting to zero) remains. Cost is unmistakable: irreversible awareness that each moment is a wound. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via intensifying sensory and conceptual friction.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether rigid control can coexist with human connection—is signaled early and deepens when Elias inverts his focus from intrusion detection to watching Mera. His agency drives escalation: lingering at the monitor, then overriding safety defaults. The cost is felt in his trembling hand and the irreversible dismantling of his professional ethos. The “quiet wildfire” tension culminates not in explosion but integration, with clear foreclosed paths: he can never again believe walls equal safety.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming agency through widened perspective—is signaled early and deepens when Elena confronts her mortality in the shifting-static book. The meaningful tightening occurs at the podium: knowledge of death replaces fear with peace, foreclosing her old reliance on calculable safety nets. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: she accepts uncertainty as permanent. Escalation is driven by her interpretation of scrawls, though the method’s mechanics remain abstract, slightly softening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—facilitating anonymous healing—is signaled early and escalates through Silas’s agency: he matches pitch to grief, patches lines, then deliberately shatters the loop with dissonance. The tightening forecloses easy catharsis (no names exchanged) and forces a trade-off: breakthrough requires abrupt severance. Cost is visible in the siphoned weight from the old man and the woman’s sudden departure. Coincidence (wrong number) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Silas’s skill drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving ephemeral joy—is signaled early and tightens when Elara risks ritual failure by indirect manipulation. Her agency drives escalation: each precise action (cleaning silver, diverting seawater) forecloses brute-force magic, honoring her ethos. Cost is felt in her isolation post-ritual; the covenant regenerates, but she remains “widow of time.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of sensory and emotional detail reweights memory as ecological act.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—curing loneliness through impossible reciprocity—is signaled early and deepens when the woman arrives with only a song. Arthur’s agency drives escalation: he initiates rumors, waits, then chooses vulnerability by discarding the rock. Cost is unmistakable: he forfeits his “celestial” offering, accepting that human connection can’t be transactional. Pressure coheres under causal lens—each beat tightens the tension between isolation and intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—deciphering her father’s hidden message—is signaled early and tightens via the closing celestial window. Agency is clear: Elara actively dowses, touches, endures. The constellations’ shudder raises urgency, forcing a lunge through briars. Cost is felt in bodily inscription of languages and emotional exposure; the stillpoint’s arrival is earned by her persistence, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—repairing misread cosmic signals to avert war—is signaled early and escalates through Elian’s agency: he actively severs causal links (“famine and revolution”) with visible cost (“bitter crop” threshed into wisdom). Pressure coheres under the Causal lens; each edit narrows historical options (starving child → artist vs. soldier). The tightening culminates in bullet-trajectory edits tied to moth wings, forcing universe-level reinterpretation. Coincidence complicates (misread signals) but resolution is earned through Elian’s precise, costly labor.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—creating meaning from silence—is signaled early and deepens via the advisor’s crescendo, which tightens pressure into frantic mapping. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses focus, aperture, pan—all to “break the static of the void.” Cost is felt in his sweat, tears, and existential forfeiture of name. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; every turn stems from their ritualized collaboration under coherent atmospheric pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—rescuing a forgotten promise—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes the promise isn’t about Kael’s face but their shared fire. Escalation is driven by her agency: each clue interpreted via her intuition narrows options until only one act remains—portrayal through charcoal. Cost is unmistakable: she abandons restoration for reinterpretation, accepting that truth lies in transformation, not recovery. The tightening culminates in a trade-off: preserving Kael’s silence versus freeing his message, with emotional price felt in her “tight” chest.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—solidifying a shared dream into permanence—is signaled early and tightens when Kael refuses the tank, forcing a trade-off: sanity for sanctuary. Escalation is driven entirely by his agency (drumming tempo increase), which overrides machinery and awakens the garden. Cost is unmistakable: “purchased with his sanity,” visible in Lena’s blurring edges and the scientists’ futile rush in the abandoned reality. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—access vs. noise—is signaled early and tightens decisively at the Blind Box. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he engineers the challenge, controls information, and uses environmental constraints. Kael’s shouting triggers sirens, proving cost is tied to method, not just goal. One meaningful deepening occurs when the key’s true function reframes the conflict from force to finesse, raising conceptual stakes without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—carrying unbearable guilt—is signaled early and deepens via the woman’s trembling and half-spoken secret. Elias’s agency (weaving light) escalates pressure not through conflict but Accumulative density, forcing her attention shift. Cost is legible in her exhaled breath and internal reconfiguration. However, the “tightening” is atmospheric rather than tactical; no live option is foreclosed, limiting escalation intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—freedom of thought versus enforced certainty—is signaled early and tightens when the grotto’s silence allows authentic cognition. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses the signal, knowing shopkeepers await his impulse. The cost is immediate and societal: the surveillance state “snagged” by riddles, creating intellectual gridlock. This deepening isn’t coincidental—it’s earned through year-long preparation, and the “virus of hesitation” exacts a price the regime cannot algorithmically resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—survival through surrender to fluidity—is signaled early and tightens when the dock dissolves beneath them. Elian’s agency drives escalation: he initiates the embrace, interprets the scrimshaw’s warmth, urges “Let go.” Cost is unmistakable: Vane must relinquish his last tether to a dying geometry. The whale’s call complicates but doesn’t resolve; Vane’s choice to release is the decisive act.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—survival under the Happiness Mandate—is signaled early and tightens when Silas turns whittling into performance to sever emotional connection. The deepening occurs as he shifts from carving pine to decimating the bouquet, narrowing options until only erasure remains. Agency drives escalation: his choices (theatrical voice, destroying the flower) are desperate tactics shaped by state terror. Cost is unmistakable: he trades love for safety, ending “completely empty”—a conceptual and emotional forfeiture that crystallizes the story’s moral calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—transgressing sacred separation to access aesthetic truth—is signaled early and deepens when the quartz amplifies her connection, blurring earth/sky. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to engage the shadow, then fully step into the corridor. Cost is felt physically (vibration rattling teeth) and existentially (risk of mind-shattering “raw language”). The ban’s recent lift creates temporal pressure, but the true tightening is internal: her surrender to dissolution forecloses safe observation, demanding total immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—awakening Silas to capture his sorrow—is signaled early and deepens when the Glassblower rejects beauty for utility. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she pivots from floral offering to mechanical sound, accepting corrosion as necessary texture. Cost is unmistakable: the reed is surrendered, Silas’s return is physically traumatic, and the world remains grayscale. The tightening—from plant poetry to discordant scream—narrows options logically under the Accumulative lens, with each choice raising the price of success.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming analog connection—is signaled early and tightens when digital restoration fails Kael. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her rejection of “rigid laws” enables the lens experiment, foreclosing pure visual translation. Cost is unmistakable: she sacrifices performative purity for risky physicality, paid in the “tingling” aftermath. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each sensory detail intensifies until the decisive deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—externalizing unfulfilled intent—is signaled early and deepens when the stencil’s “ghost of a mark” becomes refracted light. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses compression, setting, illumination. The cost is felt in the woman’s relinquishment of permanence for ephemeral beauty. Coincidence (origami finding her) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the resolution stems from his craft and her acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding the architecture of loss—is signaled early and tightens when measurements reveal “causality that shouldn’t exist.” Silas’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to measure, interpret, then breach protocol by confiding. Cost is legible: his pulse hammers, professional detachment shatters. The engineered demolition revelation raises stakes from personal ruin to global conspiracy, though the client’s reaction slightly softens the blow’s immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—accessing forbidden truth—is signaled early and deepens when Elara confronts the golden age’s destruction. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her erratic method purifies space, enabling progress. Cost is unmistakable: loss of faith, innocence, and future ease. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; one meaningful tightening suffices. No false resolutions—truth is gained but beauty is irretrievable, raising emotional stakes without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving individual longing against homogenizing unity—is signaled early and tightens when the video comparison confirms the shadow’s severance. Elian’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to trap the shadow despite knowing the woman won’t be restored. The cost is unmistakable in closure: “the victory was steep,” and the collective remains “joyous, shallow.” Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens, deepening via textual density rather than causal turns, culminating in a Charged Poise where options (surrender vs. preservation) are crystallized with emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving compassion amid betrayal—is signaled early and tightened when the chameleon’s pain halts Elara’s rage. The meaningful deepening occurs during surgery: saving the tail requires shedding poisoned layers, mirroring her psychological reckoning. Cost is unmistakable: lost innocence, money, and trust, yet she endures without cynicism. Pressure remains coherent under a Hybrid lens (Causal + Accumulative), with protagonist agency driving every escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering trauma through physical excavation—is signaled early and tightens when the coffee ring directs Elias downward. His agency drives escalation: he chooses pain over anesthesia’s numbness, ignores plant pleas, smashes stone. Cost is visible (bleeding, torn stitches) and conceptual (sacrificing sanctuary for truth). The displaced miracle complicates but doesn’t resolve; Elias’s actions alone yield the lullaby.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—locating and redirecting unused love—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s incubation ritual, which narrows her options: she must sacrifice the film’s ghost to preserve its essence. Escalation is driven by her agency under Accumulative pressure; the rising “hushed thunder” externalizes internal stakes without resolving them. Cost is unmistakable: the strip dies in her hands, and the silence afterward carries emotional weight. No coincidence; all tension arises from her method and motive.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—channeling cosmic creativity before being shattered by it—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Elian collapses, realizing pursuit itself blocks flow. The meaningful deepening occurs in his shift from active tracing to passive reception, which reweights the entire premise: creation requires surrender, not control. Cost is palpable (physical collapse, relinquished instrument) and shapes the final stance. While escalation is strong, the meteor’s arrival feels slightly coincidental rather than causally earned by Elian’s prior effort, slightly softening the pressure curve.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving unlived possibilities—is signaled early and tightens when Kaelen risks dissolution to “charm the probability field.” The escalation is driven by his agency: singing the lullaby forces quantum dispersion, a costly deepening that narrows his existence to pure function. Though stakes are cosmic, they’re viscerally felt through vibration (“billion unlived lives rattling... like trapped moths”). However, the absence of an external antagonist slightly softens oppositional pressure, limiting full escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—mental liberation—is signaled early and tightens when Elian risks engaging the turbine. His agency drives escalation: choosing resonance over safety, inserting the gear despite rust’s decay. Cost is unmistakable: surrendering control of his translocations, embracing uncertainty. The “probable miracles” tone sharpens tension without relying on coincidence—the gear works because it matches his internal frequency.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—claiming unused courage—is signaled early and deepens via the spiral route that avoids “capsizing the soul.” The meaningful tightening occurs when Elara insists on opening eyes at the station, forcing confrontation with the abyss. Cost is felt in the man’s bitter admission (“I left nothing but fear”) and physical tremors, though the escalation leans slightly more on guide intervention than protagonist agency. Still, the final grasp of “resolved will” crystallizes stance under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—what must be sacrificed for safety—is signaled early and deepens when the bolt reveals music was purged, not lost. Elian’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to investigate the scar, pries loose the bolt, and elects to stay. The tightening forecloses escape (he knows he’d perish in the blizzard) and redefines resistance as internal contamination. Cost is unmistakable: continued agony, mute servitude, and the burden of unshared memory—all crystallized in the final climb.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. rewritten history—is signaled early and tightens via Orel’s indirect sabotage, culminating in the rune’s activation. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he chooses patience, precision, and symbolic warfare over force. Cost is unmistakable: the Pretender’s annihilation and Orel’s isolation amid ruin. The celestial trigger complicates but doesn’t resolve; victory stems from Orel’s preparation under cosmic constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding why paths vanish—is signaled early and tightens when sensors report void where road should be. Elian’s agency drives escalation: his tapping practice gathers data that automated systems miss, culminating in the composite image. The deepening isn’t just intellectual; it’s existential, forcing him to relinquish the myth of passive loss for active transformation. Cost is felt in the irreversible shift from witness to participant in a new ecological epoch.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reigniting rebellion through meaning—is signaled early and deepens when Elara steps into the circle despite looking foolish. Agency is clear: she chooses ritual over mechanics, narrowing options to one fragile method. Cost is felt in her exposure and the soldiers’ doubt. Escalation follows Accumulative logic: hum intensifies vibration until resonance locks—a single, decisive tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—awakening the biosphere savior—tightens as patrols close in, forcing Elara to decode under duress. Agency is clear: her choice to proceed despite psychic screams and armed threat drives escalation. Cost is felt (physical pain, exposure) and conceptual (breaking sacred law). The deepening occurs when the moss shifts from warning to reverence—proof her act has already succeeded before guards arrive. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; timing is earned by her speed and knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving fragile beauty in a hostile world—is signaled early and deepens when the turbine-like whine threatens to collapse Elias’s reality. His agency lies in freezing *deliberately*, then returning to grafting: a renunciation of escape that affirms his life’s purpose. The cost is felt in his body and memory, and the tightening (panic → control) narrows his options to one: endure and create. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with no coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving artistic truth amid ontological collapse—is signaled early and tightens when walls close in, forcing Elias to choose between futile resistance or radical redesign. His agency drives escalation: untangling threads creates the chute, and the cost (crushing masonry, abandoned future) sharpens the peak choice. The deepening—“enlightenment was the trap”—narrows options to descent. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the tarot box’s vibration merely underscores his active unmaking.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—capturing Kaelen to decode temporal logs—tightens when the ink mandala offers an unforeseen escape, forcing Silas to choose between futile lunge or strategic pivot. Agency drives escalation: Silas deploys drone, corners target, then adapts post-failure. Cost is visible in evaporated opportunity and redirected focus. Coincidence never resolves; Kaelen’s exit stems from prepared science, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. peace—is signaled early and deepens when Elara chooses chaos over preservation. Her agency drives escalation: she splices terminals, bypasses firewalls, throws the switch. The tightening occurs in Kael’s entrance, which raises stakes without resolving them; Elara acts *despite* his presence. Cost is unmistakable: the collapse of societal order and her own ruin, mirrored in Kael’s pallor. Coincidence (his arrival) complicates but doesn’t solve.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—growing a new law rooted in earth rather than stone—is signaled early and tightens when the intruder appears. Elara’s agency lies in renunciation: she chooses nonviolence despite inherited instinct, narrowing her options to only cultivation. The cost is felt in her isolation and vulnerability, yet this very act reweights the world’s moral climate. Escalation is driven by protagonist choice under Accumulative pressure, though the intruder’s impact could be slightly more consequential to push past 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—catching the goddess’s echo—is signaled early and tightens when constellations disrupt the garden, forcing Elara to act at the fracture of logic. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her zigzag confuses defenses, her voiced silence creates vacuum. Cost is unmistakable—the lullaby’s psychological toll, the burden of divinity wrapped in iron. Coincidence (stars descending) complicates but doesn’t resolve; victory stems from skill under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—truth versus slander—is signaled early and tightens when Eleanor chooses investigation over denial. Her agency drives escalation: she retrieves the pen, consults memory, constructs a proof, and calls back. The cost is social (confronting false narrative) and emotional (enduring doubt about her father), made visible in the heavy silence after her rebuttal. Coincidence never resolves; logic alone dismantles the threat.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—hushing guilt’s dissonance—is signaled early and escalates causally: the machine’s baby-cry translation forces Elara to confront her negligence directly. Her agency drives escalation (initiating boot sequence, modifying stylus, drawing waveforms), narrowing options until only tethering remains. Cost is unmistakable: tears blur vision, system overloads threaten shattering, and success demands enduring sorrow as preserved light.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—granting peace to trapped memories—is signaled early and tightens when voices hit “fever pitch,” forcing Elian to choose between preserving his art or imposing silence. His agency drives escalation: he observes rhythm, severs the mandala, and creates “visual silence.” Cost is legible: the ruined mandala, evaporated memories, and cold tile. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, though the “social gridlock” metaphor slightly abstracts the conflict without diminishing its emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving fragile humanity against systemic erasure—tightens when the child’s gasp forces 734 to choose between protocol and empathy. His agency drives escalation: scanning stone → renaming log → venting heat. Each act narrows options (battery drain, drone risk) with visible cost. The moral calculus—life as “static debris”—sharpens the peak choice without coincidence or external rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—saving the carnival legacy—is signaled early and deepens when the Tower card manifests ruin. Barnaby’s agency (echo manipulation) tightens options: he can’t touch or speak, forcing inventive tactics. The grey static’s threat escalates pressure coherently under the Accumulative lens. Cost is visible in Clara’s initial despair and Barnaby’s energy expenditure (“spiced wine” surge).

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—navigating post-hive-mind neural static—is signaled early and deepens when verbal instruction fails, forcing Elias to devise somatic guidance. The tightening is decisive: cognition is abandoned for breath/pulse-driven motion, narrowing options to pure physiology. Cost is unmistakable in Mara’s fragility (“I don’t know how to move”) and the ever-present voices; the final image offers resilience, not cure. Escalation stems from protagonist agency (Elias’s choice to “paint the noise”), not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—translating planetary healing for future humans—is signaled early and tightens when the “yearning” spike demands physical risk (floating over abyss). Agency drives escalation: Elara chooses immersion despite dissolution risk, altering her role permanently. Cost is unmistakable: neural overload mitigated only by the fossil, and the irreversible shift from observer to voice. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—rewriting fate—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes prophecy is mistranslated sonic chaos. His agency drives escalation: uncorking the jar, selecting buttons, arranging them—all narrowing options toward a single, costly choice: to invert the hourglass and risk chaos over order. The price is conceptual (loss of certainty) but legible in the sand’s defiance of gravity. Coincidence never resolves; everything stems from Elias’s labor.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—redemption through truth—is signaled early and deepens when Elias trades anonymity for exposure via snow-coding. His prudently daring maneuver escalates pressure: visibility invites death or vindication. The tightening occurs when the helicopter arrives—not to kill but to test—and Elias must surrender proof without guarantee. Cost is unmistakable: he risks everything for a chance to fix what’s broken, and survives only by forfeiting control of his own narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—crossing the river with distilled essence—is signaled early and deepens when the woman’s palimpsest proves too heavy. Silas’s agency drives escalation: his ambient awareness detects her, his needle unravels layers, each pull narrowing options until only truth remains. Cost is legible: the “thick, scarred document of guilt” drips into mud, a physical forfeiture. Under Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via textual density (layers of promise) then resolves through pattern break (unraveling), reweighting survival as purity.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding temporal resistance—is signaled early and tightens when Silas realizes the timeline bends toward compassion, forcing a shift from inquiry to devotional making. Agency is clear: his softened touch and use of lantern glass are active responses to rising thrum. Cost is conceptual (accepting limits of restoration) and felt (twilight erasing visions). Escalation follows Accumulative logic—density of overlapping timelines intensifies until harmonized with the wheel’s whir, crystallizing stance without false resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—bringing light to the bedridden woman—is signaled early and tightens when the rose dies, clearing sightlines for the apparatus. The seized joint raises pressure; Elias’s rhythmic coaxing is agency under constraint. Cost is felt: the loss of floral vibrancy traded for functional radiance. Escalation is subtle but sufficient—a single deepening that shifts from organic to mechanical care under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—translating isolation into independence—is signaled early and tightens when Elara chooses the stone circle over the library stacks, foreclosing passive mourning. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she seeks the monoliths, steps onto the disc, breathes into resonance. Cost is unmistakable: she accepts permanent coexistence with grief rather than seeking oblivion or reunion. The cloud-tide’s rise externalizes internal shift, deepening stakes without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rejoining fractured love through narrative—is signaled early and tightens when Elara sees the sculpture’s “hollow ache.” Her agency drives escalation: she walks, places the spiral, and triggers transformation. Cost is felt in the client’s voiceless absence and the burden-turned-anchoring of secrets. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the spiral’s fit is uncanny but prepared by prior detail.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—preventing massacre via signal interference—is signaled early and tightens when mobs reach the quad, forcing Elias’s hand. His agency drives escalation: he chooses subsonic frequencies over speech, aligns phase variance under duress, and risks transmitter failure. Cost is unmistakable: sweat, bent VU meters, and the implied fragility of human freedom. Though the entities’ motives are expositional, the immediate pressure remains coherent and causally linked to Elias’s actions.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—unlocking earth’s dormancy via resonance—is signaled early and tightens when walls rush inward, forcing Elara to choose between flight (death) and playing (risk). Her agency drives escalation: scraping moss enables breath, which enables sound, which halts contraction. Cost is unmistakable: gasping collapse after the chord, sweat cooling in wind. Coincidence never resolves; survival hinges on her precise musical defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—awakening empathy through art—is signaled early and deepens when Silas bypasses facial recognition to “strike directly at the heart.” The meaningful tightening occurs at the lancing: a violent act that injects life into abstraction, narrowing options to one irreversible gesture. Cost is visible in Miller’s crumbled expression and the town’s “infection of indifference” being drained. Agency is fully Silas’s; no coincidence resolves pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—proving Silas’s bravery—is signaled early and tightens when Elara must voice the storm’s syntax, risking annihilation. Agency is clear: her petition, not luck, reverses exile. Cost is visible in her isolation and the High Archivists’ condemnation. Escalation follows Accumulative logic—density of dread increases until the precise linguistic act pierces it—but lacks a second tactical trade-off beyond emotional endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—escaping the high-definition cruelty of past guilt—is signaled early and deepens when the glass shard reveals the bridge’s ghostly outline. The tightening occurs when Silas aligns shard and scaffold, triggering pixelated amnesty: a trade-off where clarity is sacrificed for forgiveness. Agency is maintained—his recounting and playing stabilize the glitch. Cost is visible: he forfeits sharp reality but gains a “permanent horizon.” Coincidence (hitchhiker’s gift) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Silas must act to complete the transmission.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—defending Ringmaster from predatory acquisition—is signaled early and deepens into survival against systemic greed. Silas’s agency drives escalation: his primal dissuasion tactic narrows options, forcing the wolves’ retreat. Cost is unmistakable in layoffs and collapse, culminating in solitary departure. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with each loss tightening the thematic vise.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—decoding encrypted trauma—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes the glyphs map shared burdens. Escalation is driven by her agency: matching breath to starlight, stepping toward the crushed figure, speaking words that fracture the monolith. Cost is unmistakable: the burden’s transformation demands her voice as conduit, risking emotional absorption. Pressure tightens coherently under an Accumulative lens, with variable stars synchronizing to demand translation only she can provide.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the truth hidden by mirrors—is signaled early and tightens as Kaelen navigates the vortex. Escalation is driven by his agency: choosing to step onto spinning timber, then deploying the seed via expanding circles. Cost is visible in the chaotic toll and the irreversible dissolution of Verrick’s stasis. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; methodical, character-rooted action does.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—stabilizing madness by finding the dream-intersection—is signaled early and tightens when the clipping’s path proves unreadable alone. The scar-linking deepens pressure: it’s painful, risky, and necessary, forcing Jaren to endure trauma to access truth. Cost is unmistakable: exhaustion for Elara, mental peril for Jaren, and the irreversible loss of the physical artifact. Escalation stems from protagonist agency under a Causal lens, with no coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming Leda’s lost joy—is signaled early and deepens when the orchard demands substitution. Elian’s agency drives escalation: his unsanctioned ritual provokes resistance, forcing him to offer his certainty as payment. The cost is unmistakable (“trading his security for her healing”) and visible in his post-ritual emptiness. Pressure coheres under the Causal lens, narrowing options until only sacrifice remains.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—authenticity as redemption—is signaled early and tightens when Elias must choose between delicate appraisal or roadie-force to verify the cloth. This deepening narrows options and raises personal cost: risking further humiliation if wrong. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; coincidence (finding the scrap) complicates but doesn’t resolve—Elias’s agency in wrenching truth drives escalation. Cost is unmistakable: his trembling hands, phantom cheers, and ultimate renunciation of commercial motive.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving Aris’s consciousness against entropy—is signaled early and tightens when the station lurches, forcing Elian to act. Escalation is driven by his agency: choosing analogical logic over engineering fixes narrows options to planting the seed. Cost is unmistakable in the ending’s “touching distance”—proximity without touch, warmth without reunion. The deepening isn’t reversal but intensification: haunted ambition becomes sustainable growth, paid for by accepting irrevocable separation.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving complex identities against entropy—is signaled early and deepens when the “heavy soul” resists dissolution. Elian’s agency drives escalation: he chooses contradiction over simplification, narrowing archival options but strengthening historical integrity. Cost is unmistakable: gears whir under pressure, the creel vibrates violently, and the fused ingot hums with “complex resonance.” Moon-phase viscosity directly shapes tactics, making the gibbous night pivotal.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving vs. releasing collective hope—is signaled early and tightens at the hesitation beat, where sealing would hoard light forever. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his decision to crown, not seal, narrows options irreversibly. Cost is unmistakable: he sacrifices his inspector role and personal isolation for vulnerable connection. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness through truth—is signaled early and deepens via Elias’s methodical decoding of graffiti. Agency is present in his choice to follow the “ceramic tile prophecy” and mimic a drowning gasp. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; cost is felt in his weeping and relinquished cartographic purpose. No false resolution—forgiveness is received, not seized.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—accessing suppressed truth before cyclic reversal traps her—is signaled early and tightens via the watch’s heat and color shift. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she adapts tactics using propagation delays, turning perceptual limitation into method. Cost is felt (risk of regression, time loss) and visible in the watch’s warnings. One meaningful deepening occurs—the realization that “truth decays when spoken”—which sharpens thematic stakes without deflating tension.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—freedom of wild things versus imperial silence—is signaled early and tightens at the coffee-stain revelation: “perforated destiny” offers a narrow window to act. Elian’s agency drives escalation; he chooses transformation over destruction, pouring coffee to activate the seed. Cost is unmistakable: the Empire’s claim collapses, and his personal safety is forfeited. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens, intensifying through sensory overload until the ivy falls silent—a cadence shift that crystallizes the moment of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving identity against dissolution—is signaled early and tightens at the “zero-point” when Elara must act or lose Vane forever. Her agency drives escalation: sifting static, detecting rhythm, pressing the chip. Cost is unmistakable—her “vitality” poured into transfer leaves her “breathing hard,” while Vane’s body becomes “empty matter.” Coincidence never resolves; success hinges on skill under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—freeing a soul paralyzed by rebirth fear—is signaled early and tightens when Elara recognizes her own past terror in the pod. Her agency drives escalation: climbing to think, descending with clarity, then acting with precision. Cost is legible: each release washes her own hurt, implying emotional labor with cumulative weight. No coincidence resolves; pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—moral certainty vs. doubt—is signaled early and deepened via Elias’s proprietary method. Vance’s agency drives escalation: his iron chime strike invites the mirror, which triggers his collapse. Cost is unmistakable: loss of invincibility (“terrified boy”) and forfeited command authority. The tightening forecloses bombardment, reweighting “necessary order” as fear masquerading as duty.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—how to manifest true influence—is signaled early and deepens when Elara withholds the formula, forcing Kael beyond intellectual grasping. The magnetic grotto transition intensifies pressure by altering perception, narrowing options to pure observation. Kael’s agency lies in surrender, not action: his realization emerges from watching, not doing, which aligns with the Accumulative lens. Cost is felt in Elara’s irreversible regression—she sacrifices future teaching capacity to seed this one transmission—and in Kael’s loss of egoic certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—escape via non-physical navigation—is signaled early and deepens through Silas’s synchronization with his own past scream. The tightening occurs when he identifies the birds’ flight as an air-density map, narrowing his throw to one precise vector. Cost is unmistakable: decades of futility crystallize into one fragile harmonic chance. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (crows) complicates but doesn’t resolve—Silas interprets and acts.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—finding sacred simplicity in a world of automated creativity—is signaled early and deepens when Elara sheds her regulator, narrowing options irrevocably. Pressure escalates via physical toll (mist walking), systemic opposition (whining regulator), and environmental hostility, culminating in a choice that trades safety for authenticity. Cost is unmistakable: she’s left shivering, exposed, and forever severed from the Looms’ world. Agency drives every escalation; coincidence plays no role in resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—verifying the emotional truth of a decades-old vow—is signaled early and escalates through protagonist agency: Silas chooses descent, navigation, and opening the jar. The meaningful deepening occurs when sound manifests as color, transforming abstract hope into tangible proof. Cost is unmistakable: he must confront forty years of self-deception (“preferred night shift because pay was better”). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with each sensory layer (lanterns → vows → violet-gold ribbons) reweighting his emotional capacity to endure silence.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory against universal collapse—is signaled early and tightens when the backwards prophecy reveals coral cities, making loss visceral. The escalation is driven by Hiero’s agency: he interprets coins, tunes dials, listens, and chooses to continue. The deepening occurs at the loop point, where doubt intensifies (“What if the universe was simply choking to death?”), narrowing options to endurance alone. Cost is felt in the vanished gold coin and the suffocating chest-tightness that precedes his final act.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—naming the nameless to neutralize terror—is signaled early and deepens through Silas’s agency: he repurposes the observatory, channels grief into crystallization. The tightening occurs when he shifts from passive mourning to active binding, foreclosing the path of unresolved haunting. Cost is felt: each sculpture eases the “crushing weight,” culminating in audible release (“Complete”). Escalation is driven by protagonist choice under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—repairing the bell to restore the sea—is signaled early and deepens through escalating precision demands. Pressure tightens via environmental shifts (dawn heating, air cooling) and psychological fragility (“microsecond of hesitation would shatter his psyche”). Agency is absolute: each drop is a choice under self-imposed rules; luck complicates (evaporation risk) but never resolves. Cost is felt in Elian’s exhaustion and the implied danger of cosmic backlash, though the latter remains conceptual rather than dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming collective memory—is signaled early and tightens at the apothecary, where Elias confronts a corrosive myth. His agency drives escalation: each photo placement deepens the narrative, culminating in the shard’s recontextualization. Cost is felt: emotional labor, historical responsibility, and the risk of failure if townspeople reject his reframing. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—harmonizing logic and intuition—is signaled early and tightens when the sky darkens, forcing a choice between crucible (logic) and starlings (intuition). The escalation is driven by Elara’s agency: she rejects fire, opens to wonder, and snaps her fingers. Cost is felt—the potential loss of her life’s work—and the final act forecloses the path of pure rationalism. Coincidence (starlings appearing) complicates but doesn’t resolve; she must interpret and act.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—Lyra’s survival—is signaled early and intensified by the micro-fracture discovery. The tightening is decisive: aborting strands them; proceeding risks death. Kael’s agency drives escalation—he revises the harness using only what’s at hand—and the cost is legible: emotional (adrenaline storm hidden), tactical (sacrificing his own gear), and existential (bearing the watcher’s burden). Pressure coheres causally, with no soft resets or off-stage resolutions.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming emotional capacity—is signaled early and deepens when Vane asserts corporate ownership, raising legal/ontological barriers. Kael’s agency drives escalation: he redirects Vane’s attack using complementary opposites, then severs Vane’s authority with truth-blade before vivifying the brain. Each turn narrows options (combat → transfer) and carries cost: accepting trauma’s return. The historical revision clock tightens tactics but doesn’t resolve conflict; victory comes through Kael’s irreversible choice to merge logic with instinct.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—creative breakthrough—is signaled early and tightens when the seed demands unconventional nurturing. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses lateral thinking over discarding the seed. Cost is conceptual (embracing decay as design) and practical (managing future stench), legible in the final vision of the mad botanist room.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—restoring lost familial joy—is signaled early and deepens through Silas’s realization that his own moods silenced his household. The tightening occurs when he chooses deafening violence over passive regret, foreclosing any return to quietude. Cost is unmistakable: his marrow vibrates, guilt macerates into flow, and tears stream horizontally—physical proof of emotional expenditure. Agency drives escalation: each pull cord ignites not just engines but his resolve to push wind backward through time.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving narrative ambiguity against violent definition—is signaled early and deepens when the pendant’s light threatens the garden’s core logic. The guardian’s agency drives escalation: choosing to interiorize the landscape, then to wait rather than attack, foreclosing their old predatory role with visible cost (enduring fear instead of eliminating it). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of sensory violation (light “cutting” mist) intensifies until the cultist’s trembling hand makes the stakes visceral. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the cultist’s terror is a catalyst, not a solution.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—breaking stasis to create a future—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Elian realizes he must be “the catastrophe,” foreclosing the path of preservation. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each failed iteration raises physical and existential cost (deepening cold, bodily exposure). The final act carries unmistakable price: heritage obliterated, self-exposure to lethal cold. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens with one decisive deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—capturing the nebula’s final signal—is clear early and tightens when standard protocols fail. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she discards assumptions, listens to gaps, and locks onto silence. Cost is felt in trembling meters, vibrating deck plates, and volatile magic requiring post-mission safety checks. Lunar perigee intensifies pressure but doesn’t resolve it; success stems from her perceptual shift, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—returning to linear time—is signaled early and tightens when Elara realizes audio frequency must fill the hourglass. Escalation is driven by her agency: she chooses to broadcast clock ticks, risking failure. Cost is felt in the violent deck lurch and reassertion of gravity. Coincidence never resolves; success stems from her precise, willful acts under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving sanity by binding hallucinations—is signaled early and tightens as fever spikes. Elias’s agency drives escalation: each loop of thread deepens his entrapment, foreclosing escape. Cost is unmistakable: cold sweat, searing thread, and ultimate psychic consumption by the gallery. The “rational enchantment” framework raises stakes by demanding logic-sacrifice, but the eruption resolves too cleanly as pure consequence rather than compounded error—minor deduction for slightly teleological collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming celestial navigation—is signaled early and deepens when Harlin risks madness for starlight. The escalation is driven entirely by his agency: typing coordinates, expanding sensors, visualizing folded water. The cost is unmistakable: intellectual triumph paired with bodily entrapment, crystallized in the logbook entry of a course he’ll never sail. Pressure tightens once, decisively, and the alien math doesn’t resolve—it reveals a cage.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—protecting unmoored spirits—is signaled early and deepens when the child’s fear replaces Arthur’s heart. Elara’s agency drives escalation: choosing to use the hearing aid, projecting recognition, linking photo to sound. Cost is unmistakable—physical collapse post-confrontation, adrenaline drain—and narrows options (no retreat once shadows coalesce). Coincidence never resolves; victory comes through earned connection under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—freeing trapped consciousness—is signaled early and tightens via the tidal clock, which narrows options relentlessly. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to insert the gold, key the override, endure sensory violence. Cost is visible: panic nearly paralyzes him, and escape is frantic. Coincidence never resolves; success stems from preparation (studied method) and courage under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—extracting truth from digital ghost—is signaled early and deepens when the ink ritual bypasses logic to access emotional truth. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses chaos over code, enabling the wife’s confession. Cost is unmistakable: the shard drowns, the projection fades, and he’s left with bitter wisdom that saves him only from purgatory, not loss. Pressure tightens once, decisively, under Accumulative lens—no coincidence, no slack.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—translating texture into enduring sound—is signaled early and tightens when Sylas realizes words fail, shifting tactics to avian aerodynamics. Escalation is driven by his agency: choosing the cursed diamond, aligning its flaw with bird formations, vocalizing friction. Cost is unmistakable: his voice is claimed, yet the canyon gains tactile memory. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens, deepening via sensory density rather than external opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—rewriting cosmic tragedy as absurd vitality—is signaled early and tightens when Elias chooses to weaponize resentment. His agency drives escalation: whispering confessions, slicing his thumb, commanding “Laugh.” Cost is legible in the dead phone and fragile hope. Gravity’s playfulness isn’t coincidence but a tactical condition earned by the ritual’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—beauty vs. mechanization—is signaled early and deepened when Elara risks annihilation to summon wildness. Escalation is driven by her agency: syncing bow to heartbeat bypasses sentinels’ auditory logic, provoking the orchard’s violent awakening. Cost is unmistakable: order collapses, statues are destroyed, and the city’s “gray wounds” bleed life—a trade-off between control and vitality. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, intensifying via cadence and sensory density rather than causal reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—delivering encapsulated weather as political/moral act—is signaled early and tightens at the drone border. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his “linking absences” technique narrows options under electromagnetic surveillance. Cost is unmistakable: sweat stings but can’t be wiped, knees crack on tiles. The lone mail drop deadline forces a single, high-risk path—no coincidental saves.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—completing the charger before the chime fades—is signaled early and tightens via the volatile halo fragment, which demands vocalization, thus foreclosing Elias’s lifelong silence. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: his search leads to the oasis, his choice to sing tames the light, and his final note fuses it into the horse. Cost is unmistakable: the searing purity of the fragment forces him to break his core identity. Coincidence (wrong turn) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the resolution hinges on his song.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—accessing pre-written stories—is signaled early and tightens via Elara’s geometric manipulation. Agency is clear: her folds escalate pressure until the scarf snaps, foreclosing entry but validating her theory. Cost is felt (lost moment, frayed artifact) and conceptual (proximity without access). Coincidence doesn’t resolve; failure stems from material limits, not luck. One tightening suffices, though deeper moral calculus could push toward 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (deciphering longing via dream-recall) tightens when sunrise begins—the “hush of improbable beginnings” imposes a live clock. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she harvests light, constructs the city, and vitalizes memory. Cost is clear (construct’s inevitable dissolution), though the archipelago’s aid slightly softens opposition. One meaningful deepening suffices: the cipher’s resolution requires perfect accuracy or “curdle[s] into regret.”

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—freeing a buried creative impulse—is signaled early and tightens when Silas dissolves the ground, forcing the woman to choose between panic and focus. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her decision to obey “Do not look down” directly enables the lock’s release. Cost is legible in her “breathing heavily” post-liberation and the vanished token of “cowardice.” Yet the pressure relies slightly on Silas’s external orchestration rather than the woman’s autonomous deepening—she follows commands, doesn’t initiate.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—recovering his wife’s voice—is signaled early and intensified by the “raw, open wound” of memory theft. Escalation occurs through Silas’s agency: he deciphers celestial patterns from wreckage gaps, waits for tidal reversal, and acts precisely when shadows realign. The cost is palpable: lifelong isolation, reputation loss, and emotional desiccation, all crystallizing in the “cold, dark wait.” Luck (tidal event) complicates but doesn’t resolve; success hinges on his interpretive skill and endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—proving worthiness to re-enter light—is signaled early and tightens through Silas’s refusal to ease the trial. Escalation is driven by Lenore’s agency: her shadow surges, strikes, and finally breaks the glass. Cost is unmistakable: Silas endures emotional exposure (standing firm despite fear) and Lenore risks annihilation by light. Pressure coheres causally under the Causal lens with one meaningful deepening—the annotated runes.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder before it vanishes from the cosmos—is signaled early and deepens through Elian’s deliberate, costly act of essence-weaving. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: he chooses not just to release the seed but to braid it meticulously into the water, ensuring seamless integration. The price is visible: physical exhaustion and the irreversible dissolution of the last physical trace of a lost civilization. Coincidence plays no role; pressure tightens through disciplined craft under cosmic urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—grounding his brother’s spirit before it ravages the world—is signaled early and tightens when Elian admits he stole the net, raising moral cost. Escalation is driven by his agency: each knot unraveled releases heavier silence, narrowing options until only self-imprisonment remains. The “lucid unrest” intensifies coherently under Accumulative lens, culminating in a trade-off where peace for the dead demands eternal unrest for the living. Cost is legible in the mask’s “terrifyingly empty” face and Elian’s numb fingers.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—accessing the Whispered Chapel through emotional resonance—is signaled early and tightens when Elara realizes force won’t work. Escalation is driven by her agency: comparing footage, triangulating coordinates, then embodying grief. Cost is felt in the final act—she risks nothing physical but offers profound emotional openness, which the mechanism validates. Coincidence never resolves; all pressure stems from character choices under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding the moment of soul detachment—is signaled early and deepens when Elias isolates “resistance” as the variable. His agency drives escalation: he chooses to ground the transmission, breaking the loop. Cost is felt in the library’s lightened silence and his clipped souvenir—a quiet forfeiture of mystery for resolution. One meaningful tightening suffices; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—articulating Kaelen’s unspoken needs—is signaled early and deepens when Elian risks electrocution to bridge analog/digital realms. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he chooses the storm window, encodes manually, presses the plate. Cost is unmistakable: emotional exhaustion, physical drenching, and the irreversible acceptance that Kaelen exists only in code now. One meaningful tightening occurs—the lightning strike forces irrevocable action within a split-second window.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—uncovering hidden joy—is signaled early and deepens via the diary’s spectral decryption. Elian’s agency drives escalation: he actively tests the goggles, narrowing options under time pressure (floors 5–8). Cost is felt in his composed solitude—he bears Halloway’s secret alone, foreclosing communal mourning. However, stakes remain internalized; no secondary pressure or tangible loss sharpens the trade-off beyond emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—proving memory persists in vacuum—is signaled early and deepens when the Nimbus of Resentment births a radiant memory-loop. Elian’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to witness fully, to document, accepting eternal drift as cost. Pressure tightens once meaningfully: from classification to revelation. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; his trained attention unlocks the vision. Cost is felt but not over-explained—tears, trembling hands, solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—mirroring the sky before demolition—is signaled early and tightens relentlessly as Elias confronts the limits of human mimesis. His agency drives escalation: he chooses to stay, seeks the Guild’s secret, deciphers the coin, and translates its fractal logic blindfolded by vision. Cost is unmistakable: the masterpiece exists only for one breath before destruction. Coincidence complicates (demolition clock), never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—charting the unchartable—is signaled early and deepens when Elara shifts from sky-watching to floor-deciphering, narrowing options from observation to interpretation. The magnetic anomaly linking birds and luminance creates coherent pressure under an Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual: success is fleeting (luminance dissolves), yet Elara’s earned stance—walking back to deck “ready for the next mystery”—forecloses complacency. Agency lies in attention, not force, fitting the story’s epistemological conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring cosmic rhythm—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully in the hall of mirrors, where mental architecture forces Elara to reject false failures. Her agency drives escalation: choosing blindness over illusion, then applying torque against “resistance of the heavens.” Cost is felt (emotional exhaustion, implied historical burden) but not visibly paid in loss or sacrifice, slightly muting the price demanded by high-band standards.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving the Nebula of Respite—is signaled early and tightens through Oren’s messages, culminating in the high-risk pump modification. Agency is collective but focused through Elara’s leadership and Jaxon’s reluctant curiosity. Cost is felt in bleeding hands and groaning anchors, and the escalation (thinning nebula → gray leaves → urgent diagram) narrows options credibly. Coincidence never resolves; the solution emerges from prior tools and unity.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—encoding safety into the next universe—is signaled early and deepens through Silas’s alignment of chaotic fracture with temporal rhythm. Agency is clear: he chooses asymmetry over perfection, actively adjusts dials, leans into the pane to vouchsafe memory. Cost escalates visibly: puppet dissolves, lighthouse unspools, body loses coherence. The tightening occurs when nested patterns explode outward—a point of no return where physical reality trades for emotional legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—saving travelers before frost seals the maze—is signaled by line 3 and tightens relentlessly via the falling sun and ice bloom. Silas’s agency drives escalation: his remote manipulation retrieves the seed, assembles the device, and overrides the birds. Cost is visible: physical tremors, emotional drain, and the orchard’s pull post-rescue. Coincidence never resolves; even the birds’ aggression is a systemic pressure he must outmaneuver through skill and sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—engineering an ephemeral polymer—is signaled early and tightens when Elias grasps the “molecular eddy.” Agency drives escalation: his observation of foam leads to a concrete chemical insight. Cost is felt in the renunciation of his life’s work (“mountains of synthetic refuse”). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, though the tightening occurs in one beat rather than layered progression.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—access to narrative origin—tightens when the journal demonstration proves erasure’s efficacy, raising the cost of each future transaction. Elian’s agency drives escalation: he chooses void-glass weights, diamond scalpel, then moonlight, each step narrowing options toward genesis. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the bell’s ring introduces new pressure. Cost is felt in the “ghost of what had been removed”—freedom with permanent residue.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—processing stored remorse—is signaled early and escalates through Elara’s tactile vulnerability (“emotionally contagious through touch”) to the life-risking act of ingestion. Her agency drives every turn: analyzing pools, digging, chipping coral, swallowing. Cost is unmistakable: the “freezing weight” nearly shatters her spirit, paid to achieve atmospheric “lift.” Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via sensory and emotional density until the broth of wisdom crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preventing societal collapse via acoustic cohesion—is signaled early and deepens when Elara physically alters time to force listening. The meaningful tightening occurs when she adds the pinecone weight, slowing the clock and raising personal cost (muscle strain, risk of stalling). Agency is clear: her song, not coincidence, resolves the crisis. However, the industrial valley’s shift feels slightly swift given the scale of paranoia described, softening the escalation’s edge.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving obsolete human psyche against digital erasure—is signaled early and intensifies through Elara’s dangerous neural coupling. The meaningful deepening occurs when she forces synaptic plasticity to mimic the mirror’s chaos, narrowing options: success demands total surrender to entangled memory flood. Cost is unmistakable—her body rigid, pathways “burning into existence”—and the final stance crystallizes under coherent pressure. No coincidence resolves; agency drives every escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—renewing the Seeds of Vigilance before time runs out—is signaled early and tightens when gravity inversion destabilizes. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she deciphers the doodle, exploits threshold effects, and speaks resonant frequencies. Cost is unmistakable: the chronometer’s buzz, jarring landing, and implied decades of failed attempts. However, the “chaos festering below” remains abstract, slightly weakening the stakes’ visceral weight despite strong tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—coaxing music from mute wood—is signaled early and deepens via the failed ash block, which teaches that rigidity destroys. Elian’s agency drives escalation: he chooses empathy over force, altering tactics based on historical analysis. The hedgehog’s uncurling tightens timing, making winter’s end a live constraint. Cost is felt in his decades of failure and crystallized in his knees hitting the earth—endurance transformed into earned vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—deciphering the spirits’ silence—is signaled early and deepens when Elian shifts from passive observation to active correlation of magnetic pulses and wind pauses. His agency drives the escalation: translating silence into strategic intent is a high-stakes cognitive gambit. The cost is legible in his healed-but-hurting heart and the foreclosed path of return. The tightening culminates in a single, irreversible realization that reconfigures all prior assumptions with emotional and conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—liberating a memory without violating its guardian—is signaled by page one and tightens when Elias realizes the lock embodies protection, not secrecy. His agency drives escalation: discarding melancholy C, rejecting mosquito-whine, tuning to lullaby heartbeat. The cost is conceptual yet palpable: sorrow must “breathe” or rot, and opening requires surrendering control to resonance. Fireworks’ eruption coincides with release but doesn’t resolve—it amplifies the earned poise of mutual respect over dominance.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—cultivating serenity through biological mastery—is signaled early and deepens when the corpse flower’s stench reveals “the undercurrent of wisdom,” transforming Elara’s goal from control to comprehension. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her journaling ritual intensifies into frantic annotation as the bloom coincides with the decade-long wind shift. Cost is felt in her relinquished dream of stillness, replaced by acceptance of perpetual motion. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each sensory and temporal layer tightening stakes toward Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—saving crops from blight—is signaled early and tightens when Elara enters the Flux, foreclosing safety. The hour-long inversion creates a live clock that forces urgency, and her agency drives escalation: she chooses to follow water, land mid-anomaly, and twist the artifact. Cost is visible—she scrambles back as gravity resets—and the stakes deepen from survival to stewardship. Coincidence never resolves; everything stems from her decisions under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preventing future crashes through foresight—is signaled early and deepens when Elara finds the patch, personalizing the abstract risk. The meaningful tightening occurs at the impact zone: data confirms the “singular convergence,” transforming investigation into actionable prophecy. Agency is clear—her survey choices narrow uncertainty—and the cost (bearing witness in suffocating silence) is palpable. Coincidence complicates (shifting containers create new vortices) but resolution stems entirely from her methodical work, satisfying Causal escalation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—certifying wonder as essential—is signaled early and deepens when the aurora intensifies, tightening the window for action. Elian’s agency drives escalation: he feels the artist’s tension and chooses “Now,” pulling the rope to unfetter magic. The cost is visible in the spent amber sheet and his enduring isolation. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure grows via sensory saturation culminating in a single, decisive act that validates creation miles away.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding failure to redefine guardianship—is signaled early and deepens when Silas realizes his fundamental error mid-performance. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: arranging markers enables resonance, which reveals the “river” of otherworldly energy, forcing conceptual shift. Cost is unmistakable: reputational ruin and emotional devastation (“tears streamed... scar of wisdom”). Coincidence doesn’t resolve; insight emerges from his own flawed method corrected through action.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—measuring the soul’s weight via transposed empathy—is signaled early and tightens through the Operator’s escalating intrusions. The “disorientation” method forces Kael into unmoored vulnerability, narrowing his options to pure endurance. Cost is unmistakable: Kael is emptied, the halo dims, and the universe darkens. Though Kael lacks active agency, the Operator’s relentless pursuit under coherent pressure satisfies Situational escalation with conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—delivering wonder to a monochrome world—is signaled early and tightens when the pendant hums, demanding immediate action. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to vibrate, using her flaw as catalyst. Cost is felt in exhaustion and relic’s dissolution; the trade-off (lose object, gain inspiration) is legible. Under Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via atmospheric and bodily density, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—Mara’s need for closure versus her disbelief—is signaled early and tightens when the prism reveals truth, foreclosing her anger narrative. Pressure escalates via supernatural environmental response (hush, suspended mist), but agency remains with Elias’s choice to perform the ritual and Mara’s decision to witness. Cost is felt in her tears and the irreversible dissolution of her coping myth. Escalation is driven by protagonist action under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—transmitting proof of existence—is signaled early and tightens when silence breaches the orchard, forcing Elara’s ultimate trade: life for message. Agency is total; her “Recommence” command triggers irreversible escalation. Cost is visible (her dissolution) and conceptual (erasure of sanctuary). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each encroaching loss (tree, bamboo) deepens urgency without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—saving the harvest—is signaled early and tightens when Ewan chooses the mine over temples. The meaningful deepening occurs in the geode: the barter system forces a trade with conceptual cost (truth for lie). Escalation is driven by Ewan’s agency under coherent pressure (gravity fluctuations, crumbling world), though the “dormant consciousness” mechanic slightly softens causality. Cost is unmistakable: he surrenders illusion, the tool of his hidden competence.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the truth behind the *Icarus* explosion—is signaled early and tightens when Elara fights temporal inertia to redirect the vision, narrowing options from infinite timelines to one damning audio clip. Agency drives escalation: her mental effort creates the reversal. Cost is unmistakable: physical collapse, emotional devastation, and the burden of knowledge that offers no catharsis—only heavier silence.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—psychological survival in isolation—is signaled early and deepens when the lamp fails. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his decision to add the sea glass transforms distress into endurance. The cost is legible in Thomas’s shuddering breath and loosened posture—a visceral shift from terror to safety. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, intensifying via object-based ritual rather than external threat.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—shaping tomorrow by resurrecting ancestral darkness—is signaled early and tightens when Silas steers the storm toward the metropolis. His agency drives escalation: slotting the wick, adjusting mirrors, turning the wheel. Cost is conceptual (erasure of digital debris) and literal (the dam’s burst), though the latter is reported, not felt. Under an Accumulative lens, this single deepening suffices, but the emotional price of Silas’s isolation lacks visceral weight at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—capturing structural color to understand charisma—is signaled early and deepens when Elian realizes the heart’s “magnetism” is perceptual, not biological. The single meaningful tightening occurs at the climax: succeed and gain insight, fail and lose the wing forever. Cost is legible in the gray dust alternative and the emotional weight of his syncopated heartbeat. Agency drives escalation—his meticulous preparation, not luck, enables the reaction; coincidence (sun alignment) complicates but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—clearing quantified sorrow to access arboreal memory—is signaled early and deepens when the blockage threatens reality’s walls. Elias’s agency drives escalation: mapping dreams leads to finding the grief-knot, then precise intervention. Cost is felt in the tear left behind and the necessity of night work. Coincidence (storm’s eye) complicates but doesn’t resolve—he times his action within it.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rekindling the realm—is signaled early and tightens when the woven light becomes “too wild,” forcing the swaddling act. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her song summons filaments, her weaving binds spirits, her swaddling contains chaos. Cost is felt in burned palms and mental fragmentation, though the villagers’ sudden sync borders on convenient amplification rather than earned complication. The deepening (communal will fueling the loom) meaningfully alters tactics but lacks friction—no resistance or doubt tempers their unity.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can empathy be a gateway rather than a wound?—tightens when the invitation demands presence amid emotional noise. Elian’s agency drives escalation: he chooses invisibility-through-withdrawal, then “staying while leaving,” each narrowing options. Cost is felt in his hammering heart and ruined paper, but the final price—abandoning his identity as recluse—is implied more than dramatized. Still, under Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices, and the trade-off resonates.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory against collective forgetting—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s guerrilla gardening and bread ritual. The meaningful tightening occurs when he enters the surveilled space, narrowing options to furtive acts with high personal risk. Cost is felt (guilt of survival) and conceptual (irreversible urban decay), though the escalation leans more accumulative than causal. Agency is present in every choice, but the pressure remains atmospheric rather than sharpening into a decisive trade-off beyond the ritual itself.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving authentic meaning before universal entropy—is clear from paragraph two and tightens as the slide decays. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her meticulous measurement forces the luminous vows into data, narrowing options from preservation-as-memory to preservation-as-proof. The cost is unmistakable: warmth vanishes, light snaps off, and she’s left in blue gloom. Though tension is internal, it’s viscerally felt through the dying gauge needle and flickering hologram; one meaningful deepening (verifying truth before dissolution) suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—capturing betrayal’s sound—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s escalating false starts, each narrowing Kael’s patience and raising the risk of violence. Agency is clear: she engineers the betrayal by disrupting rhythm, not waiting passively. Cost is felt in every withheld gesture and culminates in Kael’s irreversible violation of the truce. Sunrise isn’t just a clock; it’s a tightening noose that forces the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding why people carry weather—is signaled early and tightens when Elara confronts the carriers as ballots. Her agency drives escalation: she corrects course, consults the compass, steps forward despite doubt. Cost is legible in her dimming bioluminescence and the gray cloud forming—a personal burden assigned by consensus. The system’s logic resolves conflict not through force but reconfiguration, fitting the Accumulative lens perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—artistic authenticity vs. commercial survival—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Silas smashes the lock, foreclosing polite caricature forever. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative pressure: each sensory and memory beat intensifies until the physical act of destruction becomes inevitable. Cost is felt in lost years and the permanent burial of his restraint symbol. Coincidence never resolves; silence arrives only after emotional labor.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—recovering suppressed truth—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the Governor’s lie triggers Elara’s wilting, confirming deception. The clerk’s lie escalates pressure, forcing candor that unlocks the archive. Elara’s agency drives the climax: she demands, collapses, and ultimately chooses dissemination. Cost is felt physically and morally, and the evacuation order’s revelation forecloses passive compliance. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; truth emerges through earned confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving emotional color against homogenizing silence—is signaled early and escalates through Elara’s deliberate engineering of disruption. The tightening occurs when sunrise melts the ice, upsetting balance and triggering irreversible sound. Agency is clear: she chooses to initiate chaos despite personal muteness, paying the cost of fleeting impact (the song lasts only until the ice vanishes). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with thermodynamics driving the turn, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—resolving inner static before system wipe—is signaled early and tightens when fears threaten to shatter the dome, forcing Seven to miniaturize chaos. His agency drives escalation: choosing compression over deletion, then directing the burst outward. Cost is unmistakable: loss of the farm, the ghosts, the sealed world. The magnetic reversal isn’t coincidence—it’s the external pressure that makes his internal crisis lethal, deepening stakes without resolving them mechanically.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserving home through collective memory—is signaled early and tightens when Elara chooses listening over panic. Her agency drives escalation: each story narrows the combination’s possibilities. Cost is felt in the community’s dissolved panic, replaced by solidarity that demands ongoing vigilance. Coincidence (child’s rhyme) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Elara actively traces it.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—liberating the trapped consciousness—is signaled early and tightens when Elara must “encrypt vulnerability as strength” to bypass defenses. The meaningful deepening occurs mid-dance: admitting weakness confuses the system. Cost is felt in her breathless exhaustion and the weight she carries upward. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens—each gesture adds authorization—but lacks a sharper tactical trade-off to reach 9.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering a deleted memory before it dissolves—is signaled early and tightens when gravity fluctuates upon theft, forcing Elias to choose between drifting to death or psychic anchoring. The meaningful deepening occurs when the wildflowers’ scent becomes tactical, not just sentimental. Cost is unmistakable: bodily trauma (“breath-stealing thud”) and the irreversible act of exhumation. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens—density of salt, silence, and memory crystallizes into stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preventing a coded prophecy from manifesting—is signaled early and deepens through the protagonist’s agency: he doesn’t fight noise but maps its absences. The tightening occurs when he shifts from observation to active lattice-weaving, narrowing options to one fragile method. Cost is felt in the heavy “velvet layer of peace” that coats even his heart—a conceptual price for erasing potential futures. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation reads as cadence shift from chaotic whisper to glass-like hush, driven entirely by Elian’s will.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving shelter through linguistic deception—is signaled early (“language of old buildings”) and tightens when Silas produces the seal. The deepening (“You are teaching me to lie to the stone”) raises conceptual cost: truth becomes lethal. Agency is maintained—Silas drives interrogation, demands answers, and chooses complicity. One meaningful turn suffices at this length; the meteor shower complicates but doesn’t resolve, preserving causal integrity under Situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—freedom from parasitic grief—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s active archiving, which narrows her options to irreversible renunciation. Escalation is driven by her agency: humming the dissonant tone, pressing the shell, forcing herself to witness. The cost is unmistakable: the “violent transition,” stripped emotion, and “no ghost left to comfort her.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens, with one decisive intensification—the memory’s crystallization—that reconfigures her entire existence.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—rewriting the prince’s fate—is signaled early and deepens when Elian confronts his decade-old failure. Escalation is driven by agency: he chooses stillness, applies the key, lifts the ‘n’—each narrowing options under magical wards and freezing temps. Cost is unmistakable: enduring frostbite-level cold, risking execution, and metabolizing lifelong guilt into one irreversible glyph. The moral calculus—death vs. praise—sharpens the peak choice without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—uncovering why some voices echo forever—is signaled early and tightens through Elara’s escalating vocal interventions, each narrowing options under Council surveillance. Agency is clear: her choices (pitch shifts, breath modulation) directly extract truth, with visible cost in physical strain and risk. The Silent Council’s sound-webs create coherent antagonistic pressure, though their presence remains off-page. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, culminating in a decisive act that reweights silence itself—but lacks a tangible sacrifice beyond emotional weight, slightly limiting felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—exposing the boy’s true final act—is signaled early and tightens when dream patterns reveal his placement near exits. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she actively synchronizes visions rather than passively receiving them. Cost is felt in the risk of shattering the spirit (“pulling too hard… could shatter the remnant”), though this danger remains abstract rather than dramatized in a failed attempt. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—perceiving and affirming hidden patterns—is signaled early and deepens when Elian risks intrusion on noble architecture to pursue clarity. The moon-path walk tightens pressure by literalizing his philosophical stance: light = knowledge, shadow = ignorance. His whistle is the decisive act that narrows possibility into momentary order, with cost felt in his isolation and the insects’ exhaustion. While escalation is subtle, it’s consistent with the Accumulative lens; however, the absence of a tangible consequence beyond internal resonance slightly limits the stakes’ visceral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. protective myth—is signaled early and tightens when the machine destabilizes. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his deduction, then intuition, alters outcomes. The cost (destroying the fear that shields the orchard) is legible in the final lines. Pressure coheres causally; no coincidence resolves the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—control over the revolution’s narrative—tightens when variant allegiance transfers loyalty to Kael, foreclosing Silas’s agency. The escalation is driven by protagonist choices (splicing signals, grooming Kael), not coincidence, and culminates in visible cost: severed connection, mocking machinery, exile from his own creation. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—saving the past’s melody from oblivion—is signaled early and tightens at dawn when external pressure (wind’s flute-note) forces the ritual’s climax. Elian’s agency drives escalation: his precise blending of sounds alters the music box’s fate. Cost is legible in his trembling hands and solitary vigil; the “gleaning for salvation” stakes deepen without abstraction. Coincidence (wind timing) complicates but doesn’t resolve—he must still perform the delicate chemistry.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—protecting the artifact—is signaled early and tightens when mechanical force fails, forcing adaptation. The meaningful deepening occurs when Elias abandons engineering rigidity for vibrational matching, narrowing options to one fragile method. Cost is unmistakable: exposed skin, vocal strain, bodily risk. Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist agency under Accumulative pressure; no coincidence resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—disabling the viaduct without provoking swift rebuild—is signaled early and deepens when Elara reveals her true aim: teaching patience. The tightening occurs when Kael’s impulse is overruled, narrowing options to Elara’s precise window. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her knowledge of moon paths and environmental harmonics dictates tactics. Cost is unmistakable: irreversible destruction that demands strategic silence, not celebration.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. corporate erasure—is signaled early and tightens when Halloway demands compliance. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his scanner use, interpretation of waveforms, and ultimate upload are all active choices that narrow options. The cost—career termination—is felt in the loaded silence after his defiance. Pressure coheres under Causal lens: each turn stems from Elias’s decisions, not coincidence, culminating in a trade-off with irreversible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether broken things (and people) deserve restoration—is signaled early and deepens when the “second opinion” reveals the heart runs on sound, not springs. This escalation is driven by the protagonist’s agency: Elias sought mechanical redemption, but the truth forces a moral recalibration. The cost is felt in his paralysis—he cannot undo his failure to truly listen. Pressure tightens once, decisively, when the music plays and the heart beats, foreclosing any retreat into theological abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—ascension over survival—is signaled early and deepens via irreversible trade-offs: blunted stylus → obsidian relic, iron shielding → canvas. Agency drives escalation: Unit Seven’s modifications narrow options until only launch remains. Cost is unmistakable: the workshop’s rot mirrors his shedding, culminating in skeletal vulnerability. Coincidence (storm timing) complicates but doesn’t resolve; victory stems from etched wind patterns memorized through prismatic vision.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding the truth behind deletion—is signaled early and tightens when the drone interrupts, forcing Silas to choose between exposure and subterfuge. His lie succeeds but deepens peril, escalating to the synthesis that reveals hijacking and digital imprisonment. The cost is conceptual (the corporation’s true nature) and personal (his complicity). One meaningful tightening suffices, though the escalation leans slightly on coincidence (numbers appearing everywhere); however, protagonist agency drives every key turn.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether to enact mercy or judgment—is clear from the outset and tightens when Kaelen commits to reconstituting the anomaly. His agency drives escalation: he navigates mirrors, aligns reflection and shard, and projects truth. The cost is legible in the council’s transformed stance and the cessation of grinding ice. However, the prisoner’s fate remains implied rather than concretely altered, slightly softening the consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering the sound of endings—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes it’s not destruction but aftermath that sings. His agency drives escalation: deferring euthanasia to volunteer, then choosing to stop searching once truth is found. The tightening occurs at the parasol tip: it forecloses further trawling and reorients his path to the clinic. Cost is felt in relinquishment—the work ends, the fold smooths, and linear time resumes with mortal consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—emotional reconciliation with loss—is signaled early and deepened through Elias’s viticultural analogy, which reframes rejection as biological necessity. The woman’s agency lies in attention and renunciation: she stops reading smoke, opens her hand, and accepts waiting. Cost is felt in her swollen eyes and tightened grip, then released. Escalation is subtle but coherent under an Accumulative lens, with one meaningful deepening that forecloses self-blame.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving wisdom against dogma—is signaled early and tightens when the Pavilion demands confession, forcing emotional exposure as price of entry. Elian’s agency drives escalation: his choices (not luck) navigate traps, conjure sanctuary, and seal knowledge. Cost is felt in his trembling voice and solitary retreat. One tightening suffices at this length, though the moral calculus (truth vs. survival) could deepen further without sacrificing brevity.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—collective healing through ancestral joy—is signaled early and deepens via Elian’s lingering, which narrows options to pure endurance. Pressure escalates texturally: cooling air, creeping vines, twilight softening edges. The cost is visible in time forfeited and emotional weight borne, though agency leans toward attention over decision. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; magic requires patience modern life denies, making the ritual itself the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—defying linguistic immutability to testify to living growth—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s syntactic rebellion. Agency is clear: he chooses fractured speech over silence, risking erasure in a world that criminalizes novelty. Cost is conceptual (abandoning the scholar’s duty) and felt (voice gaining strength only after shedding fear). While escalation is strong, the absence of external opposition softens pressure slightly; stakes remain internalized despite high thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—capturing aging’s sound—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes he must trust hands over mind. The tightening occurs as his vision erodes, forcing him to externalize prophecy via driftwood, narrowing options to tactile ritual. Cost is felt in his panic and the chalk’s physical depletion, though the escalation leans more on atmosphere than active opposition. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; his agency drives every turn toward earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—capturing the Green Flash—is signaled early and tightens when the hand’s spin threatens lens destruction. Elian’s agency drives escalation: he doesn’t stop the hand but aligns with its “escape velocity,” transforming a flaw into the mechanism’s power source. Cost is unmistakable: he trades control for attunement, risking total failure for a chance at the ephemeral. The earthquake complicates but doesn’t resolve; victory emerges from his precise tension dialing under collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—executing a “flawless goodbye”—is signaled early and deepens when Clara’s despair surfaces. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his humming, then cello-playing, validates her pain rather than soothing it, narrowing options to musical truth-telling. The cost is felt in Clara’s release and Elias’s burdened kindness. One meaningful tightening suffices, though a second pressure point (e.g., time running out) could elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—finding where shadows go at noon—is signaled early and deepens as Elara simulates the sun, forcing the world to remember noon. Escalation is driven by her agency: closing loops, adjusting valves, turning the key. Cost is legible in the knowledge’s ephemerality (“fade by morning”) and the shadows’ terrified pooling—a conceptual price for violating natural order. The tightening (from glyph study to beam activation) forecloses passive observation, demanding active world-rewriting.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring the daughter—is signaled early and deepens into “turning mistakes into constellations.” Aris’s agency drives escalation: his decision to treat substitution as fracture narrows options (rejecting death pronouncement) and raises emotional cost (demanding parents embrace terrifying hope). The tightening occurs when he chooses innovation over orthodoxy, forcing a trade-off between scientific duty and magical possibility. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—creating safe light without fire—is signaled early and deepens through memory-triggered panic. The tightening occurs when trauma resurfaces mid-polish, forcing her to choose between retreat or persistence; she endures, refining the glass into purpose. Cost is felt (psychic pain) and visible (tremor, breath control). Under an Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening suffices, though escalation lacks a second tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming meaning after systemic betrayal—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s tending and Mara’s hiding. The single meaningful tightening occurs when Elias follows the water’s path to the amber, then offers it: a choice that forecloses isolation and opens fragile connection. Cost is felt in Mara’s trembling and the weight of her viral confession; agency resides in attention and gesture rather than grand action. Coincidence (the pendant’s placement) complicates but doesn’t resolve—Elias’s interpretation and offering are deliberate acts under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving hope before plot crushes it—is signaled by line 3 and tightens when Elias inserts himself against the narrative current. The meaningful deepening occurs at the bridge: his intrusion disrupts fatalism but cannot rewrite canon, forcing a trade-off between artistic integrity and compassion. Cost is unmistakable: Elara’s dimmed eyes, Elias’s exhaustion, and the irreversible closing of the book. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, with pressure accumulating through sensory and textual density.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring sacred reciprocity with the land—is signaled early and tightens at the climax when success hinges on precise celestial alignment. Elian’s agency drives escalation: grafting, singing, and waiting are active choices under pressure. Cost is felt (vine’s death, his exhaustion), though the resolution leans slightly toward grace over grit, softening the price just enough to dock 0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving the orchard’s residual pulse—is signaled early and deepens when starlight must be fused via destructive flash. Silas’s agency drives escalation: he chooses timing, arrangement, and ignition. Cost is felt in the irreversible incineration of flash-paper and the abandonment of natural debris; the ritual succeeds only by sacrificing transience for permanence.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving fragile beauty against entropic silence—is signaled early and deepens as Elias risks scattering the echoes through direct attention. His agency drives escalation: weeks of observation culminate in the perilous act of reverse-engineering. The cost is felt in the cavern’s sudden emptiness and his solitary burden. While pressure tightens coherently under an Accumulative lens, the absence of a second on-page character slightly limits interpersonal stakes, though this fits the story’s scope.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—freeing villagers from emotional burdens—is signaled early and deepens as regret threatens Elara’s mind. The tightening occurs when the spiral “multiplied… without resolution,” forcing her to risk alignment. Cost is felt in her misting breath and the satchel’s weight; agency lies in her precise wrist-twist. Coincidence doesn’t resolve—it’s pure skill under pressure. Only slight deduction: no secondary stake complicates the primary one.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (“counter fading by containing Silas’s essence”) tightens when kettle’s boil forces deadline-driven agency—protagonist chooses clinical detachment over liquefied sorrow. Deepening occurs via crystallized-time method: visualizing the swipe as “sculpture of cause/effect” reweights danger from tragedy to inevitability. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits emotional release to gain structural integrity, foreclosing romanticized grief. Escalation driven by her agency under Accumulative lens—pressure accumulates until whistle shatters reverie.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—remembering why the Carousel stopped—is signaled early and tightens when Jaren trades scavenged voices for truth. The escalation is protagonist-driven: his method (collecting echoes) enables the negotiation, and his choice to seek the ghost forces the revelation. Cost is legible: “ambitions lay smooth and featureless,” and post-revelation, he’s left with suffocating regret and a broken tool. Under the Accumulative lens, density of captured stories reweights the central question until the ghost transaction crystallizes the price.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—resurrecting hope through infrastructure—is signaled early and deepens when Elias improvises with the sextant, narrowing options under material constraint. Pressure escalates coherently: power grid failure → drainage workaround → missing crystal → sextant substitution. Cost is felt in the delicacy of the operation (“hissing through the walls like a waking beast”) and the fragility of success. Agency drives every escalation; coincidence complicates (carnival debris) but never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—unmasking historical fabrication—is signaled early and deepens when the hull plate proves internal explosion. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to dive, interpret the sundial, and ultimately re-submerge truth. The cost is conceptual but legible: “the magic of history creates only nausea,” and he bears solitary knowledge. Pressure tightens via the radio deadline, forcing a stance crystallization at dawn. Coincidence never resolves; all turns stem from his trained perception and prior study.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving forgotten divination—is signaled early and deepens as fog intensifies pressure, forcing Elias to complete his reading before visibility fails. The tightening occurs when he isolates the “seed” knot, a moment of agency that narrows reality to one captured potential. Cost is felt: the physical toll (“knees cracking”), the burden of solitary knowledge, and the irreversible act of mental harvesting. Though conflict is internalized, it escalates coherently under the Accumulative lens, with no reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—mapping grief to enable healing—is signaled early and deepens when the narrator projects presence, narrowing options to emotional confrontation. The meaningful tightening occurs when the thread snaps, forcing verbal articulation of absence. Agency lies in the narrator’s method and the Countess’s choice to receive the obituary. Cost is felt: she relinquishes the illusion of return, embracing solitude as fertile ground. Pressure remains coherent under an Accumulative lens, though escalation relies more on texture than causal narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can organic life return to a mechanized world?—is signaled early and tightens when the egg fractures. Valerius’s agency drives escalation: his assembly choices narrow survival parameters (“vibration exceeds three hertz…”). The deepening comes not from external opposition but internal realization: success is meaningless in this world. Cost is felt in the bird’s struggle and Valerius’s silent surrender—though the absence of active resistance slightly limits pressure intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—proving scars can sing—is signaled early and deepens through the grafting act. Pressure tightens when Elara chooses fragile, traditional methods over modern tools, foreclosing efficiency for authenticity. The escalation is driven by her agency under an Accumulative lens: each layer (sand, moss, coin) raises emotional stakes. Cost is unmistakable in her motionless vigil and the unspoken weight of lineage.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—freeing trapped memories—is signaled early and tightens when the box resists removal, forcing Elara to choose between shattering it (loss of history) or waiting (cost of time/stasis). Her agency drives escalation: auditory breadcrumbs lead her, realistic imagination guides visualization, sidereal patience enables the cosmic key. Cost is unmistakable: hours of immobility, risk of failure, and the acknowledgment that magic requires labor. Coincidence (star alignment) complicates but doesn’t resolve—she must still apply twisting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—breaking the generational cycle of destructive illumination—is signaled early and deepens when Xylos confronts the “rusted axle” of ancestral failure. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: his sonar-guided transit, gear alignment, and choice to press the fractal edge into the drive shaft narrow options irrevocably. The cost—emotional obsolescence—is unmistakable in the final loneliness, and the tightening (from mournful hum to resonant vibration) forecloses the path of perpetual lament. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: each petal-fall, echo, and memory layer intensifies the inevitability of repair and its personal toll.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering grief’s shape—is signaled early and deepens when Elias’s assumption of geometric order collapses into tangled reality. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he climbs, measures, and reinterprets. Cost is legible in his relinquished ideal (“not a singular structure to be built”) and crystallized in the final act of carving chaos. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves tension—only sustained observation and inherited ritual yield insight.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring temporal purity—is signaled early and tightens when the escapement stutters, forcing Silas into an impossible act: fix time without stopping it. His agency drives escalation; the “microscopic shift” costs him physical pain and eroded penance. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via sensory and moral density, not causal turns. The cost—burned wood, trembling hands—is unmistakable and scales perfectly to the story’s intimate scope.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering intention behind chaotic death—is signaled early and deepens when Silas confronts the unintelligible tapestry. The meaningful tightening occurs when he chooses border-decoding over central pulling, narrowing his method under self-imposed rules. Cost is legible: time invested, emotional labor of harmonizing with uncharted echoes, and the weight of unresolved hope now made visible. Though agency is clear, escalation lacks a second pressure point; one deepening suffices for length but limits 9+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—writing a future that avoids utopian fantasy and grim despair—is signaled early and tightens when Elian visualizes cascading effects (panic → workshops → new engine). The meaningful deepening occurs when he accepts “cruel kindness” as necessary, foreclosing easier paths. Cost is felt conceptually: a year of stagnation equals “slow death.” Escalation is protagonist-driven under Causal lens, though the tightening could be more tactile (e.g., a failed model projection).

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming narrative in a story-famine world—is signaled by line three and escalates when the patrol approaches and the page glows too brightly. Elian’s agency drives the tightening: he doesn’t flee but actively conceals, choosing preservation over escape. The cost is felt in his isolation, the risk of incineration, and the burden of memory. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation reads as intensifying luminosity and atmospheric pressure culminating in a tactical choice (cloaking) that forecloses visibility but secures transmission—exactly the kind of deepening this length requires.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—whether memory can be fixed—is signaled early and deepens when Silas chooses incomplete information over realism. Escalation is driven by Silas’s agency: grinding, drawing, then blowing away the portrait. The tightening occurs at stillness, foreclosing Elara’s path of clinging. Cost is felt in her betrayal-turned-peace and Silas’s burden of truth-weaving without reassurance.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—objective time vs. subjective dogma—is signaled early and tightens when Silas finds the cog, forcing the high-stakes act of integration where “a single grain of dust could disrupt the frequency.” Escalation is driven by his agency: weeks of excavation, then obsessive filing, culminating in winding the spring. Cost is felt in bodily degradation (numb, raw fingers) and existential isolation, crystallized in the final “war without saying a word.” The priests’ off-page presence exerts coherent pressure; coincidence (finding the cog) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the real victory is earned through meticulous labor.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving human capacity for harmony—is signaled early and tightens when Elian shifts from teaching song to extracting silence. The meaningful deepening occurs when noise subtraction yields involuntary hum, raising stakes by proving resonance still exists but is fragile. Agency is clear: Elian’s conducting choices narrow options to pure attention, and the cost—ephemeral success swallowed by returning silence—is felt in the scrape of a chair. Under Accumulative lens, this single intensification suffices, though the lack of tangible consequence beyond emotional weight slightly limits escalation impact.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving beauty against enforced uniformity—is signaled early and tightened through Elias’s pruning, which narrows the plant’s consciousness to exclude trauma. Agency is clear: his cuts directly alter the organism’s trajectory, with each snip carrying conceptual cost (lost memories, spilled sap). The celestial alignment acts as a live clock that intensifies urgency without resolving conflict coincidentally. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, culminating in a fruit that embodies the trade-off between truth and hope.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserving human-scale wonder vs. restoring mechanical order—is signaled early and tightens when Silas demands “patience” as toll. The meaningful deepening occurs when Kael solves the riddle but fails the intent test, narrowing options to irreversible truth. Cost is unmistakable: no fix exists, and the city must “breathe” in darkness. Escalation stems from Silas’s agency (withholding, revealing), not coincidence, though Kael’s panic slightly dilutes reciprocal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding what animates a house—is signaled early and deepens through tactile engagement with the orris root. Pressure escalates texturally: from observation to intervention to revelation. The meaningful tightening occurs when the house “listens,” narrowing Elias’s goal from inquiry to recognition. Cost is felt conceptually—he abandons active searching for passive witnessing—but could be more viscerally embodied in bodily or social consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—moral judgment of historical act—tightens decisively when Elara realizes “murder” was “mercy,” foreclosing her accusatory path. Escalation is protagonist-driven: her refusal to believe prompts Caelum’s vine-threading, which forces revelation she cannot unsee. Cost is felt in her loosened grip and stale-tasting air—judgment fracturing under new context. Final choice (to break ampoule) crystallizes stance with irreversible consequence: waking a nursery or preserving a vault.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—freedom via undoing regret—is signaled early and deepens when Elian risks annihilation to grasp “texture of a missed opportunity.” Pressure escalates causally: understanding the staircase’s mechanics → deploying flawed die → accepting potential dissolution. The cost is unmistakable: physical pain, existential risk, and the weight of irreversible action. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; agency drives the rupture through calculated defiance of physics.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—proving lost kindness endures—is signaled early and deepens when the painted ideogram elicits a real-time response. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: Elian chooses to risk emotional exposure through art, narrowing his world to this one act. Cost is legible in his trembling hands and long-denied sleep, now earned only after connection is confirmed. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the reply is framed as intentional syntax, preserving causality under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving language against environmental erasure—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the thaw destroys archival conditions, forcing Elian to abandon canisters for bread. Agency drives escalation: his choice to bake initials isn’t reactive but a repurposed family method, turning loss into edible legacy. Cost is unmistakable: physical texts are sacrificed, yet cultural continuity endures internally. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each sensory layer (rosewater, ice, dough) deepens the thematic weight without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—averting famine by reversing cosmic order—is signaled early and tightens when Elias locks the gyroscope into the lantern, narrowing all options to one irreversible act. Agency is absolute: the reversal stems solely from his tinkering, not luck. Cost is felt in the “shrieking” mechanism and “cold electric thrill,” though the villagers’ fate remains off-page. Pressure escalates cleanly under the Causal lens without coincidence or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—tricking fear into revealing weakness—is signaled early and escalates through Elias’s paradox-driven navigation. The meaningful deepening occurs at the mirror: vulnerability without terror inverts fear’s logic, forcing its collapse. Protagonist agency drives every escalation; coincidence never resolves. Cost is unmistakable: burned palm, shattered reflection, and the irreversible loss of post-resurrection illusion—all visible in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving the fragile ecosystem against annihilation—is signaled early via cloud interpretation and taste of ozone. Escalation is driven entirely by Elara’s agency: she doesn’t flee but composes acoustic barriers, narrowing options from passive endurance to active co-creation. Cost is unmistakable: physical exertion, risk of graft failure, and the ever-present threat of oceanic indifference. The storm’s transformation into music is earned through precise, escalating strikes—not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—discovering her brother’s fate—is signaled early and tightens when the whistle’s resonance triggers the turtle’s pause. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her choice to blow the whistle causes the fissure, which reveals the truth. Cost is unmistakable: her kin were harvested, and escape is impossible. The tightening forecloses hope, forcing Charged Poise at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. noble lie—is signaled early and tightens when the petal falls, ending the grace period. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her parallels force the Censor’s stance crystallization. Cost is unmistakable—the Censor’s white knuckles, the cracked foundation—and forecloses civil peace if unaddressed. Pressure coheres causally: each historical example narrows his justifications until surrender becomes inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving emotional truth amid physical collapse—is signaled early and deepens when Elias chooses to embed a personal dream rather than record data. The meaningful tightening occurs at the pillar: clearing the fissure is physically arduous, raising cost, and enables the secret burial. Agency is clear—his method is self-invented, risky, and irreversible—and the price is solitude, labor, and the burden of witnessing loss. Coincidence never resolves; the tide’s pressure only intensifies his resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—truth versus sanctioned falsehood—is signaled early and tightens when the blackout creates a narrow window for action. Elian’s agency drives escalation: he stole the stamp, calculated the blackout’s utility, and physically manipulates the decryption mechanism. Cost is unmistakable: suffocation looms if power doesn’t return, yet he proceeds. The deepening occurs when the true text is revealed—not just historical correction but moral condemnation (penal colony), raising the price of dissemination. Coincidence (turbine restarting) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Elian’s choice stands regardless.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—saving Elara’s dream before her soul evaporates—is signaled by line 3 and tightens relentlessly. The “hour after the shadow detaches” creates a live metaphysical clock that narrows options. Elias’s agency drives escalation: polishing, bleeding, folding—all deepen pressure and incur cost (his blood, his composure). The paradox of ascent-as-descent charges the final image with conceptual weight, making the crane’s flight both triumph and torment.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—accessing “unused potential”—is signaled early and deepens when the Geode reveals “arrested possibility.” Elias’s agency drives escalation: he aggressively pushes perturbation, forcing the universe to “account for the discrepancy.” The breaker-reset imposes a hard deadline, narrowing his window. Cost is unmistakable: the return of “mundane electricity” shatters his connection, leaving him with “cold, hard truth.” One meaningful tightening suffices, though a second tactical shift (e.g., modifying method mid-vision) could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—decoding belonging—is signaled early and deepens when static proves unintelligible without the matrix chip. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to pull the chip despite resistance, paying the cost of deactivating the Pilgrim. Under the Causal lens, this tightening (raw noise → structured text) narrows her path to one irreversible act. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the Pilgrim’s presence complicates but doesn’t solve—Elara must still act.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming stolen reality—is signaled early and tightens when the watch hand anchors his guilt. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: he chooses to sift driftwood despite its danger, resists false memories, and endures judgment. The meaningful deepening occurs when the heir’s “agony of displacement” replaces his self-serving myth of mercy. Cost is unmistakable: “he could not restore the boy he had turned into a ghost,” and the truth is heavier than any lie.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—successful prisoner exchange—tightens when the lever snaps, forcing Silas to improvise with his past. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency (jamming the pull, commanding “Turn it”) under Causal lens. Cost is visceral: magical backlash would kill the boy; Silas risks his symbolic anchor. The “timeframe between apology and forgiveness” sharpens moral calculus without abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reconciling heart and action—is signaled early and deepens when Elias abandons astronomical navigation for utility poles, a meaningful tightening that forecloses his former identity. Agency drives escalation: his choice to follow pylons stabilizes his “flickering faith.” Cost is unmistakable: surrendering grandeur for survival. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens—each pole reduces panic, narrowing his world to manageable increments.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—kindling empathy—is signaled early and deepens when the lake reveals stolen futures. The tightening occurs at the visualized alternate timelines, forcing Elias to confront the cost of his act. Agency is clear: he chooses to destroy the only proof of temporal mercy. However, the “time traveler” claim leans slightly on coincidence rather than fully dramatized causality, softening the escalation just enough to keep it below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reforging the bond—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Elian chooses metamorphosis over self-preservation. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: his conjuring forces the phoenix’s dive, which triggers irreversible biological rewriting. Cost is unmistakable: loss of human form, sensation, and temporality. Under an Accumulative lens, the deepening comes via sensory and physical intensification, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming lost paternal time—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the cards reveal not lost moments but discarded ones. The deepening (“time was not lost… but willingly discarded”) narrows options: Silas can either accept guilt or retreat into delusion. He chooses the latter, paying the cost of permanent emotional stasis. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence, only escalating self-confrontation. Final image makes the price undeniable: he’s alone, feigning ignorance beneath crushing beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—accessing the sanctuary through self-integration—is signaled early and deepens via the failed initial attempt with Kwan Yin’s tear. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elian realizes he must bind his shadow, narrowing his options to a single agonizing ritual. Cost is unmistakable: he endures nausea, rage, and the psychic burden of ancestral grief. His agency drives escalation; coincidence plays no role in resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether transformation requires total surrender—is signaled early and tightens when the bugs’ release alters the volcano’s behavior. Pressure escalates via the “vibrant hush” intensifying into physical vibration, forcing attention. Cost is visible: Silas loses his last possession, yet gains fullness. However, the mountain’s appeasement leans slightly on coincidence (bugs happen to soothe magma), mildly undercutting protagonist-driven escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—decoupling the city from authoritarian energy—is signaled early and deepens via Elara’s precise, high-risk manipulation of the sundial. The blackout tightens options; her calm inventiveness becomes tactical necessity. Cost is legible: she risks execution for a revolution only she can perceive. Agency drives escalation—no coincidence resolves the crisis; her micro-choices (sliding quill, rotating gnomon) narrow paths toward irreversible change.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—synthesizing stillness—is signaled early and tightens via the ritual’s escalating precision (Fibonacci spiral → star dust → eel capture). Protagonist agency drives escalation: Oren’s choices narrow options (committing rare polymer, risking backlash). Cost is unmistakable: electromagnetic pain and the knowledge of transience. Coincidence (aurora timing) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the trap’s success hinges on his design.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—making invisible suffering visible—is signaled early and deepens through the chemical ritual, which narrows options: failure means permanent erasure. The tightening occurs when Elias commits to the solvent pour under storm’s zenith, trading safety for revelation. Cost is unmistakable: each red line reopens personal wounds (his wife’s departure, his manuscript’s burning). Agency drives escalation—his steady hands enact resistance—and the regime’s censorship becomes tangible through the dissolving lacquer, not abstract declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—deciphering war’s question to find peace’s destination—tightens when Silas realizes Kael’s violence is language. Agency is clear: Silas chooses alignment over victory by stepping into the vector. Cost is felt in hydraulic strain, sweat-soaked velvet, and the prosthetic’s shriek. Escalation follows Causal logic: each clash narrows interpretive options until the needle-tin unlocks the exit.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—blooming resistance against expectation of fire—is signaled early and deepens via the seed-planting ritual. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each tactile act (clearing debris, packing earth) intensifies thematic weight. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: their defiance is fragile, hidden, yet irreversible (“It is beginning”). Agency lies in quiet creation, not confrontation—a credible, high-stakes renunciation of violence.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—defying entropic fate through performance—is signaled early and tightens when magnetic north fails, eliminating evacuation. Elias’s agency drives escalation: repurposing obsolete tech creates a portal, narrowing options to one fragile chance. Cost is unmistakable: finite time in the arbor, paid with his life. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from his “strategically creative” choices under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.9)
