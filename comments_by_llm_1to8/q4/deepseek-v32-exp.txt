  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake—survival and understanding the conspiracy—is signaled early, but escalation is thin. The ledger comparison to frost patterns offers one tightening beat, yet the rival artist's name appears as exposition rather than through a choice that forecloses an option. No visible cost accompanies the decision to "create something new"; revenge is rejected off-page without dramatizing the renunciation's price. The attempt on her life and the fire are recounted rather than pressuring present action, flattening the tension curve.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—translating silence into music—is signaled early and remains coherent. Elara's process unfolds as a series of emotional mappings (scarlet fear, azure sorrow, emerald hope) that accumulate toward the final tapestry. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens requires a density increase or pattern break that reweights cost, and here the mappings feel iterative rather than tightening. No tactical trade-off or foreclosed option makes the final peace feel earned; the conservatory "felt less like a prison and more like a stage" is declared, not demonstrated through a choice that alters her situation.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—give rest a permanent address—is signaled early and held through closure. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elijah realizes the lens needs amplification and discovers the moonlit chamber solution, narrowing options. However, the escalation lacks agency-driven cost: the "dream" solution and the chamber's convenient properties resolve the problem without trade-offs or visible sacrifice. The lens repair succeeds without setback, and the final "profound silence" declares victory rather than demonstrating what Elijah relinquished to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—sustaining the community through sanctions—is signaled early and remains coherent. The midnight food run provides one meaningful beat, and Elara's declaration offers a tightening from mere survival to intentional future-building. Yet no reversal tests commitment: donations arrive reliably, authorities never appear, and the declaration itself meets no resistance. The escalation is asserted ("sanctions felt less burdensome") rather than dramatized through a choice that forecloses an option or incurs a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake ("find where unused love is stored") is declared but never tested by opposition or scarcity. Elara's quest proceeds without meaningful tightening—each strand dissolves identically, and no prior choice narrows later options. The breathing method and the tear enable progression without risk, refusal, or visible price. The ending summarizes completion ("her pilgrimage complete") rather than dramatizing a final choice that forecloses a path. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation requires density increase or pattern break; here, repetition flattens pressure instead.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—escape retrocognitive trap—is signaled early but never tightens through a meaningful reversal or choice that narrows options. Elara adjusts the maze layout, but the act is summarized without visible tradeoff or cost. The bridge disintegrates not from her agency but from geometric contrivance ("hyperbolic contours she had engineered"). No on-page moment shows her foreclosing a live alternative; the resolution arrives through coincidental mechanics rather than protagonist decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—planting resilience—is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page cost tests Elara's commitment until the final planting, which proceeds without friction. The guard's lunge is deflected instantly via chain-trip with no escalation or tactical adjustment. The arrow-piano sequence unfolds as a puzzle solved on first attempt, offering no reversal or deepening. Pressure is declared ("shadows shifted," "air grew thick") but not dramatized through narrowing options or forced trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"to find the sound of trust breaking"—is declared but never tested by a reversal or tightening that narrows options. Elara's process is a sequence of unlabored steps: she wades, reaches, begins, calibrates, tests, succeeds. No live choice forces a trade-off; no attempt fails and compels adaptation. The "insight" that trust breaking "wasn't a single sound, but a cascade of fading notes" arrives via summary reflection, not through an on-page reversal or cost. Escalation under any lens is absent; pressure remains static from opening to close.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (steal the locket portrait to glimpse destiny) is clear early. The black-orchid trap signal offers one meaningful tightening that forces Elara to reinterpret and improvise an escape. However, the moonbeam jar conveniently holds just enough for both the portrait reveal and the escape-route illumination; no live option is visibly foreclosed. The final escape reads as competence rather than a trade-off with felt cost—she vanishes successfully, the portrait secure, with no tactical price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—crafting safe zones—is signaled early but never tested or deepened. No reversal or tightening occurs; lighting the furnace, shaping the sphere, and packing tools unfold without opposition or rising cost. The decision to abandon her former studio is recounted in backstory without on-page friction. The final departure is asserted as liberation but lacks a visible trade-off or price that would elevate pressure. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification or cadence shift is required; here the thaw simply continues in parallel.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake (outwit Silas) is signaled early but never tightens on the page. Deciphering the notes is told in summary ("He began to decipher...found patterns in the chaos") with no failed attempt or visible cost. The tower confrontation occurs off-stage; Leo "called out" and "declared," but no reversal or trade-off is dramatized. Coincidence does not resolve, but agency is also absent—Leo's final stance is asserted, not earned through a pressure-tested choice.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.5)
    One stake is signaled early: draw the map. Pressure never escalates; the Oracle proceeds unimpeded from opening meditation to completion. No on-page reversal, tightening choice, or visible cost alters tactics. The star dims "slightly" and later "shone brighter," but these ambient shifts do not narrow options or force trade-offs, leaving escalation absent under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—tracing consciousness origin—is signaled early but never faces on-page resistance or trade-off. J-7 performs the violin experiment without setback, error, or cost; the amalgamation "process" is asserted to "require" merging selves, yet no failed attempt or narrowed option appears. The final insight arrives through summary rather than a reversal driven by protagonist agency. No tightening forecloses a live option; no visible price is paid. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake (clearing Elara's name) is signaled early but escalation is flat—Elara examines tickets, Marco confesses without resistance, the group gathers and accepts. No meaningful tightening or trade-off: Marco's fear of blame evaporates upon meeting Elara's calm, and the final projection to staff encounters no friction. Agency is minimal; the resolution hinges on Marco's coincidental arrival and voluntary confession rather than a choice by Elara that forecloses a path with cost. The investigation structure promises pressure but delivers summary exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—proving gardens know their gardeners—is declared but never tested by genuine opposition. Visitors appear late, their skepticism dissolves instantly, and no on-page tightening forces Elara to choose between competing goods or accept a loss. The "stubborn vine" anecdote is recounted rather than dramatized, removing agency from the present frame. Escalation is replaced by reiteration: each paragraph restates the premise without narrowing options or raising cost.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—proving the sideways-time theory—is signaled early and remains coherent. Yet pressure never escalates: no failed attempt, no opposition from Dr. Aris beyond mild skepticism, no cost to pulling the lever. The "narrow window before their awakening" is mentioned but never tightens the action. The resolution arrives without reversal, trade-off, or visible price. Agency is present (Kael's choice to demonstrate) but the choice itself is uncontested and succeeds immediately, leaving escalation minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (unravel the ghost's code) is signaled early and pursued consistently. One meaningful tightening occurs when the water stains reveal the code, forcing Elara to act by disrupting the stillness. However, escalation is gentle—no live option is foreclosed, and the ghost's approval feels granted rather than earned through struggle. The resolution (ghost's release) lacks a felt price; Elara gains inspiration without sacrificing anything tangible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—confronting the buried truth about the Bloom—is signaled early and pursued throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when she compares the illustration to weather patterns and finds dismissed correlations, but this discovery is told in summary rather than dramatized as a decision under pressure. The resolution (accepting imperfection, updating predictions) is earned by prior reflection, yet the cost is abstract: "the weight of reality, not of guilt." No on-page choice narrows live options or trades competing goods; the ending reconfigures her stance through realization rather than action that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding "the weight of a swallowed truth"—is signaled early and drives the arc. Pressure accumulates through sensory intensification (cold air, clanking sounds) and the radio provides the key reversal when the caller's confession reframes the entire phenomenon. However, escalation is largely atmospheric rather than choice-driven; Kaelen doesn't face a trade-off or forfeit a path. The resolution unfolds through revelation rather than agency, and while the conceptual cost (burden of acknowledged guilt) is legible, Kaelen himself pays no visible price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=3.5)
    No dominant stake is signaled or tested. The keeper seeks "regenerative silence," reaches it without obstacle, and returns—no tightening, deepening, or reversal occurs. No choice narrows options; no cost is paid; no agency (decision, renunciation, endurance with foreclosed path) appears on the page. Pressure remains flat from beginning to end, violating the escalation requirement under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—rekindling Leo's wonder—is declared but never tested on the page; Leo simply "widens his eyes" and the story reports success without visible friction or cost. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the eclipse unfolds smoothly, the curl is shown, and Leo's transformation is summarized across years. Elara's flute playing and the curl are passive props that do not force a choice or payment. The final image grants symmetric satisfaction without forfeiting a live alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"to collect the stories walls have heard"—is signaled early but never tested by opposition, scarcity, or a competing good. No on-page reversal tightens options: Elian finds diaries, decodes the tapestry, builds a device, and succeeds sequentially without setback, miscalculation, or visible price. The "displaced axis" is solved off-stage by his invention's activation, with no dramatized cost (stamina, tool failure, moral calculus) that would demonstrate agency under pressure. Escalation reads as summary of discoveries rather than a narrowing tactical bind or deepening stake that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake ("escape her lonely routine") is declared but never tested on the page; Elara's plan unfolds without reversal, complication, or visible cost. Leo's arrival is scripted rather than earned through protagonist agency under pressure. The "delicate operation" and cache discovery are summarized in tell-mode, not dramatized as beats that foreclose options or force trade-offs. No on-page escalation tightens choices; the resolution is delivered as fait accompli rather than a constrained decision with legible price.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (stop possession before completion) is signaled early but never tightens into a trade-off or live dilemma. Elian's method succeeds linearly: loop question, mark floor, pose paradox, entity recoils—no reversal, adaptation, or visible price paid for the victory. The timeframe ("before the possession completes") generates urgency in concept but not in dramatized pressure; no ticking manifestation forces a rushed or costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake—completing the symphony before exhaustion—is signaled early but never tightens meaningfully. No reversal narrows options; Elara proceeds methodically without genuine obstacle, adaptation, or trade-off. The approaching dawn and her fatigue are mentioned repeatedly but do not force a difficult choice or visible price. The resolution ("task complete as fatigue set in") arrives on schedule without dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=3.5)
    Pressure is declared—"he had to act" before the raindrop hits—but the stakes never narrow options on the page. Each rune activation generates a new path without cost or risk; Kaelen glides forward, sees reflections, presses on, and reaches the center in a linear sequence. The "trap" self is dismissed in one sentence with no dramatized consequence. The ending tells us integration was "painful" but shows no forfeiture or altered tactic. No meaningful escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—escaping emotional numbness—is signaled in line 1 and pressure accumulates through the backward-song experiment, which narrows her isolation into communion. One meaningful deepening occurs when vibrations shift from "chaotic pulse" to "filament of hush," altering her sensory stance. Cost is legible in her tears and the mark left in clay. However, Kael's role remains passive observation without applying secondary pressure, and the transformation's smoothness (no false starts, no cost to the experiment itself) slightly undercuts escalation texture.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—exposing falsified quarantine reports—is signaled early and persists. One meaningful tightening occurs when the follower returns and is revealed as an ally, narrowing Elara's isolation. However, the escalation is driven by external arrivals (pigeon, woman) rather than protagonist agency. The collaboration and pigeon-network plan offer solutions without visible tradeoffs; Elara's solitude dissolves without on-page cost, and no live option is foreclosed at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—help the beings versus preserve his own history—is signaled clearly and escalates when their light dims. The impossible choice is tested on the page with visible cost (memory erasure) and Elian's agency drives the resolution. One meaningful tightening occurs: recognition of distress → decision → channeling. The price is legible and forecloses the path of solitary study. The escalation is straightforward; no reversal complicates the path further, and the beings' need is discovered rather than earned by protagonist action, capping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"find beauty in the unfinished"—is declared but never tested by a trade-off or competing pressure. Elara's nightly performances are repetitive loops without escalation; no reversal narrows options. The bonfire ritual unfolds without friction or cost; echoes unbind cooperatively, voices return, and the hush becomes "companion" through assertion rather than earned renunciation or Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—Elara's shift from counterfeit dealer to authentic curator—is signaled early but never tested by a reversal or tightening that narrows options. The "half truth" transaction mentioned in the opening never occurs on the page; no buyer arrives, no conflict materializes. The transformation happens through internal summary rather than a choice under pressure. The piece lacks escalation; Elara moves from professional detachment to empathy in a single declared arc without visible cost or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—uplift silent contributors—is signaled early but never tested by a forced trade-off or visible cost to Elara on the page. The envelope discovery prompts investigation and community organizing across weeks, yet no single tightening or reversal narrows options or forecloses a path with felt price. Escalation reads as accretive (more events, more people inspired) rather than a deepening that changes Elara's knowledge or stance under pressure. The resolution is asserted through summary of cascading social effects rather than earned by a protagonist choice with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (belonging) is signaled early but never truly tested. The search provides activity without escalation—days pass with no narrowing of options or rising cost. Elara faces no meaningful tradeoff between her isolation and integration; the community simply accepts her after she finds the tag. No visible price is paid, no option foreclosed, leaving the pressure flat throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—uncage the echoes—is signaled early, but escalation is absent. Elara dips an oar, borrows time, sculpts a key, and succeeds without complication, friction, or trade-off that narrows live options. The "giant's snore" timer never triggers consequences, and "borrowed time demanded repayment" arrives as a micro lurch with no dramatized price. The piece lacks a meaningful tightening or deepening; no reversal alters tactics or forecloses a path with on-page cost. Agency at closure is completion, not renunciation or endurance with felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: Elian seeks to decode emotion's logic to understand Lyra's absence. One meaningful deepening occurs when the glass eyes project Lyra's face, shifting his goal from solving loss to integrating it. However, this turn arrives through observation rather than agency—Elian adjusts the eyes, but the projection appears passively. No visible trade-off or price is paid in the moment; the acceptance is summarized ("his motivation shifted") rather than tested by a choice that forecloses a path with cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—delivering the tape to ease the city's fear—is signaled early but faces no on-page complication or escalation. Kaelen encounters no friction retrieving the fragment, threading the tape, or broadcasting it; the task unfolds as a smooth checklist. The outage and flickering lights are mentioned but never tighten his window or force a tactical choice. The ending tells us people's "worries eased" without dramatizing a reversal, cost, or trade-off that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—reconstructing her gardening philosophy to allow plants to survive storms—is signaled early and resolved at closure when she abandons rigid control for flexible observation. One meaningful tightening occurs when the linden leaf is released, narrowing her options to acceptance. Yet escalation is largely internal and repetitive; the storm itself does not force new tactical failures or choices after the opening. The final choice (not tying down the tree, gathering branches for natural support) carries emotional cost but lacks a legible external price or trade-off that alters her situation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—threshing meaning from loss—is signaled early and pursued through Kaelen's nocturnal painting and rain-trail quest. The discovery of the brooch and meeting Elara constitute a tightening, and the exchange forecloses solitary meaning-making with a visible trade (brooch for story, painting for connection). However, escalation is more atmospheric than agentic; Kaelen stumbles upon the convergence and Elara approaches him rather than his choices narrowing options. The cost is present (giving up the brooch's private mystery) but muted by the reflective, summarized final paragraphs that tell us he "slept a little better" rather than showing a tactical or emotional price paid in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake (magnify everyday magic) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara touches the pearl and channels her memory, creating tangible mist. Yet this feels more like demonstration than escalation—the unseen forces cooperate, Kaelen laughs, and villages bloom. No genuine resistance, trade-off, or path foreclosed. Cost is implied ("his jaded sight had overlooked") but never materializes as a visible price that alters tactics or the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—reveal buried truth to hearten the community—is signaled early but never tested. Elara encounters no opposition, error, or resource limit; her archival work proceeds unobstructed. The "staggered intervals" compress into summary ("Over the next few days"), and the final ceremony feels preordained rather than earned through agency or sacrifice. No reversal or tightening choice narrows options; coincidence (someone produces a working trumpet) resolves the ending without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—finding the fortress—is signaled early, but pressure remains static: each obstacle (mist, dead end, inner maze) is resolved immediately by the phantom punch without trade-off or narrowing of options. No on-page reversal forces Elara to choose between competing goods or pay a visible price; the "burst of revelations" and "healing" arrive as convenient gifts rather than earned through her decisions. The "echoes of past seekers" and their "failures" suggest potential cost but are not dramatized, and the ending declares transformation ("bad habits behind," "new start") without showing what was forfeited.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—creating reflective peace for villagers—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal tightens options; the transcription succeeds without obstacle, and the villagers simply ascend at dawn to receive the gift. Elara's skepticism dissolves through passive vision rather than a choice that narrows her path. Coincidence (the tile glowing at the right moment) enables rather than complicates, and no visible price is paid for the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (discovering what lies beyond goodbye) is signaled early and pursued consistently. However, escalation is thin: Kaelen positions the fragment, channels energy, and sees the rift without facing a meaningful trade-off or narrowing of options until the very end. The climactic "battle" to control energies is summarized in a single sentence rather than dramatized with visible cost. The final moment offers a conceptual shift (infinite regression) but it arrives as vision rather than choice, leaving agency unclear.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (father's asylum) is declared early but never tested by a live on-page reversal or tightening that narrows Leo's options. "Waiting actively" is summarized ("studying guard rotations and delivery schedules") rather than dramatized through failed attempts or escalating costs that force tactical shifts. The climactic "breach" is mental rather than physical, which could work under a situational lens, but the security chief's conversion occurs through the ink pot's magic rather than Leo's agency—Leo "offered him a seat, placing the ink pot between them" and the object does the work. No visible price is paid: Leo retains his honesty, his father is freed off-page, and the ink pot's purpose is "fulfilled" without Leo forfeiting a live alternative or enduring a felt loss in the moment. Escalation reads as a single move (the flower delivery ruse and the meeting) without prior failures or compounding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—collecting textures of time—is signaled early but never tested or tightened. Elian waits, records, and departs; no reversal, complication, or meaningful deepening narrows his options or raises cost. The fluorescent lamp's hum shifts from wavering to steady, but this change does not alter his tactics or force a trade-off. The story describes a ritual without pressure escalation; the ending returns to the same cycle without consequence or a decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—recovering erased memories—is signaled early and drives each beat. The poison label tightens focus and the overheard port-official conversation narrows options to one answer. However, escalation unfolds through passive accumulation (listening, layering) rather than protagonist agency that forecloses paths; he receives answers rather than trading cost for them. The ending delivers knowledge but no visible choice or renunciation with on-page consequence, keeping the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—decoding the universal riddle—is signaled early but remains abstract and never tested by on-page reversal or cost. Elara's journey is summarized in past tense; no present-scene pressure forces a choice that narrows options or deepens understanding. The "gloomy cheerfulness" and acceptance are declared rather than earned through escalation. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does agency; the protagonist observes and reflects without altering tactics or paying a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—preserve communal identity against privatization—signals early and remains coherent. Elara's graffiti reorganizes resistance through encoded messages, a meaningful tightening of scattered efforts. Yet the final beat deflates pressure: she steps back with "weary accomplishment," announces tomorrow's plan, and walks away without on-page cost or trade-off. The corporate ships' approach provides situational escalation, but Elara's agency at closure reads as延续 (continuation of method) rather than a choice that forecloses an option or imposes a visible price scaled to this length.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—photographing Cassini's Tear before obliteration—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation is purely temporal: the vials change color, dawn arrives, Elara presses the shutter. No reversal, complication, or trade-off narrows her options; the mining operation never materializes as on-page pressure. The ending delivers completion without visible cost—she seals the data, mission fulfilled. Under the Accumulative lens, the tightening is present but the cost remains asserted rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (repair the drone before the ship departs) is signaled early but never truly tested. Time pressure is declared ("Time was short") yet Elara works "with unwavering patience" and completes the repair without any misstep, resource constraint, or forced trade-off. The anchor-lift provides atmospheric urgency but does not alter her tactics or narrow her options. No reversal, deepening, or tightening occurs; the repair proceeds smoothly from diagnosis to success, and the test flight works on first attempt with no cost visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—to find where rivers begin—is signaled early and sustained. One tightening occurs when the condensation pattern matches the phrasebook, narrowing Elias's search to the fissure. Yet the escalation is intellectual rather than visceral; no on-page cost alters later tactics (he simply walks to the center and finds the source). The final worry ("What if this discovery altered nothing") is asserted anxiety, not a dramatized consequence. Under a causal lens, the pressure coheres but never forces a trade-off with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.1)
    Dominant stake: restore the ghost town's balance before another collapse. The stake is declared early but never tested by opposition or scarcity. Elian's actions proceed in a smooth accumulation—walk, strike fork, adjust rhythm—without a moment where a tactic fails, a resource runs short, or a choice forecloses an alternative path. No reversal or tightening occurs; the shimmer, whispers, and figures emerge as milestones of success rather than complications. Agency is present (Elian chooses his rhythm), but the resolution arrives without visible cost or trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (capture the hush before air runs out) is clear and coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when Kaelen must override panic to unsnarl the mechanism, and the oxygen alarm's final chirp narrows the escape window. However, the turn is tactical (slow down, succeed, leave) rather than a trade-off that forecloses another live option; coincidence does not resolve, but agency also does not visibly sacrifice an alternative path. Cost is stated ("his oxygen alarm chirped its final warning") but not felt as a near-miss or injury that alters his surfacing.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake (reach the beacon before bodies are found) is signaled early but never tightens meaningfully—shouts "grow closer" yet Kaelen ascends without impediment. The spectral wardens drift past "without hindrance," and the warden's inspection arrives after he has already succeeded. No on-page reversal or trade-off narrows options; the labyrinth "listens" and grants passage in response to narrative rather than choice under duress. Closure cost is conceptual (impossibilities wane) but not felt in forfeited options or tactical sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake: repay the debt across lifetimes (ghost bride) and understand their shared past (Elian). One tightening occurs when the bead triggers memory and the ghost bride begins to fade, but this reversal is triggered by a convenience artifact (the bead's alchemical charge) rather than protagonist agency. The ghost bride's visits grow more frequent ("as if time was running out"), suggesting escalation, but no on-page choice narrows options—she offers the bead, he accepts, memories arrive, she vanishes. The cost (her dissolution) is declared rather than felt through a trade-off or forfeited path.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake ("carve a path from ruin to reverence") is signaled early, but pressure does not escalate through reversals or tightening choices. Elara's sewing proceeds without opposition, setback, or tactical shift; the "tangled knot" at the central chamber is described but not dramatized as an obstacle that forces her to choose between competing goods or pay a visible cost. The "hauntingly optimistic" hope "swells, pushing back the shadows," yet no on-page moment shows her optimism threatened or tested. The restoration is completed linearly, with no forfeited path or felt price that would charge the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (restore lost faith) is signaled early but never tested by a credible obstacle or competing want. Elara's "purposeful wandering" leads directly to the orchard; her excavation proceeds without setbacks; the sundial conveniently reveals the hidden scrolls. No reversal, no tightening choice that forecloses a live option. The resolution is granted by discovery rather than earned by protagonist agency under pressure. Cost is asserted ("work was a meditation," "hands trembling") but not demonstrated through a visible sacrifice or trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—ensuring safe passage of the letter—is signaled early but never tested. No obstacle, near-miss, or complication appears; Elara completes each step without friction. The told reference to Orion's potential compromise does not generate an on-page choice or visible price. The resolution is a planned action (dropping the letter) with no agency, renunciation, or cost dramatized. Pressure remains flat across the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—uncovering and warning against the coup conspiracy—is signaled early and tightens when the Serpent's Coil tangles, then escalates when the captain's complicity is revealed. Elara's agency drives the escalation: her embroidery method uncovers the plot structure, and her choice to extinguish the candle is a renunciation of safety that forecloses her hidden observer path. The cost is legible on the page: darkness replaces light, "louder than any scream," marking a shift from covert to overt action. One meaningful reversal (discovery by the captain) narrows options and forces the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—whether to forgive Kaelen's silence—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the condensation messages shift from explaining his fear to declaring "The decision is not his to make now, but yours," reweighting the pressure from seeking his apology to claiming her own agency. However, the escalation is driven more by externalized devices (shard, spirits, messages) than by Elara's active choices; she evokes and wades deeper, but these actions do not visibly narrow options or force a trade-off until the ending declaration. The cost—releasing the unsent letters and choosing forgiveness—is named but not dramatized as a forfeiture of a live alternative with on-page consequence; we're told the letters' "power dissolved" rather than shown what she loses or gains tactically by that release.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—grafting new meaning onto trauma—is signaled early but remains abstract. The decryption of Kaito's cast notes provides a structured sequence (circle, numbers, "river," two figures), yet each symbol is interpreted without visible resistance, failed attempts, or trade-offs. Pressure does not escalate; the anesthetic frame removes urgency and the "unknotting" proceeds linearly in summary. The final symbol's revelation offers thematic weight but lacks a live cost or tightening that forecloses an option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: rediscover lost joy. Elara's decision to "display the truth" constitutes one meaningful tightening, and the light-painting action deepens pressure through the knowledge network. Weakness: no live opposition, reversal, or credible loss shapes the escalation. The fog "would return" but "felt less like a prison"—consequence is acknowledged yet softened rather than paid with visible cost. Agency is present but the resolution avoids foreclosing a path or imposing a trade-off scaled to the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara's shift from certainty to curiosity—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal or tightening choice narrows options; the garden's revelations arrive as gifts rather than earned through agency. Elara never faces a trade-off, and the "exchange" of certainty occurs off-page in summary. The piece accumulates atmospheric detail without escalation: each "awakening" is described as "more profound" without demonstrating increased cost or narrowed tactics. Closure arrives through passive witnessing ("her work was done") with no legible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake (protecting the secret language club) is signaled early but pressure remains static. The enforcers' arrival is the only escalation, and it resolves via coincidence (the sound-wave dissonance) rather than protagonist agency. No meaningful tightening occurs; Elara never faces a trade-off or visible cost. The "warping effect" complicates scenery but doesn't narrow her options or force a choice between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake ("to photosynthesize pain into beauty") is declared but never tested by a concrete on-page dilemma or rising cost. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; the poet writes, voices return, he feels warmth—a sequence without escalation or agency. The resolution (lullabies inspire earthly armistices) is told rather than earned, and no visible price is paid; the protagonist's final rest is reward without struggle. The piece reads as a premise held in stasis rather than conflict that narrows options under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—preserve the sound of forgotten names—is signaled early and the crack introduces urgency. The search for the tablet provides a single tightening, but the resolution is frictionless: she finds "Aria's Farewell," holds it aloft, and the crack seals itself. No trade-off, loss, or visible price alters her tactics or forecloses a path. The ending returns to her vigil with summary language rather than a moment of transformed pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake (restore trust before dawn) is signaled early, but no meaningful opposition tests it. Elara's carefully reckless plan proceeds without genuine friction; each promise succeeds on cue with no failed attempt or trade-off. The "silence" and "misunderstanding" remain abstract—no scene dramatizes the conflict that caused the rift. Kaelen's entrance resolves everything without Elara making a difficult choice or paying a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—harmonizing conflicting values—is signaled early, and the discovery of the envelope message provides one meaningful deepening. Yet escalation remains declarative: "more violently this time, as if resisting her touch" tells resistance rather than showing a tactical pivot or cost. No on-page reversal forces Elara to choose between competing goods or pay a visible price; the floodgates recalibrate and the tremor subsides without friction. Agency is present but soft; the resolution arrives without a forfeited path or dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving lost songs—is declared but never tested on the page; no live choice forces Elara to trade off preservation against another cost. Leo's discovery of the letter is coincidence, not protagonist agency. The piece summarizes weeks of friendship and eventual collaboration without a single on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options. The ending recounts mission success rather than showing a decision with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake (understanding sacred thresholds) is philosophical rather than urgent, with no on-page antagonist or ticking clock to force trade-offs. Elara's correlation of wood grain and weather codes proceeds without setback, and no reversal narrows her options. The resolution is asserted ("she was no longer lost") without demonstrating a path foreclosed or a visible price paid. Coincidence does not complicate; instead, the luminous threshold appears conveniently when insight is reached, deflating any sense of earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding belonging through celestial mapping—is signaled early but never faces a concrete on-page test or tightening. No reversal occurs; Elara adjusts equipment, explores, discovers logs, and witnesses bioluminescence in a smooth accumulation without narrowed options or trade-offs. The burnt feather mystery resolves via research log rather than protagonist agency. Coincidence (bioluminescent swarm appearing at 2 AM) provides the climactic moment rather than Elara's decision, and no visible price is paid.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—discovering why paths disappear—is signaled early but never escalates or tightens. Kaelen faces no resistance, error, or competing pressure; each conjecture smoothly yields the next insight without cost. The "missing pieces" coalesce conveniently in a single moment of understanding, not earned through prior friction. No on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off; the protagonist observes rather than acts under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—to jolt monotony into wonder—is signaled early and remains consistent. Yet the story presents no escalation or meaningful tightening: Elara's plan unfolds exactly as intended (petals swirl on cue, balloon rises, onlookers gasp), and she feels "a surge of fulfillment" without encountering resistance, adaptation, or cost. The lack of a live complication or reversal means pressure never builds. The ending returns to the starting stance with no path foreclosed or option narrowed, keeping this well below the 7.0 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—penning the verse—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal, obstacle, or cost appears; Elara's dance proceeds from intention to completion without a single choice that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The nostalgia ban is mentioned as context but exerts no on-page pressure. The collapse at the end is framed as triumph rather than sacrifice, and no live loss (time, safety, relationship) alters her tactics. One continuous success arc without escalation or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—finding clarity and meaning before the bay shifts—is signaled early. The ritual at the pond offers a tightening moment as Elara interprets the ripples, but the escalation is reflective rather than driven by protagonist agency under pressure. The sun's arrival feels coincidental (external timing) rather than a consequence of her choice. No visible trade-off or forfeited path appears; the stone-casting and the insight arrive without a dramatized cost or tactical shift. Pressure accumulates texturally through imagery but does not narrow options or force a renunciation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—translating pain into universal language—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or narrowed by a tightening choice. No reversal, no escalation under pressure; the walk is a continuous, unimpeded meditation. Elara's agency is limited to reflection and continued walking; no renunciation, endurance under visible cost, or decision that forecloses a path. Coincidence does not complicate; nothing complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—revitalizing hope across parallel timelines—is signaled early and remains consistent. However, escalation is weak: Elara releases trial balloons, reads the gauge, adjusts patterns, and sees immediate positive feedback without setback or cost. Each balloon reports despair or silence; each adjustment softens the timeline's hue or returns music; the final pearl steadies the needle in the green. No live option is foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized. The process is meticulous but lacks a moment where success is uncertain or where Elara must sacrifice an alternative path. The resolution is declared ("a critical mass was approaching") rather than earned through a decisive narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—mapping echoes to understand what walls dream—is signaled early but never tested by a meaningful reversal or cost. Elara's progression is a steady reveal (scuffing the fireplace, extracting diaries, holding the negative, reading fragments) without a tightening that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The ending declares deepened motivation ("no longer just a cartographer, but a keeper") but the shift is asserted rather than earned by an on-page choice that forecloses an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—persuading mirrors to show possibilities—is signaled early but never tightens or deepens through opposition. No reversal, visible price, or trade-off occurs; Lyra hums, the mirrors "tremble slightly," and "one mirror after another" complies without friction. The first bell tolls and she leaves; no option is foreclosed, no cost paid. Escalation is absent under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—forging peace through ritual sacrifice—is signaled early but never faces on-page resistance. No reversal occurs; the ritual proceeds as planned, representatives arrive on cue, and the sacrifice succeeds without complication. The "price" is pre-accepted and narrated rather than tested: "She had accepted this, believing..." The clans' suspicion dissolves instantly under the ritual's light with no intermediate failure or micro-turn that narrows Elara's options.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—preserve the echo—is clear, but no on-page obstacle or reversal tests it; Elias kneels, whispers, and the echo flows without resistance or cost. The drought backstory and his role in ecological destruction are told rather than pressuring a present choice (e.g., a temptation to reverse the drought vs. complete the ritual). The final "unburdened" state is asserted, not earned by a trade-off that forecloses a live option. One micro-turn exists (thunder draws nearer as the ritual completes), but it decorates rather than escalates.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (defy conformity, unlock sanctuary) is signaled early, but no meaningful tightening occurs: Elara encounters no resistance, makes no trade-off, and the final thread "gives way" without cost. The "alarming serenity" is declared rather than felt as pressure, and the "lullaby of conformity" fades passively rather than through agency. Agency is present (she pulls the thread) but the action does not foreclose a live option or reveal a price—transformation is awarded, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—how to respond to Marco's threat—is signaled early but never escalates; Elara resolves it internally without on-page cost or reversal. The "reversal" is announced as a shift from despair-to-hope but not dramatized in a beat where options narrow. No tightening occurs; she moves from upset to serene in unbroken summary. Agency is renunciation of defiance, but the choice forecloses no live option because Marco's threat is never re-engaged on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—honoring the last monarch's migration—is signaled early but remains external to Elian's agency. He waits, witnesses, and releases; coincidence (the butterfly's arrival) completes the event. No on-page reversal narrows his options or forces a trade-off; the structure is built without friction, and the butterfly's brush is atmospheric rather than a decision point. Pressure does not escalate under the Accumulative lens; it accumulates description and holds still.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—is signaled early and remains coherent. Yet no meaningful tightening occurs: Elara begins with the rope, card, and vision already in hand, and each step succeeds without resistance or escalation. The aurora brightens and whispers emerge in smooth sequence with no reversal, complication, or choice that narrows options. Closure delivers success without a visible price or trade-off, failing the escalation requirement for accumulative designs.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—understanding path-choosing—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the storm's approach and the directive's decay, providing external and internal tightening. However, escalation relies heavily on atmospheric build rather than protagonist agency narrowing options: Foresight arranges dream-stones and presses the seal, but these actions feel scripted by foresight rather than forced by genuine trade-offs. The "profound calm" and smooth transcendence undercut the sense of cost. No on-page reversal tests her commitment; coincidence (the storm breaking precisely when needed) acts as catalyst without her decision altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—sealing a covenant to harmonize cosmic silence with earthly transition—is signaled early but never tested by meaningful opposition or cost. Aris proceeds methodically from tile placement to voice encounter to covenant completion without a single tightening that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The voice's question "Why do you seek the covenant?" is answered, not wrestled with; the resolution is granted rather than earned through agency or renunciation, leaving escalation absent and pressure diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—teaching Kael to release resentment—is signaled but never tested by genuine resistance or reversal. Kael "resisted" briefly, then capitulates after one cylinder vibration and a childhood memory. No meaningful tightening or trade-off occurs; the sanctuary's reality shifts supply spectacle without forcing harder choices. Agency collapses into passive reception of Elara's method, and no visible cost forecloses an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—capture the runaway dream—is signaled early but never faces meaningful opposition or tightening. The synchronized breathing succeeds without friction, and "the dream became more substantial" progresses in smooth declarative steps. No on-page reversal narrows options, and the climax ("felt it snap into place") offers no trade-off or visible price. The ending retreats to safety ("back in the ruined orchard") rather than foregrounding cost.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—repairing the rift with Lyra—is signaled early but never tightens under protagonist agency. Elara's project (crafting quartz eyes, reading the journal) is recounted in summary; no on-page beat shows her wrestling with a trade-off or narrowing her options. The reversal (Lyra's return) is delivered by coincidence after an ellipsis, not by Elara's decision. The journal's "accidental wisdom" bypasses earned escalation; the insight softens her heart in narration, and the reunion follows without visible price or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—Elara's pursuit of forbidden knowledge—is signaled early and sustained. The orchard's vision sequence (civilization that transcended flesh, memory-unmaking secret) deepens the stakes conceptually, but no on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off with felt cost. The final act (placing the cameo back) reads as acceptance rather than a decision that forecloses a live path; the piece accumulates texture but lacks a tightening that alters tactics or imposes a legible price.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake (retrieve the volume to stabilize Kael's timeline) is signaled early and drives the quest. Pressure tightens once: the realization that Kael's own avoidance caused the paradox shifts tactics from frantic search to meditative journey. However, the escalation is summary-driven ("they renegotiated their approach") rather than dramatized through on-page choice under duress, and the final resolution (Kael reads, timeline heals) unfolds without visible cost or trade-off—luck and the diary's decode do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—finding the garden of forgotten names—is signaled early but never faces on-page resistance or a choice that narrows options. Elara walks, whispers, sits, and stands without opposition; the garden simply appears when she approaches the bow. No reversal, no tightening, no trade-off; pressure is declared ("memories alter") but not dramatized. Under any lens, escalation is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: stabilize the void/door. Pressure escalates when Elara untwists the rope and merges the wax seal's intent with the braids, narrowing her path to a single ritual method. The tightening is causal and on-page. However, the protagonist's agency feels curiously assured—she "knew she needed to act" and executes the method without visible struggle, error, or intermediate cost. The resolution lands smoothly but lacks friction; no live option is foreclosed on the page, only the abstract "fable of absence."

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake (restore harmonic balance) is signaled early and pressure accumulates as Elara works through the conjuring. The energy beings' shift from chaotic to cooperative provides one meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens. However, the escalation is smooth and unopposed—no reversal tests her method or forces a trade-off. Cost at closure is asserted ("exhausted") but not dramatized through a visible forfeiture, injury, or foreclosed option. Agency is decision-driven (leaving the stone in the niche) yet the choice feels soft, more denouement than culmination with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—rekindling the beacon to guide scattered settlements—is signaled early and remains coherent. The story provides one meaningful tightening: Elara must track star paths and align fragments under a specific celestial window. However, no reversal tests her commitment; the final alignment succeeds on first attempt with Vega's convenient zenith. The cost is told ("hope trembled but held") rather than shown through a visible trade-off or forfeited option. Agency is present but uncontested, and the coincidence of Vega's arrival resolves rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding how collective memory condenses in the new solid state—is signaled early but never tested by opposition. The archivist's movement from monument to monument accumulates information without a meaningful tightening or trade-off. No reversal narrows options; the fog's shimmer at the end responds to his realization rather than forcing a choice. The cost of his epiphany is asserted ("his preemptive nostalgia was a gift") but not demonstrated through forfeited alternatives or embodied loss.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—"to defy the gravity of hopelessness"—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or internal conflict. Elian executes a pre-laid plan (secreted gunpowder trails) without reversal, adaptation, or visible price. No tightening narrows options; the fortress offers no resistance, and the "hopelessness" lifts off-page for others rather than through a choice that forecloses a path for Elian himself.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will leave the coast—is signaled early, but pressure remains largely internal and contemplative. The one tightening occurs when Kael finally speaks and Elara offers the cicada metaphor, yet this feels more like clarification than escalation; no prior option is visibly foreclosed. The resolution ("not let go, but transform") arrives through reflection rather than a choice that costs something tangible on the page. Under an Accumulative lens, the pattern deepens but does not narrow options with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (reaching the gilded hush) is signaled early and pursued coherently. The inversion provides external time pressure, but the ascent proceeds without meaningful reversal—the trellis materializes as expected, the vial captures the silence without complication, and the descent is summarized. One tightening occurs (the inversion countdown), but no on-page choice forecloses a live option or forces a trade-off. The "limiting exposure" method is mentioned but not tested; Elara secures her goal without visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—teaching silence to comfort—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal or tightening occurs: Elara seeks silence, finds silence, and the vial confirms silence without any obstacle or trade-off. The train whistle's echo is mentioned but does not alter her approach. No cost is visible; the piece moves linearly from intention to confirmation without agency-driven escalation or a choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (find the stairway before sunrise) is clear, but pressure remains steady rather than escalating. Each obstacle—waterfall veil, paint layers, locked passage, final puzzle—resolves immediately upon discovery with no trade-off or failed attempt. The sunrise deadline is mentioned three times but never tightens tactics on the page; "time was slipping away" and "dawn approaching" are asserted without visible cost to hesitation or speed. Agency is present (she peels paint, presses the ruby, decodes symbols) but no choice forecloses an alternative path or forces a loss. The throne-claiming is achieved without complication, and the "weight of responsibility" is declared rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—maintaining solitude versus allowing connection—is signaled but never tested with on-page cost. The keeper's "allowing" is passive observation; no tightening forecloses an option. The visitor's arrival is described as "encroachment" but the keeper immediately "understood" and "demonstrated," bypassing conflict. Coincidence (resonance of scars) enables the resolution without protagonist agency driving a turn.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—transforming trauma into value—is signaled early but never tested by a live dilemma. Leo faces no trade-off or renunciation; he simply complies with the experiment and receives the diamond. The dimensional messages provide instructions rather than complications, removing agency. No meaningful escalation occurs between volunteering and the climax; pressure is asserted ("intensified") but doesn't narrow options or force a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"to uncover a hidden truth"—is declared but never tested on the page; the music simply "amplified his thoughts, guiding him toward clarity" without resistance or cost. No meaningful tightening occurs: the standing waves deliver the answer without a trade-off or foreclosed path. The protagonist's agency is passive (the gramophone does the work), and the final decision to "seek redemption, exposing the manipulators" is announced rather than dramatized. Coincidence (the record's content) resolves the problem it did not help create.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—capturing possibility—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. Alaric's single attempt succeeds without reversal, friction, or a trade-off; no on-page tightening narrows his options or forces a choice between competing goods. The "snap" he feels is internal and asserted, not earned by prior dramatized pressure. The program and orchard cooperate passively; coincidence (finding the program, the orchard's instant bloom) enables resolution rather than complicating it. No persistent constraint shapes his tactics, and the final success carries no visible price—he gains the orb and a new purpose with no path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—healing Elara's heartbreak through archival discovery—is signaled early, but escalation operates via accumulation (intake forms → letters → soldier's identity → Jonah's outcome) rather than narrowing options or forcing a trade-off. No reversal tightens pressure; each research step succeeds without complication, and the climactic cross-reference to the veteran's archive encounters no obstacle. The ending delivers thematic satisfaction ("a balm on her own heartbreak") but Elara's agency is observational—she documents rather than deciding between competing goods or paying a visible price to magnify this kindness.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"to hold the line against the tyranny of indifference"—is declared but never tested by a live on-page obstacle or competing pressure. Plans "unravel" off-stage; the puddle-map solves the problem it did not help create, and the phone booth grants access without trade-off. No reversal or tightening choice narrows options; Kael walks a fetch-quest path from archive to lagoon to city with no credible loss, omission, or moral calculus. Coincidence (puddle reflections, ghostly historians) complicates and resolves without protagonist agency shaping the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—hushing the prophecy to prevent "storms of dissonance"—is signaled early and remains coherent throughout. Elias's method (negative space saxophone) is specific and his action unfolds as a sustained ritual, but there is no on-page reversal, tightening, or moment where his tactics must change because a live option is foreclosed. The atrium "resists" and the whisper "falters," but these are passive reactions rather than turns driven by protagonist agency. The cost is future and conceptual ("the prophecy would return") rather than a visible price paid in the scene. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift would suffice, but the ritual proceeds without friction or transformation, capping the score in the mid-5s.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—decoding the prophecy—is declared but never tested by a meaningful tightening or trade-off: Elara's work proceeds without obstacle, the moonstone speck appears as a gift, and the arbor responds positively to every action. No reversal or narrowing of options occurs; the piece moves in one smooth upward arc from orderly sorter to fulfilled guardian without a moment where her choice forecloses a live alternative with on-page cost. The communal gathering and flourishing arbor are outcomes recounted in summary, not pressure points that force her to weigh competing goods or accept loss.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—Elara seeking the compass to embrace uncertainty—is signaled early but remains abstract. Pressure does not meaningfully escalate; each location yields its clue without resistance or cost (key found easily, box unlocked smoothly, compass points the way). The grotto revelation is contemplative summary rather than a choice that narrows options. No visible trade-off or foreclosed path appears on the page at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: to understand "the weight of names" and redeem the failed search through alchemical inquiry. Pressure accumulates as Elara pushes the coin's limits, channeling energy until the crack appears—a meaningful tightening that narrows her options and forces the kintsugi repair. The reversal ("Instead of despair, Elara felt a surge of luminous regret") deepens her understanding without a second reversal. Agency is clear (she chooses to push, to repair), and the kintsugi process forecloses the original search while opening a new meaning. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual; no live tactical option is visibly sacrificed beyond the coin's integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake (heal Lyra's soul through laughter) is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. The sequence—pluck harp, Lyra appears, request joy, Lyra laughs—unfolds without reversal, escalation, or a choice that forecloses an alternate path. Elara's "modest fearlessness" is told but not dramatized under pressure; no moment forces her to trade one value for another or endure a visible loss. The soul dissipates as an automatic outcome rather than a protagonist-driven turn, undercutting agency. No causal tightening narrows options under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is legible: Kaelen seeks to solve "the mathematics of mercy" as psychological survival. Pressure accumulates through repeated bracing and trauma triggers, creating a textural tightening. However, escalation lacks a turn that narrows options; the strap discovery and insight arrive without a prior choice or sacrifice that raises cost. The ending reconfigures understanding but does not dramatize agency—no decision, renunciation, or endurance visibly forecloses a path. Cost is conceptual, not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories—is signaled early and remains consistent. The discovery of the painting and the vision sequence provide a single meaningful tightening when Elara spots the fracture pattern. However, escalation is minimal: no reversal tests her commitment, no cost narrows her options, and the resolution (intent to document Anya's story) is uncomplicated by competing pressures. Anya's courage is presented as a fait accompli in the vision; Elara's role as witness imposes no trade-off or sacrifice. The final paragraph's claim of "urgency" and "bright, sharp" courage is told rather than dramatized through a decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—to discover what ceilings hide—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Leo's investigation escalates from floor dust to wall compartment to ceiling rafters, and the appearance of multiple ghosts deepens the pressure. However, the escalation is exploratory rather than agonistic: no live dilemma forces Leo to trade one good for another, and the resolution (promising to return the barrel) costs him nothing visible on the page. The tightening is present but the price legibility needed for higher bands is missing.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—compressing eternity into a moment—is signaled early. The bottled whisper's uncorking triggers the rupture, a meaningful tightening. Yet Elara's agency in the climax is passive: she "felt the weight of ages" and "realized" consequences rather than making a forced choice between competing goods. The cost (library destabilization) arrives as aftermath summary rather than a visible trade-off during the peak beat. Escalation under the Accumulative lens requires reweighting the dominant stake with felt cost; here the cost is declared ("at the cost of the library's former stability") but not dramatized through a specific forfeiture or altered tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—proving the civilization was poetic, not martial—is signaled early and escalates through Kael's dismissal to the climactic presentation. The storm experiment provides one meaningful tightening that narrows Elara's options (risk public failure or remain silent). Yet the resolution hinges on other scholars being "captivated," an off-stage validation that dilutes agency; Elara's internal transformation is asserted ("she understood now") rather than tested through a visible tradeoff or renunciation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=4.6)
    One dominant stake (reclaim stolen light) is signaled early. The townsman's lie creates a reversal (gears tarnish, song falters), but Elian's response is immediate and friction-free: he "spoke gently," the man confessed, and the problem dissolves. No visible trade-off or foreclosed option—Elian completes his task without sacrificing time, stamina, or social cost. The ending declares triumph but does not dramatize a price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is legible: find the place "where explanations failed." Pressure accumulates through the descent, psychometry revelations, and the lagoon's "impossible stillness." The tightening occurs when Elara's understanding shifts from collecting scent to experiencing presence, and she leaves the compass—a renunciation with visible cost (no vials filled, quest redefined). However, the escalation is largely internal and reflective; no external obstacle or competing want tests her resolve, so the cost feels more conceptual than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—reimagine solitary work as dialogue with history—is clear, but escalation is minimal. Elara discovers the slide, watches projections, and carves without friction. No reversal or tightening: the wood cooperates ("she would not fight its twists"), the projections "guide her hands," and the form "emerges" intuitively. The storm abates on cue as she finishes. The GPS failure (inciting constraint) is resolved externally rather than by her choices, and she "ignores" the restored GPS without on-page cost—no moment where ignoring it forecloses a safe exit or tested commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake (understanding nocturnal blooming) is signaled early but never faces meaningful opposition or cost. Elara's journey is one of accumulation—she collects clues (postcards, cathedral visit, grandmother's notes) without setbacks, failed attempts, or trade-offs. The cathedral revelation arrives as convenient confirmation rather than a turn that narrows options. No reversal or tightening occurs; each step simply adds to her understanding without risk or loss. The children's arrival at the end provides validation rather than complication, and Elara's "quiet completeness" lacks the felt price required for high-band entry under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—decrypting the diary to reveal hidden civil-rights history—is clear, but escalation is minimal. Elara faces no genuine opposition; the cipher solves itself as she arranges objects, and the vision releases her on schedule. The "controversy it might cause" is mentioned but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening narrows her options; the path from discovery to resolution is frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=3.1)
    The dominant stake—reimagining civilization—is signaled early but never tested in scene. No on-page reversal, tightening choice, or escalation narrows Elian's options; he conceives a plan, gathers materials, teaches settlers, and succeeds without visible friction or cost. The stated rejection of wishes and false comfort remains a label rather than a trade-off dramatized under pressure. The resolution is asserted in summary ("the cove thrived") rather than earned through protagonist agency with legible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—archiving emotional patterns—is signaled early but never tested by a counterpressure. The accidental prophecy arrives passively (he hears it on playback) and Elian's response is to continue his work "now with a new purpose," which reads as expansion rather than a tightening or trade-off. No live option is foreclosed, no price paid on the page; the "velvet disquiet" and "responsibility to warn others" remain abstract declarations without tactical consequence in the ending beats.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (reopen the gateway) is signaled early and pursued throughout. One tightening occurs: the vortex is unstable and "fading fast," forcing Elara to "focus all her will" and draw on heirloom seeds to stabilize it. However, this pressure reads as cosmetic urgency ("incomplete and fading") rather than a choice that forecloses a path. No on-page cost is legible—Elara succeeds without sacrifice, error, or visible trade-off. The resolution is agency-driven (her ritual actions) but lacks the visible price or narrowed options required to enter the 8+ band under Accumulative/Textural.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.6)
    One dominant stake (warn the valley safely) is signaled early. The tightening occurs when pressure drops and Elara chooses the bell over the siren, which narrows options. However, the cost reads as logistical (villagers prepare calmly) rather than visceral or relational; there's no moment where the choice risks failure or forces a trade-off between competing goods. The storm "broke, but the valley was prepared" deflates rather than escalates, and we never see a credible loss or adaptation that alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=3.1)
    No dominant stake is signaled or tested. Kael's yearning for "deeper understanding" never encounters opposition, cost, or a narrowing choice. The meteor shower is an occasion for reflection, not escalation. No reversal, tightening, or trade-off appears; Kael begins peaceful and ends peaceful with no agency exerted. The piece is a static tableau where coincidence (the meteor shower) delivers an epiphany without protagonist effort or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—preserve unspoken words—is signaled early but never tested by a competing pressure or tactical fork. No on-page reversal: the ghosts' appearance astonishes, but the recluse's response is serene observation followed by a single, unopposed act (opening the box). The covenant "untangles" without protagonist agency driving the shift; the ghosts dissolve as a result of the box's inherent property, not a choice that narrows options or forecloses a path. Cost is asserted in summary ("weight of unspoken words," "gratitude and release") rather than shown as a forfeited alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding time's texture—is declared early but never tested by a meaningful tightening or cost. Leo's arrival is coincidental, not driven by Elara's prior choices; his revelation solves the mystery through exposition. The "timeless moment" offers atmospheric pause but no visible trade-off or foreclosed option. Escalation is absent; the story moves from sorting debris to epiphany without intervening pressure or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—discovering beauty in the incomplete—is signaled early but never faces opposition or internal friction. The snapped kite string arrives as an opportunity for the poet to demonstrate his philosophy rather than a pressure that tests or complicates it. No meaningful tightening narrows options; the child's sadness eases under the poet's words without cost to either party. Agency is pedagogical rather than transformative, and the resolution restates the premise without alteration or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—fostering tangible interspecies respect before death—is signaled early and guides all action. Escalation manifests as cumulative pattern: one oak wired, then multiple, then fauna respond, then the stag bows. Under the Accumulative lens this suffices as one meaningful deepening, but no reversal or on-page choice narrows Elara's options; success compounds without friction. The copper-wire method works on first attempt with no adaptation required. Cost is told (weakening body) but never forces a visible tactical trade-off or forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—deciphering universal homecoming chemistry—is signaled early and pursued cleanly. However, escalation is minimal: the walk to the tower encounters no resistance, the amber activation is immediate, and the revelation arrives without a trade-off or live choice. Elara's agency is observational rather than decisional; she places the amber and waits, then absorbs the display. No tightening forecloses an option or forces a cost visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (reclaim the battlefield) is signaled early but never encounters opposition or escalation. The coachman's plan proceeds without complication: he speaks, birds respond, he plants seeds, all according to intention. No reversal, tightening, or cost-laden choice appears; coincidence (the birds' guidance) enables rather than complicates. The piece describes a completed ritual rather than a conflict under pressure, and the resolution is predetermined by the opening motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—bridging distance to Elara—is signaled early and tightens when the cylinder yields coordinates instead of her voice. The leaf-overlay moment provides one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens, reweighting "closeness" from reunion to pilgrimage. Cost is visible: he abandons his sanctuary to walk into the wastes. Agency reads as attention and interpretation rather than renunciation, which slightly softens the pressure; the riddle solves itself once he holds the leaf to light without prior failed attempts to establish what's at risk if he can't decode it.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—finding purpose in isolation—is signaled early and pressure accumulates as Kaelen moves from sketching to recalibration to departure. However, the escalation reads as a smooth ramp rather than a tightening that narrows options or imposes a felt trade-off. The decision to journey toward the star faces no on-page obstacle or cost (no resource forfeiture, no lost alternative, no immediate consequence). For the 7+ band, the piece needed one visible price paid that alters later tactics or forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—amending the fractured sky—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is minimal: Kaelen climbs, meets the guardian, performs the swap, and succeeds without a reversal, complication, or cost. The ritual proceeds as intended with no narrowing of options or visible trade-off. The guardian's presence could have applied pressure but remains cooperative. No tightening forces Kaelen to forfeit, adapt, or endure; the resolution is execution of a plan rather than agency under constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—documenting small gestures before they fade—is signaled early but never tested by a live obstacle or competing pressure. Elara's walking patterns progress from "remember" to "listen" to "forgive" to "hope" to "peace," a lyric sequence without reversal or tightening; each step is additive, not a narrowing of options. The nomadic penumbra and chessboard remain symbolic rather than sources of conflict. No cost is legible on the page: her "task complete" and "heart lighter" are declared outcomes, not dramatized forfeitures or renunciations. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or reweight; here it simply layers.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (understanding home) is signaled early. One meaningful deepening occurs when the stone reveals "home was not a place, but a pattern of connections," but this realization is told rather than tested through a choice with visible cost. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as density increase across "weeks of effort," yet no single on-page reversal or tightening forecloses a live option with felt price. Agency is present (using the feather, seeding visions), but the moves feel low-friction and the final acceptance arrives without dramatized renunciation or endurance that would push the score higher.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is clear and sustained. Elian's decoding of the tapestry and labyrinth solution constitute one meaningful tightening, but the escalation is intellectual work rather than a pressure that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The labyrinth clicks into place without risk of failure or visible cost; the "lull of distant thunder" warning never materializes into urgency. No on-page reversal or forfeiture alters tactics. The resolution is delivered by understanding rather than agency under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—refract truth before the ritual—is signaled early, but pressure remains static rather than escalating. Elara recites three poems without meaningful resistance, cost, or tightening; the bell's deadline is declared but never dramatically tested. The listeners' tears and sighs add texture but do not narrow options or force a trade-off. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening or cadence shift is sufficient, yet the piece loops rather than tightens toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—save fading memories from oblivion—is signaled early and persists, but pressure never meaningfully tightens because success is never in doubt. "The acid sea resisted" and "lungs screamed for air" are declared obstacles, yet Elian completes every alignment without error or trade-off. No reversal forces a choice between competing goods; the statue obligingly crumbles at the perfect moment. The escalation is atmospheric rather than stakes-driven, and the final image asserts triumph without showing what live option was foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (return to unbroken peace) is signaled early and tightens when Elara finds the painted shell, forcing a choice between clinging to the past and releasing it. One meaningful reversal: discovering the shell reframes her promise from preservation to liberation. The final act—placing the shell back—enacts protagonist agency with visible cost (unburdened heart, lighter satchel). Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens, though the escalation could narrow options more sharply in the cave beat.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—calling her brother home—is signaled early and remains coherent. Elara's method (whisper over shout) provides thematic pressure but no on-page obstacle tests her belief; she executes the ritual without failure, doubt, or cost beyond the year already spent. The brother's segment introduces a mild complication (storm remnants) but he yields to the pull immediately with no internal resistance or trade-off. One meaningful tightening occurs (the scent traveling and finding him), yet the escalation lacks agency-driven friction or visible price at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Elara must confront her grief and escape emotional stranding. One meaningful tightening occurs when she completes the resonator and aligns it with Polaris, shifting the station from prison to sanctuary. However, escalation is accumulative rather than driven by agency-vs.-resistance: the phone voice guides without friction, and no live option is foreclosed with visible cost. The "reverse migration" unfolds as ritual assembly with subtle emotional deepening but lacks a choice-point where Elara trades one path for another on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake (mute the compulsion) is signaled early. The piece offers no on-page reversal or complication; Elara calculates risk, waits, performs, succeeds. The ritual's success is declared rather than tested. Agency is present in the decision to charge and use the eye, but no live option is foreclosed with visible cost at the ending—she simply gains control. The unknown cost is mentioned but not dramatized or felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: decode the stranger's final gesture. Escalation operates through accumulation of journal gaps and inferred memories rather than reversals that narrow options. The tightening is gradual (days of investigation, fragment of memory surfaces, realization, decision to write) but lacks a moment where Elias's options visibly narrow or a trade-off is forced. The letter-writing resolves the mystery without on-page friction or visible price paid; the stranger's death predates the story, so Elias's agency is observational rather than decisional under live pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—honoring Mara's vow by finding the Doorway—is signaled early and pursued through the glimmer trail and ant-following. Escalation coheres through the rising creek and the discovery sequence, but the climactic choice to step back lacks a visible trade-off or tactical cost; the doorway simply fades when he refuses, leaving no on-page consequence that forecloses a live option. The water rising to his ankles provides external pressure, yet the decision reads as acceptance rather than a choice between competing goods with felt price. One meaningful tightening is present (the creek cresting forces urgency), but the resolution leans toward thematic summary rather than pressure that narrows options at the threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—unraveling the mystery of the dreams—is signaled early and drives the climb. The grotto revelation offers new knowledge but arrives through exposition rather than a decision that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The "lacy menace" and impending celestial collapse introduce declared stakes in the final third without testing them in a concrete choice, and the fireflies' dimming at the end asserts consequence without showing Elara paying a price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake ("capture the density of presence") is signaled early but remains abstract and never tested by a concrete obstacle. No meaningful escalation occurs—Elara's plan unfolds without friction, and the nexus responds cooperatively. Kael's secret reframes understanding but does not force a trade-off or narrow options. Agency is minimal: Elara's final act (releasing transformed energy) is uncontested and the "awakening" of the nexus arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: distill chaos into narrative to regain agency over disorienting visions. Internal conflict (jealousy of past selves, feral nostalgia) and external pressure (the dream of the grave) interweave. One meaningful tightening occurs when the dream pulls him back under and he soars, seeing the grave again, then forcibly returns to mark the scroll. The act of chronicling—"one mark after another"—narrows options from paralysis to imperfect narrative with visible cost (hand aching, "ragged" result). The escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens. Minor gap: the turn from soaring back to the cabin is abrupt; the decision to "land" and "pin this down" is stated but the on-page cost of forcing himself back feels slightly thin.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—Elara seeking a way to heal without scent—is signaled early but never tightened. She arrives, hears a parable, leaves, and the text tells us she succeeded without showing a single on-page test, reversal, or cost. No escalation occurs; the repairman's wisdom is handed over without resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—transforming scars into stories—is signaled early but never faces a concrete on-page test that forces a trade-off. The piece loops through reflection and metaphor without a meaningful tightening or reversal that narrows options. "Completing the ceremony" and "exhaling" offer no visible price or foreclosed path. Stress is declared ("her motivation burned bright") but pressure remains static rather than escalating under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—facilitating Alistair's overdue apology—is signaled early and pursued throughout. The induced-currents device and perfume bottle create one meaningful tightening when the spirits bridge. Yet the resolution lacks a reversal or complication: Elara's method succeeds on first attempt, the "forgiven" petal arrives without Isabella's resistance or ambiguity, and the cost (orchard destruction) is external context rather than a price Elara pays through her choice. Escalation is present but thin; the haunting softens into lullaby without a prior moment when success felt uncertain.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake ("unravel cosmic illusions") is signaled early but never tested by on-page opposition or tightening. The witness proceeds without reversal, obstacle, or trade-off; each paragraph restates intent in synonym loops rather than escalating pressure. No moment narrows options or forces a visible price. The ending declares success without demonstrating agency, renunciation, or endurance that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding time's substance—is declared early but never tested. No reversal, tightening, or competing pressure appears; the shepherd's counting ritual proceeds without obstacle or trade-off. The epiphany arrives as internal summary rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Coincidence does not resolve because there is no conflict to resolve; the piece offers philosophical musing without agency or cost, preventing entry to even mid-band pressure standards.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—widening perspectives responsibly—is announced but never tested by a concrete on-page choice with competing costs. Elara's subway journeys and library visit proceed without resistance, reversal, or tactical adaptation. The journal appears as a late gift rather than an earned discovery; no pressure escalates to force a decision at closure. Her resolve to teach is declared, not dramatized through sacrifice or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—Leo's mission to "teach endings how to begin"—is signaled early but never tested or escalated under on-page pressure. Elara's grief complicates the scene but does not force Leo into a difficult choice, trade-off, or renunciation; he performs his established role without visible cost or friction. The "loop" mechanism is introduced as a demonstration rather than earned through escalating agency: Leo "set the disc into a faster spin" without resistance, consequence, or visible price. No reversal narrows options; the resolution (Elara's thank-you) arrives without Leo's decision altering tactics or foreclosing a path.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=3.5)
    A dominant stake is declared early (preserve the jetty's memories before demolition), but no on-page reversal, tightening, or cost emerges. The ritual proceeds without obstacle: Elara performs each step, the covenant regenerates, and she walks away satisfied. No choice narrows options, no price is paid, and coincidence does not complicate—magic simply works as intended. The piece signals escalation with phrases like "urgent" and "haunted euphoria" but never dramatizes pressure or a trade-off. Under any lens (causal, accumulative, situational), the lack of a meaningful turn or deepening caps the score well below high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: curing loneliness through reciprocal connection. The piece signals it early and maintains coherence, but on-page pressure is diffuse—Leo's skepticism dissolves without visible friction, and the "shift within him" is asserted rather than dramatized through a choice with cost. The station's transformation from tomb to heart is a deepening under the Accumulative lens, yet no tightening or trade-off narrows options mid-scene. The resolution (rumor chains continue, group gathers) lacks a felt price tied to protagonist agency at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (navigate grief to find stillpoint) is clear from the outset. One meaningful tightening: the musical trail descends and ends, forcing Elara to reinterpret the hidden melody as earth vibration rather than airborne sound—this narrows her method and deepens understanding. The ring's pulse and the absorbed forest languages raise sensory pressure, but no on-page reversal forces a trade-off or forecloses a live option; she follows the trail, kneels, and succeeds. Cost remains told ("transforming chaotic storm into structured composition") rather than shown through a visible forfeiture or altered tactic under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: repair the relationship with the anomaly and stabilize it. One meaningful tightening occurs when the anomaly's mirrored pattern arrives—not an attack but a conversation—forcing Elara to shift from passive interpretation to active dialogue. The synthesis signal represents agency (decision) that forecloses the path of avoidance, and the anomaly's stabilizing response makes the cost legible: she is now "forever listening," bound to an uncertain process. Escalation is driven by protagonist choice under the Accumulative lens, and the price is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—Elian's isolation and the search for connection/music in silence—is signaled early. The advisor's arrival and mapping demonstrations deepen the theme, but there is no meaningful reversal or tightening that narrows options: Elian moves from passive recipient to active participant without friction or cost. The ending image reweights prior material, but the escalation itself lacks a visible price or on-page trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—rescuing the forgotten promise—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The portrait-as-map insight provides one minor tightening, yet no visible price is paid; Kaelen simply proceeds without trade-off. The ending claims transformation (arsonist to keeper) but this shift occurs off-stage over "days" of documentation rather than through a pivotal on-page choice that forecloses a live option. Agency reads as endurance without demonstrable cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—"breathe life into a shared dream"—is declared but never tested: no reversal, no tightening choice, no visible cost that narrows later options. Elara drums, the garden erupts, the vision lives "for a fleeting moment," then fades; this is wish-fulfillment coincidence rather than protagonist agency under pressure. The "universe inhaling/exhaling" frame is poetic but imposes no clock or trade-off, and the ending's "she would be ready to continue" defers consequence off the page rather than landing a price here.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake: proving that whispers work better than shouts. Pressure is coherent under the Situational lens—Kael's challenge and the lost dockworkers test Elara's method. One meaningful tightening occurs when Kael's suspicion shifts to curiosity after the coin exchange. However, Elara never faces a credible loss or trade-off; she succeeds without visible cost (no stamina drain, no failure that alters tactics, no moment where shouting would have been easier). The resolution is demonstration rather than earned choice under duress, capping escalation impact.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—freeing the child's spirit—is signaled early, but pressure never tightens: Elara adjusts shutters and the spirit responds passively, with no reversal or moment when her method fails. No on-page cost or trade-off accompanies the resolution; the "release of tension" is summary, not a dramatized forfeiture. The piece operates under an accumulative lens, yet lacks the single meaningful deepening or pattern-break that would narrow options or raise felt stakes. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist agency; the spirit's shift occurs offstage without a visible trigger tied to Elara's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake ("awaken doubt, not violence") is declared early but never faces on-page opposition or complication. Elara retrieves the chess set and organizes the displays without friction, reversals, or visible cost. The guard's "posture softening" and people "questioning laws" are told outcomes, not dramatized pressure. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the rebellion succeeds off-page in summary paragraphs. Escalation is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara's need for freedom versus her tethered life—is signaled early. However, the tightening is more atmospheric than action-driven; the whale's call intensifies but Elara does not face a forced trade-off or visible friction. The step onto the island is framed as surrender rather than a decision that narrows options with on-page cost. The Great Pacification premise (violence impossible) is intriguing but does not constrain tactics in this beat; it functions as backdrop rather than live pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—cultivating lightness in grief—is signaled early, but no on-page reversal or tightening occurs; Elara's actions (whittling, narrating, holding the bouquet) loop without escalation or trade-off. The Happiness Mandate and risk of melancholy infractions are mentioned but never tested in scene. Reporting neighbors to protect herself is told in summary without a dramatized choice moment or visible cost that forecloses a path. The piece ends exactly where it began, with no narrowed options or felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—striding through forbidden boundaries—is signaled early but never faces on-page resistance or a trade-off. The poet approaches, speaks, crosses, composes, and departs without encountering a live obstacle, internal conflict, or cost that alters tactics. The "tremor of certainty" and subsequent question ("what other boundaries could fall") suggest deepening but do not narrow options or force a choice. Escalation under the Accumulative lens would require density increase or pattern break that reweights the stake; here the sequence feels like a procession rather than a tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—Elian's desire to awaken his sight—is signaled early but never genuinely threatened or complicated. Maestra's "challenge" (paint the courtyard's essence) introduces a task but no visible cost or trade-off; Elian completes it without struggle, error, or sacrifice. The "bartered awakening" mechanic promises equal exchange but delivers a passive process: he paints, the reed tongue vibrates, he gains insight—all without agency-driven escalation. The resolution (he accepts his colorblindness) occurs through realization rather than a choice that forecloses a live option, and the cost (not gaining color vision) was never truly at risk.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—discovering connection's texture—is signaled early and Elara's adjustment of the lens apparatus constitutes agency. The shift from "focus" to "bridge" provides one meaningful tightening, and the symphonic assembly in the atrium registers as escalation under the Accumulative lens. Yet the cost is vague: "texture...settle into her bones" abstracts the price rather than naming a forfeited path or visible sacrifice. No live option is foreclosed; the pilgrimage simply completes without friction or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—teaching grief to transform into growth—is signaled early but remains abstract and uncontested. No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows live options; Elara follows coordinates without friction, and each clue confirms rather than complicates her path. The arrival of the grieving woman offers a secondary test but is resolved immediately with the bracelet gift, leaving no visible cost or trade-off. Escalation reads as accumulation of similar acts (more origami, more jewelry, more visitors) rather than a meaningful deepening or a turn that forecloses a path with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—mapping cultural patterns—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; Elara's work unfolds as summary rather than escalating pressure. The climactic insight ("humanity's patterns were cyclical") is told to Leo in exposition, not earned through a dramatized choice with visible cost. Agency is absent; coincidence (the rain easing, light breaking) provides the resolution beat without protagonist transformation or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.4)
    The dominant stake (purify atoms to heal sorrows) is declared but never tested by a live on-page trade-off. The "steadily unpredictable" atoms are asserted as obstacles yet never force a visible reversal or tactic shift. The ritual succeeds without dramatized failure, adaptation, or cost—collapsing exhausted is a physical consequence, not a narrowing of options. No agency-driven escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—preserve hope's shape—is signaled early. One tightening occurs when Elara initiates the untested metamorphosis process, raising immediate risk. However, the escalation lacks visible trade-off: she completes the process without on-page cost (no stamina drain, no price paid to the library, no foreclosed capability). The final regret is told rather than demonstrated through a lost option or irreversible consequence, leaving the pressure asserted instead of felt.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can maintain compassion without sacrificing self-respect—is signaled early and sustained. The piece operates under an Accumulative lens; pressure builds through her reflective shedding of hurt, naivete, bitterness, and fear. However, the escalation is contemplative rather than event-driven, and no sharp on-page reversal narrows her options. The final stance (answering the door tomorrow with "self-respect intact and compassion refined") represents a deepening rather than a turn, which fits the lens but lacks a moment where cost forecloses a live path with visible friction.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—learning to read scars and find closure—is signaled early and drives the tunneling action. One meaningful tightening occurs when the plants reveal the void and Aris commits to digging, narrowing his options. The crystal discovery offers a reversal (understanding his accident as beginning, not end), but the resolution lacks visible cost: no stamina drain, no social or tactical forfeiture shown on the page. Agency is present but the price remains conceptual, limiting high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake ("find where unused love is stored") is signaled early but never escalates through a reversal or tightening that narrows Elara's options. The psychometric vision arrives without resistance, and the path forward is described as "clear" with no visible trade-off. The ending declares a new purpose ("guardian," "path home") but does not dramatize a choice that forecloses an alternative or pays a cost. Under any lens, pressure remains static from midpoint to close.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is declared early but never tested on the page through a choice with visible cost or competing goods. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the "breakthrough" is summarized rather than dramatized. Elara's agency is passive observation (tracing stars) that does not foreclose a path or force a trade-off. Pressure remains static across the narrative, with no escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.0)
    Dominant stake—cultivate sparks—is signaled early but pressure remains flat: Elara moves from spark to spark without visible resistance that narrows options. "The spark resisted, flickering" dissolves in the next line without cost. No tightening choice forecloses a path; coincidence (sparks simply respond to her intent) resolves the problem. The accumulative lens should show density increase or pattern break that reweights cost; instead repetition dulls escalation. Agency is procedural, not under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—reaching the forest's core to unlock inner enlightenment—is signaled early but remains abstract. One tightening occurs when Elara finds the jammed nexus, yet the gear fits "perfectly" with no trade-off or tactical cost. The translocations disorient but never force a renunciation or alter her approach. Agency is present in placing the gear, but the act resolves the problem it did not help create, and no visible price (stamina, tool loss, social cost) alters later moves. Under the accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through constraint or cadence shift; instead, beats telescope from problem to solution without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—finding unused courage—is signaled early and sustained through the traverse. Pressure accumulates via the guides' gentle persistence and the slow descent into twilight, but no on-page reversal narrows Elara's options or forces a trade-off with visible cost. The broken leash is a strong opening image, yet the walk itself proceeds without friction, setback, or moment where Elara must choose between competing goods. The ending offers Charged Poise (readiness for "whatever comes next") but the cost is primarily emotional vastness rather than a dramatized forfeiture. Under Accumulative lens, one deepening turn is present but escalation remains soft.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding the cost of safety—is signaled early and drives Elian's archival research. The discovery of the musician's suspicious death deepens his knowledge. However, escalation lacks a turn that narrows options or forces a trade-off; Elian moves from ignorance to knowledge without facing resistance, risk, or a decision that forecloses an alternative. The final resolve to "remain and hold this knowledge" does not demonstrate what he sacrifices or what opposing pressure he overcomes.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake (unmask the pretender) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Theron confronts Lorian, narrowing options to activation or silence. However, the scholar's discovery is off-page convenience; the climax pivots on a pre-prepared mechanism rather than a protagonist choice under live pressure. The rune's activation feels like pulling a lever rather than a trade-off with visible cost. Escalation is present but accumulative rather than causal, meeting baseline under the inferred lens but lacking the friction and agency typical of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding marine path disappearance—is signaled early but remains intellectual rather than urgently contested. The "specific task" of assembling the report provides a frame, yet no obstacle threatens its completion or forces a trade-off. The revelation arrives via data correlation without a reversal or tightening that narrows options. Pressure is conceptual (weight of witness, years of doubt) rather than an escalating friction that demands agency with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—reignite the rebellion's embers—is signaled early and sustained. However, pressure does not escalate through protagonist agency: Elara does not face a reversal, trade-off, or tightening choice. She walks to the circle, steps in, and the ancient energy flows outward without resistance or cost visible on the page. The visions ("starships soaring, people united") arrive as declarative summary rather than a beat that narrows options or forces a sacrifice. One deepening occurs (the hum intensifies, wrapping her), but it lacks causal linkage to a prior choice and does not foreclose a live path.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—evolving tradition versus rigid restoration—is signaled early but faces minimal on-page opposition. The plants "urge" Elara forward without resistance; the council's skepticism is told not shown and dissolves in summary. The unsealing itself requires "not force but understanding," which Elara achieves through effortless telepathic extension with no failed attempts or costs. The visions provide multiple futures but no difficult choice between them appears on-page. One meaningful tightening occurs (finding the embryo), but escalation lacks visible prices that alter later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—navigating grief without paralysis—is signaled early. The aircraft hum triggers tension, and Elara's breathing exercise offers one tightening moment. Yet escalation is minimal: the external pressure (sound) passes quickly, and the grafting resolution feels preordained rather than earned by a choice that narrows live options. Cost is conceptual (accepting pain) but not legible as a trade-off in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: Elian seeks to recover fragmented selfhood by confronting past failures. Pressure accumulates through memory examination, each thread revealing deeper self-knowledge, and culminates in the decision to "redesign his purpose" and begin again. The tightening reads as an internal deepening rather than a dramatic turn; cost is felt in the acceptance of brokenness and the shift from portraiture to cartography, but the progression is more meditative than agonistic. Under the Accumulative lens this qualifies as one meaningful tightening, though the escalation is primarily conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—discovering why time slows in crisis—is signaled early and sustained. However, the story lacks escalation under the Causal lens: Kael performs his experiment, it succeeds on the first attempt, and he observes the landslide without complication. No reversal, failed attempt, or tightening choice narrows options; the resolution arrives without dramatized obstacle or visible price. The experiment's mechanics (ink patterns, drone data) function as plot furniture rather than sources of friction.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—exposing contraband truths—is signaled early. Elara's agency (inserting the chip, initiating upload) drives the action causally. Yet escalation is thin: the "alarms should have sounded, but the silence held" moment deflates rather than tightens pressure, and the cascade of acknowledgments arrives as affirmation rather than complication. No live option is foreclosed, no trade-off forced; the resolution lands without visible cost or a narrowing of choices under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—"to weave continuity through chaos"—is declared but never dramatized as a live dilemma with competing costs. No reversal or tightening occurs; the roses grow more robust, the wanderers arrive peacefully, and the farm becomes "a symbol of hope" without opposition. Elara's pacifism is stated as past refusal of her father's methods but faces no present test that would force a trade-off or reveal the price of her choice. Escalation is absent; the chaos beyond the glass "intensifies" in summary but never intrudes to complicate her work.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.6)
    One dominant stake is signaled early (catch the echo). Pressure accumulates through collapsing patterns and erratic constellations, but the tightening is atmospheric rather than choice-driven; Kael's zigzag and voicing silence are repeated without escalating cost or a live trade-off. The resolution ("gently pinned the echo… with understanding") lacks on-page friction or a foreclosed option. Coincidence (constellation interference) complicates but protagonist decisions do not narrow the field with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—discovering whether her father was complicit—is signaled early and tightens through the archive investigation. The proof-by-contradiction method provides clear escalation: each file narrows options until the assumption of innocence collapses with visible cost (loss of the father-hero she wanted). Elara's agency drives the turn: she chooses to descend, to open the files, and finally to write the public confession. The decision to intervene "not with a shout, but with the quiet power of revelation" forecloses the path of silent inheritance. One limitation: no moment where she hesitates over a specific tactical cost (e.g., financial ruin, social exile) that would sharpen the price of publication.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake (hushing guilt) is declared but never tested through a choice that narrows options or incurs visible cost. No reversal or tightening occurs; Elara moves from discovery to solution without opposition or trade-off. The firmware "resists" in summary but does not force tactical adaptation. The ending asserts peace without showing what was foreclosed or paid.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake ("discover meaning in the mess") is signaled early but remains internal and observational; Elara's only on-page action is drawing the mandala, which succeeds without complication or trade-off. The woman's challenge ("What's the use of your pictures?") offers a reversal opportunity, but Elara "did not look up" and continues without altering tactics—no narrowing of options or visible cost. The resolution is a passive transformation of others' perspectives, not a choice that forecloses a path for Elara herself.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—breaking free from retrocognitive imprisonment—is signaled early but lacks a live on-page test with visible trade-offs. Elara's agency is limited: she kneels, traces patterns, and whispers a new name without encountering resistance or paying a dramatized price. The "aberrant mercy" that loosens the visions arrives as coincidence rather than protagonist-driven escalation. One tightening (realizing the patterns form a map of states of being) changes knowledge but does not narrow options or force a choice between competing goods. The ending reconfigures her stance, but the cost—what she gives up or risks—is not made legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (recapture applause, transform eternity). The performance builds through layered echoes and the "brink of despair" moment, offering one tightening. Yet Elara faces no meaningful opposition or cost at the peak—she "pressed on," succeeded, and the garden "responded" cooperatively. The resolution is handed to her by external magic (coin, echoes solidifying) rather than earned through a trade-off or agency-driven choice that forecloses an alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—illuminate pathways to Mara's fading memory—is signaled early. One tightening: Alex moves from retrieving the geode to devising the light-painting sequence, narrowing his method under time pressure ("the pill's effects were subtle...time was short"). The escalation is more methodical than pressured; no on-page failure, miscalculation, or friction tests his approach. Agency at closure is present (he completes the map and prepares to show Mara), but the resolution feels assured rather than costly—no dramatized moment where a pathway resists or the method falters.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—becoming the voice of the unknown—is signaled early but never tested. The floating fossil and Kaelen's own levitation are gifts, not earned reversals driven by agency. No options are foreclosed, no price paid; the mystical event simply confirms the goal. Coincidence (the cave's "inherent properties") resolves rather than complicates, violating the lens requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—altering the prophecy—is declared but never tested. No reversal, tightening, or deepening narrows options; the protagonist encounters no failure, adaptation, or trade-off. The work proceeds smoothly from jar-opening to button-sorting to hourglass glow without opposition, mistake, or visible cost. The resolution is convenience: the prophecy dissolves because the cataloging is complete, with no agency or sacrifice dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: expose the conspiracy and restore trust. One meaningful tightening occurs when enemy agents close in, forcing the broadcast under fire. Agency is present in Elias's choice to proceed and Anya's decision to guard. Cost is visible (Elias wounded). However, escalation feels thin—opposition materializes late without earlier friction, and the plan unfolds largely as conceived with minimal adaptation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—finding clarity through introspection—is signaled early but remains abstract. No on-page reversal or tightening forces a trade-off; the coachman waits passively until the ticking stops, then declares resolution. The yarn needle and palimpsest metaphor accumulate meaning but do not narrow options or impose felt cost. Agency is contemplation, not decision with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding why some places resist change—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation is largely passive: Kael meditates, a vision appears, he watches beekeepers' kindness, then rises. The single on-page action (holding the glass aloft) happens late and does not narrow options or test commitment; the oasis "felt whole" without dramatized trade-off. Under the Accumulative lens, the thrum and vision deepen meaning, but agency remains observational rather than decisive, and no visible price is paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.1)
    Dominant stake—sustaining hope through reflection ritual—is signaled early but remains static. No on-page tightening or reversal occurs; Elara rows out, performs the mirror act, rows back, finds the bud. The discovery of the bud is coincidental rather than earned by protagonist choice, and no visible price or trade-off narrows her options.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (translate isolation into independence via coexistence with past-life memories) is signaled early and persists through the ending. Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens: the hum intensifies, projections appear, the sundial glows. Yet no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options; Elara approaches the circle, the hum "steadies her," and she realizes truth without visible trade-off or forfeited path. The method (stone circle hum) arrives as a solution she "had read" about rather than one she discovers through trial, and her shift from isolation to independence is declared, not enacted through a decision with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake ("find the thread") is signaled early but remains abstract and untested; no competing option or fear creates friction. The installation grows without obstacle—visitors cooperate, the spiral expands—so escalation is textural accumulation rather than narrowing pressure. Elara's final realization costs nothing on the page: she will "still write letters, but now they would be her own," yet no prior scene showed her refusing a commission or losing income. The protagonist's agency is limited to building and inviting; luck (cooperative crowd, perfect weather) enables rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—stop the trickster signal before community violence—is signaled early and pressure coheres under a causal lens: Aris identifies the taunt pattern, waits for isolation, bypasses protocols, activates the burst, and faces Evans's confrontation. One meaningful tightening occurs when the signal stutters and dissolves, narrowing his options to defend the choice or retreat; he stands his ground with visible cost (career jeopardy, defiance of authority). The subsonic broadcast's dual payoff (signal disruption *and* crowd pacification) feels convenient, softening the trade-off; a cleaner escalation would have forced a starker choice or left one problem unresolved. Agency is present—Aris's decision drives the turn—but the resolution's ease and Evans's rapid capitulation reduce the felt weight of the gamble. The price (potential scandal, isolation as lone guardian) is stated more than dramatized in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the vital key—is signaled early but never tested by a trade-off or reversal. The spatial mutiny is declared to intensify, yet no passage narrows, no choice costs stamina or safety, and the organ's "fleeting calm" never forces Elara to abandon or adapt a tactic. The keeper's explanation resolves the problem without protagonist agency; coincidence (finding the keeper) replaces earned escalation. No visible price alters later moves, and the ending delivers satisfaction without foreclosing a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—solving Isabelle's cold case after evidence vanishes—is signaled early. Elara's methodical pacing and synthesis of "opposite natures" (masquerade/quarry, ribbon/rock) constitute one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. The realization that the ribbon was "caught, snagged" rather than torn in struggle narrows interpretive options and reweights the tragedy. However, the escalation is cerebral and told: "a picture began to form in her mind" and "she understood" both summarize rather than dramatize the tightening. Agency is present (she chose to come, to pace, to synthesize) but the cost remains abstract—"hoped to awaken empathy"—rather than a visible trade-off or foreclosed path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—clearing the ancestor's name—is signaled early but never tested by a meaningful choice with visible cost. Roy's suspicion evaporates without friction; the remote dive succeeds on first attempt; the committee grants exoneration after brief hesitation. No live option is foreclosed, no trade-off faced. The "spongey dread" is asserted repeatedly but never translates into a decision that narrows Elara's path or forces sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding the hitchhiker's departure and finding meaning—is signaled early, but pressure never escalates through on-page reversals or choices. Elias observes, interprets, and plays his fiddle without friction, obstacle, or cost; the "luminous disbelief" is a declared emotion, not a dramatized struggle. The resolution ("pixelated amnesty settled over him like a gentle rain") is delivered as convenience, not earned by protagonist agency or a visible tradeoff. No meaningful tightening or deepening narrows options under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake (breaking the inherited cycle) is signaled early and Leo's pilgrimage provides clear motivation. The squatter encounter offers one tightening—Leo must dissuade rather than claim—but the reversal feels engineered and the cost is minimal (the squatter simply leaves). The final choice to leave the train lacks a live alternative or dramatized pull to stay, reducing the closure to a declared rather than enacted forfeit. Agency is present but the escalation does not narrow options or force a meaningful trade-off with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=3.6)
    One dominant stake is signaled early (decode inscriptions to help others), but no on-page reversal or tightening narrows options. The variable-star method is described, not tested against failure or cost. "When understanding dawned" is asserted twice without dramatizing what Elara risked or lost to achieve it. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist agency; the discoveries arrive through passive witness and summary transcription. No visible price paid after any turn alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"unbend the rigid silence"—is declared but never tested on the page through a live trade-off or narrowed option. The single reversal (confession spills forth) is passive: the seed "consumes" and the ice "flows" without Elara making a choice that forecloses another path. No escalation under any lens: she chants, presses the seed, and succeeds in a straight line with no setback or cost legible in the text. Coincidence (the seed's hunger precisely matches the ice's rigidity) resolves the problem, undercutting earned agency.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—restoring the eclipsed covenant and crossing the portal—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through sensory deepening (cobalt hues, shadows, glowing clipping) but lacks a meaningful on-page tightening or choice that forecloses an option. The portal simply "flickers into existence" and Elara steps through after an internal realization; no reversal, tactical adjustment, or visible trade-off narrows her path. The transformation at the end (roots to light bridges) is granted rather than earned by prior resistance or cost legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—mending her soul through symbolic ritual—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs when the keeper challenges her method, forcing a tactical shift from dominance to acceptance. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens relies on told interiority ("she felt the fragility of her approach") rather than a concrete on-page choice that narrows options. The cost at closure (placing the card as offering rather than control) is legible but lacks a visible forfeit—what path is foreclosed? The shift reads more as epiphany than earned consequence of prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: discover purpose after public failure. One tightening occurs when Mara's empathy threatens Leo's emotional walls, forcing him to either deflect or open. Leo's choice to combine past and present is protagonist-driven, but the path from deflection to synthesis unfolds in rapid summary ("He spent the next days researching") rather than a second on-page beat that narrows options with visible cost. The professional failure consequence remains abstract; no client walks away, no quarry contract threatened.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake is signaled early: understand the physics of transition to reestablish connection with the departed spirit. One meaningful deepening occurs when the seed begins to glow and visions flicker, shifting Elian's approach from pacing and analogical thinking to active realization. Yet escalation under the Causal lens lacks a visible tightening or trade-off—no live option is foreclosed, no resource spent, no secondary cost paid. The "haunted ambitions" are declared purified, but no on-page action demonstrates what was renounced or what price was extracted. Coincidence does not resolve, but protagonist agency at closure is passive reception (visions arrive, he "realized") rather than a decision that narrows options with legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder—is declared but never tested by a choice with visible cost. Elian encounters identities that "fluctuate" and might "shatter," yet every smelting succeeds without complication, failure, or trade-off. No reversal, deepening, or tightening occurs; the narrative presents serial completions of the same task. Coincidence does not resolve because nothing is at risk to begin with. The final paragraph recapitulates the opening premise without on-page consequence or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—performing the final inspection—is signaled early but immediately abandoned when Kaelen picks up the seashell; no cost or trade-off is dramatized for this shift. The confessions accumulate textural weight, but no on-page reversal tightens options: Kaelen reads, feels, decides, acts, all in smooth sequence without friction. The pearl's eruption of light is a deus-ex-machina gift rather than a hard-won turn driven by protagonist agency. No visible price is paid; the ending declares future intent ("his work would never be the same") without forecloses a live path or demonstrating cost in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs when the graffiti line reframes her guilt. However, the turn happens through passive discovery rather than a choice that narrows options or trades one cost for another. No live obstacle resists her acceptance; the station's decay and the graffiti cooperate rather than test. The final accordion performance feels like ritual rather than a decision with visible stakes or foreclosed paths.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (reach the library) is signaled early and pressure accumulates through reversals and propagation delays. Yet escalation remains lateral—each obstacle (cipher inversion, mist thickening, final reversal) is met with measured response rather than a tightening that forecloses options or forces a trade-off. The protagonist's agency at closure (standing firm, following her breath's echo) lacks visible price; luck and persistence resolve rather than a choice with cost. No meaningful narrowing or deepening occurs in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—propagate freedom or control—is signaled early and lands at closure. Yet the escalation is weak: Elara moves from hesitation to playing the violin without a meaningful tightening or visible trade-off. The Empire's demand is mentioned but never tests her on the page; no live antagonist pressure forces adaptation. The "perforations in her destiny" widen as a metaphor, but no concrete option is foreclosed with felt cost until the violin melts, which reads more as atmospheric dissolution than earned sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—capturing the spark before oblivion—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal or tightening occurs; Elara performs the infusion without opposition, complication, or cost. Agency is limited to executing a pre-planned ritual; no decision forecloses a path or trades competing goods. The piece reads as a successful demonstration rather than a conflict under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—finding the source of contentment—is signaled early but remains abstract and is never tested by a conflicting desire or cost. Elara's actions (tending mosses, climbing, scalloping) lack opposition; no reversal or tightening forecloses an option. The hairpin's glow reveals a hidden alcove, but this discovery does not complicate or force a trade-off—it simply confirms her quest. The resolution ("contentment lay in embracing renewal") is declared without visible price; coincidence (the glow) solves the problem it did not help create.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—Elara's decision about leaving town—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through the ritual objects (mirror, cloak, chimes), but no on-page reversal tightens options or forecloses a path with visible cost. Elara's certainty "frays" and she gains "newfound awareness," yet these shifts are told rather than dramatized through a choice that sacrifices something concrete. The ending offers permission rather than earned difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=3.4)
    Dominant stake—teaching "vanishing to appear"—is stated early but never tested by resistance, resource scarcity, or competing values. No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options; Kael's fear is mentioned once and immediately dissolved by Elara's urging without cost. The lesson unfolds as monologue with cooperative reception; the "delayed revelation" arrives on schedule without friction. No agency decision forecloses a path; the final "understanding" is granted rather than earned through prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake ("to learn to navigate without moving") is signaled early but never escalates or narrows options through protagonist agency. Elara's actions—appraising, listening, humming—are observational; the birds and towers perform the work, and the "pulse" settles without Elara forfeiting anything on the page. No reversal, no trade-off, no visible cost: the story declares success ("its journey was complete") without showing what was risked or lost. The piece reads as a static meditation rather than a conflict that tightens under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (finding sacred simplicity) is signaled early but never tested by meaningful opposition or cost. Elian's journey is "treacherous" in summary only; no on-page reversal or complication forces a trade-off. The keystone accommodates impossibilities without friction, and the spire's transformation arrives as convenient reward rather than earned consequence. The final paragraphs summarize legacy rather than a single climactic choice with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake (discover color of sound) is signaled early but never tested. Elias dives, finds the library, unlocks the orb, and succeeds without reversal, complication, or visible price. No tightening narrows options; the melody manifests and he rows back unchanged except for perception. Coincidence (the key matches the lock) resolves rather than complicates. Agency is minimal—observation, not decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"to wavelength align with purpose"—is declared but never tested by an on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options. Elara casts coins repeatedly, but each session yields the same contemplative summary without escalation. The "new sequence" paragraph promises a turn, yet she simply delves into archives with no friction or cost. No decision forecloses a live alternative; pressure remains static from opening to close.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—naming nameless fears—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal, tightening, or deepening narrows options or raises cost; the crystallization process unfolds without complication or friction. The reaper whispers names and the echo "absorbs them" with no visible price paid or path foreclosed. Agency is observational rather than decisional throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—restore cosmic balance by rebuilding the bell—is signaled early. Escalation relies on label-only intensifiers ("brittle devotion threatened to shatter," "his magic flaring brighter than ever") without on-page tactical shifts or live trade-offs. The cut finger and fatigue arrive as complications but do not force Elian to alter his method or forfeit an option. Success lands without visible cost: no path is foreclosed, no credible loss shapes the final image, only a declarative win.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—transforming fragmented memories into shared meaning—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or scarcity. Elias finds photographs, recalls his past, gathers villagers, and they agree without friction; no reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off. The memorial decision is consensus rather than earned through a choice that forecloses another path. Coincidence provides the trail without Elias's agency creating the discovery or risking something to follow it. The closure lacks a visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—harmonizing logic and intuition—is signaled early but never tested under real pressure. No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options; Elara's gentle warming of the crystal succeeds without risk or visible cost. The starlings provide a metaphor for balance, but coincidence (their appearance) complicates rather than escalates. The "final transformation" remains off-page, and the closure renunciation ("lingered, savoring") lacks dramatic cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preserve trust by correctly interpreting anomalous data—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs: frayed cables + incoming anomalies force her to "revise her entire analysis protocol" and create a "hybrid analysis, something never tried before." That move is protagonist-driven and narrows her options (desperation and ingenuity under immense pressure). However, the escalation is largely cognitive and recounted; we don't witness a failed first attempt or a visible trade-off (e.g., sacrificing thoroughness for speed, risking a false alarm). The resolution (celestial event, not danger) lands, but the cost is emotional relief rather than a material price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—overcoming Kael's numbness—is signaled early, but pressure remains static: Kael "felt nothing," then after one proposal and hand-placement, emotions flood in. No on-page reversal narrows his options or forces a trade-off with visible cost before the resolution. The custody battle itself never escalates; both factions "argue" off-page while Kael listens and then unilaterally proposes a merge that both sides accept without dramatized resistance. Agency at closure is asserted (he "focused all his will") rather than demonstrated through a choice that forecloses a live alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake (restore laughter) is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through sonic layers (one blower, then another), but escalation is additive rather than causal—no choice narrows options or forces a trade-off. The "paradox" (joy and sorrow inseparable) is declared, not dramatized through a visible cost that alters tactics. The giggle's arrival reads as granted by the ritual rather than earned by a protagonist decision under constraint. One meaningful deepening is present (the laughter returns "different now"), but the cost remains conceptual and unproven on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—dimensional homesickness and the pull toward the library versus embracing uncertainty—is signaled early and threaded throughout. One tightening occurs when the pendant hums and boundaries thin, but the guardian's final step "into the between" lacks visible cost or a foreclosed option; it reads as synthesis rather than sacrifice. The piece favors philosophical meditation over escalating pressure, and coincidence (the pendant's spontaneous shattering) resolves the tension rather than protagonist agency forcing a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake (vivify crozier, interrupt destiny) is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure is declared ("hesitation gripped him") but does not escalate through a meaningful reversal or tightening that narrows options. The crozier's explosion could be a complication, but it resolves immediately ("fragments hung suspended") without forcing a tactical trade-off or altered approach. Agency at closure is present (Elian channels energy, encourages destruction) but the cost is conceptual rather than felt: no visible price paid, no path foreclosed on the page. One tightening move is insufficient when the stakes remain static from setup to resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—unlocking a celestial signal—is signaled early, but escalation is minimal. Elara's shift from seeking amplification to attenuation is told in summary ("years of training and old charts had failed her") rather than dramatized through on-page attempts that narrow options. The resolution arrives via insight without a prior visible failure or trade-off; no live cost or foreclosed path charges the final image. Coincidence does not resolve, but protagonist agency is conceptual rather than enacted under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—merging parallel timelines—is signaled early but remains abstract and never tested on the page with a live option or visible cost. The hourglass and radio sequence ("moved…slowly," "adjusted") describes mechanical actions rather than a choice that forecloses a path; the grotto "began to pulse" and the ferry "materialized" without Eli risking loss, enduring pain, or renouncing an alternative. No reversal narrows options or deepens the conflict under the Causal lens. Escalation reads as declarative intensifiers ("profound sense," "final adjustment") rather than protagonist agency forcing a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"to discover the texture of connection"—is declared but never tested through on-page escalation or trade-off. The eruption is described as "not destructive, but transformative," yet Elara's response is purely methodical weaving with no visible price, no narrowing of options. The "knot of unease" dissipates immediately into continued calm; no reversal or deepening alters her tactics or forecloses a path. Coincidence (the tapestry erupting, memories altering) drives the middle without protagonist agency shaping the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake (learning celestial navigation to grasp new cosmic realities) is signaled early. Pressure deepens through the lesson beats: introducing edge geometry → xenocartography integration → Kael's awakening. Under the Accumulative lens, this registers as one meaningful intensification. However, no visible trade-off or foreclosed option accompanies the tightening. The "courage to look up" ending reweights perspective without on-page cost—agency is contemplative rather than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—giving voice to Eleanor—is signaled early but never escalates or faces opposition. Elara's task unfolds as a ritual without friction: she tracks pulses, finds Eleanor, listens, assures her, and Eleanor fades peacefully. No reversal, no tightening, no visible cost or trade-off. The lack of agency-driven escalation under any lens keeps this in the low-mid band.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—return the codex before the tidal window closes—is signaled early but never tested. No on-page reversal narrows options; the hologram reveals safe paths and Elara retraces them without misstep or cost. The ghostly researchers appear as closure reward rather than complication. Agency is absent: the codex guides her, the facility "calms," and the currents reverse on schedule. The final "accomplishment" is asserted without a visible price paid or path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clearly signaled: fetch wisdom from failure, understand the catastrophe. One meaningful tightening occurs when ink patterns force Elara to see "not as a blur of tragedy, but as a series of distinct, understandable choices," narrowing her interpretive options and confronting her culpability. Her agency—choosing to defragment via ephemeral ink, examining Kael's acceptance, placing the shard in the drawer—drives the resolution. Visible cost: she must acknowledge her "reckless confidence" and that she ignored warnings, forfeiting the protective narrative of blameless victimhood. Escalation is textural/accumulative rather than causal, fitting the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—translate texture into sound before the language dies—is signaled early and sustained. Elara's encounter with the diamond provides one meaningful tightening: the curse fights her initial approach, forcing a tactical shift. However, the pivot from opposition to mimicry feels more like a conceptual realization than a high-cost choice that forecloses a competing path. The dying language as a time pressure is mentioned repeatedly but does not visibly narrow her options in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—transforming collective sorrow into freedom through absurdity—is signaled early, and the arrowhead placement provides one pressure point. Yet escalation unfolds through passive metamorphosis: plants glow, bodies reshape, "the changed ones moved with grace" without protagonist agency driving the turn or visible trade-off. The phone "fell silent," the garden "thrived," but no live option is foreclosed and no tactical cost accumulates. Under the Accumulative lens, the final image ("plants swaying in a rhythm") should reweight prior material with felt cost; instead it declares victory without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—reawaken beauty—is signaled early but never tightens through protagonist cost or tactical adjustment. Elara descends, plays, and the statues respond; no reversal forces her to adapt or forfeit. The "gap between knowing and understanding" is recited but never dramatized as a lived constraint. The crystal's death is spectacle without visible price: she simply "poured her soul" (label-only intensity) and the mechanical order collapses.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—reconnecting divided families via smuggled letters—is stated early but never tested. Elian faces no opposition, surveillance gap, or moral calculus on the page; the drone simply arrives and departs as planned. "A mix of fear and determination" is asserted without dramatized consequence. No reversal, tightening choice, or visible cost forecloses an option or alters tactics. The piece loops through summary of past actions rather than escalating present pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—restoration of the carousel—is clear and sustained. Elias's move from silent work to singing provides one meaningful tightening that narrows his approach (he risks voice after silence). However, the escalation lacks visible cost: no material runs short, no injury threatens, no social witness judges. The halo fragment's glow and the horses' shift feel like reward without tradeoff. Under the Accumulative lens, the cadence deepens once, but the final reconfiguration asserts transformation ("no longer a tomb") without showing what Elias has relinquished or risked to earn it.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—finding where stories live—is signaled in the opening and drives Elara's action throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when the scarf glows and the wall ripples, narrowing her path to a single threshold. However, the crossing itself carries no visible cost: she gains access, loses a relic she no longer needs, and faces no dilemma or trade-off. The patrons' presence never complicates her work, and no secondary pressure tests her commitment, leaving escalation functional but not deeply earned.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—capturing the runaway dream—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the dream resists and Elara persists, tracing its form until it solidifies. However, escalation reads as technical progression (adjusting exposure, blending light) rather than a narrowing of options or trade-off with visible cost. The resolution grants peace without a legible price paid on the page; the dream dissolves but no path is foreclosed, no resource spent in a way that alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.6)
    One dominant stake (free the idea) is declared early, but escalation is thin: the "wave of disorientation" could narrow options, yet Elian "held fast" without visible trade-off or cost. The resolution—"whispered words of release"—arrives without a prior tightening that foreclosed a live option. Coincidence (starlight hint, hidden keyhole) complicates setup but agency at closure is minimal; no felt price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—recovering stolen memories—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates as Elara maps mushroom rings to fractured star patterns, and one meaningful tightening occurs when the haze coalesces and fragments appear. However, escalation lacks friction: each step (kneel, brush mushroom, adjust placement, complete constellation) proceeds without resistance or trade-off, and the resolution feels ordained rather than earned by a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: Elian's reversible exile and his learning to "bend without breaking." Pressure accumulates through the lesson sequence (tea leaves, shard annotation, pattern recognition). One meaningful tightening occurs when Elian asks "Why must we use such obscure methods?" and the archivist replies by shifting his perception. The resolution ("You're ready") is earned by his demonstrated understanding, but the cost of readiness—what he forfeits by leaving or what the archivist loses by releasing him—is not legible on the page. Agency is present (Elian's annotations become confident), yet the final departure lacks a visible trade-off or foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—preserve wonder—is signaled early but never faces a meaningful tightening or trade-off. Elara's weaving proceeds without complication, setback, or cost; she "had done it before" and succeeds identically this time. No reversal narrows her options, no price is paid (the seed's glow and immediate success are pure reward), and coincidence (the seed's inherent power) resolves the problem rather than protagonist agency under pressure. The gray malaise vanishes without Elara renouncing anything or enduring a credible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—freeing trapped spirits—is signaled early but escalation is minimal: Elara encounters resistance ("tightening grip," "sharp silence"), continues, and succeeds without trade-off or tactical shift. The needle slips once, Kael flinches, but no live option is foreclosed and no price paid. The "last knot gave way" without cost or complication, making the resolution a release rather than an earned turn.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake (bridge known and unknown via reopening the chapel) is signaled early. Yet escalation is absent: Elara studies, compares footage, finds the fissure, and opens it in a linear sequence without reversal, complication, or narrowing options. The stone "give[s] way under her touch" with no resistance. No on-page cost accompanies the achievement—she "left the chapel" with emotions declared but no visible price paid. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should tighten via density increase or cadence shift; here it remains flat.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake ("understanding the physics of letting go") is signaled early but never tested by opposition or narrowed by on-page consequence. Elara encounters no obstacle—fissure access is convenient, the snow globe is "miraculously intact," and the transmission plays on cue. The note and transmission deepen theme but do not force a choice or tighten options; the ascent feels predetermined rather than earned through agency. No live decision alters tactics or forecloses a path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—giving voice to the voiceless—is signaled early but never faces meaningful opposition or trade-off. Elara's encode action proceeds smoothly: she kneels, works, the graffiti glows, the ghost appears and affirms her. No reversal, no visible cost, no narrowing of options. The storm and "between lightning and thunder" timeframe promise urgency but do not impose a deadline that complicates her work. Agency is present in her choice to encode, but the resolution is granted rather than earned through sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—seeking joy beneath anguish—is signaled early but remains abstract and untested by on-page pressure. The elevator ascent provides a metronome, yet no reversal or tightening forecloses an option; Elara simply reads, floor by floor, until she arrives at an epiphany summarized in the final paragraph. Agency is observation rather than decision. The diary's captain offers thematic mirror but no live conflict, and the resolution carries no visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=4.3)
    The dominant stake—proving empty spaces remember—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. Elias categorizes clouds without friction, and no reversal or tightening narrows his options. The ending declares success ("he had proven") without showing what was risked or foreclosed. Agency is observational rather than decisional, and no meaningful escalation or deepening occurs under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—capturing the sky before demolition—is signaled in the opening and tightens when the hidden safe reveals the technique, narrowing Elara's path to one final attempt. The realization that replication loses infinity constitutes a meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens, reweighting her goal with conceptual cost. However, the escalation lacks a visible trade-off or tactical price during the craft sequence itself; the sky's resistance is told ("lost its infinite quality") rather than shown through a specific failed brushstroke or perceptual limit that forces her to stop.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake (chart the hidden pathway) is signaled early and drives the sequence. Elara's agency shows in her observation and decoding, but pressure remains static—she encounters no reversals, dead ends, or costs. The luminance and symbols yield answers without resistance; the captain approves immediately. One tightening occurs (symbols → coordinates), but no live option is foreclosed and no visible price is paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—learning the rhythm of repair—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. Escalation under the accumulative/textural lens occurs via density increase (library → prophecy → gear → hall → uncap), yet no live option is foreclosed with felt cost. The search progresses without meaningful resistance; each discovery leads smoothly to the next without forcing trade-offs or tactical shifts. The protagonist's agency is observation and execution rather than choice under competing pressures; the prophecy guides her rather than her decisions shaping outcomes.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—awakening the nebula for survival—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when doubt creeps in and Jax voices the need to "reexamine," forcing Elara's renewed determination. However, the escalation lacks a visible trade-off or cost: the group simply "focused their efforts" and the nebula appears. Coincidence (the bell's warmth, the arches' glow) resolves the problem without protagonist sacrifice or a path foreclosed, undermining agency at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—calibrating the clock to deliver a final lullaby—is signaled early and sustained throughout. The piece shows one meaningful deepening when the broken puppet head mends as the lullaby pours forth, but this occurs without Elara's agency driving the reversal; the transformation happens to the object rather than through a choice that narrows her options. No visible cost is paid; she completes her task, smiles, and fades, which reads as fulfillment rather than a trade-off under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—save the travelers before frost—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens through the mechanical birds' aggression and the frost's approach, creating a meaningful escalation. However, the resolution lacks a visible trade-off or loss: Elara succeeds cleanly, dismantles the device, and stands watch with no forfeited path or felt cost. The tension is coherent but the closure doesn't test commitment or force a hard choice, capping the score despite solid escalation mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake (atonement for Elena's death) is signaled early and drives Aris to the ravine. The foam-tracing beat offers one meaningful deepening: the ephemeral connections mirror failed bonds, reframing atonement as connection rather than erasure. Yet this insight arrives without an on-page dilemma or trade-off; Aris moves from grief to polymer project without visible resistance or cost. The final third summarizes the team's inspiration and the remediation work, providing closure by assertion rather than a choice that narrows options. No antagonistic pressure tests the commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"to find the place where stories begin"—is declared but never tested by opposition or cost. Elara's journey involves no reversal: she uncorks moonlight, traces a circle, steps through, and succeeds without friction. The "lull" (no customers) is reframed as potential rather than dramatized as a problem that forces a trade-off. The first customer's arrival at the end is coincidental, not earned by Elara's agency, and no visible price is paid for the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—absorbing and transforming stored remorse—is signaled early, but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs on the page. Kaelen's progression is narrated in summary ("he worked methodically," "he continued analyzing") without a reversal, trade-off, or foreclosed option that narrows his path. The story tells us the remorse "began to dissolve into something softer" without showing what choice or cost precipitated that shift. Agency is absent; events unfold in a passive, descriptive sequence where the protagonist's decisions do not visibly alter tactics or outcomes.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—reuniting villages—is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page representative resists or complicates the repair. The collaborative fixing proceeds without friction: mechanic, astronomer, farmer each contribute their skill in turn without competing priorities or cost. No meaningful reversal or tightening narrows options. Agency is cooperative problem-solving, not a choice that forecloses a path with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—accessing and modifying entangled memories—is declared but never tested by opposition or scarcity. No on-page reversal narrows options; Elara adjusts the mirror "chaotically precisely" and memories flow without resistance or price. The climax (integrating the child's flying dream) arrives without prior escalation or trade-off. Agency is passive reception rather than decision under pressure, and the ending asserts success without demonstrating what was risked or lost.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—finding forgotten combinations—is signaled early and pursued throughout, but escalation feels linear rather than tightening through trade-offs. The threshold effects complicate her path yet she overcomes them without visible cost or lost resource; "she was prepared, her vigilance unshakable" deflates tension. One meaningful deepening occurs when she reenters the vault she once fled, but no on-page choice demonstrates what she forfeited to succeed. Agency reads as endurance rather than decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—restore music to a silent world—is signaled early and tightens when Elara finds the sculpture and realizes the cracks hold "the resonant frequencies the grove had lost." The climactic strumming is protagonist-driven and irreversible, altering the grove's state permanently. Pressure accumulates cleanly under the Accumulative lens: discovery → interpretation → action → response. The cost is visible on the page (seasons of silence, "days in intensely quiet contemplation") and the resolution reweights the world. Minor weakness: no on-page complication or trade-off during the playing itself—success arrives without friction once she begins.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—restoring the eclipsed covenant before the next celestial phase—is signaled early but remains abstract. Kael's actions (clutching the stone, recalling history, pressing the stone to the nexus) are unopposed and flow without reversal or tightening. No live antagonist or constraint forces a tradeoff; the nexus "throbbed with increasing intensity" but this is ambient rather than a test of agency. The resolution (covenant stirring) happens to Kael rather than through his choice with visible cost. Under the Accumulative lens, a deepening or pattern break could substitute for a turn, but the final beat does not reweight options—it fulfills the ritual without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—recovering the diary's contents—is signaled but faces no meaningful opposition or complication. The clasp unlocks smoothly, the fireworks provide ambient contrast rather than pressure, and no on-page reversal narrows options. The resolution declares success without visible trade-off or cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: germinate the seed and cultivate serenity. The piece offers one tightening—Elara detects the soil's activation scent and realizes her impatience blinded her—but this reversal is internalized summary rather than a decision that narrows options or imposes visible cost. The seed's sprouting is a reward for passive waiting, not driven by Elara's agency under pressure. No trade-off or forfeited path appears on the page; the "collective shift in thought" resolves the problem externally.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—find the source of resilience—is signaled early and pursued linearly. Gravity inversion provides one tightening that opens access to the cavern, but no subsequent reversal forces a trade-off or narrows options. The arrow tip hums and the echoes swirl, yet Kaelen never risks anything to secure the discovery; he observes, secures the tip, and exits. No visible price is paid, and the ending defers consequences to a future return, leaving escalation incomplete on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—documenting wind patterns to cultivate foresight—is signaled early and coheres. One meaningful tightening occurs when the patch discovery personalizes the abstract data ("a tangible piece of the puzzle"), narrowing Elias's focus from systemic failure to individual loss. However, escalation remains cognitive rather than forcing a trade-off: Elias "adapted rapidly," "recalibrated," "envisioned" without facing a live tactical or ethical choice that forecloses an option. The wind shift forces a postural adjustment but no decision with cost. Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens but does not crystallize into a choice that alters his stance on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake ("unfetter wonder") is signaled early but never tested. No reversal, tightening, or trade-off narrows Elara's options; she waits for the aurora, rings bells, and succeeds without complication. The sculptor's chisel creates no friction for Elara—it is parallel decoration. Agency is ceremonial performance, not choice with cost; the ending declares triumph without on-page price or forfeited path.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: understanding his failure to prevent the citadel's fall. One meaningful tightening occurs when he steps through the portal and confronts replayed failures, then returns with new clarity. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is weak—each otherworld visit feels like parallel observation rather than accumulating pressure that narrows options. No on-page reversal or tactical constraint forces a trade-off; the "shift, a culmination of understanding" is told, not tested. Cost is implied (time, emotional labor) but not made viscerally legible in a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—quantifying emotion—is declared early but remains abstract. Elara feeds sheets through the press and feels transposed emotions, yet these moves do not tighten options or force a trade-off with visible cost; they accumulate atmosphere without escalation. The final "transposition" into the halo fragment is a reversal, but it resolves the problem off-stage through an asserted understanding ("she understood the equation from the outside") rather than a dramatized choice that forecloses a path. No persistent constraint (stamina, resource, time pressure) visibly alters her tactics across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—Kaelen's desire to find magic in routine deliveries—is signaled early but remains abstract and never faces a concrete on-page test with cost. The traveler encounter should escalate pressure, yet the pendant simply extends the moment without forcing Kaelen to choose between conflicting goods or pay a visible price. The "germinated idea" is a passive reception of wisdom rather than a decision that narrows options. No reversal or tightening forecloses a live path; the night's transformation is deferred to future myth-making rather than earned in the present beat.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—proving that objects absorb emotions—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when the frost reveals Elara's own guilt, narrowing her understanding and reweighting her theory. However, the escalation is conceptual rather than tactical: no on-page choice between competing goods or live options is forced. The protagonist's agency at closure is passive reception ("allowing it to wash over her") rather than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—sending a message across impossible distance—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates as the raveling silence advances and "coils around her loom," but the escalation is told rather than dramatized through narrowing options. The sacrifice is present but arrives as exposition: "the sacrifice became clear" rather than emerging through a dilemma that forces Elara to weigh competing costs. The climax—stepping into the light—reads as inevitable rather than a choice that forecloses other live paths. Under Accumulative logic, one meaningful deepening is sufficient, but the cost here is abstract rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"coax resilience from rubble"—is signaled early but remains abstract and never tightens. Elian's quest proceeds without obstacle: he finds the silk, trades it, learns the secret, forges the alloy, and teaches others in a steady accumulation with no reversal or cost. The mage's warning ("comes at a cost") is declared but never paid on the page. No live option is foreclosed; the resolution gifts success without sacrifice or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—discovering the withheld truth—is signaled early and held throughout. Pressure appears to escalate (shard contact → multiverse visions → rift opening), but each step unfolds through Kaelen's will and sensory mapping without on-page cost or tactical adaptation; coincidence (the shard happens to be a "key") initiates the sequence. The final revelation arrives as vision rather than choice, and we see no trade-off or foreclosed path at closure. One meaningful tightening is present (rift stabilization under time pressure), but the agency remains largely passive observation.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—restoring the light to protect the channel—is signaled early and tightens through the cairn construction and lamp relighting. The haunting provides atmospheric resistance but lacks on-page agency; Elian's escalation is mostly internal and procedural (gathering stones, relighting the wick). One meaningful deepening occurs when he realizes the haunting is "a manifestation of old fears" and places the sea glass as "a small anchor for hope," but the final victory (the presence "calmed") arrives without a trade-off that forecloses another option.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—"to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows"—is declared but never tested; no on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off. Kael adjusts lenses and "steers" light in a series of interchangeable moves with no escalation or visible cost. The storm arrives on schedule, the visions appear, and he completes the task as if reading a checklist. No agency, no price, no tightening—just ornamental atmosphere cycling through the same thematic claim.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—"to learn why some people magnetize stories"—is declared but never tested. Kaelen encounters no opposition, no failed hypothesis, no cost for pursuing this inquiry. The "illumination process" unfolds without friction: he aligns the wing, light refracts, symbols appear, understanding arrives. No reversal, no deepening, no trade-off. The ending grants comprehension as a gift rather than an earned outcome, and coincidence (the donor heart's influence) resolves the question without protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—deconstructing quantified sorrow—is signaled early but never tested by meaningful opposition or scarcity. Elara adjusts the sextant, traces dream-maps, and the instrument glows in response; no reversal, failure, or forced trade-off narrows her options. The pin's sound is declared a "catalyst" yet its mechanism and cost remain unexplained. Pressure accumulates through descriptive intensification (moonlight intensifies, gears turn) rather than through protagonist agency or constrained resources. The resolution—sorrow replaced by mundane miracles—lacks visible price; she descends "sure and calm" without forfeit.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (rekindle the dying realm) is signaled early. Yet escalation is minimal: Elara hums, then sings more strongly, and the realm immediately responds with no setback or trade-off. The "profound stillness" marks the brink but is resolved within the same beat. No visible price is paid—communities join "from beyond" without dramatized hesitation or friction. Under a Causal lens, the lack of a meaningful tightening or cost legibility keeps this in the functional-but-limited band.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—unearthing wisdom from a past mistake—is signaled early but never tested by a live dilemma that forces Elara to choose between competing goods. Pressure is static: she arrives anxious, listens, reads, and leaves at peace, with the elder's counsel doing the work off-stage. No on-page reversal narrows her options or raises the cost of connection versus hiding. Midnight arrives as a clock chime, not a tightening constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—finding absolution through uncovering the courtyard's history—is signaled early and remains coherent. The journal discovery serves as the single meaningful tightening, reframing her quest from personal to intergenerational. However, the resolution is largely internal realization without a visible trade-off or foreclosed path; Elara's "work was just beginning" suggests continuity rather than a choice that narrows options. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens but lacks a felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving the luminous vows before they fade—is signaled early but never tightens or forces a trade-off. Elian proceeds without opposition, error, or reversal; he simply completes his task. The timeframe ("while illusions fade to memory") suggests urgency, yet the magic lantern slide "began to dim" prompts only faster data collection, not a meaningful narrowing of options. No on-page cost or sacrifice is legible; the ending asserts success without dramatizing what was risked or lost.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—thwarting Silas's betrayal—is signaled early but never escalates through protagonist agency. Elara's "false starts" are told retrospectively without on-page demonstration, and the climax unfolds passively: she overhears an argument she did not cause or shape. The agent strikes Silas, breaking their pact independently of Elara's actions; her success is coincidental observation rather than earned tactical victory. No meaningful tightening or choice under pressure appears; the tide deadline mentioned early is abandoned (sunrise arrives without consequence). Conflict remains static observation rather than escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—learning why people carry weather—is declared but never tested on the page; Elara receives an answer via monologue rather than pursuing it through escalating choices. The man's fog "eases" as he speaks, a visual shift without conflict. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the ring "steadies" and "pulses" without altering Elara's tactics or foreclosing options. The forest elections are mentioned as significant but exert no pressure on her decisions. No visible cost appears at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—regaining creative flow—is signaled early and pursued throughout. The cave descent and sketch act provide one meaningful tightening, but the escalation is largely internal and summary-driven ("Each stroke was an act of rectification"). No on-page opposition or reversal forces a trade-off; coincidence (the mentor's hidden note) enables rather than complicates. The resolution is asserted ("creativity flowed back") rather than tested by a visible price or foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—finding where lost conversations go—is signaled early and resolved at closure. Escalation is linear: she finds map, travels, reaches archive, learns answer. No meaningful reversal or tightening narrows her options; each step succeeds without cost or adaptation. The child's water-cache moment provides a micro-complication but doesn't alter tactics. Agency at closure is realization rather than choice, and no visible price is paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.3)
    The dominant stake—preserving the color of wonder—is signaled early and accumulates through the sculpture's assembly. One tightening occurs when Elara notices the dimming and fine-tunes the largest bell, but this "focused intensity" moment is summary-only; no competing option, resource limit, or failed attempt dramatizes the cost of success. The symphony erupts and wonder blooms without visible sacrifice or foreclosed path, so escalation remains conceptual rather than earned by protagonist choice under constraint. Agency is present but unchallenged, and the resolution is declarative success without trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—resolve inner static—is signaled early. The miniaturization of fears and controlled burn create one meaningful tightening: the plan forms, preparations occur, ignition succeeds. However, no reversal or friction narrows options; magnetic shift and weak dome align conveniently, and the burn is "hot and clean" without cost or complication. The ending declares freedom without dramatizing what Kael renounced or risked; the "condensed essence" he carries is asserted, not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake (returning the locket to ease Mr. Hemlock's sorrow) is signaled early and remains coherent. Escalation reads as accumulation (Mrs. Gable → baker → Mr. Hemlock) rather than a tightening that narrows options. The resolution (unlocking the mailbox and reading the letter) is driven by Elara's persistence but lacks a visible price—Hemlock's agreement and emotional release arrive without on-page friction or trade-off. Cost legibility is the high-band gate; here cost is asserted ("the weight lifting") but not dramatized with a forfeited path or visible stake.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—liberating trapped subjects—is signaled early but never tested. Elara encounters no obstacles, dead ends, or trade-offs; each decoding step succeeds, and the final sequence unlocks on command. The journals detail dark history but impose no present threat or cost on Elara's mission. No agency-driven reversal or deepening narrows her options; coincidence does not complicate because nothing complicates. Escalation is absent under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—finding where deleted memories go—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when coffee grounds map the path inland, and a second when the jar is unearthed, revealing letters that restore memory. However, escalation is largely linear: each step (brew coffee, read grounds, walk to chamber, dig, read letters) proceeds without genuine reversals or competing pressures. The resolution hinges on discovery rather than a choice under pressure; Elara does not sacrifice or foreclose an alternative path. Cost is conceptual (confronting forgotten grief) but not dramatized as a trade-off or visible loss in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=2.4)
    Stakes are declared but never tested. The prophecy threatens "chaotic unraveling," yet no complication arises, no option narrows, no price is paid. Elian begins his ritual, executes it, and succeeds without error or sacrifice. The "smoothed hush" grows without resistance. No agency choice forecloses a path; the ending is functionally identical to the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—learning the building's language—is signaled early and tightens through weekly lessons, each deepening the method (seal impressions, silence interrogation). The peak moment when the narrator asks "Why are you really here?" functions as a mild reversal, and Finch's dissolution narrows options (no more live instruction). Yet the escalation is gentle; no on-page choice forces a trade-off or visible price during the narrative. The cost arrives only at closure as inheritance of solitary work, legible but not foregrounded by prior tactical pressure or a decision that forecloses an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—breaking free from a quarantined memory—is signaled early and remains consistent. One meaningful turn occurs when the memory unfolds and Elara chooses to archive it, but the cost is atmospheric rather than tactical: no live option is foreclosed on the page, no visible trade-off forces a decision under pressure. The ritual progresses without complication or reversal; the stones hum, the memory is stored, and Elara walks away transformed by declaration rather than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"to forgive the unfinished"—is declared but never tested by a concrete dilemma or price. No reversal or narrowing of options occurs; Elara enters seeking forgiveness and exits having granted it to herself through a symbolic gesture. The blood drop and invisible seam are metaphorical; no on-page cost (relationship, resource, capability) is forfeited. Pressure is static, recycling the same reflective beat across twenty paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—learning why some people echo—is signaled early but never escalates through agency. Kaelen moves "deeper," sings, and listens; the seashell discloses answers without requiring a trade-off or tightening his options. No reversal occurs: false echoes dissolve on cue, true echoes rise in harmony, and Kaelen "ensures" restoration without visible cost. The climax is a declarative summary ("he had learned") rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Pressure is static across all beats.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=3.5)
    No on-page escalation or reversal is dramatized. The dominant stake—salvaging Elias's truth—is declared but never tested: Kaelen gathers dream fragments without obstacle, then tells Anya the story without cost or complication. The "exposure" is a one-way gift with no trade-off or risk made visible. Pressure remains flat summary throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=3.1)
    The dominant stake—"to appreciate hidden effort"—is announced early but never tested or deepened. No reversal, tightening, or meaningful pressure emerges; Kaelen faces no opposition, temptation, or internal conflict that would force a choice with cost. The text cycles through thematic variations (nets, fireflies, tea) without escalation. Agency is absent: he walks, whistles, and reflects, but no action forecloses a path or alters his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—excavating the truth behind the rumor—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation is thin: Kaelen searches, finds shredded letters, reassembles them, digs, and finds the diamond in a mostly linear sequence. The "bargain, a life for a life" and the cost of activation are declared in the letters and the final paragraph but never tested on the page through a choice that narrows options or forces a visible tradeoff. The winds returning at the end gesture toward pressure but arrive as external coincidence rather than protagonist-driven escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—uniting factions under the prophet—is signaled, but all pressure (variant allegiance, betrayal, council debate) is summarized rather than dramatized. No on-page reversal forces Elara to trade one option for another; the broadcast interpretation and final decree happen offstage, so escalation reads as told intensifiers ("critical," "final hours") without causal tightening. Agency is assertion, not decision with visible cost, and the lens defaults to Causal but lacks because/therefore linkage at key turns.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—preserving sounds against oblivion, seeking redemption through his craft—is signaled early. The music-box jarring sequence provides one meaningful action, but no escalation, tightening, or deepening occurs: each jar is captured identically, and no complication or reversal tests his method or forces a trade-off. He completes his task without obstacle, and the ending restates his intention ("would begin again") without narrowing options or paying a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—protecting the artifact by stabilizing the ice—is signaled early but never tightens into a trade-off or reversal. Kaelen adapts by humming and inserting the key; the "vibrations skewed" moment hints at complication but resolves in the same paragraph without cost or tactical shift. No live option is foreclosed: he succeeds, withdraws the key, and stands watch with no visible price. Escalation is asserted ("threatening to fracture the key") rather than enacted through a choice that narrows his path or forces sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake ("unyoke her people from the frantic cycle") is signaled early but never tested or tightened. No reversal, complication, or cost appears; the moon convergence arrives on schedule, the group gathers without conflict, and the liberation proceeds exactly as planned. The piece describes "restrained wildness" and "latent energy held in check," but this potential never manifests as on-page friction or choice under pressure. Agency is collective and symbolic, not a protagonist-driven turn that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake (expose the cover-up vs. agency control) is signaled early and pressure tightens when Thorn arrives and demands the ledger. Elara's refusal—"No"—is a clear reversal that narrows options. However, the physical confrontation (Thorn lunges, Elara sidesteps) resolves too easily; no visible trade-off or tactical sacrifice accompanies her escape. The cost is asserted in summary ("the weight of control lift from her shoulders") rather than paid on the page in the climactic moment, weakening escalation at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—transforming apology into tangible action—is clear from the opening. The woman's second opinion ("It's not hopeless") is a micro-turn that shifts the chaplain from despair to agency. Yet escalation is thin: the middle learning process is summarized, so no on-page reversal tests his commitment or forces a trade-off. The final repair emits "a clear, melodic chime," but we never see a moment where the repair risks failure or the chaplain must choose between haste and patience under pressure. Cost is named ("each turn of a screw...an act of contrition") but not dramatically tested.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=4.6)
    A dominant stake ("ring a bell no one hears yet") is signaled early but never narrows options or faces resistance. The arrow-tip insertion and kaleidoscope work proceed without complication, reversal, or trade-off. The "yearning algorithm" hums louder but does not impose a cost or force a decision. The ending declares success without showing what Elara risked or lost, leaving escalation and pressure inert.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—discovering where deleted files go—is signaled early and sustained. The lie to her supervisor is one meaningful choice that opens the hidden cluster, tightening access and narrowing options. However, the escalation is primarily discovery-driven rather than protagonist-driven under pressure; the climax is a revelation about sabotage, not a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. The recurring numbers and patch function as clues without forcing a trade-off or altering her tactics once known.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—save the villages from the ice anomaly—is signaled early but never tightens through genuine opposition or cost. Kaelen descends, travels, consults mirrors, and succeeds in a linear sequence with no reversal, complication, or trade-off. The orb reconstitution happens because he aligns his will with the reflection; no on-page price is paid, no option foreclosed. The final act (soothing the leviathan) is told in a single sentence without dramatized struggle or visible consequence, flattening what should be the story's climax.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—learning the sound of endings—remains abstract and contemplative throughout. Trawling provides repetitive action without a meaningful narrowing of options or visible cost that forecloses a path. The piece deepens Elara's acceptance but does not dramatize a pressure point where her choice or renunciation alters tactics or consequences on the page. Under the Accumulative lens, one decisive intensification is expected; here the accumulation stays level.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—reconciling with the past—is signaled early, but no on-page action tests it. The sentinel moves from grief to acceptance via internal summary; no reversal, tightening, or deepening forces a trade-off or narrows options. The bus departure and letter edge are static symbols rather than pressure points. Agency is observation and retrospective insight, not decision with visible cost. Escalation is absent; the piece loops through parallel reflections without meaningful intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving echoes—is signaled early but faces no opposition, resource limit, or ticking clock. Kael senses, envisions, speaks, and succeeds; the parapet cooperates, the clearing solidifies, seekers validate. No reversal, trade-off, or moment where success is uncertain. The ending reports outcomes rather than dramatizing a tightening that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake—transmuting communal pain into collective healing—is signaled early but never tightens on the page. No reversal: residents simply arrive, share, and approve. Elara faces no resistance, resource constraint, or competing pull. The exhibition's success is narrated ("the room buzzed"), not tested. Mr. Hemlock's gratitude confirms rather than complicates. The Accumulative lens allows gradual intensification, but even that requires one meaningful deepening that narrows options or changes knowledge with felt cost; this piece offers steady addition without friction or price.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (decode growth, share the finding) is signaled early and pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens via crystal work. However, escalation is tepid: no reversal or tightening choice narrows options; Elara simply completes her method and decides to speak. The final act (testify) is stated as daunting but unfolds without visible opposition or cost-forcing trade-off, leaving the tightening/deepening requirement barely met and the cost abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—capturing the sound of growing older—is signaled early but never tested by a trade-off or narrowed by agency. The prophet follows driftwood markers set by earlier visions, but no reversal or escalation forces him to sacrifice one path for another. The chalk breaking is a coincidence that removes agency rather than a protagonist-driven turn. The ending declares acceptance without showing what was risked or lost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—capturing the once-in-an-era solar flare before it vanishes—is signaled early and remains coherent. Escalation is thin: the tremors intensify, but Elara's adjustments feel serial rather than narrowing options or raising cost. The clock-halting maneuver at the climax occurs without visible trade-off or resistance; no tactic fails, no resource is exhausted, no alternative is foreclosed on the page. The piece deepens thematic texture (chaos vs. constancy) but does not tighten choice or dramatize agency under pressure sufficient for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—executing a flawless goodbye—is signaled early but never meaningfully tested. Elara's method succeeds without complication; Lena arrives on cue, reconciliation unfolds smoothly, and Alistair dies peacefully. No reversal narrows options or raises cost; the single "tightening" (Lena's arrival) is coincidental rather than driven by protagonist agency. The resolution awards equal satisfaction (peace, forgiveness, memorial) without visible trade-offs scaled to this length.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—find where shadows go and stabilize fractured physics—is signaled early but remains abstract. The automaton activation and orrery alignment provide procedural steps rather than narrowing options through antagonistic pressure or trade-offs. The ritual completes successfully with one benign entity released and shadows restored; no on-page reversal forces Elara to choose between competing goods or face a visible price that alters tactics. The broken key arrives as a micro turn, but its cost (future effort) is deferred rather than paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—Elara's need to "turn mistakes into constellations" and heal after the changeling's deception—is signaled early but never tested. The entire sequence is a smooth ascent from grief to acceptance without a meaningful reversal, tightening, or on-page tradeoff. Agency is passive ritual performance; no live option is foreclosed with visible cost. The tooth "dissolving into light" and garden blooming read as convenient magical resolution rather than earned closure driven by protagonist choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake (share light without fire) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara raises the polished glass and the kaleidoscope effect validates her method. Yet escalation is contemplative rather than pressure-driven: no live obstacle forces a trade-off, and the decision to leave the grotto unfolds through reflection ("weighing that decision felt like holding the entire ocean") without a visible price paid on the page. Agency reads as a stance crystallization under Accumulative lens, but the final image lacks a felt cost that forecloses an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—grafting new meaning onto public shame—is signaled early and tightens when Elara offers the pendant to Leo, a choice that forecloses solitary healing and commits to shared future-building. The cost is visible in "protected vulnerability" and the acknowledgment that wounds remain part of the story. However, Leo's acceptance arrives without on-page friction or competing impulse, reducing the pressure of the exchange. The icicle pattern provides a conceptual method but does not itself create tactical obstacles; escalation is more thematic accumulation than causal narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake (collect all hopes before closure) is signaled early but never tested; no hope escapes, no choice trades one hope for another, and the mist never forces a renunciation. The structure is additive without reversal: each cameo dissolves on cue, Elara captures it, the next appears. "Against the current" is declared as opposition but never dramatizes friction—time's flow and the nexus's erasure are aesthetic backdrops, not live obstacles. The ending delivers all hopes with no visible cost, undercutting the premise that urgency or sacrifice shaped the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake (restore the arbor) is signaled early but never tested. No reversal or tightening: Elara hums, the vine responds, she sings louder, restoration completes. Coincidence does not complicate; the "timeframe of alignment" arrives on cue without effort or trade-off. Agency is execution of a known method, not decision under pressure. The resolution lacks visible price—her pockets still jingle, her spirit is "alight," and no live option was foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.0)
    The dominant stake—to bind starlight and map heartbeats—is signaled early but never tightens or deepens under opposition. No reversal narrows options; the ritual proceeds from intention to completion without friction. Agency is present (Elara initiates and executes), but no on-page cost forecloses a path—cold is noted, patience invoked, yet no sacrifice or trade-off materializes. The world's held breath dissipates without dramatized consequence, leaving escalation flat.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake—master the harvest of echoes—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through observation cycles, but there is no on-page reversal or moment where a live option narrows with visible cost. The timer's insight ("designed not to measure time, but to harvest echoes") arrives as epiphany rather than earned discovery through failure. Agency reads as patient assembly without trade-offs; success is assured, and the wounded season's "healing" coincides with completion without causal linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—collecting and calcifying burdens—is signaled early but remains abstract and unchallenged. Each burden (grief, fear, envy, hope, love) is introduced and resolved within its own beat without escalation, trade-off, or visible cost that narrows options. The process unfolds as a series of completions rather than a tightening or deepening under pressure; no reversal or choice alters subsequent tactics. The ending claims completion and enrichment, but coincidence (the task simply finishes) rather than protagonist agency drives resolution, and no felt price is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—to "harvest lessons from loss"—is declared but never tested by a reversal or price. The widow carves without error, hesitation, or trade-off; no moment narrows her options or forces her to choose between competing goods. The kettle's whistle is mentioned as a timer but does not trigger a choice or tighten tactics. Pressure remains static, and the resolution (carving finished, heart lighter) arrives without visible cost or agency that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—making peace with her ghost—is signaled early, but pressure remains static rather than escalating. The ghost encounter unfolds without resistance, negotiation mechanics, or a moment where Elara's choice narrows live options. The disposable camera wheel's glow and the resulting image-tapestry feel granted rather than earned by protagonist agency. One meaningful tightening (wading to the island) occurs, but no visible price alters her later tactics or forecloses a path with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—"to puzzle out new equations for hope"—is abstract and never tested by a concrete obstacle or trade-off on the page. Kaelen's work (mapping tunnels, aligning reflectors, rerouting pipes) proceeds without reversal or meaningful tightening; each action succeeds in sequence. No live option is foreclosed, no competing pressure forces a hierarchy of values. The "resurrection" is a gradient accumulation without a moment where agency narrows possibilities or reveals cost under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—making peace with an abandoned dream—is signaled early and coherent throughout. However, escalation is minimal: Elara arrives with the intention to find peace, works on the clock, reflects on her past, and achieves peace without meaningful reversal or tightening that forecloses a live option. The "profound sense of acceptance" and "newly found serenity" arrive through meditation rather than a pressured choice or visible trade-off. Under an Accumulative lens, the piece should deepen or shift the stake with cost, but the cost remains abstract ("transformed" dream) rather than concretely legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding why the Sunken Bell legend exists—is signaled early and shapes the arc. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens as Elara pieces together insight. However, no on-page reversal or tightening narrows her options; the arc is one continuous deepening without a visible tradeoff. The resolution is largely introspective summary ("she understood," "she felt a peace settle") rather than a decision or renunciation that forecloses a path with cost. Agency remains passive observation rather than choice under constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake (preserve ancient methods) is signaled early, but pressure never tightens or forces a trade-off. Elara encounters no resistance, time pressure, or competing demand; the weavers test her "dedication" off-page (through her established patience) rather than on-page escalation. The knot-decoding unfolds as patient archaeology with no reversal, cost, or narrowed option. Coincidence does not resolve because there is no conflict to resolve—the weavers manifest when she finishes, granting lore without agency or price.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding the geography of healing—is announced early but remains abstract and never faces a concrete test. Elara projects Kael's memories and arrives at insight without reversals, escalation, or visible tradeoffs. The thread ritual succeeds without friction, and no on-page choice narrows options or forecloses a path. Pressure is asserted rather than built through linked complications. The story offers a single reflective deepening rather than a tightening that raises cost or forces agency, and coincidence does not complicate because external opposition is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—reawaken beauty—is signaled early and remains consistent, but pressure never tightens meaningfully. The assembly proceeds without obstacle, failed attempt, or trade-off; each connection is "a test of his faith" in summary only, never dramatized as a live dilemma. The egg cracks and the bird emerges as a linear success, with no on-page reversal or agency-driven choice that forecloses an alternative path. The stated cost ("bitterly sweet," "could not last forever") is conceptual rather than a visible price paid in the moment. Under a Causal lens, escalation is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—helping the girl's scars heal—is declared but never tested. No complication arises; the graft succeeds without resistance, pain threshold, or tactical adjustment. The girl flinches once but holds still, offering no meaningful friction. Escalation is absent; the procedure unfolds as a demonstration rather than a choice under pressure. The ending grants resolution without visible cost or trade-off, leaving the conflict inert.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—liberate trapped memories—is signaled early but never tested by a competing desire or cost. Elara encounters no genuine reversal: each fountain yields its shard without resistance, and the final alignment solves itself once she waits for nightfall. Agency is passive (she waits for geese, for stars) rather than a choice that forecloses an option. The piece accumulates steps but lacks a meaningful tightening or trade-off that narrows her path under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving the garden's light and breaking a generational pattern of decline—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the sonar-mapped fissure and the revelation that each keeper has passed on a weaker garden, but no on-page reversal tests Elara's commitment; she moves from discovery to decision without friction. The climactic choice (encoding the garden into sonar waves) is asserted rather than dramatized through a dilemma or competing option. Cost is conceptual (the garden fades, the cycle may begin again) but remains abstract; no visible tradeoff narrows her tactics or forecloses a live alternative on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"to discover the shape of collective grief"—is abstract and never tested by a concrete obstacle or dilemma. Elara encounters no resistance: the ghost cooperates, the ribbons map cleanly, and the butterflies affirm her thesis without complication. No reversal or tightening narrows her options; the accumulative patterning (ribbons, poems, butterflies) layers without pressure. The ending declares transformation ("her hands, once carving stone, now felt capable of mending spirits") but no on-page choice, renunciation, or visible price accompanies it.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (restore clock balance to atone for past failure) is signaled early and sustained. Elias's pendulum adjustment offers one meaningful tightening as he follows the inscriptions, but the work unfolds without reversal or trade-off: each turn brings him closer to success with no visible cost or complication. The searing reverie softens into acceptance without dramatized resistance, and the final harmony is declared rather than earned through a choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—discovering the shape of intentions—is signaled early but never tightened through genuine opposition or foreclosed options. Elara's work proceeds without obstacle: the tapestry yields its secrets linearly, the journal appears conveniently, and the map reveals itself without requiring a difficult trade-off. The "urgency" after Mr. Hemlock's death is told, not dramatized through a ticking constraint. No visible price is paid; the resolution ("she must continue") is declared rather than earned by a choice that narrows her path.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"seed innovation within a constraint"—is declared but never tested by an on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options. Kaelen "hesitates" and considers consequences (monopolies forming, exploitation), yet he resolves these concerns internally through refinement rather than facing a live trade-off that costs him something. The "first cracks" on the lake and the spreading story are outcomes narrated as already achieved, not a turn earned by protagonist agency. Coincidence does not complicate; instead, the world simply mirrors his success without resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—reviving stories after the famine—is signaled early and pursued consistently. However, the authorities' threat is declared but never dramatized on the page; no reversal or tightening forces Elara to trade off safety against her mission. The pirate broadcast complicates her work by increasing song complexity, but this does not narrow her options or impose a visible cost. The ending asserts flourishing narratives within the alcove without showing a decision, renunciation, or endurance that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake: achieving forgiveness/peace through the ritual portrait. The piece moves through setup → grinding → drawing without a meaningful reversal or tightening that narrows options. Elara encounters no resistance, competing desire, or tactical shift; the ritual proceeds as planned. The "weight lift" at the end is declared rather than earned through a visible trade-off or foreclosed path, so escalation under the Accumulative lens remains shallow.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving ancient navigation methods—is signaled early but never tightened or tested. No on-page reversal, meaningful choice, or visible cost occurs; Elara continues her work methodically without opposition or internal friction that narrows options. The "competing narratives" appear only as reported memory, not as live pressure that forces a trade-off. Agency is absent at closure; she simply uncovers another artifact and reaffirms her prior stance.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—teaching the choir to subtract noise and achieve harmony—is clear and signaled early. However, escalation is minimal: Elara finds the rosette without complication, and the choir's transformation happens in summary ("tentatively at first, then with growing confidence") without on-page resistance or a tightening that narrows options. The phrase "old rivalries that echoed in their hesitant voices" remains abstract; no specific friction surfaces during rehearsal. The ending asserts success ("they had found a way") rather than dramatizing the cost of that achievement or the path foreclosed by their choice to commit.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.5)
    Dominant stake—"create something beautiful from ruins"—is signaled early but never tightened. No reversal or complication challenges Elara; the seed cooperates, the alignment arrives on cue, the plant sprouts exactly as hoped. The pruning of dead vines and the planting proceed without setback, trade-off, or cost. Pressure remains static: the story restates her mission across twenty-nine sentences without escalation or a choice that forecloses an alternate path. The ending delivers success without earned agency or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake—restore power to preserve wonder—is signaled early but never tightens into a trade-off or narrowed option. The single reversal (riddle understood → water applied → lights on) occurs through exposition and instant mechanical success, no visible cost or agency test. Kael's arrival and cooperation are friction-free; no competing pressures, lost resource, or moral calculus complicate the solve. The ending declares wonder preserved without demonstrating what was risked or renounced to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding why some houses feel alive—is signaled early but never tested by a reversal or tightening that narrows options. Elara places the orris root and the cottage immediately "wakes"; no resistance, cost, or turn appears. The resolution is delivered to her rather than earned through agency that forecloses a path. The displacement method succeeds on first attempt without complication, flattening escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding the statue's origin and purpose—is signaled early but never escalates under pressure. Each revelation adds information without narrowing options or forcing trade-offs. The ampoule's use is convenient (no risk, no failure mode) and the statue's telepathic reach succeeds without resistance. No meaningful tightening or cost: the garden's magic is reinforced, other guardians are stirred, and the statue's isolation ends—all gains, no forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—capturing the texture of a missed opportunity—is signaled early but never concretized into a testable on-page problem with live options. No reversal or tightening narrows Elara's choices; the "rupture" is a coincidental event (crack appears beneath her) rather than the result of her tactical decisions. The dice roll (3 and 5) feeds "into her calculations" by assertion only; we see no math, no narrowing, no cost paid for the attempt. Closure renunciation ("no longer chasing a ghost") is told rather than earned by a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake (prove strangers remember kindness) is signaled early but never tested by friction, failure, or competing cost. Elara paints visions methodically; each one confirms her belief without reversal, opposition, or scarcity. The "faster" painting in the climax represents intensity escalation without tactical shift or foreclosed option. No on-page cost—sleep can "wait," implying indefinite deferral rather than sacrifice. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through density or cadence shift; here it repeats confirmation loops.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—rescuing the bread custom—is signaled early and tightens when the beekeeper's honey proves unavailable, forcing Elara's failure loaf and then the lens-inscription breakthrough. The harvest climax narrows options (no beekeeper = find local resource) and the baked bread delivers visible success with cost (years lost, community nearly forgot). Pressure coheres under the causal lens. Weakness: the lens discovery itself is a lucky find rather than a choice under duress, softening escalation's link to protagonist agency. The elders' incomplete memories complicate but don't deeply test Elara's commitment or force a painful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—unraveling fate—is signaled early but never genuinely tested. Elara encounters no meaningful resistance: the stone responds to her touch, the yoyo yields "with a final, precise adjustment," and the clocks comply. There is one tightening when the yoyo's logic unravels, but it arrives without prior failure or cost, reading as inevitability rather than hard-won escalation. The storm gathers but never complicates her work; coincidence ornaments rather than pressures. No live option is foreclosed, no price paid that alters her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—tricking fear to survive—is declared but never tested by a live on-page trade-off. The middle beats (reading the dictionary, confronting the mirror) unfold sequentially without a meaningful reversal or narrowing of options. The climax (throwing the clasp) resolves the problem via an object action rather than protagonist agency; luck and timing replace earned escalation. No visible price paid after the turn alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—protecting the orchard from the wave—is signaled but never feels urgent because the prophet's gift ensures success without trade-off. The "silence predicted by the clouds" is transformed but that obstacle vanishes before applying pressure. No live option is foreclosed; the wave encounter adds complexity to the music without altering the prophet's trajectory or costing him anything legible on the page. Agency defaults to competence display rather than hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the watchers' silence and reconnecting with the lost expedition—is signaled early and tightens when Kaelen discovers the dissonance. Playing the whistle is a meaningful act of agency that narrows options (he could wait, force, or abandon the quest). The cost is legible: the gate stays shut, the city must change its internal stance, and the expedition remains intermediaries. One on-page tightening (dissonance → whistle sequence → vision) is sufficient at this length, though the watchers' passive guardianship keeps external pressure somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—rescuing a scribe's reputation from historical lies—is signaled early and pursued throughout. Pressure remains largely static: Elara examines the letter, recognizes patterns, and discovers the proof without meaningful escalation or tactical cost. The "veritas" clue is a revelation rather than a turn that narrows options or forces a trade-off. No genuine reversal tests her commitment; the parallel-drawing method and final discovery proceed smoothly to completion. The ending offers satisfaction without visible sacrifice or foreclosed alternatives, which limits escalation under the inferred Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—cataloging abandoned dreams—is signaled early but never faces on-page opposition or tightening. Elias completes his method (placing notes) without friction, cost, or adaptation; no reversal or complication tests his commitment. The raised drawbridge is mentioned twice but imposes no time pressure or resource constraint that alters his tactics. Agency at closure reads as completion of a predetermined task rather than a choice that forecloses a path. The piece accumulates texture but lacks escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—tracing honest origins—is signaled early and sustained throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when the alternative hypothesis (palimpsest theory) narrows her search and the hidden drawer opens to reveal contradictory scrolls. Agency is present in her readjustment and methodical stamping, but the escalation is cognitive and accumulative rather than a live trade-off or visible sacrifice. The resolution is earned by her shift in method, yet the cost (rejecting the official narrative) is told more than shown; no immediate price or foreclosed relationship appears on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—reunite with detached shadow—is signaled early but never escalates through genuine pressure. Elara experiences no setback, competing obligation, or resource limit; she completes each step (polish, fold) in linear succession without resistance. The "descends while ascending" sensation is told as torment but does not constrain her movement or force a tactical choice. No reversal or deepening alters options; the shadow simply drifts back when the final crane is folded, a coincidental resolution rather than protagonist-driven closure with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—finding where unused potential pools—is signaled in the opening and drives every beat. The feedback loop is a meaningful tightening: it narrows options (power goes dark) and forces the awakening that redefines the hunt itself. Kaelen's agency is active (he places the geode, initiates the sequence) and the cost at closure is clear: his grief's nature changes but its weight does not lighten. The price is philosophical and emotional, legible in "devastating emptiness filled with terrible, luminous clarity."

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—decoding the frequency—is signaled early. One tightening occurs when the chip produces "garbled" output, forcing recalibration. The lever pull and dome rotation constitute a second beat. Yet both moves feel mechanical; the drone's success is coincidental (it "highlighted a cluster"), and the pilgrim's validation replaces on-page cost. No visible price is paid—Kael gains wholeness without forfeiting an alternative or enduring friction.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—quelling guilt by confronting a withheld truth—is signaled early and sustained through the shore sequence. The single tightening occurs when Elara uncovers the carving she made and recalls the brother's death, narrowing her options to acceptance and a vow to stop fabricating histories. However, the turn is recounted in backstory ("she had tried to forget") rather than dramatized as a present reversal that forces a visible trade-off. The cost (no more false memories) is declared but not tested on the page, and coincidence (finding the exact carving) enables rather than complicates the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—successful prisoner exchange and Elara's redemption from past failure—is signaled early but never genuinely tested. The negotiation proceeds smoothly from Elara's opening gambit to Kael's agreement without a credible complication, refusal, or cost that narrows options. Kael's revelation about his brother is a micro-turn, but it does not force Elara into a trade-off or alter her tactics; she simply continues her prepared approach. The resolution feels pre-ordained rather than earned through protagonist agency under pressure, and no visible price is paid that alters the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—completing the voyage to align heart and action—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the wave tips the kayak and the compass is lost, forcing Kael to rely solely on utility poles. This narrows options and escalates the cost of continuing. Agency is present: he chooses to launch, to persist, and to accept the humble method. The resolution is earned by his renunciation of the broken tool. However, the escalation is more summarized than dramatized in high-pressure beats, and the price (lost compass, collapsed expectations) is told rather than shown through incompatible tradeoffs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—kindling empathy—is signaled early but never tested by a live trade-off or visible price. Leo's journey involves reading clues, descending, stepping onto a path, and throwing the ball, yet none of these acts narrows his options or costs him something tangible. The climax (speaking to his reflection, the lake changing) happens to him rather than because of a protagonist choice that forecloses an alternative. No on-page reversal or tightening forces Leo to sacrifice or endure with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake (reforge bond with Kael) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: to cross the bridge, Elara must accept permanent metamorphosis, narrowing her options. The cost (loss of human form) is visible and forecloses return. However, the peak choice is not contested on the page—no rival desire or fear creates friction at the moment of transformation. The afterlife reunion with Kael proceeds without complication; his form solidifies without trade-off or sacrifice from either party, deflating the anticipated cost.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—finding where lost time accumulates and seeking cloudbound repentance—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs when the saucer crack becomes a gateway and Elara sees fragments of her past, narrowing her quest to an act of weaving. However, the escalation feels more like symbolic revelation than a tightening that forecloses a live option; she never faces a trade-off or renunciation with visible cost. The resolution is asserted ("peace settle over her") rather than earned through a protagonist choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—opening the locked dimension—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through repeated attempts (holding photographs, focusing shimmer through the tear), but no on-page reversal narrows her options or forces a trade-off. The piece presents a single long effort rather than a tightening choice; the door resists, then yields to her "final, immense effort of will" without visible sacrifice or tactics shift. Agency reads as endurance, yet the cost of that endurance (what path is foreclosed, what price paid) remains abstract. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification would suffice, but the climax delivers assertion over dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding transformation—is signaled early but never tested by genuine opposition or trade-off. Releasing the lightning bugs is framed as mystical fulfillment rather than a choice that forecloses an alternate path; no visible price is paid (she gains peace, the volcano awakens gently, and she walks on "lighter"). The prophecy and celestial alignment resolve her poverty without protagonist escalation or agency-driven tightening. Pressure is declared ("vibrant energy," "resonant rumble") but not dramatized through narrowed options or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—sparking the revolution—is signaled early but never tested. The blackout complicates the guards' awareness but does not narrow Elara's options; she "had practiced this very maneuver in her mind a hundred times," so the night unfolds as rehearsed success rather than escalation. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; each step confirms the plan. The ending declares the revolution "inevitable" and "underway" but locates the consequence ("others would find the pamphlets") off-page, forfeiting the on-page cost required for meaningful escalation. Agency consists of flawless execution, not a choice that forecloses a path with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—deciphering sacred patterns to restore balance—is clear early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Kaelen realizes a rock is misplaced, raising cost via his precognitive countdown. However, the resolution is a straightforward success: energy harnessed, patterns understood, curse lifted. No live option is foreclosed; the final state is additive (comprehension gained) without visible loss or renunciation, leaving escalation coherent but cost clarity weak.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—decoding scars into uncensored poetry—is declared but never tested by a reversal or tightening that narrows options. Elara writes a poem offstage (we see only "words began to flow"), so the central action lacks dramatization. The stranger's arrival is pure coincidence, resolving the vigil without protagonist agency. No visible price is paid; the ending asserts transformation ("she was silenced no more") without showing what Elara sacrificed or risked to earn it.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—decoding the sundial to determine duel terms—is signaled early but resolved via convenient mechanism (needle insertion → compartment opens) rather than protagonist struggle. The fencing itself is pure metaphor ("each strike a syllogism") with no tactical escalation, traded blows, or visible cost. The final "disarmament" via scroll revelation tells us the true destination was "understanding," but this is asserted rather than earned through narrowed options or a choice that forecloses a path. Under a Causal lens, the sundial puzzle lacks because/therefore linkage to the duel; under Accumulative, the philosophical motifs do not tighten or deepen with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—rebuilding the library as a "sanctuary" for "blooming resistance"—is signaled early but never tightened or tested. No reversal, obstacle, or competing pressure forces a tradeoff. The action of sorting and stacking books proceeds without friction; even Elara's personality molt, which could introduce internal conflict, is described as "no longer a burden" and integrated smoothly. The ending restates commitment without visible cost or foreclosed alternative. Under the Accumulative lens, a cadence shift or deepening that narrows options is required; here the pressure remains static from opening to close.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—escape the collapsing arbor before the storm—is signaled early and tightens once when the compasses "flared bright, a warning that the equilibrium was shattering." That single reversal narrows options and forces the film-escape attempt. However, the escalation is thin: Elian executes his plan without friction, the film door swings open on cue, and he steps through without dramatized cost or competing pulls. The final performance in the ballroom is described as "wild, and unscripted," but we don't see what price that improvisation exacts or what concrete option it forecloses. Agency at closure is present but not tested by meaningful resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake (protect cultural memory before the monsoon) is signaled early but never tightened through a reversal or meaningful choice. Elara encounters no opposition, makes no trade-offs, and pays no visible price—the tree bends "whimsically," the fruits are harvested swiftly, and the sanctuary is reached with ease. The monsoon's arrival is mentioned in the final paragraph but does not test the protagonist on the page. Agency is absent; coincidence and convenience drive every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—finding the color of unspoken apologies—is declared but never tested through a meaningful tightening or trade-off. Kaelen's walk with the compass does not narrow options or force a decision; the locket simply appears. The final "diffusion" of regret reads as emotional summary without visible cost or foreclosed path. Escalation depends on Elian's teaching rather than protagonist agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake of giving rest a permanent address escalates through Elijah's agency under causal lens: journey to coast, submersible descent, and lens repair each narrow options and deepen knowledge. Cost is legible in his days of research and trembling hands, culminating in a trade-off that forecloses other paths. Pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully, though the distress signals' introduction could be earlier for fuller integration.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are clearly signaled—stealing the portrait to listen to destiny—and escalate meaningfully through protagonist agency, like reinterpreting flower codes and using moonbeams for escape. Cost is legible on the page with the jar nearly empty and danger imminent. The dominant stake tightens with each turn, but the trap feels slightly contrived, limiting peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (crafting safe zones) escalates under the accumulative lens through the thaw and Elara's agency, culminating in her decision to leave. Cost is legible in the forfeiture of the sphere and bookmark, foreclosing a path. Pressure coheres without coincidence, and one meaningful tightening occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—proving vulnerability is power—escalates through Leo's agency in decrypting notes and confronting Silas. A meaningful tightening occurs as fear transforms into strength, with cost unmistakable in the climax. Pressure coheres under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are clear (creating the map), and escalation occurs under the Accumulative lens through density of silence summarization, but cost is mild and agency lacks a decisive trade-off; no reversal tightens options significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes in finding thought origins escalate under accumulative lens via density increase in timelines; agency in violin use drives tightening, with cost legible in embracing fragility.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes of mistrust escalate through Elara's agency in investigating tickets and projecting images. A meaningful tightening occurs when Marco confesses, with cost visible in their emotional relief. Driven by causal lens without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake of proving care over luck escalates through Elara's agency in mending deceptions and demonstrating to visitors, with cost legible in her devotion. However, escalation under the accumulative lens relies on density rather than causal tightening, limiting the score.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation driven by Kael's agency in pulling the lever, leading to holographic revelation with unmistakable cost in altered relationships and understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake of unraveling the code escalates through Elara's agency under the causal lens; cost is unmistakable in the ghost's release, and one meaningful tightening forecloses options with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the accumulative lens, with one meaningful tightening as she correlates the Bloom's cycle to weather patterns. Cost is legible in her acceptance of imperfection ("the weight of reality"). The dominant stake (certainty vs. unpredictability) deepens through her actions, satisfying the 9+ quick test with unmistakable on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes escalate through Kaelen's agency in discovering the valve and interpreting the radio confession, tightening under causal pressure. Cost is unmistakable in the "profound hush" and relief, foreclosing options with a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven by the keeper's agency under the accumulative lens, from restlessness to peace, with cost legible in the release of reality. The stake of internal conflict tightens meaningfully, though it lacks multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clear with nurturing wonder as the dominant stake, escalating through the eclipse and music under the accumulative lens. Elara's agency drives the shift in Leo, with cost legible in the cautious exuberance and renewed connection.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is driven by Elian's agency under the accumulative lens, from probing archives to decoding the tapestry and activating the device. The dominant stake of restoring stories tightens meaningfully, with cost visible in the axis realignment and the cessation of new dreams. No coincidental resolutions; pressure coheres to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stakes of personal liberation and purpose escalate through protagonist agency, such as Elara orchestrating the encounter and Leo decoding the microdot. Cost is legible in their shift from shadows to collaborative light. Pressure tightens meaningfully under the causal lens, though the escalation is somewhat linear.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven by Father Elian's agency through rhetorical devices, tightening stakes until the entity's assumption is exposed. Cost is unmistakable in the fragmentation and amplified silence, under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are signaled early (conducting before exhaustion); escalation is driven by agency under the accumulative lens, with memory mapping increasing density. Cost is legible as she pushes through fatigue, narrowing options meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation is driven by Kaelen's agency under the causal lens, with each rune activation narrowing options and increasing cost, culminating in the painful integration. The dominant stake of self-conquest is signaled early and tightens through his choices, such as rejecting the eternally young self. Cost is unmistakable in the on-page suffering during timeline merging.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the accumulative/textural lens, as she chooses to play the backward recordings, deepening the stake of emotional numbness. The cost is legible in her physical sensations and tears, foreclosing her path of numbness. However, the pressure coheres through density increase rather than causal tightening, slightly limiting peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake of exposing truth escalates through Elara's agency: receiving the message, cross-referencing data, and collaborating. Cost is felt in her foregone solitude, tightening options under causal pressure. The follower's reveal complicates but doesn't resolve, maintaining earned progression.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.5)
    Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the accumulative lens: adjusting the UV lantern and uncorking the vial intensify stakes toward the pollen's revelation. Cost is legible in her grief-turned-awe, narrowing options and foreclosing her avoidance. One meaningful tightening suffices, with protagonist choices altering knowledge and emotional stance.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake is Elian's internal conflict between preserving his past or freeing the beings; escalation is driven by his agency in realizing the beings' pain and choosing sacrifice. Under the Accumulative lens, the pattern break reweights stakes with unmistakable cost—the loss of memories. No coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under the accumulative lens, escalation is driven by Elara's agency in unbinding echoes and reviving tradition, with a meaningful tightening that reweights stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding lost time—escalates under the accumulative lens through Elara's agency, like pressing her palm and weaving the thread, narrowing options. Cost is unmistakable in the "choking beauty" and foreclosed path of regret. One meaningful tightening occurs as the crack widens, revealing fragments of the past, and resolution is earned by her alteration.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clearly signaled as opening the locked dimension, with escalation driven by Elara's agency in stitching the light and confronting shadows. Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through density of emotion and pattern-weaving, culminating in a cost legible as she crosses over. However, the escalation relies heavily on internal process rather than external turns, slightly limiting tension.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation under the Accumulative/Textural lens is driven by Elara's agency in releasing the bugs, leading to the volcano's awakening and her internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency in rebuilding, with cost legible in their dedication and the foreclosed path of cynicism.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Aris will cling to human-scale drama or surrender to a process-based view of change—is legible but very low-conflict. There is a gentle deepening through her repeated visits and attention to dust patterns, but no marked escalation or true test of her stance; internal and external pressures never truly force a trade-off. The resolution feels earned conceptually yet comes without a sharp narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding why she was targeted and what to do with that knowledge—is clear but plays out almost entirely as internal deduction rather than pressured choice. Deciding to transform the experience into art instead of revenge is a real internal turn, but it’s not weighed against vivid, concrete alternatives or consequences. External conflict (smugglers, rival) sits offstage; no new danger or constraint presses her in the canyon scene. As a result, escalation feels modest and mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can transform her mute, traumatic world into a personal form of “music”—is signaled early and maintained. Pressure escalates modestly through the choice to map specifically the capsizing memory, with its layered emotions, and then to reinterpret her failure and grief via repeated, silent “strikes” of the fork. However, conflict remains almost entirely internal and relatively static; there’s little sense of a live alternative path or a risk of failure beyond continuing emptiness, so the turns read as deepening rather than genuinely tightening. The final stance is earned, but the journey lacks a sharper test or sacrifice that would foreground cost.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring the beacon so lost souls can find peace, aligning with Elijah’s life mission—is clear and coherent. Pressure escalates in a mild, linear way (journey, exploration, research, precise reconstruction), culminating in a single concentrated task in the impossible chamber. However, there is little active opposition or genuine risk beyond endurance, and he never seriously confronts the possibility of failure or sacrifice beyond effort and age. The dream-delivered solution undercuts potential tension, keeping the conflict functional but not gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stakes—survival under sanctions and the community’s cohesion—are clearly established, but they are never directly pressured in scene by concrete opposition. The midnight runs go off without incident, and no authority, scarcity spike, or internal dissent forces an acute dilemma or trade-off. The main turn is Elara’s decision to “declare” a future-building stance, which is thematically significant but not dramatically forced by escalating conflict. As a result, tension remains low and largely conceptual rather than felt as narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.3)
    The central stake—finding where unused love is stored and healing the resulting ache—is clear, but pressure is gentle and largely internal. Once the tear appears, every step works on the first try; there’s no meaningful obstacle, reversal, or trade-off as she moves from discovery to mass release of the strands. Her agency is present (choosing to reach in, to channel the tear, to continue along the viaduct), yet these choices never threaten loss or failure. The conflict thus remains more meditative than tense, limiting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.8)
    The main stake—escaping the retrocognitive prison—is well signaled, and the disintegration of the bridge is a visible turning point. Yet escalation is fairly linear and low-friction: Elara experiments, has an epiphany, acts, and succeeds, with no real risk that her efforts will worsen her condition or fail. Her internal conflict (desire to understand time vs. the pain of being trapped in it) is gestured at but not sharply tested in the climax. The result is a conflict that is conceptually rich but emotionally and dramatically modest.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—freeing the seeds to transform dead land—is clear and signaled early, and there is one central tightening when the guard appears as she decodes the keys. However, opposition is underpowered: the guard is dispatched in a single smooth move and no subsequent complication truly narrows her options or forces a trade-off. Much of the “forces will impede her” tension is asserted rather than dramatized. As a result, escalation plateaus quickly and the outcome never feels genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—capturing the sound of trust breaking to transform pain—is clear, but on-page pressure is relatively low and abstract. The main complication (overwhelming aurora colors “screaming in her ears”) is atmospheric rather than a true obstacle that forces different tactics. Escalation occurs mainly through reiterated effort and introspection rather than a concrete reversal or narrowing of options. Her eventual success carries limited visible cost, making the arc emotionally meaningful but dramatically soft.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—steal the destiny-charged portrait without being caught—is clear from early on and escalates coherently with the black-orchid warning and blocked exits. Her choice to stay with the portrait despite the danger, and then spend the last moonbeams on the flowers rather than the prize, gives the conflict a concrete pivot and a visible price. Still, the external danger remains somewhat abstract (guards never personally bear down on her), so dread never fully peaks. The result is strong, elegant tension rather than severe pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she can genuinely create and inhabit imperfect “safe zones” rather than prisons of control—is present but operates mostly as internal stance rather than concrete dilemma. The main turns (accepting the flawed sphere, choosing to leave the room and objects behind) feel thematically apt but not heavily pressured by new complications or sharpened costs within the scene. Conflict remains largely static meditation; there’s little sense that a real alternative path (retreating back to perfectionism, clinging to the control room) is live and then foreclosed on the page. As a result, tension is steady but rarely intensifies.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.8)
    Conflict is clearly framed—Leo versus Silas’ manipulative trap, plus the ethical pressure of protecting Eli—and the code-breaking beat is a solid tightening that changes his options. Internal stakes (redefining his fears) and external stakes (surviving and outwitting Silas) interweave. However, escalation flattens at the climax: once Leo understands the trap, there is no further reversal or difficult trade-off, and Silas is “confounded” largely by declaration. The resolution feels low-cost and low-friction relative to the emotional and thematic stakes the opening promises.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—creating the map to guide lost souls—is clearly articulated, but on the page it never faces genuine resistance. The only gestures toward cost are physical (chill, weariness) and are easily brushed aside without consequence or adaptation. There is no real escalation; once she begins, the booklet cooperates and the process proceeds smoothly to success. As a result, tension stays low and the ending, while graceful, feels preordained rather than earned under mounting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—J-7’s need to understand the origin of its thoughts—is clear, and the attempt to amalgamate multiple selves into one stream provides a conceptual arc. Yet the conflict is almost entirely internal and highly abstract, with no strong opposing force beyond vague fragility and cold; the experiment works on first try without meaningful resistance or risk. The crescendo of the violin and the weaving of timelines suggest escalation in tone, but options never truly narrow nor is a concrete price extracted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.3)
    The central stake—Elara’s reputation and the staff’s trust—is clear, and her choice to go public with the evidence marks a genuine, if gentle, escalation. Still, conflict feels relatively low-friction: Marco steps out and confesses almost immediately, with no competing agenda or serious pushback from others. The story leans heavily on explanation (tickets decoded, intentions clarified) rather than forcing a painful trade-off or real risk. As a result, tension rises modestly but never tightens to a truly fraught moment.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—proving the maze responds to care rather than luck—is articulated, but almost never meaningfully threatened. Skeptics appear, yet offer no real resistance; the devices flicker, and her thesis is simply confirmed. Most “conflicts” (redirecting a stubborn vine, mending a deception) are summarized as already-resolved small victories rather than dramatized crisis points. There is minimal escalation or felt price, keeping the pressure flat.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—will Kael’s theory be validated during this narrow window—is clear, and the lever pull offers a modest tightening. Yet the pressure remains largely intellectual and comfortable; failure would mean disappointment, not a meaningful loss on the page, and the Mothraals’ potential to disturb fields is mentioned but never felt as a live threat. Once the hologram stabilizes, the resolution arrives without resistance or reversal. Conflict is functional but gentle, limiting dramatic impact.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central stake—decoding the ghost’s composition to break his stagnation and, secondarily, renew her own artistic drive—is clear but emotionally low-pressure. There is some escalation: from quiet exploration to the ghost’s appearance to the decisive act of violently disrupting the water. However, Elara faces little risk, opposition, or genuine dilemma; once the pattern is recognized, the solution flows without meaningful trade-offs or the sense that another harmful outcome is possible. The conflict remains contemplative rather than tense, which limits the category’s ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will cling to brittle certainty or adopt a fault-tolerant embrace of error—is signaled early and resolved clearly. Pressure escalates modestly through her decision to unpin the illustration, notice the insect, and re-examine correlations, culminating in her updating predictions with a new method. The main cost is conceptual and emotional: surrendering the comfort of believing her work can fully tame nature. The conflict is largely internal and quiet, so while it is coherent and earns its turn, it never sharpens into a truly gripping crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the hidden truth behind the town’s industrial “ghost”—is clearly signaled and resolved. Pressure escalates as sounds intensify, the uncanny radio content sharpens, and the confession locks into the physical valve in his hand, narrowing interpretive options. The on-page “cost” is mostly conceptual/emotional rather than personally risky; Kaelen is rarely in genuine danger or forced into a wrenching choice. This keeps the conflict effective but somewhat low-temperature for elite literary suspense.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the keeper can sustain their role without being crushed by accumulated decay—is present but largely conceptual. The only escalation is the initial restlessness and the decision to seek refuge; the journey itself is frictionless, without real obstacle, trade-off, or narrowed options. As a result, the ending reads as a gentle deepening rather than a pressured stance crystallized at visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can rekindle Leo’s sense of wonder—is clear but faces almost no resistance. The eclipse arrives as a benevolent backdrop rather than a complicating force, and Leo’s shift from withdrawn to open happens smoothly once the music and curl are introduced. There is a small tightening as totality approaches and Leo’s “trembling breath” shapes the music, but no real alternative outcome or sacrifice is felt. As a result, pressure never truly escalates; the piece reads as a foregone gentle success story.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—recovering stories/dream-capacity after a cosmological catastrophe—is intriguing but remains almost entirely conceptual. There is no real opposition on the page: Elian’s probing yields exactly what he needs, the tapestry decodes without friction, and the device works on first activation. The escalation is intellectual (deeper understanding of the axis shift) rather than dramatized pressure that narrows his options or forces costly trade-offs, so the conflict feels static despite the grand stakes claimed.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.8)
    The nominal stakes—exposing a spy ring, clearing Leo’s name, and risking the hidden network’s retaliation—are high, but they remain almost entirely abstract. There are no genuine obstacles or reversals: each step (Leo noticing the microdot, decoding, traveling, teaming up, finding the cache) happens cleanly and successfully. Internal conflict is similarly underdeveloped; neither character seems to risk anything concrete when they commit. Pressure never really tightens, so the climax feels like a summary of a successful plan rather than an earned turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central conflict—Elian versus the possessing force—is clear, and the stakes (the anchor’s integrity) are well signaled early. Escalation occurs as he layers more complex rhetorical devices and the entity visibly destabilizes, with the final question about silence and substance providing a discernible turning point. Yet the opposition never takes a concrete counteraction; there’s no reversal or moment where his approach nearly fails, so pressure grows more by accumulation than by hard choices or losses. As a result, the resolution feels somewhat assured rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.8)
    The core stake—complete the symphony before exhaustion and resolve her temporal homesickness—is clear from early on, and there is a faint time-pressure as dawn approaches and her eyelids grow heavy. However, tension escalates more by repetition and accumulation than by clear reversals or sharply narrowing options; there is no moment where failure feels truly imminent. The cracking lake and pulsing shell add sensory intensity rather than new pressure. The resolution is earned but relatively low-friction, with limited on-page cost beyond fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—integrating fractured selves to end the cyclical, periodically eternal suffering—is clear from early on. There is nominal escalation via increasingly distorted timelines, darkening brightness, and the painful stitching at the center platform. However, obstacles stay conceptual; there are no sharply rendered moments where he might truly fail or choose a worse alternative, so pressure feels muted. The cost of integration is asserted (“each integration felt like a part of him dying”) but not deeply dramatized in specific, escalating beats.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—can Elara break through emotional numbness and reconnect with music—is clear early and remains coherent. Pressure escalates primarily through intensification of sensation and memory during the backward playback and the drums’ sympathetic response, culminating in her tears and new teaching stance. However, resistance is modest: once Kael proposes the backward method, nothing truly obstructs her; she doesn’t significantly waver or risk backsliding on the page. The cost (reopening pain) is there but could be sharpened with one more moment of real hesitation or potential refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story sets up personal and systemic stakes—Elara’s safety vs. exposing a rogue, weapon-concealing quarantine zone—but on-page pressure stays mild. The follower’s return and gate rustle promise confrontation, yet the tension collapses almost instantly into alliance with no real test or hard trade-off. Escalation is largely informational (connecting data, revelations) rather than situational or moral, and we never see a concrete price paid beyond implied risk. As a result, the conflict feels resolved more by convenient alignment than by a difficult, narrowing choice.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is Elara’s need to understand her reactions to scent, with a secondary external stake in aiding the Lumina Blossom’s preservation. There is one meaningful escalation when she opens the vial, triggering grief and the pollen’s response; this beat reweights both her inner question and the external process. However, the “critical phase” never introduces real risk of failure for the plant or her task, and her internal struggle yields quickly to revelation without much sustained tension. As a result, conflict feels contained and gently resolved rather than sharply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—preserve his own history vs. sacrifice it to free the beings—is clear and sharpened effectively once he recognizes their pain and the rope’s potential. Escalation is mostly internal but real: his earlier escape dilemma is recalled to intensify the new “impossible choice,” and the beings’ dimming light provides a simple ticking pressure. However, the transition from aesthetic observation to “their light patterns were a distress signal” is a bit abrupt, undercutting some visceral tension by telling us their state rather than forcing Elian (and us) to infer it more gradually. The cost is unmistakable at the end, but one more concrete consequence or moment of hesitation could heighten perceived stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can transform oppressive silence into something livable and meaningful—is clear but remains mostly internal and abstract. Escalation is mild: “one night, she built a bonfire” functions as a simple next step rather than a hard-won or risky move under pressure. There is no real counterforce, setback, or visible cost beyond implied grief, so her agency is not meaningfully tested. The piece operates more as a meditative vignette than as a conflict-driven story.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is internal—whether Elara will continue dealing in counterfeit emotions or embrace genuine empathy—and it is clearly signaled. Pressure deepens when the real sorrow of the grotto undercuts the counterfeit happiness, pushing her toward a choice. However, escalation remains relatively gentle and abstract; there is little sense of risk, opposing desire, or tangible consequence if she rejects change. The “transformation” is repeatedly asserted rather than put under stress by a concrete test or trade-off, which keeps the stakes from fully biting.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is extremely soft: once Elara finds the envelope, everything unfolds without resistance—she traces Anya, visits her, organizes events, and the community responds positively. There are no obstacles, trade-offs, or genuine risks that might complicate her goal to uplift unsung contributors. Emotional or ethical tension is absent; everyone is uniformly kind and receptive. As a result, stakes feel abstract and the escalation reads more like a list of pleasant developments than mounting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s desire to belong—is legible from the outset, and the search offers a functional external frame for it. There is some escalation via days of failure and the tension of whether the tag will be found, but there’s little sense that Elara risks true rejection or loss; the others never push back or doubt her. Her agency drives the climax (spotting and calling out the tag), yet the resolution feels granted, not hard-won. The lack of a meaningful trade-off or visible cost keeps the conflict band modest.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—freeing imprisoned echoes before the giant wakes and time runs out—is stated clearly and followed through causally. There is a visible tightening as she starts borrowing time, the world stutters, and the sense of a finite reservoir grows. Yet the danger of failure stays conceptual: we’re told of balance and cadence, but no concrete harm or sacrifice looms if she doesn’t succeed, so tension never fully peaks. The aging and brief world-lurch are real but gentle prices, keeping conflict and stakes solid but not gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Elian can transform his grief-driven quest for a “math of emotion” into something that yields meaning—is present, but conflict is largely internal and low-friction. His experiments progress without setbacks, competing goals, or difficult trade-offs; the feedback loop works on the first try and produces Lyra’s image as a near-gift. The key tightening is his realization that integration, not solution, is the goal, yet this turn doesn’t force him to relinquish something concrete on the page. As a result, tension feels contemplative rather than truly pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.9)
    Conflict and stakes stay very gentle: the outage provides mild urgency, but Kaelen faces almost no meaningful opposition, risk, or real possibility of failure. His internal want (to become visible) never truly rubs against a cost beyond remaining unseen physically. Escalation is signaled via flickering lights and time pressure, yet the path from finding to playing the tape is smooth, with no reversal or hard choice. The result is pleasant but low-tension, which limits impact at this publication standard.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara clings to control or allows a new, more adaptive philosophy—is clear, and the storm serves as credible external pressure. There is one main tightening beat when she releases the leaf and chooses to observe rather than restrain the tree, which functions as the hinge. However, tension stays fairly even; resistance and fear are described but not deeply dramatized through setbacks or more agonized choice, so the sense of risk and price is muted. The conflict feels authentic but somewhat pre-resolved in tone, limiting sharper escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is existential—finding meaning and connection after environmental and social collapse—which is clear but softly pressured. The main escalation is his decision to follow the rain into the island’s interior, then to engage with Elara and accept her exchange, which deepens emotional stakes. There is little real resistance or reversal; Elara is sympathetic, and the world does not actively push back, so tension never tightens much beyond contemplative curiosity. The resolution feels emotionally satisfying but lightly tested.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes center on whether everyday magic can be amplified safely and meaningfully, and whether Kaelen can function without reliable foresight, but the conflict remains extremely gentle. The “unseen forces” are explicitly “not malevolent,” which removes much potential danger; unpredictability is framed almost exclusively as wonder. The main tightening is Elara using the pearl and triggering the rain/shadow escalation, but no real option is foreclosed or hard trade-off forced. As a result, tension is modest and never approaches the pressure expected for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—restoring communal connection and meaning after exile—is clear, but the opposing pressures are soft: wary looks and generalized despair rather than concrete resistance or risk. Elara’s work proceeds without serious obstacles; the investigation never truly imperils her standing or forces a hard trade-off. The climax (ceremony and revelation) lands, yet it feels more like a gentle unveiling than the culmination of escalating pressure. As a result, tension is present but modest and rarely sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—reaching the fortress of unspoken truths and confronting what lies there—is clearly signaled, but the story offers almost no resistance to that aim. Following the arrows works flawlessly, the vault opens on first attempt, and the central sphere yields to a single, unopposed use of the punch; there’s no genuine dilemma or visible cost. Internal and external conflict never truly bite against each other, so tension plateaus rather than escalates. As a result, the climax reads more like a ritual completion than a pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stakes—whether Elara can transform arcane, possibly superstitious lore into a real tool of solace for the villagers—are present but remain largely abstract. Once the tile activates, there is minimal resistance: no fear of harm, no social or emotional pushback, and no scenario in which she might fail or pay a sharper price. The “pressure” mainly takes the form of a deadline before the migration peaks, yet this never meaningfully narrows her options or forces a difficult trade-off. As a result, escalation is gentle and meditative rather than tense, limiting the felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—piercing the mystery of “after goodbye” at the risk of unleashing the amulet—is clear and the mutiny escalates from subtle warp to full dimensional vortex. Pressure does intensify when Kaelen realizes the fragment has its own will and that his experiment is a trap, leading to his decision to channel the magnetic fields through himself. However, tension is dampened by his near-total lack of fear and by the relative safety of the outcome: the world does not visibly suffer, and his immortality remains intact, so the external cost feels conceptually large but viscerally modest. The battle reads more as a narrated inevitability than as a sequence of hard choices.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Leo preserving his honesty while saving his father—is clear and conceptually rich, and the shift from planning a physical breach to executing a mental one is a meaningful tightening. Yet on-page pressure is relatively soft: Leo’s “active waiting” and calculations are summarized, and the crucial confrontation with the chief resolves with minimal resistance once the ink pot is in play. We never see a credible near-failure, sacrifice, or serious cost; the father’s survival feels secure as soon as the plan is enacted. As a result, tension flattens instead of escalating sharply through the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—Elian’s commitment to preserving ephemeral temporal textures—is intriguing but remains largely conceptual, with little concrete opposition. Pressure only gently tightens as dawn approaches and the hum shifts; no option is truly foreclosed or contested on the page. This works for a lyric piece but limits felt tension and the sense of escalating cost.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—recovering his erased history—is clear early and steadily tightened by the discovery of the arsenic label and subsequent targeted listening. Conflict is largely internal and investigative, culminating in a conceptual reweighting rather than an external confrontation. There’s a genuine emotional price at the end (“a man with a past but no future”), but few on-page choices where he must trade one value against another. The escalation feels coherent yet somewhat low-pressure, leaning more on revelation than on tested agency.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Elara can “decode” the universal riddle and find peace with her life’s work—is clear, but on-page escalation is gentle and mostly internal. The main tightening is her decision to retell the story via the cello, which gradually leads to reframing the riddle, rather than any hard trade-off or foreclosed path dramatized in scene. Conflict remains largely reflective, with few moments where a live alternative (continue seeking vs accept ending) is palpably at stake. This keeps the piece meditative but limits tension and perceived cost.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—community survival vs privatization/gentrification—is clear, and Elara’s strategy to reorganize resistance via graffiti gives her agency. However, pressure doesn’t markedly tighten within the scene; the deadline “looms,” the ships draw closer, but her options never seem to narrow or force a genuine trade-off. The internal and external conflicts align, yet there’s no hard test of her dual allegiance or a visible price paid for her tactic beyond generalized strain. This results in a relatively static conflict profile for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving the last image of Cassini’s Tear before corporate obliteration—is signaled early and remains coherent. The countdown via shifting vials provides a formal tightening, but the pressure never truly escalates beyond waiting; nothing tests her resolve or introduces a real risk of failure. Her agency consists mainly of preparation and follow-through, with no significant trade-offs or foreclosed alternatives besides the background inevitability of mining. As a result, the tension is largely conceptual and atmospheric rather than dynamically dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—if the drone isn’t fixed, the Aethel may stray into dangerous waters—is stated clearly and early. Time pressure via the lifting anchor and distant machinery hum provides a notional escalation, but Elara encounters no genuine setback or hard trade-off; the patch works on first attempt. Internal and external conflicts don’t really rub against each other; her calm competence is never tested. As a result, tension feels gentle and steady rather than building toward a truly pressurized peak.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can locate the rivers’ origin and what that means for his lifelong quest—is clear, but the pressure remains mostly internal and low-grade. The main escalation is intellectual: decoding the condensation and phrasebook, then committing to walk onto the frozen lake, which he does without serious risk or opposition on the page. His nagging worry about the discovery’s ultimate significance surfaces, but it doesn’t sharpen into a difficult trade-off or foreclose a path beyond “this is one chapter.” The result is a compelling mood piece with underpowered dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—restoring balance and preventing another collapse—is articulated, but pressure on that stake never meaningfully tightens. There is no real antagonistic force or credible possibility of failure; every step of the ritual works as intended. Elian never has to choose between competing goods or costs, so his agency feels procedural rather than embattled. As a result, tension remains low even at the supposed climax.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stakes—capture the hush vs the ticking oxygen clock and survival instinct—are well signaled and coherently maintained. The key pressure point is his choice to work the mechanism slowly and then to enter the hush instead of fleeing, which narrows his options. Yet escalation feels linear and somewhat safe: there’s little genuine loss or tactical adaptation, and everything crucial succeeds on first try, softening the bite of the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (reaching the beacon and rewriting the prison before the bodies are found) is signaled early and remains coherent. Escalation comes via his deeper narrative offerings to the labyrinth, the spectral wardens’ hovering presence, and the tightening time pressure as shouts rise from below. However, obstacles yield relatively smoothly—wardens never truly threaten him, and the labyrinth does not seriously resist once he offers stories—so the sense of potential failure and concrete price is muted. The resolution is clearly driven by his agency, but his success feels almost too frictionless for the scale of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.8)
    The core stake—whether she can repay the debt and be freed, and whether he can bear that loss—is clear, but it faces little concrete resistance. “Time running out” and increasingly frequent visits hint at pressure, yet nothing on the page threatens failure once the bead is offered, and Elian barely hesitates. Her offer, his touch of the bead, and her dissolution form a solid single turn, but there is no difficult trade-off or reversal forced by their decisions. The result is emotionally gentle, with modest tension rather than true escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring a ruined sacred labyrinth—is clear, but the story offers almost no resistance: the labyrinth “accepts her,” her method works smoothly, and there is no opposing force, doubt, or real risk of failure. The only tightening is spatial/ritual: reaching the central chamber where ruin is greatest and beginning “in earnest.” Without reversals or hard trade-offs, tension stays low and largely conceptual rather than felt. The final success, while thematically apt, doesn’t seem to cost her anything substantial on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—restoring a lost faith/connection—is legible early and ties directly to the excavation and sundial restoration. The main escalation is informational rather than pressurized: each discovery deepens understanding but does not sharply narrow options or force sacrifice. There’s no real opposition, time pressure, or internal conflict testing how far Elara will go for this goal, so tension stays gentle and meditative. As a result, the resolution feels thematically apt but not hard-won in terms of conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—ensuring the safe passage and correct coding of a potentially pivotal letter—is stated but never truly tested on the page. There are no obstacles, reversals, or trade-offs; every step of her task proceeds as planned. The only “tightening” is her realization that Orion’s identity might be compromised, but this doesn’t change her tactics or force a harder choice. As a result, tension remains largely conceptual, and the scene reads as a procedural vignette rather than a pressured conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.7)
    The core conflict—Elara’s need to uncover and act on a conspiracy vs her need to remain invisible—is well established and escalates meaningfully. Stakes move from abstract (“coup everyone feared”) to concrete (hidden garden meeting, identified guard conspirator, imminent danger once she’s noticed). The captain’s appearance sharpens external pressure and forces a real trade-off, culminating in her risky decision to plunge the observatory into darkness. Escalation is solid but could be intensified by one more on-page complication or a clearer immediate consequence of blowing out the candle.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether she will forgive or be “consumed” by silence—is clear and develops as she moves deeper, with each message sharpening her understanding of Kaelen’s fear. The main escalation is cognitive/emotional rather than event-driven, culminating in the decisive leaf message that flips agency to her. Still, the opposition is relatively gentle: the story rarely makes clinging to hurt feel like a live, tempting option with concrete consequence in the scene. As a result, the price of choosing forgiveness is felt but not as sharply contested as it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.4)
    The core stake—whether Elara can reframe shared trauma into something bearable and meaningful—is clear, and the decoding of the cast provides a sequence of small internal turns. The pressure does deepen as each symbol is reinterpreted, culminating in the final drawing of two figures holding hands and the resulting “quiet catharsis.” However, conflict remains almost entirely internal and contemplative, with little sense of real risk to her stance beyond sadness; the progression feels more like steady deepening than a true tightening that forecloses options. This keeps the piece strong but not gripping on a stakes level.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can reconnect with joy through recovering the district’s past—is clear from early on. There is one meaningful tightening when the fragment responds to the light and a full phantom orchard blooms, forcing her to confront whether joy is escapist illusion or reclamation. However, opposition is almost entirely absent; nothing resists her efforts, and success carries limited on-page risk or sacrifice beyond the ephemeral nature of the vision. The result is emotionally pleasant but relatively low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara clings to mastery or yields to curiosity—is present but largely abstract, with minimal on-page friction. The garden’s responses are uniformly welcoming; there is no serious threat, conflicting desire, or alternative path that feels meaningfully live. Escalation exists texturally (more intense sound, more layers revealed, garden’s consciousness stirring) but not as true tightening that forces a costly trade-off. Her final choice to embrace curiosity reads as a natural continuation rather than a pressured test of values.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—protecting the secret garden ciphers and avoiding cognitive tax enforcement—is clearly articulated early and escalates with the misaligned roses, garden scans, and finally the enforcers bursting in. Elara’s agency drives the main turns (rattle signal, reinforcing seeds, instigating the sonic counterattack and flight). However, the confrontation resolves quickly and cleanly, with no visible loss (no captured ally, ruined pattern, or lasting damage), which softens the sense of cost. Tension is present and rises but never reaches a genuinely cornered, no-good-options moment.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether his transformation of pain into beauty will ever effect real peace—is present and paid off by the returned lullabies and earthly blossom armistices. However, conflict is almost entirely internal and largely static: he writes, he persists, and the world eventually responds, with minimal on-page testing or reversal of his resolve. The one meaningful tightening is the moment when distant voices echo his own lullabies back, reweighting his centuries of effort. The piece succeeds as a lyric meditation but lacks the sharper, scene-level pressure and explicit trade-offs expected at top-tier markets.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—loss of the library and the forgotten names—is signaled clearly, and the crack in the chime is a concrete triggering problem. However, escalation is modest: once the lore solution is remembered, the path to resolution is linear and unopposed. There are no real reversals, failed attempts, or narrowing of options beyond “find the right tablet.” The emotional pressure is steady but not meaningfully tightened as the story progresses.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—repairing a broken relationship before Kaelen leaves—is clear and appropriate to the length. Pressure does accrue somewhat as promises escalate from listening to forgiveness, but there is no true reversal or complication once the ritual begins; every step works and only intensifies success. The time limit and the risk of “ancient magics” are declared but never concretely tested; no option is foreclosed or price paid beyond generic emotional risk. As a result, conflict feels gentle and resolved without a sharp enough test of Elara’s commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes—safeguarding a sacred yet dangerous structure and reconciling utility with reverence—are conceptually strong but rarely felt as acute jeopardy. The main escalation is the amphitheater trembling “more violently this time,” followed by her continued work and a successful softening of the breath. Conflict with the council and historians remains entirely off-page, so the ethical tension is mostly abstract. As a result, the resolution feels more like an elegant solution than a hard-won trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant conflict—Elara’s fear of intimacy and truth versus her desire to preserve the songs and connect—is clear but kept at a low simmer. The single major tightening is Leo’s discovery of the grandfather’s letter, which forces her to confront her reinventions and confess. Yet the confrontation is resolved almost immediately with Leo’s reassurance, so the sense of risk or potential rupture between them never fully bites. Stakes remain more conceptual than viscerally felt, and there’s little sense of real alternatives or loss beyond summarized past pain.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.0)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and contemplative; there is no meaningful external resistance and little sense of jeopardy beyond existential drift. The dominant stake—will she discover what makes thresholds sacred and thus reorient herself—is clear but never seriously threatened. Escalation is more about accumulation of insights than narrowing options or visible costs, so the final crossing reads as inevitable rather than hard-earned. As a result, tension is low even though the piece remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—finding a sense of luminous respite and belonging—is clear but only lightly pressured. External conflict is almost nonexistent: there are no real obstacles to her work, and nothing meaningfully threatens her ability to stay until sunrise or achieve her purpose. The internal arc deepens somewhat as the feather’s history and the firefly memory converge, but there is little escalation beyond accumulating beauty and information. Her final stance costs her nothing on the page, which blunts tension and keeps the conflict band modest.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why paths disappear—is clear, but pressure is largely intellectual and rarely tightens into a genuine dilemma or trade-off. The escalation is a gentle deepening (more emotional images, then the woman’s sacrifice, then the conceptual rule) rather than a sharpened conflict with visible cost. The “time is his enemy” frame never materially narrows his options in-scene, so the threat of loss feels abstract. The resolution is earned in logic but not hard-tested by competing imperatives.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—can Elara pierce the crowd’s monotony with orchestrated magic—is clear, but it never feels endangered. Her plan unfolds smoothly: petals lift at the right gust, the balloon release is flawless, and the crowd’s reaction is uniformly awed, with no complication or reversal. Internal tension (doubt, fear of failure, or the toll of such constant calculation) is barely present, so escalation is more a gentle accretion of pretty effects than a tightening of pressure. The ending doesn’t force a trade-off so much as reassert unchallenged commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.2)
    The declared stakes—defying an oppressive nostalgia ban to inscribe forbidden memory—are inherently strong, and the physical cost of the inscription (agonizing yet exquisite, collapse) offers some real pressure. Yet almost all tension is internal and largely resolved from the outset: she is determined and never seriously doubts or faces interruption. Without an embodied antagonist, a credible risk of discovery, or a moment where she might fail or stop, the conflict feels static for such high-stated stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake is Elara’s stance toward impending change (the dredging) and the meaning of her work, but this remains largely contemplative. Her ritual with the stone and ripples deepens understanding rather than forcing a hard trade-off, and the sunbeam’s arrival feels like a graceful answer rather than something she risks or pays for. Escalation is emotional and imagistic—mist to color—rather than conflict-driven, so tension never quite tightens. It’s effective for a lyric vignette but light on pressure for elite markets.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake is internal—whether she can transform her pain into something shareable and meaningful—and it is signaled clearly. Pressure, however, stays mostly static; there’s no strong tightening beat where an alternative (numbing out, rejecting the ritual, abandoning the box) is seriously in play. The “escalation” is largely a reiteration and deepening of already-stated ideas rather than a new test or complication. As a result, the ending feels like a gentle settling rather than an earned crossing of a threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—revitalizing hope across timelines—is stated and present, but remains abstract and largely unthreatened. Elara never encounters a serious setback; each problem responds smoothly to a decorative adjustment, so pressure doesn’t really tighten. There’s a gentle progression from grey despair to music returning, but no hard trade-off or foreclosed option. As a result, the conflict feels conceptual rather than urgent, limiting emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake is essentially whether Elara will truly hear and carry the corridor’s “dream” and what that does to her sense of purpose. Conflict is almost entirely internal and largely unopposed; discoveries arrive without resistance, danger, or meaningful risk beyond emotional burden. The glimpse of the past and the revelation of legacy deepen the situation, but they do not clearly narrow her options or present a hard trade-off. The escalation is thus modest and the ending, while conceptually reweighted, lacks a sharp sense of price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—convincing the mirrors to show possibilities before the bells ring—is legible but quite low-intensity, with no opposing force beyond time and the inertia of the mirrors. Pressure does increase slightly as the lullaby builds and the mirrors begin to tremble, with the heartbeat quickening toward the bell. Still, there’s no real reversal or moment where Lyra must trade something or adapt tactics; she proceeds as planned and largely succeeds. The ephemeral fade of the visions hints at cost but does not meaningfully foreclose future options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—ending the Forever War at the cost of Elara’s life—is clear and weighty, and the ritual’s activation provides a single, coherent tightening of pressure. However, much of the conflict is stated rather than dramatized: the clans’ hostility melts quickly, with minimal resistance or friction once the ritual begins. Elara’s internal conflict is also underplayed, so we don’t see her struggle through alternate tactics or meaningful trade-offs on the page. The result is a strong conceptual stake but a relatively gentle, low-friction escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will genuinely relinquish the egg’s memory and face the cost of his engineered catastrophe—is clear but not sharply pressured. There is a mild tightening through the taught map, the charged stillness, and the storm closing in, culminating in his choice to open his hands and let the “echo” go. However, the internal opposition (amoral armor vs. sentiment) never quite threatens to derail the ritual; doubt is stated more than felt, so escalation stays relatively gentle. The cost is conceptual and emotional rather than visceral, and while valid, it could be sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she will remain safely conformist or risk transformation—is clearly established and tied to the “lullaby of conformity” versus the dangerous clarity of the sanctuary. Escalation is primarily internal and textural: the increasing density of echoes and the resistance of the “final thread” create a credible tightening. Her choice to pull that last, most resistant thread is a decisive action that forecloses a path (her prior safety) even if the social consequences are offstage. Still, the conflict rarely feels viscerally risky or opposed by anything but abstraction; stakes stay conceptual rather than embodied in concrete threat or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she will compromise or transform her subversive art in the face of censorship—is articulated clearly. However, escalation is weak: the core confrontation with Marco is reported after the fact, and in the dome there’s little real pressure on her beyond her own rumination. Her “reversal” decision is not forced by a narrowing of options so much as serenely chosen, with minimal sense of what she stands to lose either way. As a result, tension plateaus rather than tightening toward the end.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—honoring the last migration and acknowledging loss—is present but operates at a very gentle pressure. There is some built-in tension while he waits for the butterfly, yet its eventual arrival never feels truly at risk, and no alternative course of action ever competes meaningfully with his plan. His final micro-choices (tying, waiting, untying, leaving) carry symbolic weight but minimal on-page consequence or trade-off. The result is a beautifully rendered moment that lacks a strong sense of escalation or test.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—reviving and preserving the forgotten names—is clearly stated but only gently tested. Pressure does increase texturally (sound from hum to chorus, light from shimmer to burst), yet Elara never faces a meaningful trade-off or live possibility of failure, nor is there a strong sense of what it would mean to fail here. The destruction of the punched card is a cost, but it’s presented as an almost weightless consummation rather than a tense risk. As a result, escalation reads more like a smooth unveiling than conflict-driven tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she will remain a bound keeper of paths or accept the path that has chosen her—is clear and does tighten toward the storm’s arrival and the directive’s final crumbling. Conflict is primarily internal and metaphysical, but it does culminate in a concrete act (destroying the wafer seal and stepping through the gateway). Escalation could feel sharper: there’s little sense of risk that she might choose differently, and external pressure from the storm mostly intensifies mood rather than forcing hard trade-offs. The piece has real stakes, yet they stay more contemplative than viscerally tense.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—sealing a covenant to stabilize cosmic and political chaos—is clear, and the question “Why do you seek the covenant?” is a good pressure point. However, escalation is mild: once Aris reaches the observatory and aligns the tile, the palace responds without genuine resistance or complication. There is no meaningful risk that his answer might fail, nor an alternative path he must renounce; the experience feels like a foretold unlocking rather than a contested trial. As a result, tension flattens at the very point where stakes should tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central conflict—resentment versus release—is clearly stated, and Elara’s goal to avert future violence gives it nominal stakes. Yet most pressure is declarative (“The world outside is tearing itself apart”) rather than dramatized, and Kael’s resistance does not intensify in concrete beats. There’s one main tightening when the childhood memory appears and the pin seems to repair, but little sense of a real risk that he might refuse. The resolution feels clean and low-friction, with no visible trade-off or lingering tension.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central stake—capturing the runaway dream before it vanishes—is clearly defined, but the conflict unfolds with almost no resistance or genuine risk. Once Elian and Lyra begin their synchronized breathing, each step simply works: boundaries dissolve, the sextant glows, the dream solidifies, and is captured without a moment of real jeopardy or potential loss. There is a mild deepening as the dream becomes more substantial and must be anchored, yet that “test” is solved instantly by crafting a mirror. The lack of a meaningful setback or trade-off keeps the tension low.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—repairing the rift with Lyra and preserving generational craft—is legible early, and Elara’s decision to persist through exile toward reconciliation anchors the story. However, conflict is mostly off-stage (the breach with the Guild, the original fight with Lyra) or summarized, and the on-page pressure never tightens beyond emotional regret. Lyra’s appearance after weeks with no real complication or hard choice diminishes the sense of risk or sacrifice, so the resolution feels gentle rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—whether Elara will transgress and access forbidden erasure-knowledge—is clearly identified and sharpened by the vision of the post-flesh civilization. Escalation is present but relatively gentle: her frustration, then demand, then immersion in dangerous visions do raise the conceptual stakes. Yet she never really faces a concrete on-page test of that danger; the risk of “unraveling her own past, her own mind” remains hypothetical, and her final acceptance comes without a direct, painful trade-off. The result is a thoughtful arc with modest pressure rather than a sharply tightening crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are high in premise (a collapsing timeline), but the on-page conflict feels relatively smooth, with few concrete setbacks or difficult trade-offs. The main tightening—a shift from frantic search to meditative, intention-purified seeking, and then from rescuing Kael to forcing him to confront his unlearned lesson—is conceptually strong. Yet the journey offers little resistance: once the method is identified, each step succeeds without visible cost or serious risk of failure. This leaves tension more intellectual than visceral and keeps the climax from fully cashing in the declared stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—recovering a true sense of self and memory via the garden—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure escalates texturally rather than through hard reversals: her weaving of narrative threads intensifies, the card begins to glow and pulse, and the fog thickens as she nears the bow. Internal conflict (fear of what she may lose by reaching the garden) is mentioned but not deeply dramatized in on-page choices or hesitation. The resolution feels somewhat risk-light, as the shift to peace occurs without a visibly costly trade-off or renunciation in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—stabilizing a reality-tearing anomaly linked to old “fables of absence”—is coherent and present from early on. Pressure does deepen somewhat as the door opens into “visual static” and Elara must reweave the rope and commit the seal, but there are no real reversals or narrowed options: every tactic she tries works as intended. We never feel what it would mean, concretely, if she failed (to her, the university, or the world), so tension remains conceptual rather than visceral. Conflict is functional but under-pressurized for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central stake—Elara must stabilize the caves’ harmonics before they collapse or her mind fractures—is articulated, and her conjuring is a clear response to that pressure. Yet, once she begins, the process unfolds without meaningful obstruction: the beings never actively resist, the ritual never falters, and there is no turn where an option closes or a new cost emerges. The “storm” feels more like a persistent condition than a dynamic antagonist. As a result, tension is atmospheric rather than dramatic, and escalation plateaus instead of truly tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes are conceptually high—isolated settlements in fearful darkness and Elara’s existential need to prove meaning—but they remain mostly abstract on the page. Conflict is primarily internal perseverance versus despair, with a single external test: can she align the fragments and light the beacon tonight. The brief beat where “nothing happened” before the light appears is the only real tightening, and it resolves quickly without forcing changed tactics or a painful trade-off. As a result, pressure feels gentle and lyrical rather than genuinely constricting, limiting the sense of hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—whether and how he can reconcile personal identity with collective memory—is clear but remains quiet and largely interior. His methodical movement from one monument to the next offers a nominal escalation (from flood, to grief, to peace), yet there is no strong moment where a genuine alternative or risked loss is foregrounded. The “cost” of his final stance is implied (accepting self as porous, his nostalgia as a burden-turned-companion) but never strongly dramatized as a trade-off. As a result, tension feels more contemplative than pressured, limiting conflict intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—transforming the fortress’s hopelessness—is stated and followed through, but the path is relatively smooth. There is no palpable risk of failure, pushback from the environment, or internal hesitation to complicate the ritual and sharpen its tension. Escalation exists in a formal sense (from solitary approach to ignition to fortress-wide fireworks), yet it reads more like an inevitable unfolding than a pressured test of resolve. As a result, the climax is beautiful but not particularly suspenseful.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.2)
    The conflict—whether and how to leave the coast, and what that means for the relationship—is clear but remains abstract for most of the piece; we never see a concrete loss or consequence attached to either choice. Pressure deepens slightly as Elara focuses on images of molting and Kael’s fear, but there is no true escalation or narrowing of options, just a steady contemplative drift toward reframing. Elara’s “choice” is more an internal rewording than a sacrifice, so the path foreclosed and its cost are faintly felt. The result is a thematically coherent but low-tension arc.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—risking literal death and psychic overwhelm to obtain a silence that can make confinement survivable—is established early and remains coherent. Pressure escalates from internal (bunker suffocation) to external and existential (being pulled into the open void, threat of being “lost to the void”), and then to a charged stillness at the trellis. However, the ascent and encounter unfold without any concrete setback or choice under duress—her plan works as designed, so the test is mostly endurance rather than a pressured trade-off or reversal. The cost is primarily psychological and implied (risk, terror, the temptation of staying), which lands, but could be sharpened with one pressured on-page decision.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=4.2)
    The dominant stake—redefining silence from void to comfort—remains almost entirely unopposed, so there is no credible escalation. Elara never faces a threatened failure, competing desire, or situational resistance; every reading of the storm glass confirms her ideal conditions. The closest thing to a turn is her brief hum and then cessation, but these are gentle modulations, not pressured decisions that foreclose options. As a result, tension stays flat and the “catalyzing” of change is told rather than earned through conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.5)
    The nominal stakes are high—claim the throne before sunrise to restore balance—but the conflict is almost entirely puzzle-solving with no credible chance of failure. Each obstacle (murals, missing gem, final puzzle) yields quickly once noticed, and there is no antagonist, moral dilemma, or real sacrifice. The time pressure does not force hard trade-offs or visible losses, so escalation feels more like progression than tightening. The result is a smoothly executed quest with low palpable tension.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.2)
    The central stake—maintaining hard-won isolation versus honoring his mission to help another suffocating soul—is clear but under-pressured. The “encroachment” is described as a gentle, inevitable seep rather than a true crisis, so escalation feels soft and largely tonal. His acceptance of the other carries some implied cost, yet he encounters little genuine resistance in himself before yielding. The conflict resolves smoothly, with limited sense that a viable alternative path has been meaningfully foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Leo can transform crushing psychological pressure into something valuable—is clear, and the experiment usefully literalizes it. Pressure does escalate from conceptual to physical, and Leo’s choice to channel rather than resist is an authentic tightening. However, there’s little sense of true jeopardy or trade-off: he never seriously considers refusing, sabotaging, or misusing the power, and the outcome is purely positive. Without a concrete potential loss (to self, others, or reality), the conflict remains somewhat abstract and resolves too smoothly for the scale of what’s attempted.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding whether he’s truly guilty or manipulated—is established, but conflict never intensifies beyond a steady internal brooding. The music and “standing waves” immediately facilitate clarity, so there’s little resistance, ambiguity, or cost in the realization itself. His decision to seek justice is a turn, but not clearly a hard trade-off or sacrifice on the page. Pressure remains mostly static, with declared magnitude (ending a dynasty) but low felt tension in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Alaric can use the forgotten patterns to seize and reshape possibility—is articulated early and pursued consistently. There is some escalation as he moves deeper into the orchard, bares his arm, and intensifies his chant while reality ripples around him. However, there is little true resistance or narrowing of options: no real threat of failure, corruption, or loss beyond vague regret, so tension remains conceptual rather than visceral. The resolution feels more like a successful procedure than a contested victory.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can transmute personal heartbreak and institutional neglect into a meaningful act of preservation—is present but soft. Conflict remains mostly internal and is rarely dramatized as dilemma or true risk; research and discovery unfold without obstacles, reversals, or real threat to her project. The one tightening is her refusal to accept Jonah’s file closure as the end, but this decision faces no credible resistance. As a result, escalation is modest and the cost of her hopefulness never bites on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—reviving truth against the “tyranny of indifference”—is explicit from early on, but opposition and escalation stay largely conceptual. Kael notes his plans unraveling, yet no specific obstacle forces a hard trade-off or visible loss; once he follows the puddle map, the lagoon and voices yield what he needs without resistance. The Council never exerts on-page pressure, and Kael’s tactics are never meaningfully constrained or punished. This keeps tension low and makes the final stance feel like a continuation of what he was already doing rather than a sharpened, costly turn.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preventing a prophecy from manifesting—is stated early and remains coherent throughout, and the resistance of the atrium provides a mild deepening of pressure. Elias’s tactic shift (longer pauses, leaning into negative space) is a genuine micro-choice that shapes the resolution. However, the conflict stays largely abstract and one-note: we’re told of world-scale dissonance, but on the page the struggle feels hushed and assured, with little sense he might fail or pay a sharper price. As a result, tension never quite tightens into a truly fraught turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—decoding the leaves/prophecy and realizing Elara’s role in renewing the arbor—is present but largely abstract and unopposed. Escalation is mostly additive: more transformations, more monuments, more communal participation, but no serious setback, trade-off, or narrowing of options. Even the revelation that she is the guardian arrives without friction or sacrifice; her “sacred duty” never collides with a competing want. This produces a gentle, meditative arc with little tension, undercutting the sense of stakes required for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake is Elara’s internal shift from rigid planning to trust in uncertainty, signaled early and resolved at the end, but external conflict remains very soft. Major turns (leaving the workshop, following the compass, accepting its guidance) happen with little resistance or meaningful trade-off; the cave exploration and waterfall read as atmospheric rather than dangerous. There is one real tightening—when she decides to follow the compass into deeper shadows—but it doesn’t visibly foreclose any competing option or exact a concrete price. As a result, tension exists conceptually more than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—redeeming a failed search by risking a deeper understanding—is established early and tightened when she deliberately pushes the coin past “protocols” and cracks it. That fracture is the key escalation: she endangers a factually mystical, valuable artifact for an intangible goal. The external conflict is minimal and there’s no active antagonist; pressure is largely internal and philosophical, so tension stays gentle rather than gripping. Still, the risk to the coin and the renunciation of the literal search provide a credible, felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—freeing Lyra’s tormented soul—is clear, but the conflict is essentially procedural: Elara applies her method and it works with only minor hesitation from Lyra. There’s a small tightening when Elara insists on “something joyful” and introduces laughter, but it isn’t seriously contested or risky. No meaningful option is foreclosed, and Elara never faces the possibility of failing or harming Lyra. The piece reads more like a ritual description than a pressured decision under stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is internal—can Kaelen transform his torture into a coherent understanding of mercy—and that is present from early on. Pressure escalates modestly via the repeated bracing/memory cycles and then tightens when the literal strap appears, prompting a different reaction. However, conflict remains largely cerebral; there is little sense that any path is foreclosed or that a serious alternative outcome persists, so tension plateaus rather than sharply rising. The final stance crystallization is satisfying but not hard-won under explicit on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring an erased act of courage to the world’s memory—remains abstract and is never tested against a real obstacle or cost. Elara’s goal is achieved smoothly once she finds the painting; there is no meaningful risk that she will fail, nor any competing desire that might pull her away. The “unfastening” moment marks a structural turn but not an escalation of pressure; it’s a procedure, not a crisis. As a result, conflict and stakes feel low despite the potentially rich premise.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.8)
    There is a clear external problem (uncovering what’s hidden, resolving the ghosts’ grievances) and an internal tension around his “burden,” but the stakes remain gentle and largely spiritual. The main tightening is the transition from a single ghost to a crowd of wronged spirits, yet this escalation is handled as calm listening rather than a test of Leo’s limits or values. His solution—promise to honor the clockmaker via a museum—costs him little on the page. The conflict is coherent but not sharply pressured or costly.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will compress eternity at the risk of destabilizing her world—is present from early on and pays off in the rupture and its aftermath. Escalation exists as an accumulative intensification (rustling awakenings, fraying order, boiling clouds) rather than through discrete reversals, which suits the mode. However, opposition is largely abstract and passive; nothing actively pushes back on Elara’s plan, and she never must reconsider or adapt tactics, which mutes the sense of hard-won cost. The cost is conceptual and environmental rather than experienced as a contested choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—a contest over how a civilization is understood and whether Elara’s poetic reading will matter—remains mostly intellectual and lightly contested. Pressure does rise with Kael’s dismissal and the storm-driven experiment, but these beats are swiftly resolved and rarely force Elara into a costly trade-off. The dispute “reaches a climax” off-stage, so we’re told of conflict rather than feeling it tighten. As a result, escalation is present but relatively soft, with limited sense of what Elara truly stands to lose beyond reputation.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake (reclaiming the world’s light) is clearly stated, and the covenant of rust plus the lie provide a recognizable tightening beat in the middle. Yet the on-page conflict feels largely foregone: Elian never meaningfully falters, improvises, or sacrifices; the townsman’s confession arrives almost instantly upon being prompted. There’s no genuine trade-off or path foreclosed—once the lie is resolved, the process resumes without altered tactics or loss, and midnight remains an abstract past-tense threat rather than a present antagonist. As a result, the stakes read grand but the pressure on the scene remains modest.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she will merely collect or truly confront the place where explanations fail—is present and does tighten at the lagoon when she chooses not to open the vials and to leave the compass. However, the treacherous descent remains largely atmospheric; danger never concretely tests her resolve, and no real alternative path is dramatized beyond “go back vs go on.” The surveyors’ choice to stay is intriguing but isn’t staged as a serious live option she nearly embraces. As a result, escalation feels more like deepening mood than sharpening cost.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will find a meaningful direction amid lost technological guidance—is clear, and the pressure deepens as the slide reveals a lineage of crises like hers. Escalation is accumulative rather than dramatic; the conflict is primarily internal and aesthetic, building toward her decision to carve differently and treat the work as dialogue rather than solitary expression. The cost (abandoning external “coordinates” in favor of an inner, history-laden one) is present but understated. Because opposition is mostly abstract and the storm never sharpens into a concrete threat, tension feels more meditative than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why flowers bloom at night—is established early and followed through, but it remains largely intellectual and contemplative. There is minimal escalation: her decision to visit the cathedral is a shift in tactic, yet nothing truly opposes or jeopardizes her goal. Internal conflict is gentle; she feels the “weight of unanswered questions” without facing a moment where abandoning the quest or confronting a painful truth carries real risk. As a result, the ending feels satisfying but low-tension, more like a completed meditation than a hard-won resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.2)
    The central stake—whether the painful, complex truth of the movement will be uncovered and integrated—is articulated but not strongly tested. Once the vision begins, Elara meets little resistance: the cipher process proceeds steadily, the “trap” never threatens to keep her, and the parley is cooperative. Internal and external conflicts align but rarely clash in a way that forces a real trade-off or visible loss. As a result, escalation feels more like steady revelation than tightening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—whether a new, non-magical civilization can arise from dependency—is clear, and Elian’s refusal to seek more wishes is an internally coherent stance. Yet conflict remains largely abstract: no specific obstacles, setbacks, or opposing forces are dramatized beyond generalized “challenges” and slow progress. The escalation from solitude to thriving community is narrated as a smooth arc, so no single choice under real strain sharply narrows options. The cost is implied (arduous work over time) rather than felt in concrete high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—what Elian does with the accidental prophecy and its implications—is clear but mostly internal and contemplative. There is one significant deepening when the new voice appears and speaks of a coming era of silence, but after that the pressure plateaus into reflection rather than forcing a harder trade-off or visible price on the page. His decision to keep archiving with a new purpose is interesting but comes without a dramatized alternative path or concrete risk. The piece reads as gently escalating discovery rather than genuine conflict under tightening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central stake—stabilize the vortex inheritance before it collapses and the gateway remains sealed—is clear, and tension does rise modestly as the egg cracks and the portal flickers. Yet the conflict feels largely procedural: Elara executes a plan she’s already prepared, and each step works as intended. There’s no on-page reversal, sacrifice, or genuine risk of failure beyond abstract statements (“must act quickly”), so options never feel truly narrowed. The climax lands, but without a felt price or genuine test of commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.8)
    The primary conflict—whether to trigger the deafening siren or trust a quieter, data-backed method—is conceptually strong and legible. Yet escalation is minimal: once she decides to “switch her plan,” there are no setbacks, doubts, or external pressures that meaningfully threaten failure. The villagers’ acceptance and the storm’s impact unfold without friction, so the price for her choice feels theoretical rather than earned. Stakes (valley safety vs peace) are told but never sharpened into a moment where disaster feels genuinely possible.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—finding strength in vulnerability and meaning in solitude—is present but faces almost no resistance or escalation. The meteor shower functions as a mild intensification rather than a crisis; there is no moment where Kael risks losing something tangible or must trade one value for another. His “realization” arrives smoothly, without reversal or true test of commitment. As a result, tension stays low and the ending feels contemplatively satisfying rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central stake—the preservation or loss of the covenant and its unspoken words—is clear but remains abstract and largely unopposed. Escalation is modest: the realization that the covenant is failing and the act of opening the box are the main pressure points, but they unfold without friction or real risk. The protagonist’s agency resolves things cleanly, with no visible price or foreclosed path; his success seems assured as soon as he decides to engage. As a result, tension never tightens beyond a gentle contemplative hum.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s need to understand time’s true nature—is present but remains largely interior and low-risk, with minimal external or interpersonal pressure. The main escalation is the stranger’s arrival and the shared revelation, which is powerful conceptually but arrives with little friction or resistance. There is no substantial trade-off or loss; once Leo appears, progress toward understanding is smooth and almost too easy. As a result, tension feels muted, and the emotional cost of Elara’s transformation is more implied than viscerally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether brokenness can be held as beautiful—is clear but remains almost entirely internal and low-pressure. The kite’s snapping is a promising turn, yet it resolves quickly into a lesson rather than escalating or cornering either character into a difficult trade-off. The poet’s main “choices” (to comfort, to reframe, to later write) all align with his established philosophy and are never meaningfully threatened. As a result, conflict feels static and stakes remain abstract, limiting narrative energy.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—use her remaining time to establish interspecies respect—is clear, but it encounters almost no resistance: her method works as intended, animals respond positively, and there are no real setbacks or dilemmas. Pressure technically increases as she grows weaker, but this is reported more than dramatized, and her calm removes urgency from the six-month clock. There is one real tightening—the stag bowing confirms success before her body fails—but it’s more confirmation than test. As a result, tension is low and the cost (her death) feels preordained rather than meaningfully sharpened by choices.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake is largely intellectual/existential—whether her heterodox biochemical theory of homecoming is true—and it’s signaled early. However, the piece lacks meaningful resistance: the journey is unimpeded, the tower opens, the device works, and no alternative outcome ever feels live. Pressure “escalates” mainly by accumulation of imagery rather than by narrowing options or increasing risk, so the revelation is interesting but not hard-won. The ending doesn’t register a concrete price beyond the implied gravity of new knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether life and peace can take root on a dead battlefield—is clear but never truly under threat; once he arrives with seeds, success feels inevitable. The birds’ guidance provides a gentle form of problem-solving, but there’s no reversal, obstacle, or moral bind that forces a trade-off or loss. As a result, pressure doesn’t escalate so much as repeat: multiple lines restate his purpose and methods without tightening cost. The ending has quiet emotional weight yet lacks a decisive beat where options narrow or a difficult path is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether Baron can transform his grief into a purposeful, potentially painful closeness—is clear, and there is a genuine turn when the clicks resolve into coordinates, forcing a choice. However, opposition and escalation are relatively soft: the riddle yields without much resistance, and his decision to go is not meaningfully contested by any concrete risk or countervailing pull on the page. The result is a graceful but largely unpressured progression, strong for mood but underpowered in terms of felt stakes and struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—finding purpose/direction in isolation—is legible, but on-page conflict is mostly internal and low-friction. Escalation occurs primarily as intensification of focus on the star (sketching → sensor recalibration → plan to fire engines), yet each step meets little resistance or trade-off. The decision to leave his assigned role is a genuine turn but underdeveloped in terms of cost or serious doubt. As a result, tension is present but muted, reading more like a meditative reorientation than pressured struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.2)
    The stakes are enormous in premise (the Unweaving of the sky) and are signaled clearly, but the on-page conflict is strikingly gentle. There is no real opposition from the guardian, no misstep in the ritual, and no meaningful reversal or tightening; every move succeeds as planned. Kaelen’s internal stance (curiosity over fear) is never seriously tested, so his “cautious abandon” isn’t forced into a trade-off. As a result, tension exists more as idea than as felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.8)
    Conflict is primarily internal: Elara’s drive to archive small gestures versus her unprocessed trauma and guilt. The stakes are thematically clear but remain abstract; there is little concrete resistance or jeopardy beyond her own mindset, and no real external counter-force. Escalation is modest, expressed through the progression of words she walks and the confrontation with the pawn-less chessboard, culminating in the choice to seek self-forgiveness. The emotional price is implied rather than sharply felt, which keeps tension at a measured, contemplative level.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether she continues to anesthetize herself with visions or faces painful memory to reconceive home—is clear and reasonably well carried through. There is a meaningful tightening when the stone reframes her nightly substitution as a prison, forcing her to shift from escape to engagement. However, the pressure feels gentle and foregone: there’s little sense of real risk, failure, or competing external demands, and each “session” succeeds without complication. The resulting conflict reads more contemplative than tense, which is fine but limits dramatic escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Elian’s ability to forgive himself—is clearly signaled and does progress, particularly when he finds the silver-gold thread pattern and realizes the labyrinth is a test, not a punishment. The thunder-lull clock and the decoding work provide a modest sense of tightening. However, conflict remains primarily internal and largely unopposed; there are no genuine reversals or difficult trade-offs, and the price of success feels emotionally light for someone whose life was shattered. The resolution thus reads more contemplative than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can resist the demand for a single “clean” truth by multiplying meanings before the ritual—remains largely conceptual rather than viscerally pressured. There is some escalation via density: poems grow more complex, listeners’ emotional responses deepen, and the looming bell tightens time slightly. However, no concrete option is visibly foreclosed; Elara never faces a moment where she must choose between compliance and defiance at cost, and the ritual’s consequences stay abstract. The result is textured tension but relatively low felt danger or sacrifice in narrative terms.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.7)
    The central stake—save the world’s unraveling memories at the cost of Elian’s life—is clearly signaled, and pressure does escalate through the dive, breath depletion, and statue crumbling. Yet the conflict stays one-note: Elian decides to act and then simply endures; there are no meaningful setbacks, alternate tactics, or moral trade-offs beyond “keep going vs die/lose everything.” The acid’s threat is mostly rhetorical; we never see partial failure, injury, or a choice that genuinely risks not completing the spell. This keeps the tension serviceable but below elite: we believe the danger in concept more than we feel it in on-page tests.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will continue to live inside nostalgic “temporary eternities” or accept the present—is clear and culminates in her decision to leave the shell and reframe the cracked mirror. The major tightening occurs when she finds her childhood shell, forcing a reinterpretation of her old promise. Yet the conflict remains largely internal and under-pressured; the revelation arrives without much on-page resistance, debate, or temptation to retreat. The result is a satisfying but relatively soft escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stakes—summoning a possibly lost brother and validating her whisper-over-shout credo—are clearly articulated, but pressure barely tightens. Once dawn arrives, every step proceeds smoothly; there are no obstacles, misfires, or moments where she contemplates abandoning or altering her method. Internal conflict is gestured at through her long waiting but never tested in the moment of action, so the peak choice doesn’t force a trade-off beyond quiet endurance. As a result, tension is gentle and accumulative rather than sharply escalating, limiting the felt cost of success.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—confronting and reconfiguring grief—is clear, and there is a gentle deepening as Elara assembles the resonator and the hum “pulls the stars closer.” However, conflict is largely frictionless: the voice instructs, she complies, and nothing seriously resists her or forces a painful trade-off beyond the conceptual/emotional cost asserted by the narration. There is minimal escalation in terms of options narrowing or risks rising; the main turn is informational (the voice clarifying, then withdrawing) rather than pressured. As a result, the stakes feel meaningful but under-tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—regaining agency over her own speech—reads clearly, and the choice to expose herself to lightning provides a nominal escalation. Yet the pressure never truly tightens: there’s no reversal, no concrete antagonistic force beyond generalized danger, and the ritual succeeds without friction. The “unknown cost” is not linked to a specific loss or trade-off, so the resolution feels low-risk for the scale of the premise. As a result, tension is present but muted, more contemplative than truly fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s need to decode the final gesture and thereby ease both his and the stranger’s unresolved isolation—is clear from early on. Pressure does accumulate modestly as his unease persists, the journal gaps gain weight, and the alpine imagery clarifies into a specific lost woman and undelivered apology. However, the conflict remains very low-intensity: his investigation faces no meaningful obstacles, and the decision to send the letter entails little visible risk or sacrifice. The piece reads more as contemplative puzzle-solving than as a choice under tightening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elian will use the doorway to change his past for Mara’s sake—is clearly signaled and coheres with the external urgency of the rising creek. Escalation is present (glimmer to cavern to literal doorway as floodwaters rise), and the climax is his choice to step back. However, the pressure remains relatively gentle: the creek’s danger and the psychological torment of the decision are underplayed, so the trade-off feels slightly cushioned. Clarifying the tangible or emotional risks of each option in the moment would deepen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.2)
    The central stake—understanding the dreams despite a dire warning, with her kingdom’s fate implied—is present and coherent, but the on-page conflict is relatively soft. The climb is called treacherous and arduous, yet unfolds without concrete obstacles or reversals beyond generalized effort, and the guardian exerts no pressure beyond a reassuring presence. The grotto sequence is more about receiving a revelation than facing a tested choice; once she learns the truth, her decision to return is natural and largely unopposed. As a result, escalation feels conceptual rather than dramatically sharpened, with limited cost foregrounded in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—reframing a seemingly dying nexus and capturing a single moment’s presence—is clear but largely internal and aesthetic, leading to low-pressure conflict. Kael’s secret removes opposition rather than sharpening it, so the central obstacle is a misinterpretation that dissolves quickly. Elara’s changed method does escalate engagement, but there’s little sense of what she risks beyond an implied vocational and existential shift. The resolution feels earned but not hard-won, with minimal sense of loss, trade-off, or potential failure.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether he can wrest some control by shaping overwhelming, death-haunted visions into narrative—is signaled early and paid off. Pressure escalates as nostalgia becomes “feral” and jealousy of past selves sharpens, peaking in the soaring sequence where he confronts his grave and multiple selves. The decisive move is a renunciation of helplessness via the disciplined act of marking the scroll despite chaos. However, the conflict never poses a sharply delineated alternative (e.g., total surrender to the dream or self-erasure), which keeps the cost perceptible but relatively soft.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can find a new way to heal and to “breathe” without smell—is clear, but the story presents very little real resistance. Her visit to the shop, reception of the screw, and subsequent professional adjustment unfold with near-frictionless grace; there is no significant doubt, setback, or competing desire that tightens pressure. The grief-stricken client scene offers an emotional payoff but not a new escalation, more a confirmation of the chosen path. As a result, the piece reads more as a contemplative vignette than a pressured conflict with visibly narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can transform her stress and scars into fluid, meaningful runes before the storm-window closes—is clear but remains largely internal and safe. There is escalation in the way her stress initially causes brittle crystallization and later becomes a controlled medium, and each revisited superstition slightly deepens the pressure. However, there’s no sharp on-page consequence for failure beyond continued inner pain, and no single decisive, high-cost choice; most turns feel like incremental progress rather than a pressured trade-off. Tension exists but stays gentle, more meditative than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—achieving an overdue apology before the orchard is destroyed—is clear and emotionally legible. There is one meaningful tightening when the currents and perfume actually call Alistair, and the appearance of the blossom instead of Isabella delivers the imperfect-miracle twist. However, Elara’s agency is never seriously tested; she doesn’t face a failed attempt, resistance from the spirits, or a real trade-off beyond stamina implied by “gritty” effort. The trees’ scheduled demolition functions more as atmospheric backdrop than an active ticking clock that alters her tactics or forces hard choices.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.2)
    The dominant stake—unraveling cosmic illusions—is stated clearly, but there is almost no resistance or complication; each step toward the goal succeeds without friction. “Spiral arbitration” is described as a process but never truly tests him; there are no reversals, sacrifices, or trade-offs beyond a serene acceptance that the library will fade. As a result, tension remains flat and the resolution lacks a felt price, reading more like an inevitability than an earned overcoming.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake is internal—will he achieve a deeper understanding of what clocks measure—and that pressure is clearly signaled. Escalation is modest: counting down, noticing the peculiar glint, adjusting flows, and feeling perception “fold back” all intensify his inquiry but never force a hard trade-off or foreclose a meaningful option. The insight that clocks measure resistance and human desire arrives without much resistance or cost; doubt “creeps” in but doesn’t genuinely threaten his identity or role. As a result, the conflict feels meditative rather than tense, effective but low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she will cling to rigid security or risk a new, receptive system—is present but stays abstract. The intrusion alert and energy entity offer an opportunity, yet the entity quickly proves benevolent and cooperative, so Elara is never truly squeezed between competing harms. The “tightening” moment (her realizing the entity is trying to communicate and deciding to harmonize with it) doesn’t visibly close off alternatives or extract a clear price. As a result, conflict feels intriguing but low-pressure, more contemplative than driven.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake is Elara’s need to find an ethical way to live with probability and chance after her father’s collapse, and this is signaled early. Conflict, however, remains almost entirely internal and contemplative, with minimal escalation beyond accumulating realizations; nothing significantly opposes her, and no option is truly foreclosed on the page. The subway “method” and library discovery function more as guided pilgrimage than pressured decision points. As a result, the ending feels thoughtful but low-tension rather than sharply earned under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether Elara can reframe her ending into a beginning—is clear but remains largely internal and gently pressured. The introduction of the “loop” is the main escalation, providing one meaningful deepening as she hears her story differently. However, there’s little sense of risk or potential failure; Leo never feels tested, and Elara shifts relatively smoothly once the device is engaged. The emotional cost is present but muted, limiting the sense of tightening conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving the jetty’s stories in the face of demolition—is stated early, and the urgency from the council vote provides a decent frame. However, there is no on-page opposition or complication: the ritual unfolds step-by-step without real doubt, setback, or trade-off. The shift from physical preservation to memory-preservation is interesting conceptually but not dramatized as a painful decision. Pressure deepens only mildly through backstory (the rescue) rather than through escalating present-tense conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether loneliness can be “cured” through reciprocal vulnerability—appears early and tightens as Leo chooses to participate and feels an internal shift. Escalation is primarily emotional and conceptual rather than event-driven, but the bargain (listen, then go tell) does narrow his options and introduces a clear obligation. The later image of the group in the station confirms that his choice had consequences beyond himself, giving the initial pressure some retrospective weight. Still, the on-page conflict is gentle and low-friction, with little sense of risk beyond implied emotional exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stake—whether she can find a way to live with her grief—is clear and presses gently but steadily throughout. Escalation arrives via the increasing complexity of the notes and the narrowing into the gully, culminating in the decision to kneel and fully face her sorrow. However, the pressure remains almost entirely internal and contemplative, with minimal sense of alternative paths or real risk of failure beyond continued suffering. A more tangible internal dilemma or on-page faltering at the threshold would sharpen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—can she transform a catastrophic miscommunication into understanding rather than further harm—is present and escalates when the anomaly sends a mirrored pattern, forcing her to respond. The key tightening is her choice to answer with a synthesized, relational signal despite profound uncertainty about intent, and the anomaly’s softening is a satisfying, character-driven resolution. Still, the conflict remains largely internal and conceptual; there’s little sense that she might choose *not* to reply or that replying could visibly worsen things beyond what’s already happened, so the trade-off feels relatively safe. More sharply articulated risk or a more concrete threatened loss in the moment of composition would heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Elian’s isolation versus the possibility of connection and meaning in silence—is clear, but conflict remains almost entirely internal and contemplative. There is one meaningful deepening when the advisor hands over the camera, shifting agency to Elian just before the advisor fades, yet this feels gentle rather than pressured. No real options are foreclosed beyond the advisor’s inevitable departure, which doesn’t demand a difficult choice from Elian. As a result, escalation is present but soft, more atmospheric than tense.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Kaelen will redeem his legacy by rescuing and sharing the promise—is clear, but conflict is mostly internal and lightly pressured. The trail presents no apparent risk, time limit, or chance of failure, and no antagonistic force counters his goal. His internal struggle with his arsonist past is stated rather than staged in hard choices (e.g., there’s never a moment where burning vs preserving is truly live on the page). As a result, escalation is conceptual rather than felt, and the final stance comes without a sharply visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—transforming her fractured condition into a shared dream of unity—is present early and culminates in the garden’s brief collective-vision eruption. Yet most antagonistic pressure (the lab, confinement, risk of failure) remains off-stage and not concretely tested. Escalation is mainly rhetorical (“she intensified her drumming,” “the garden erupted”) rather than built from new obstacles or narrowed options. The price she pays (exhaustion, continued captivity) is implied rather than made sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—Elara proving that quiet, subtle methods outperform loud, procedural authority—is clear but faces limited genuine resistance. Kael’s suspicion dissolves quickly once the coin and key are introduced, and the lost workers follow Elara with little friction; no major option feels foreclosed or morally costly. Escalation is present but gentle: from a routine map problem to a challenge, then to guided exploration, then to a small-scale rescue. The piece reads more as an illustrative parable than as a scene of sharpened conflict under real pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.4)
    The central stake—easing the trapped child’s fear / teaching darkness the value of stars—is clear but highly abstract, so pressure is felt more as mood than as concrete risk. There is one discernible tightening when the “secret stirring” ripple appears and she shifts tactics to specific constellations (Weaver, Lyra). Beyond that, escalation is mostly incremental repetition of the same tactic rather than new obstacles or costs. The outcome never feels in deep doubt, which keeps tension modest.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are declared as high (a Council banning independent thought), but the on-page conflict is remarkably frictionless: no real surveillance pressure, no close calls, no backlash scenes. Elara’s plan works smoothly; the guard’s softening is emblematic of how easily the regime yields to doubt, undercutting tension. The piece deepens the pattern of dissent but never truly escalates pressure or forces a hard trade-off. As a result, the “revolution” feels more like an elegant concept than a tested struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant conflict—Elara’s pull between staying in a safe, numb world and answering the whale’s summons—is clear and thematically apt. Pressure escalates as the call intensifies and the island becomes visible, forcing a binary choice to step off the known shore. However, resistance is minimal: once the call comes, her path feels nearly preordained, with little on-page struggle, complication, or reversal. The stakes remain mostly internal and somewhat abstract, which makes the final choice resonant but not especially harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Elara maintains her forbidden grief under a regime demanding happiness—is clear and morally charged. Internal conflict between survival (reporting neighbors, performing joy) and fidelity to loss is well set up. However, pressure doesn’t truly tighten; we never see an escalating external threat or a new, riskier choice, only deepened description of the same bind. The ending crystallizes her stance but without a significant on-page turn from earlier beats.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether he can and will cross a once-sacred boundary—is clear but never feels genuinely risky on the page. Pressure rises mildly as he approaches the colonnade and as the humming intensifies, and the act of paraphrasing old laws is an intriguing form of agency. However, there’s no on-page opposition, consequence, or real doubt beyond a “tremor of certainty,” so escalation is more atmospheric than felt. The crossing works conceptually but lacks a visible cost or trade-off, so the conflict reads as largely pre-solved.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—securing an awakening of sight—is signaled early and remains coherent, with Maestra’s barter condition providing an external test. However, the pressure feels gentle: there’s no real sense of what Elian risks beyond disappointment, and the challenge never genuinely threatens to fail on the page. His internal want versus need (color vs. form/imperfection) is thematically clear but not sharply tested by an on-page dilemma or near-miss. As a result, escalation exists but remains modest rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can truly grasp and enact “connection” rather than mere preservation—is established early and tightened when her isolated methods fail. The key escalation comes when she questions that core assumption and chooses to project the sound outward, triggering the spontaneous harmony. However, the stakes remain mostly intellectual and spiritual, with little sense of what’s materially or emotionally at risk if she fails beyond personal frustration. The pressure grows, but in a gently meditative register rather than with sharp, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will remain collapsed in grief or reconfigure it into transformative making—is present but largely resolved off-stage. Pressure escalates modestly when she follows the first crane and opens the sealed room, but after that the journey is a sequence of discoveries and realizations without genuine jeopardy or hard trade-offs. She never seems at serious risk of rejecting the path her grandfather laid out; each clue simply confirms a direction she’s already taking. As a result, the ending feels inevitable but not hard-won on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.9)
    The conflict is primarily internal and thematic—Elara’s need to impose pattern and meaning on post-crash chaos versus her fear that the patterns herald further collapse—which is an interesting axis but remains abstract. The tension neither escalates through new obstacles nor forces a trade-off; her work proceeds unimpeded, Leo does not challenge her methods or conclusions, and no external deadline or consequence tightens the screws. Repetitions of “by multiplying paths,” “reverse engineering,” and “after the cryptocurrency crashes” intensify the rhetoric rather than the pressure. The late “greater unraveling” concern hints at higher stakes, but it’s floated and then smoothed over by the hopeful closure without a concrete, costly confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—risking her mind and innocence to purify forbidden atoms—is clear, and the ritual is a meaningful action. Still, conflict is largely declared rather than dramatized: the atoms’ unpredictability and the mind-unraveling risk never materialize as a concrete failure, setback, or near-disaster on the page. Her strategy (avoid patterns) works without serious challenge, so there’s little sense of narrowing options or forced trade-off beyond the pre-announced cost of “innocence.” The piece has tension in concept but limited felt pressure or escalation in execution.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether hope’s “shape” can be preserved without falsifying human experience—is clear and sharpened when the shadow begins to shift into “shades of violet and gold.” Elara’s agency drives the main turn; she initiates a risky, theorized-but-untried process rather than passively observing. Escalation is present but gentle, with tension expressed more in conceptual peril than in felt urgency or time pressure. The cost of her choice is legible, but the conflict never quite bites at a visceral level, keeping this just shy of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether she will harden or remain open after betrayal—is clearly signaled and maintained. Pressure deepens through the “shedding layers” structure as she moves from raw hurt to naivete, bitterness, and fear before arriving at a tempered compassion. Her final decision to “answer” tomorrow with “self-respect intact and her compassion refined” forecloses the path of complete withdrawal, giving the conflict real cost. However, the piece lacks a concrete external challenge or reversal in-scene, so the tension never quite tightens beyond a reflective simmer.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Aris’s need for psychic/emotional closure about his wound and gift—is signaled and followed through to the crystal. There is a clear tightening when the plants indicate a “vast emptiness” and he chooses to tunnel, but after that, progression is smooth and largely unopposed. The external conflict (reaching the chamber) never seriously threatens failure or exacts a concrete sacrifice; roots part the earth with minimal difficulty. As a result, tension is atmospheric rather than pressure-driven, and while the final realization lands, it doesn’t feel hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—discovering where unused love is stored—is clear, but it remains largely abstract and unopposed. Once Elara touches the film, everything unfolds without real blockage, doubt, or risk, so there’s no meaningful escalation beyond a deepening of description. Her “task” at the end emerges as a mission, yet it arrives without a real trade-off or loss on the page. As conflict, this is meditative rather than pressured, which undercuts narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.8)
    The core conflict—her blocked creativity versus the compulsion of unspoken words and cosmic noise—is conceptually strong but remains abstract on the page. Pressure does increase slightly with the “particularly vibrant aurora” and the tracing of a “brilliant falling star,” which trigger her realization about true rest as alignment. Yet there are no concrete failed attempts, trade-offs, or visible prices under pressure; once she understands, the blockage simply dissolves. The stakes (her creative life and peace of mind) are declared more than they’re felt through escalating, consequential choices.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can cultivate enough sparks to meaningfully re-ignite the world/time—is clear, and there is some escalation as sparks resist, her efforts multiply, and her hollowness deepens. Pressure grows texturally more than causally: the fractured lullaby grows louder, the number of sites increases, and her drain accumulates, culminating in a collective brightening. However, options never feel meaningfully narrowed; there’s no real sense that she might fail or that choosing to continue meaningfully forecloses an alternative. The conflict is therefore interesting and coherent but somewhat low-torque, resting more on mood than racheted stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—unlocking deeper understanding / reaching the forest’s cognitive core—is clearly signaled and followed through, but opposition is soft. The main “obstacles” (disorienting translocations, a jammed engine, decoding the wind-chorus) never seriously threaten failure or force a painful trade-off; inserting the gear resolves the central problem with little resistance. Escalation does occur as she moves from peripheral forest to deafening core, yet the pressure feels more like steadily increasing awe than conflict. The piece reads as a quest successfully completed rather than a struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will remain bound by fear or embrace an uncertain, self-directed path—is clear but only gently pressured. The walking vigil and the sigil moment provide a modest deepening, yet there’s little sense of risk, loss, or live alternative once she agrees to follow the guides. Internal conflict (“terrifying and vast” emptiness versus soothing guidance) is present but never forces a sharp trade-off beyond simply continuing forward. As a result, escalation feels contemplative rather than truly tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—living safely within a lie versus confronting the buried truth—is signaled and followed, and the deciding-to-remain-with-knowledge is a genuine stance crystallization. Yet escalation is mostly internal and recounted: the discovery of the tragedy and the subsequent moral pressure are summarized rather than shown in tightening beats. There’s little sense of loss along the way (no relationships strained, privileges threatened, or direct pushback from the institution), so the price of his stance stays somewhat abstract. Tension operates more as steady mood than as rising conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—unmasking Theron and restoring the true queen—is clearly signaled and returns at the climax. There is one solid tightening when the scholar discovers the message, prompting Theron’s direct move against Lorian. However, conflict remains largely abstract and pre-resolved: Lorian faces no real reversals, and Theron offers almost no active resistance once on-page, so the risk of failure never feels acute. The rune activation ends the conflict almost effortlessly, with little visible price beyond the usurper’s collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.4)
    The primary stake is psychological—whether Kaelen’s work has meaning in the wake of immense ecological loss and societal “moving on.” Pressure accumulates gently through the monotony and isolation of data cycles rather than via strong external opposition or a sharp dilemma. The delayed revelation about reemerging paths deepens their understanding but does not force a hard trade-off or visible sacrifice. As a result, escalation feels modest and reflective rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether the rebellion’s lull will ossify into defeat or transform into renewed purpose—is clear, and the discovery/activation of the stone circle provides one meaningful deepening of pressure. However, conflict is mostly atmospheric; nothing on page resists Elara’s goal once she commits, and the stone’s power is granted almost frictionlessly. The result feels more like a visionary initiation than a tested struggle, leaving escalation and cost relatively muted.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—how the community will reconstruct and whether tradition ossifies or evolves—is clear, but the pressure on that stake is soft. The unsealing itself carries no visible danger or ethical quandary; it succeeds on the first attempt with no real risk of failure or misinterpretation. The council is sketched as initially rigid but yields almost immediately once Elara speaks, so there’s little real clash or cost. Escalation exists conceptually but never fully tightens into felt threat or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will be paralyzed by her trauma trigger or able to stay present enough to keep tending life—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates in a quiet but coherent way: the aircraft hum reactivates the wedding, the photograph intensifies the pull into freeze, and her choice to breathe and move to the cliff’s edge is a real test of her coping tools. The price is her willingness to re-enter pain rather than avoid it, evidenced by the ritual of naming the dead and returning to work. The conflict remains internal and somewhat low-voltage, but the central turn (choosing not to freeze) is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elian can reconceive his artistic purpose without denying the painful truths he sees—is clear and steadily tightened through increasingly painful memories (especially the destroyed portrait). Each “thread” he untangles deepens the conflict rather than resetting it, culminating in the high-cost realization that he has been punished for seeing clearly, not for failing. The escalation is internal and lyrical rather than dramatic, but it does narrow options: self-erasure vs acceptance of being the kind of artist who maps darkness. Some tension diffuses in the reflective, rhetorical texture, slightly softening moment-to-moment urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—understanding why time slows in crisis—is signaled clearly, but the story offers minimal resistance to Kael’s goal. Once he begins the experiment, every step succeeds on first attempt: ink forms patterns, portal opens, he observes, understands, returns, with no genuine threat of failure or entrapment. There is a conceptual deepening (the shift from “objective” slowing to subjective expansion of consciousness), but it’s not accompanied by a true narrowing of options or a forced trade-off. As a result, tension remains low and the piece feels more like a controlled demonstration than a pressured experiment.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.8)
    The declared stakes—exposing a genocide and scandalizing the council—are enormous, and the ethical tension between duty and truth is conceptually rich. On the page, though, pressure barely escalates: she decides, uploads, and receives a surprisingly benign cascade of acknowledgments without meaningful resistance. Fear of punishment is recalled rather than dramatized through obstacles or near-failures. As a result, her choice feels brave in concept but not fully tested in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—maintaining and spreading a pocket of peace in a chaotic world—is declared but not strongly tested in scene. There is little active opposition; the chaos outside never breaches the dome, and the wanderers function as grateful recipients rather than sources of pressure or complication. Escalation is mostly asserted (“the chaos beyond the glass seemed to intensify”) without new demands or risks changing Elara’s options. Conflict thus feels static, with no meaningful trade-off or visible price paid beyond generalized endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—capturing the echo amid dangerous, unraveling patterns—is clear and the pressure increases modestly as the garden grows more chaotic and the constellations destabilize. However, each new threat (dissonant wave, star disruption, emotional turbulence) is quickly neutralized by the same set of tools (voicing silence, rail spike), so escalation never feels truly consequential. There’s no live option foreclosed or painful trade-off dramatized at the peak. The resolution reads as a competent execution of a plan rather than a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to uphold or expose her father’s legacy—arrives early via the journalist’s implication and tightens as each file undermines her initial assumption. The key escalation is the transition from wanting logical reassurance to confronting damning evidence and then deciding to publish a confession rather than a denial. Internal and external conflicts (truth vs loyalty; heiress vs witness) are intertwined and resolved through her agency. The stakes remain more conceptual than visceral; clearer anticipation of fallout could raise the felt tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.7)
    The central stake—whether Elara can quiet the accusatory sounds of her guilt—is clear and sustained, and the haunted firmware plus time-folding provide a credible source of pressure. There is one solid tightening when she chooses to integrate the amber and confront the baby’s cry instead of continuing to endure it. However, the opposition is soft: the firmware “lashes out” but never truly threatens to derail her, and every tactic works on the first try without visible sacrifice beyond emotional pain. The resolution feels relatively low-friction for the scale of the guilt invoked.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether a community stripped of its “facts” can find new shape and meaning—is clear and present early. Pressure does build, from background unease to a direct verbal challenge (“It’s all nonsense now!”) to the charged hush; Elara’s choice to answer via continued creation functions as her key stance under stress. However, escalation is more atmospheric than sharply tactical, and the resolution arrives somewhat gently, with little sense of real risk that her method might fail. The price of the new outlook (what is actually lost, for whom) is not strongly felt in concrete terms.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—escaping retrocognitive imprisonment enough to continue her mission—is clear, but pressure escalates gently rather than through sharp turns. The main tightening comes when the retrocognitive surge reveals the artisans and the “map,” prompting her to act, yet there’s little genuine resistance or viable alternative path. The renaming forecloses a prior identity and stance, but the emotional and practical risks of doing so are only lightly sketched. As a result, conflict feels more meditative than tense, limiting the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—transforming stagnant eternity into a new, redemptive ending—is clear and present throughout. There is a discernible escalation from intention to coin toss to echo-stitching under temporal resistance. However, the cost and risk feel muted: failure is named as “despair” and “void,” but on-page pressure never fully bites, and her success seems largely assured once the coin is activated. Internal conflict (redemption vs clinging to the encore) could be pushed harder to give the climax sharper teeth.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.3)
    The core stake—finding a way to reach or “lead back” Mara before her memories vanish—is clear, and the pressure of the pill’s limited window is mentioned. However, the conflict is largely unopposed: once he chooses somatic markers and light painting, everything proceeds without significant setback, doubt spike, or tactical adjustment. Escalation is more about accumulation of images than tightening of options or cost. As a result, tension never quite sharpens beyond a low, persistent ache.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are largely conceptual—whether Kaelen can become the voice of the unknown—without a counterforce or credible risk of failure. Escalation is present in a mild way (fossil floats → cave responds → inner chamber → Kaelen floats), but each turn is only a deepening of wonder rather than a narrowing of options or an increase in cost. There’s no moment where he must choose between competing values or endure a loss; the world seems eager to cooperate with his desire. The lack of friction undercuts tension, leaving the piece more like a guided initiation than a conflict with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—averting a prophesied doom—is clearly stated, and there is a conceptual tightening as cataloging frays the prophecy and the key amber button reorients the outcome. Yet on the page she encounters no resistance, dilemma, or visible threat of failure; each step works as intended. Her agency is active but untested, so tension remains intellectual and aesthetic rather than visceral. The lack of a concrete price or foreclosed alternative keeps the conflict functional rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stakes—personal redemption and exposing traitors—are clearly signaled early and paid off when the transmission succeeds under fire. There is some tightening (burned status, enemies closing in), but much of that pressure is told in a single line rather than incrementally felt. The enemy attack and Elias’s wounding arrive abruptly, without a prior on-page tactical squeeze or visible loss that forces adaptation. As a result, the climax works conceptually but lacks layered, escalating tension.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether he can distill his life and promise into a single guiding essence before the gutters fall silent—is evident, but remains largely internal and contemplative. Pressure does increase mildly as the ticking slows and his memories intensify, leading to a clear crystallization at the end. However, the conflict never seriously threatens to break him or present a live, painful alternative; there is little sense of what happens if he fails or chooses differently. As a result, escalation feels gentle rather than incisive.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is internal—Kael’s drive to understand resistance to change—and that question is answered, but the pressure remains gentle throughout. Escalation occurs primarily through intensification of sensory/temporal strangeness (thrum → visions → glowing glass), not through meaningful narrowing of his options. His core choice—to engage via meditation and then to accept participation by lifting and keeping the glass—remains low-friction and minimally contested. The result is thematically coherent but relatively low-tension for elite literary stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s need to re-ignite her purpose and soothe her grief after the rose’s last petal drops—is recognizable but under-pressured. There is no credible alternative path (giving up, breaking the ritual, rejecting her father’s legacy) dramatized on the page, so escalation is minimal; she simply follows her familiar pattern. The rowing and mirror work do not introduce complications or demands; they function as meditative fulfillment rather than contested action. As a result, the ending feels calm and earned in tone but not hard-won in terms of conflict or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will be shattered by her past or integrate it into independence—is clear, and the stone circle scene is a meaningful deepening. However, tension is low: nothing meaningfully threatens her or resists her goal, and the visions arrive as controlled revelations rather than tests that force agonizing choices. The hum “steadies her” almost immediately, smoothing over potential conflict. As a result, the resolution feels earned conceptually but not rigorously stress-tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s attempt to reconnect with her own capacity for unfiltered emotion—is clear and carries through to the end. Pressure escalates gently as the spiral grows and strangers’ secrets accumulate, leading to her crucial choice to enter the labyrinth herself and confront what she has avoided. However, conflict remains largely internal and low-friction; there are no strong reversals or external constraints testing her resolve, so the journey feels more contemplative than pressured. The cost of change is present but subtle, which limits the visceral sense of stakes compared to the thematic ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stakes—preventing cosmic-induced chaos and averting community violence—are signaled early and tightened by the explicit prohibition against unauthorized broadcasts. Escalation is coherent: the pattern that feels like a “taunt” raises pressure, leading to the decisive choice to interfere, then to Evans’s arrival as a final test of consequence. However, the external and internal conflicts resolve a bit too neatly; the ethical/political cost of disobedience is underexplored once Evans decides he was right. Tension is solid but could benefit from a sharper, less assured outcome or a more lingering price.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.2)
    The primary stakes—surviving/contending with spatial mutiny while managing debilitating claustrophobia to obtain the key—are conceptually clear but thinly dramatized. Escalation is mostly asserted (“mutiny intensified,” “claustrophobia threatened to overwhelm”) without corresponding concrete obstacles, missteps, or forced trade-offs; Elara never seriously considers retreat or fails at an attempt. The organ’s calming influence resolves pressure quickly each time rather than generating new dilemmas, so the conflict curve feels flat. The resolution is fully successful with no visible cost beyond a declared inner shift.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—reviving empathy and understanding Isabelle’s fate—is articulated, but pressure remains largely internal and reflective. There is a modest escalation as Elara moves from general pondering to a specific scenario (snagged ribbon, outstretched hand, accident vs. murder). However, options never feel sharply opposed or mutually costly; no tactical choices close doors in a way the reader can feel. Conflict thus reads thoughtful but relatively static, more meditative reconstruction than lived dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—posthumous exoneration of the ancestor—is explicit from the outset and carries through to closure. There is a basic escalation from archival puzzle to physical retrieval to institutional judgment, but each stage yields fairly easily once entered, with minimal real resistance from Roy or the committee. Much of the “pressure” is internalized as reiterated dread rather than concrete dilemmas or credible risk of failure. As a result, the climax reads more as a procedural success than a hard-won, high-cost choice.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake is internal—can he interpret the hitchhiker’s disappearance as meaningful rather than annihilating—and this is signaled clearly. Pressure, however, is low and largely unopposed: once he starts watching the scaffold wrap, every subsequent move simply confirms a single, reassuring interpretation. There is a gentle tightening when he shifts from confusion to playing a “bridge” rather than a lament, but no meaningful trade-off or costed renunciation. As a result, the story feels more like a graceful meditation than a conflict-driven scene.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—whether Leo will repeat or reject his father’s path—is clear and tied to the encounter with the squatter, which serves as the main external conflict. The pressure does deepen once another person is on the line and Leo must choose how to use inherited knowledge (markers) ethically. However, the squatter yields fairly quickly, with limited tension or genuine risk; Leo never has to sacrifice something tangible beyond nostalgia and an abstract attachment to the place. As a result, escalation feels modest rather than bracing, appropriate but not fully exploited.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—decoding inscriptions to alleviate communal suffering—is asserted but not meaningfully tested or escalated in scene. There’s no opposing force, time pressure, or real risk of failure; understanding “dawns” twice without a substantial price or trade-off. Internal conflict (fatigue, doubt, grief) is mentioned but never sharpened into a choice that forecloses a path. As a result, pressure remains relatively flat despite the lofty thematic claims.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—unbending the curse-confession to free her people and herself—is established early and followed through, but on-page pressure remains relatively abstract. The text warns of flesh-eating seeds and a violent vortex, yet Elara never faces a serious setback, reversal, or time pressure; her first attempt at the ritual succeeds without visible risk taken or trade-off weighed. Internal and external conflicts are thematically linked but not sharply opposed in any single beat. As a result, the resolution is earned enough, but the journey feels low-friction for the scale of what’s at stake.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—restoring the eclipsed covenant by reaching the intersection of dreams—is signaled early and carried through to Elara’s choice to step into the portal. Conflict is primarily internal (duty/roots vs. curiosity/future) with the externalized covenant as pressure; this escalates once blood is drawn and the portal appears, a clear tightening. However, resistance feels modest: there’s little sense that she might actually refuse or that stepping through could cause real harm to her or the glade. The resolution comes relatively easily once the portal appears, with cost mostly framed in abstract emotional terms rather than a specific hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.9)
    The central stake—whether she can repair her soul through symbolic control—is clear, and the keeper’s challenge tightens this into a choice between forcing meaning and accepting truth. There is one meaningful turn when she chooses “fiercely gentle…surrender” and changes her tactic. Still, pressure feels soft: there’s little sense of what she risks losing if she cannot change, and no sustained escalation beyond the single admonition. The resolution arrives smoothly without a sharp test of commitment or visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Leo will find a way to live with failure and repurpose his past—is clear from early on. Yet the pressure remains mostly internal and relatively static; Mara’s arrival increases emotional exposure but doesn’t substantially corner him into a hard trade-off. His choice to combine roadie and appraiser skills is logical but arrives without facing a significant on-page cost or viable alternative, so escalation feels modest rather than tightening. The emotional stakes matter, but the scene never quite forces him into a painful decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are largely intellectual and spiritual—Elian wants understanding—and they never face sharp on-page resistance. The pressure doesn’t escalate so much as gently accumulate: the seed glows more, his thinking clarifies, and the vision sequence simply confirms his line of thought. There is no credible alternative outcome or difficult trade-off; his method works on the first try without meaningful loss or sacrifice. As a result, tension remains mild and the resolution feels serene rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are largely declared (identities might “shatter under the moon’s pull”) rather than tested in concrete, pressurized moments. The core conflict—volatile identities versus Elian’s effort to preserve their coherence—never genuinely tightens; his method works smoothly on each identity with no real risk, setback, or sacrifice. The repetition of the smelting process, while thematically consistent, does not escalate or complicate the situation. As a result, tension stays low and the piece feels meditative rather than conflict-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict remains largely internal and low-friction: his “hesitation” at the door barely registers as tension before the shell redirects him. Once he starts reading, there’s no real resistance to his change of heart, no competing obligations or fears that force a trade-off. Stakes are conceptually large (hope vs. mere survival) but on the page they don’t escalate, and there’s no testing moment where he must sacrifice something to act on his insight. The result is moving but relatively flat in pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—finding a path to self-forgiveness—is explicit early and pursued throughout. Pressure does tighten from abstract longing to a concrete test in the bathroom and then a vulnerable act of playing the accordion. However, the conflict resolves somewhat easily once she reads the graffiti line; there’s little resistance or relapse after the insight. The cost of change is more implied than actively fought through, keeping tension solid but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—reaching the Library before the second letter—exists but is rarely felt as a true risk; failure never feels concretely consequential. Reversals in the cipher and mist behavior offer technical complications but don’t force moral or emotional trade-offs. The threshold shimmer and last-minute reversal are structurally appropriate escalations yet resolve almost immediately once she consults her notes. Pressure rises a bit, but the cost of success remains low and mostly procedural.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the violin will propagate freedom (wild growth) or imperial control—is clearly signaled and sharpened by the ticking dawn deadline. Pressure escalates when the coffee stains reveal the violin’s true potential, forcing Elara to crystallize her stance; the second note and bursting seeds pay this off as an irrevocable choice. Internal and external stakes interweave: her mulberry ache, the plants’ need, and the Empire’s demand collide in that moment. The main limitation is that opposition remains abstract (no on-page counterforce from the Empire), so conflict leans heavily on interior turmoil rather than felt, adaptive struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=4.2)
    The dominant stake—whether she can capture the final spark before oblivion—is declared but never truly tested in scene. There is no credible risk of failure dramatized: no interruption, faltering concentration, or backlash that forces a new tactic or trade-off. As a result, escalation is minimal; the chip simply grows brighter until it works. The ending reads as a straightforward success rather than an earned resolution with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central stake—finding contentment after a profound betrayal—is compelling in premise but remains largely internal and low-friction on the page. Pressure does not significantly tighten; Elara never faces a concrete dilemma where she might genuinely choose avoidance or bitterness, and the hairpin’s glow delivers revelation with minimal resistance. The ritual scalloping and tree-climbing provide activity but not escalating stakes or real trade-offs. As a result, tension is more meditative than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—whether Elara can relinquish rigid certainty—is clear and remains coherent throughout. Escalation is modest but present: her certainty frays via the chimes reading, the mirror confrontation, and finally the cloak transfer, with each step deepening her doubt and agency. The conflict stays entirely internal/relational, and there is no real sense of what she risks losing by adopting nuance beyond her prior self-concept. As a result, the tension is more meditative than gripping, effective for a quiet piece but not maximally charged.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake is Kael’s willingness to let his sense of self dissolve to achieve “vanishing to appear,” and there is a clear tightening when fear arises and the magnetism intensifies. However, the conflict remains largely internal and relatively smooth—once Elara says “Do not resist,” his fear ebbs quickly and there’s little sense of a genuinely risky alternative path. The withholding of explanation offers some tension, but no major option is dramatically foreclosed on the page. As a result, escalation feels graceful rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s quest to navigate without moving by anchoring a wandering pulse—is signaled early, but pressure remains low. Events unfold with minimal resistance; each step (birds reveal pattern, echo carries pulse, humming succeeds) functions more as a planned sequence than as escalating tests. There is a cadence shift at the crescendo of echoes, yet no option is seriously foreclosed nor any failure risked on the page. As a result, tension is more meditative than gripping, which weakens stakes at this length and ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake is spiritual: whether Elian can find genuine, non-automated sacredness and a purpose in that pursuit. There is one main tightening—his decision to use the keystone to reach the rumored hidden garden—which leads to the flower encounter and the spire’s transformation. Yet external and internal pressures remain soft: the “treacherous” journey has no concrete obstacles, and there is no real risk of failure, moral conflict, or competing desire that could make the choice costly. As a result, tension is gentle and the final gain is not meaningfully opposed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s quest to perceive the color of sound—is clear but faces almost no opposition; his journey is a sequence of lucky alignments rather than tested commitment. Once he finds the key tag, everything unfolds without serious risk, conflict, or trade-off: the boat is secured, the dive succeeds, the library is accessible, the key fits. The orb’s revelation carries awe but not danger, moral dilemma, or sacrifice, so escalation is more about spectacle than pressure. For a high bar, the lack of real tension or competing priorities holds this category back significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether there is purpose after universal contraction—is clear but remains largely philosophical. There is a mild tightening when the coins fall in an unprecedented sequence and when static bursts intensify, but these do not force hard trade-offs or foreclose options; Elara never seriously considers stopping or failing. Her “decision” is essentially an interpretive acceptance rather than a choice under genuine pressure. As a result, conflict feels low-grade and stakes remain conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether he can transform his unresolved grief and nameless fears into something understood and bearable—is clear and followed through. Pressure deepens as the shards form, specific fears are named, and her final phrase is re-heard as blessing rather than curse, culminating in his choice to accept a quieter, lighter duty. However, conflict remains largely internal and meditative, with minimal escalation or real threat that his attempt might fail or cost him something irrevocable beyond sadness. The piece trades intensity for lyric steadiness, which works but limits tension.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring the river and cosmic balance—is clearly signaled, and Elian’s mediocrity plus the bell’s brokenness provide an initial sense of pressure. Yet escalation is mild: the only meaningful setback is a slipping fragment cutting his finger, after which progress proceeds linearly to success. There’s no serious possibility of failure, no reversal that forces a new tactic, and no moral or emotional tradeoff beyond simple perseverance. The result is thematically tidy but dramatically under-pressurized for the scale of the declared stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the community will continue to treat the submerged town as a ghostly wound or integrate it as living heritage—is clear but under-pressured. Conflict is almost entirely internal and socialized, with no active resistance or meaningful risk to Elias’s choice to tell stories. The main “tightening” is his decision to speak publicly and the group’s choice to create a memorial garden, both of which come without pushback or real trade-off. As a result, escalation is modest and the sense of cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.2)
    The central stake—whether she can truly harmonize logic and intuition before the Great Work—is articulated, but on-page pressure never tightens beyond a brief hesitation about how to apply the flame. There is no serious alternative outcome dramatized; failure is conceptually possible but not felt as a live option. Her decision to warm rather than melt is the one clear tightening beat, yet it resolves the conflict cleanly without visible sacrifice. As a result, tension reads as gentle contemplation rather than escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—correctly interpreting the anomaly to preserve trust and prevent unseen danger—is clear, and pressure coherently tightens as data grows anomalous and forces a full protocol revision. The key turn (realizing the pattern signals a rare celestial event, not danger) is directly tied to her agency in revising the analysis. However, the external consequences of failure remain abstract and offstage, so the stakes feel more conceptual than visceral. The internal conflict between fear/anxiety and trained competence is present but underdeveloped; we rarely see her genuinely doubt or waver.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stakes—who controls the clone and whether Kael can break his numbness while anchoring a chaotic timeline—are clearly framed. Conflict escalates from philosophical opposition (Archivists vs. Vitalists) to Kael’s proposal of a risky, identity-redefining merge. Yet there is no real reversal or hard test: no credible threat that his plan will be refused or will fail, and no concrete cost imposed by either faction. The pressure grows conceptually but never quite tightens into a moment where a real option is foreclosed with visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Elara will protect her innovative space from homogenizing corporate pressure—is declared but not actively tested in-scene. The corporate entity exists only in recalled summary, so the antagonistic force never exerts live pressure on the page. The only “conflict” is her curiosity about the seed and interpreting its meaning, which resolves without resistance once she lands on the escape-room concept. As a result, escalation is minimal and the final decision carries little visible risk or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether he can restore laughter despite the cost of reawakened pain—is legible and carried through to the end. Escalation is present but gentle: additional blowers, louder singing, and the tunnel’s trembling build to a sonic crescendo that births the first giggle. The price (that restoring joy sharpens the memory of loss) is stated and thematically credible, but it doesn’t significantly constrain his tactics or produce a hard on-page trade-off in the moment. The conflict therefore reads more as a solemnly executed ritual than as genuine struggle under tightening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—cling to the known safety of the remembered library or surrender to the garden’s uncertainty—is clear and is tightened when the pendant reveals itself as a key. The main escalation is internal: moving from passive waiting to an active, high-cost stance of entering the “between.” However, much of the piece reiterates the same emotional pressure without fresh complications, so the sense of mounting risk remains somewhat abstract. The choice at the end is meaningful but not viscerally contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—break the “stifling destiny” and vivify the crozier—is clearly signaled early and culminates in one central tightening: his decision to risk total destruction. The internal conflict between fear of loss and need for transformation is coherent, and the “penny drops” realization functions as the key turn. However, external opposition is minimal, and once he commits, success comes without complication, so the sense of price and danger remains somewhat abstract. A more concrete or partial loss would increase felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central stake—whether she can locate and interpret the elusive signal—is clear but remains largely abstract and low-pressure. The main escalation is conceptual: shifting from seeking volume to seeking absence, which is thematically apt but not dramatically tense. There’s no meaningful cost to failure depicted, nor any visible sacrifice to achieve success, so the conflict never quite tightens into necessity. The resulting resolution feels more like a well-executed thought experiment than a hard-won victory under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are high in concept (the scattered ferry and its passengers) and clearly stated, but the on-page conflict is almost entirely problem-solving without meaningful resistance. Once the patterns and hourglass function are noticed, there’s no strong escalation of risk, no failed attempt, and no explicit sense of what’s lost if Eli misaligns or cannot complete the alignment. The pressure does rise somewhat with the chorus of voices and pulsing grotto, yet the path to success feels relatively unopposed, which blunts tension.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central pressure—her enchantments destabilizing and threatening to overwrite her history—has strong potential, and the tapestry’s eruption is a clear turning point. Yet Elara never feels truly cornered; she remains “calm,” resumes weaving in essentially the same way, and the eruption quickly becomes a controllable transformation rather than a real threat. There’s little sense of a path closed or a price paid beyond accepting a new understanding. The stakes play more like a gentle philosophical adjustment than a conflict that tightens and exacts visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central pressures—teaching meaningfully in the shadow of alien contact and keeping human orientation toward the stars alive—are clear but remain largely internal and low-friction. The main tightening is Elara noticing Kael’s disengagement and expanding her approach, which provides some progression but little real cost or foreclosed option. Alien discovery and reworked navigation systems raise implied stakes but never materialize as on-page conflict beyond mood. The ending crystallizes stance rather than resolving a sharply escalated dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—rescuing Eleanor from oblivion via remembrance—is conceptually strong but never meaningfully threatened on the page. The “pressure” escalates mainly via intensifying pulses, without real resistance, uncertainty, or risk of failure. Elara’s assurances work immediately; Eleanor’s cooperation is quick, so there’s no sharp test of Elara’s methods or resolve. As a result, the story feels more like a quiet procedure than a conflict that tightens toward a hard-won outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes (survive the shifting facility and make it out before the tides seal her in) are clear and present early. There is visible escalation as she moves through denser phase instability (gaseous barrier, rippling walls) toward the core and then races back amid changing currents. However, the conflict path is linear and largely unopposed beyond environmental description; there’s no major reversal or moment where a real option is foreclosed or a sacrifice is required. Tension works but never fully bites down.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can reconfigure her relationship to her catastrophic failure and Kael’s death—is legible from early on. Pressure does tighten: her heartbeat-counting accelerates, images of the explosion and her ignored warnings crystallize, and she must mentally confront her responsibility. The key turn comes when the chaotic memory stream becomes “a series of distinct, understandable choices,” enabling acceptance. However, the conflict remains largely internal and contemplative, and the story never seriously entertains the possibility of her refusing or failing the ritual, which softens the sense of jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central conflict—Elara versus the cursed diamond in the context of saving a language—is clearly established, and tension escalates from eerie observation to direct psychic assault. The beat where the curse pushes back, “a thousand shattered whispers scraping at her thoughts,” is the pivotal tightening. Her decision to stop resisting and instead mimic the starlings’ pattern provides a credible internal resolution. However, the lack of on-page consequence from this new tactic blunts the felt stakes and keeps the conflict from fully cresting.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—transforming communal bitterness into something wild and freeing—is clear, but the on-page conflict is soft. There is no substantive opposition: the confessions don’t resist him, the garden’s forces never threaten to go wrong, and Aris’s strategy works on the first try. His choice to answer pain with laughter could be ethically or emotionally fraught, yet those tensions aren’t tested in scene. As a result, the metamorphosis reads more as a planned inevitability than an earned victory with discernible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—reawakening beauty and freeing the orchard from mechanical control—is clear, but pressure escalates only minimally. The statues “track her every step” yet never threaten or impede her, and the Warden quivers and cracks almost immediately once she plays, reducing suspense. There is one main tightening—moving from distant playing to uprooting the crystal—but it lacks a felt price or real risk beyond the abstract. As a result, tension feels more ceremonial than fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are inherently high—illegal subversion of border drones to reconnect divided families—but they stay abstract, repeatedly described rather than tested. The only real pressure is the impending drone arrival, which occurs exactly as expected; there’s no on-page surveillance threat, near-miss, or moral cross-pressure to tighten the scene. As a result, the conflict feels static and contemplative, with resolution arriving through completion of a routine rather than escalation-driven choice.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is whether Elias can transform this dead, silent place into a living “oasis” of potential—and, more subtly, whether he will remain purely silent or risk using his voice. There is one meaningful tightening when he shifts from silent labor into singing, which reweights the space and activates the halo fragment. However, conflict remains very low-pressure; there is no true resistance, deadline, or real threat of failure. The result is stately and beautiful but short on escalation for a top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s drive to locate “the place where stories live”—is clear, and the geometry ritual plus doorway functions as the main tightening. However, there is almost no opposition or escalation: once she begins the process, everything unfolds smoothly with no meaningful risk of failure or alternative path. Internal conflict (fear of loss, uncertainty about crossing, risk to the library or herself) is largely absent, so tension never meaningfully sharpens. The resolution is thus earned causally but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.2)
    The primary stake—capturing the runaway dream and understanding her own unnamed longing—is clear from early on and does culminate in a real shift. The main escalation comes via time pressure (the coming sunrise) and the dream’s resistance, which she overcomes by intensifying effort and investment. Conflict, however, remains relatively frictionless: nothing credibly threatens failure, and her success never seems in serious doubt, so the cost of the pursuit feels modest. The final renunciation (not owning the dream, accepting it as memory) is thematically apt but under-dramatized on the level of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.5)
    The central conflict—Elian versus fear’s imprisoning of an idea—is conceptually strong but on the page it feels almost unopposed. The supposed antagonistic forces (“guardians of fear,” disorientation, vertigo) appear briefly and are overcome without meaningful tactical adjustment or visible cost beyond momentary dizziness. Stakes are framed as world- and cosmos-level but experienced mainly as a ritual proceeding as expected, so escalation is minimal. The resolution therefore reads more like inevitable fulfillment of a task than a pressured, narrowing confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering stolen memories and, by extension, restoring a balance with the land—is clear from early on. Pressure does deepen when the haze appears and the vision reveals the true nature of her grandfather’s bargain. However, Elara never faces a genuine alternative, setback, or moral bind; once she starts realigning mushrooms, success feels inevitable, and there is no visible price she must pay now beyond transient pain. The conflict thus reads more as a puzzle calmly solved than as a tested commitment with narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elian can internalize resilience enough to reverse his exile—is clear and consistently pressed. Pressure escalates from his resistance to a concrete interpretive task (annotating where light fails/holds), culminating in a perceptual reframe that enables him to leave. However, conflict remains mostly intellectual and emotional without a sharp on-page price; his breakthrough comes after relatively gentle friction. The archivist’s nervousness adds a secondary tension but never threatens to derail the process.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—the orchard losing its color of wonder—is announced, but the narrative provides no real opposition; every step of the ritual succeeds on the first try. There is no tightening turn where options narrow or a path is credibly threatened; pressure remains flat and contemplative rather than escalating. Elara never has to choose between competing goods or accept a visible loss; her “work is never done” reads as a gentle truism, not a sharpened cost. As a result, conflict feels largely symbolic rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—freeing/grounding trapped spirits from a dangerous, accumulated silence—is clear from early on. There is some escalation as each knot intensifies the hush and the needle slip suggests real peril, but the conflict never forces a difficult trade-off or visible sacrifice. The “interlaced hush” concept fights back in language, yet practically the process proceeds without serious setback or narrowing of options. As a result, tension exists more as atmosphere than as felt, tightening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—bridging known and unknown by reopening the whispered chapel—is clear but never feels truly pressured. There’s no substantial resistance: once she identifies the fissure, it opens with patient tool work; her guardedness is mentioned but not dramatized as a live obstacle. The comparison of footage is an intellectual puzzle rather than a tightening conflict, and no option is meaningfully foreclosed or paid for beyond effort. As a result, escalation feels procedural rather than tense.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central stake—Elara’s need to understand and reconfigure her relationship to death and letting go—is clear but largely internal and philosophical. There is little escalation: no concrete external threat, deadline, or serious obstacle; she investigates, finds the key artifacts, understands, and leaves, all without a genuine test or trade-off. Her final vow to release the ghosts she carries does foreclose a prior mode of being, but it hasn’t been materially challenged or complicated in-scene. As a result, tension stays low and the story reads more like a graceful meditation than a pressured conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can finally be “heard” and encode others’ unspoken needs—is clearly signaled, but it is never genuinely in doubt. There is no antagonist, no misfire of the ritual, no visible price for failure, and no on-page moment where she must sacrifice or choose between competing goods. The arrival of the ghost and the success of the encoding feel almost given once she begins painting, so tension stays conceptual rather than visceral. As a result, escalation is minimal and the climax lands more as a pretty fulfillment than a hard-won turn.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and contemplative, with no real opposition beyond Elara’s prior melancholy. The diary’s revelations deepen her understanding but never force a difficult trade-off, and there is no credible risk to her goal during the ascent. The “ten floors” structure gestures at a ticking frame, yet nothing in the scene would break if the ride were longer or shorter. As a result, stakes feel abstract and the emotional turn, while pleasant, is low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are articulated—Elias wants to prove that emptiness remembers and fears being forgotten—but they remain abstract and untested. There is no genuine threat to his project (no dwindling resources, danger, or opposing force), and no hard trade-off required to achieve his insight. The “realization” that the sky is a library largely aligns with his starting belief rather than overturning it, so escalation feels more like accumulation than tightening pressure. As a result, the ending’s peace comes cheaply, with minimal on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—capturing the true, infinite sky in a doomed space before demolition—is clearly signaled and coherently pursued. Escalation comes through accumulating constraints (time, the missing “key” knowledge, the safe’s puzzle) and culminates in the realization that her apparent victory is conceptually a failure. The internal conflict between mastery/control and acceptance of limits surfaces most strongly at the end but could be more dramatized in the middle beats. The demolition rumble is a solid external punctuation, though the tension stays mostly intellectual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—discovering a hidden air current that could transform navigation—is clearly declared and followed through, but never feels truly pressured on the page. Conflict is largely internal/procedural (can she decode this pattern?) with no real opposition, time crunch, or competing goal; the captain’s immediate acceptance removes any social or institutional resistance. Escalation is modest: noticing → decoding → reporting → course change, with no real jeopardy of failure or visible price for being wrong. As a result, tension exists conceptually but doesn’t deepen into anything gripping or costly.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will discover a usable “rhythm of repair”—is stated early and technically resolved at the mirror-vial climax. Still, tension never sharpens beyond gentle curiosity; the prophecy search, gear acquisition, and uncapping all proceed with near-certain success and no real trade-offs. There’s no credible alternative path or visible loss if she failed, so the final gain feels low-risk. Conflict remains mostly internal and abstract, without a pronounced tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—will they transform a fragile, traumatized existence into something sustainable and peaceful by trusting this ghost-led plan—is legible from early on. Pressure does escalate modestly as they invest weeks of labor and their limited energy, and Jax’s call to “reexamine this whole plan” is the key tightening beat. However, conflict remains largely internal and conceptual; there’s minimal tangible loss or sacrifice dramatized beyond fatigue and anxiety, so the cost of recommitting never quite bites. The resolution comes swiftly once they double down, leaving little room for a final, tested trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—granting one last moment of peace to all existence—is clear and substantial, and the ticking doomsday clock offers an inherent deadline. Yet the conflict is largely unopposed; there is little sense that she might fail, and no true reversal or hard tradeoff beyond the expected self-sacrifice. Her life-force entwining with the melody is a meaningful cost, but it arrives as an inevitability rather than the culmination of contested choices. Tension operates more as solemn inevitability than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—saving the travelers before the night frost—is clear and present early, with the ticking clock and patrolling birds tightening pressure. Escalation is steady: device assembly under time pressure, then threading the birds’ patrols, then closing just as frost forms. Internal conflict (resentment vs obligation) is present but not deeply sharpened into explicit trade-offs beyond risk and emotional burden. The cost is more ongoing duty and danger than an immediate sacrifice, which works but feels somewhat gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Aris will remain trapped in paralyzing guilt or convert it into meaningful atonement—is clear and coherent. There is one meaningful deepening when tracing foam leads to a reframing of “transient bonds” and points him toward Elena’s biodegradable polymer work. However, escalation is mostly conceptual; there’s little sense of narrowing options, reversible choices, or visible sacrifice beyond internal reframing, so tension stays relatively low. The resolution feels earned but low-pressure, more reflective than truly tested under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.3)
    The dominant stake appears to be whether Elara can transcend her initial erasure-based business model to reach “the place where stories begin” and reframe her purpose. There is a single, mild tightening when she uses the bottled moonlight to incise the veil, but the library never pushes back, and the realm of beginnings welcomes her without cost or danger. Internal conflict (fear, doubt, attachment to her original business model) is gestured at but never truly tests her commitment; once she acts, everything works. As a result, tension is low and escalation is minimal, leaving the piece more meditative than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Kaelen can absorb and transform this collective remorse without being broken by it—is clear but stays mostly conceptual. Pressure increases modestly as he moves deeper, touches the pillar, and the “air thick with shared sorrow” signals a peak of intensity. Yet he never faces a concrete moment where he might have to stop, retreat, or accept a significant loss to continue; his path feels ordained rather than contested. As a result, tension is steady but low, and the price of success does not fully bite on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—reuniting siloed villages by repairing the clock—is clearly articulated early, but on-page opposition is minimal. The three representatives are skeptical in premise, yet they offer their expertise almost immediately and no serious conflict, ethical tension, or practical obstacle threatens failure. There is a single gentle tightening when they begin working together and Elara guides their perceptions, but no genuine trade-off or loss marks the climax. This keeps tension pleasant rather than gripping, undercutting the claim of high communal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s internal transformation via integrating abandoned dreams—is clear, but the conflict is nearly frictionless. Each step into deeper memories (“stories of love shattered by war,” the child’s flying dream) reads as an intensification, yet she encounters no substantive resistance, doubt, or risk of failure. The text gestures at turbulence (“turbulent journey,” “quaking in her very bones”) but doesn’t dramatize a real trade-off or moment where she might refuse or break. As a result, escalation is more a steady climb in imagery than a pressured narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—recovering the “forgotten combinations” that encode reality—is signaled early and carried through, and the threshold effects provide a plausible external obstacle. However, escalation remains mostly linear and undramatic: each new challenge is declared and then passed without a strong reversal, sacrifice, or moment where failure feels genuinely possible. Stakes are grand in premise (“keep the world in balance”) but remain abstract on the page, with no concrete consequences sketched for failure beyond implication. Her agency is real but rarely conflicted; she decides to press on and then succeeds.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—restoring music to a silent world—is clear, but on-page resistance is minimal. Once Elara discovers the insulator, there are no real setbacks, doubts, or alternatives; her approach works on the first attempt. The main “tightening” is conceptual (interpreting the cracks, then playing), rather than actual narrowing of options with cost. As a result, the piece is more contemplative than pressurized, which limits its conflict score.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can restore or irrevocably lose the covenant before the celestial “next phase”—is clearly signaled. There is one meaningful tightening when twilight deepens, the nexus pulses, and he aligns the dent with the lodestone ridge, triggering the vision and partial restoration. However, opposition and cost are light: he encounters no real resistance, failure mode, or sacrifice beyond effort and emotional strain. The result is a gentle escalatory curve that feels more contemplative than truly pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—recovering the diary and its final entries before fireworks disrupt the stillness—is articulated, but never truly sharpened into a consequential dilemma. The “distant rumble” and arrival of fireworks hint at a ticking clock, yet nothing significant seems at risk of being lost if she failed or were interrupted. Internal conflict is mild: her urgency versus the surrounding noise, but she never faces a meaningful trade-off or sacrifice. The result is a gentle escalation rather than a felt tightening of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—proving her skill and accessing the corpse flower’s wisdom versus finding genuine serenity—is clear, but the pressure remains low-key and largely interior. There is a single meaningful tightening when the new scent appears and she must re-evaluate her approach, yet she is never forced into a difficult trade-off with visible cost. The conflict between her ambition and the need for patience is articulated but not fully stress-tested on the page. As a result, escalation reads more as a gentle deepening than a genuine narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—discover the source of Veridia’s resilience—is clear, and the one-hour inversion theoretically provides time pressure. But conflict is minimal: there’s no meaningful opposition, no hard trade-offs, and no sense that failure would carry an on-page cost beyond lost data. Escalation is mostly informational (learning about the caretakers) rather than pressure-based, so the piece lacks a true tightening turn where options visibly narrow. The result feels more like a successful field trip than a consequential test.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.9)
    The primary conflict is investigative and thematic—Elias versus the puzzle of the crash and the moral imperative to turn tragedy into foresight. Pressure escalates modestly as he moves deeper into the maze, finds the patch, and reaches the twisted containers where his reconstruction sharpens. However, there is little on-page jeopardy or sharply narrowing options; the wind threatens balance but never truly endangers or corners him. The cost manifests more as solemn comprehension than a felt sacrifice or forced trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—liberating wonder to prove its essential nature—is declared, but it remains largely abstract and untested on the page. There is anticipation and a mild sense of “will it work now,” yet no genuine resistance, competing demand, or risk of failure; the aurora arrives, the chisel strikes, and the plan succeeds seamlessly. Escalation is mostly tonal (the hush “deepens”) rather than driven by narrowing options or sharpened costs. As a result, the climax feels beautiful but frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—whether Kael can extract usable wisdom from his failure rather than be broken by it—is clear and present throughout. Conflict is almost entirely internal: enduring the pain of rewatching his failures and parsing their patterns, guided by the flute. There is one main tightening beat when he moves from preparation into otherworld traversal and confronts multiple versions of his failure, but the prose rarely makes this feel truly risky or potentially derailing. The result is a thoughtful, coherent arc with modest tension rather than a deeply gripping crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—pursuing an abstract understanding at the risk of losing herself—is well signaled and coherently escalated through increasingly overwhelming empathy and personality layering. Each new imprint raises the internal cost, culminating in despair and the risky decision to let her essence flow into the fragment. The final renunciation (shelving the now inert halo) closes off a path and implies continuing cost: she accepts partial knowledge and the end of this method. Still, the threat level remains somewhat conceptual; a clearer sense of what she might irretrievably lose could sharpen the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake is internal—whether Kaelen will remain a routine courier or become a conscious bearer of wonder and stories—signaled early and revisited at the end. Pressure is gentle: the traveler’s arrival and the pendant’s activation deepen reflection, but there’s little sense of risk, dilemma, or competing obligations to force a hard choice. The encounter prolongation is interesting conceptually, yet it doesn’t escalate into a moment where he must trade off comfort, safety, or loyalty for insight. The resulting arc is satisfying but low-tension, more contemplative than truly tested.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—proving her theory versus confronting what it reveals about her—is legible, and there is a clear deepening when the visions shift from others’ emotions to her own past betrayal. However, the conflict remains largely internal and contemplative, without a strong sense of competing values forcing a difficult trade-off. Once the darker vision appears, she accepts it without serious resistance; the cost feels muted. The piece has one meaningful turn but doesn’t press that turn into a genuinely fraught choice.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes—both intimate (reaching Liam) and cosmic (world unravelling)—are declared and consistent, and the cost of success (her dissolution) is explicit. Pressure does escalate via the advancing silence and her draining vitality, culminating in the bead’s flare and her step into the light. However, conflict remains relatively one-directional: there is little sense of alternative tactics, reversals, or genuine doubt about whether she will pay the price. As a result, the climax reads moving but somewhat foregone rather than sharply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—gaining and applying the secret of resilience, both personally and metallurgically—is clear, but pressure remains low and mostly untested. The mage’s warning that “awakening…comes at a cost” never sharpens into a specific dilemma or sacrifice on the page; Elian agrees without hesitation and encounters no real resistance. The forging process is described as slow and requiring patience, yet he “never wavered,” so there is little escalation, reversal, or narrowing of options beyond time passing. The conflict is more conceptual than dramatized, which undercuts tension.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—unearthing the withheld truth—is clearly signaled and carries emotional potential. There is some gestured urgency via the cyclic peak of his power and the need to stabilize the rift quickly. Yet the conflict remains mostly one-sided: Kaelen decides to weave; the universe yields visions; the rift opens; he stabilizes it with apparent competence and no genuine threat of failure. Because no option is sharply foreclosed and no tangible price is paid beyond emotional knowledge, escalation feels mild rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—keep the channel safe by restoring/redirecting the light—is clear early via the darkened lighthouse and Cora’s plea. Pressure escalates texturally (spectral cold intensifying, letters revealing a malevolent presence) and causally (his choice to build a guidance cairn, then face and relight the lamp). Elian’s agency drives the resolution, but his success comes without a truly sharp trade-off or visible loss, keeping the conflict emotionally quieter than the premise might allow. As a result, tension is strong but not quite piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are largely abstract—shaping a “new dawn,” cleansing through storm, offering “tangible truths”—and no concrete threat tests them. The storm is framed as inevitable and welcome, not something to resist or navigate with trade-offs. Kael’s routine continues essentially unimpeded; the gathering clouds and intensifying visions register as tonal heightening, not as genuine narrowing of options or moral calculus. Conflict exists conceptually (destruction vs renewal) but stays un dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—whether he can meaningfully understand why stories magnetize to certain people—is signaled, but opposition is entirely internal and lightly stressed. Escalation is mostly textural: the light patterns intensify, symbols appear, and the scope of his insight widens to encompass “fates intertwined.” There is one meaningful deepening as he connects the donor heart to story-magnetism, but it doesn’t force a hard trade-off or visible sacrifice. As a result, tension remains gentle and meditative rather than sharpening toward a pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s need to deconstruct her quantified sorrow and learn what trees witness—is clear, but the pressure on that stake is mild. After the “clink” from below signals a shift, there is no real complication, reversal, or trade-off; her chosen method works on the first attempt without visible cost or genuine test of resolve. Internal and external conflicts stay aligned but largely unchallenged, so escalation reads more like a steady unfurling than a tightening. The ending thus feels serene rather than truly earned under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—world sliding into permanent cold and dark—is clear, and the brink moment with “profound stillness” offers a genuine tightening. Yet the conflict unfolds almost entirely as a single linear push: she sings, the light appears, she instinctively “swaddles” it, and more threads follow, all without real resistance, misstep, or trade-off. The external pressure from the dying realm doesn’t really force a difficult choice so much as trigger a finally-successful try. Consequently, the cost of success feels modest compared to the declared scale.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can transform guilt into wisdom and re-engage with the world—is meaningful, and her initial reluctance versus desire to learn creates some internal pressure. However, escalation is minimal: once she decides to attend, events unfold without significant resistance or reversal, and the elder’s validation arrives without friction. The ritual at midnight is a strong structural promise that resolves gently, not as a real test. The story reads more as a guided reflection than as a scene where options narrow and a costly stance is forced.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can transform passive noticing into ethically charged caretaking and find a form of absolution—is clear and coheres. Pressure gently tightens via the discovery of the seam and the journal, which reframes her gardening as a response to generational complacency. Still, conflict remains highly internal and contemplative, with little sense of risk, trade-off, or price beyond emotional recognition; no live option is sharply foreclosed. The quiet mode works, but the tension never quite bites.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central stake—preserving meaning before the luminous vows vanish—is signaled clearly, and the lantern’s dimming plus the dissolving illusions imply a ticking clock. However, Elian never faces a real dilemma, obstacle, or tradeoff; his progress from setup to completion is almost frictionless. The only escalation is a late, modest uptick in pace when the slide begins to fail, which doesn’t significantly alter options or force sacrifice. As a result, tension remains mostly conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—prevent Silas from betraying her family’s route while capturing the betrayal’s “sound”—is established early and followed through. Pressure does increase as dawn approaches and Elara edges physically closer to the meeting, with the negotiation and slap functioning as the single major tightening. However, conflict remains mostly observational: Elara’s main tactic (surveillance and patience) succeeds without real on-page risk, reversal, or sacrifice; Silas’s undoing is delivered by the agent, not by a choice that truly endangers Elara. The emotional and moral stakes are intriguing but never feel knife-edge for her.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s need to understand why some people carry weather and what that implies about her place in a larger system—is signaled, but remains mostly intellectual. Pressure does mildly tighten as the ring behaves erratically and the forest elections peak, leading to the encounter with the man and the explanation. Yet there’s little real opposition or cost: he is immediately cooperative, no alternative path is truly foreclosed, and Elara does not have to sacrifice or risk much to gain her answer. As a result the conflict feels gently inquisitive rather than genuinely tense, limiting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether Elara can overcome creative paralysis after public humiliation—is clear and emotionally grounded. There is a meaningful turn when she discovers the hidden compartment and reframes the broken lock as a mental key, which leads directly to the act of drawing as rectification. Yet the conflict is largely internal and resolves without real friction once she reaches the cave; there are no significant setbacks, doubts, or failed attempts on the page. As a result, escalation feels more like a gentle incline than a tightening spiral, and the price she pays is mostly retrospective sorrow rather than an on-page trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (discovering the fate of lost conversations and preserving truth in a dishonest, resource-scarce city) is articulated, and there is a mild tightening when the wilting leaves force her to seek candor on the journey. Yet conflict is largely environmental and thematic rather than dramatized; lies cause cosmetic setbacks, quickly remedied by a truthful exchange, and no choice asks her to sacrifice something meaningful. Her activation of the archive faces no on-page obstacle or alternative, so the resolution feels more like following a laid-out path than confronting a crucible moment.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring the fading color of wonder—is clearly signaled and does culminate in the grand symphony. Yet the conflict is largely unopposed: nothing meaningfully threatens failure once she decides to act, and no alternative paths or sacrifices are dramatized. The “pressure” comes from seasonal passage and the abstract dimming of wonder rather than concrete obstacles that test her resolve or tactics. This yields a gentle emotional curve rather than a true escalation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—quieting the inner static by escaping the dome—is legible, and the choice to ignite the fear-core is a meaningful turn. However, there is minimal resistance or complication: no real risk of failure, no counterforce, and little internal hesitation once the plan is set. The magnetic instability and watching roses hint at possible danger or moral cost, but these pressures never crystallize into sharp trade-offs. As a result, escalation feels more procedural than tense.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara’s listening can help Mr. Hemlock confront his grief—is clear and threads the story. There is a credible tightening when the locket is connected to the mailbox key and when Elara decides to approach him directly. However, the conflict unfolds with little pushback: neighbors are helpful, Mr. Hemlock quickly agrees to open the mailbox, and his internal resistance is summarized rather than dramatized in the moment. The emotional price is present but underplayed, keeping stakes modest rather than bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are notionally high (imprisoned minds in stasis, Elara’s own psychic liberation), but opposition on the page is minimal. The pressure barely tightens: each roll of the dice and each dance sequence moves her forward without friction, moral trade-offs, or concrete risk. Her “calm defiance” is never significantly tested by failure, danger, or doubt. As a result, the climax reads as a linear fulfillment of intention rather than the outcome of escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will face or continue to avoid the pain of her erased past—is clear and consistent, and the story does move from unease through pursuit to confrontation and integration. Gravity anomalies and the eerie cavern provide externalized resistance, but they rarely force her into a hard trade-off or genuine jeopardy; she never seems likely to turn back or fail. The decisive “choice” to reintegrate her memories and make peace is emotionally coherent but arrives with minimal on-page struggle in the climactic beat, so escalation feels more like a smooth ascent than a pressured narrowing of options. Strong foundation, but the lack of a sharper, contested turning point undercuts the intensity of the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—a coded prophecy that could disrupt all balance—is stated repeatedly but never concretized or tested in-scene. Conflict is essentially one-directional: Elian performs his method and everything works as intended, with no setback, doubt, or costful tradeoff. As a result, pressure does not genuinely escalate; the middle and ending beats feel like restatements of the opening terms at slightly higher volume. The supposed world-level danger reads abstractly, so tension never truly bites.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether she can learn and then carry forward this liminal “language” from a ghost who cannot stay—is clear, but it stays mostly conceptual. Escalation comes through the accumulation of lessons and their ritualization, peaking when she finally turns her interrogative impulse onto him and forces the truth of his binding and impending departure. The loss of Finch and the burden of continuing alone read as a cost, yet there’s no hard dilemma or contested choice where she must sacrifice something tangible for this knowledge. The conflict remains quiet and internal, effective for a lyric piece but not fully maximized for narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will confront and transmute her quarantined grief—is clearly signaled and carried through the scene. There is a mild escalation as the whisper grows into a “clear, haunting voice” and the stones’ hum intensifies, forcing her to face the stormy-beach memory. However, conflict is mostly internal and presented as a foregone success; she never seriously falters or doubts mid-ritual, so options don’t feel meaningfully narrowed. The resolution is earned but low-friction, with limited sense of risk that the process could harm or fail her.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can release herself from the guilt of her treason—is present and understandable from early on. There is one meaningful tightening beat when she chooses to draw blood with the thorn and then slice the invisible seam, committing irrevocably to the ritual. Still, the pressure feels gentle and almost meditative; there’s little sense of risk, resistance, or competing desires in the moment, so escalation is modest. The conflict resolves cleanly with minimal visible cost beyond the symbolic act and its emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—uncovering why some people echo and overcoming manipulation—is clear but remains largely conceptual, with little in-scene resistance or risk. Conflict is mostly one-sided discovery; the “shadowy group” and “webs of intrigue” are invoked as stakes but never push back in a way that forces Kaelen into a true dilemma or sacrifice. Escalation is more a steady accumulation of information than a tightening of pressure, and his final song of revelation encounters no visible opposition. The result is a meditative inquiry rather than a story with strong, escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—recovering and exposing a “pure” act from a tragic wreck—is signaled early and resolved when Kaelen tells Anya and Elias’s spirit calms. However, there is almost no on-page resistance: strangers readily yield dreams, the interpretive process holds no missteps, and Anya offers no pushback or disbelief. Escalation is primarily informational, not pressure-driven; what Kaelen risks (emotionally or ethically) by exposing the truth is only implied. The piece reads as a graceful arc rather than a pressured conflict with narrowing options or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece largely lacks conflict: Kaelen has a goal (to appreciate hidden effort) but encounters no real resistance, ethical dilemma, or trade-off. His “demure audacity” never risks social reproach, and there’s no serious tension between his contemplative ritual and his practical duties. The only faint tightening is the firefly season waning, but this merely lends gentle melancholy rather than forcing a hard choice. As a result, stakes remain abstract and the narrative reads as static reflection rather than escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—uncovering dangerous truth versus preserving safety—is established early and reweighted at the end when he discovers the liquidation was deliberate and the stillpoint demands sacrifice. Escalation is clear as he moves from skepticism to decoding letters to physically unearthing and activating the diamond, with each step narrowing options and increasing potential cost. However, the moral and personal dimensions of the sacrifice choice are only surfaced in the final lines and not fully tested or complicated in scene. Tension is present, but the ethical calculus could be made more visceral to heighten the sense of irreversible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central stakes—whether fractured factions can be unified into a purposeful movement—are clear and emotionally scaled well to Elara’s abilities. However, most conflicts (variant allegiances, betrayals, council debates) are reported rather than dramatized in tense, choice-laden scenes, so escalation feels more declared than viscerally experienced. Elara’s key agency moments—choosing to descend, interpreting the song, issuing the final decree—are strong but somewhat easy; we rarely see her plans fail or her values forced into a painful trade-off. The result is satisfying but lacks the sharp, on-page prices that high-tier conflict demands.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—redeeming himself by preserving ephemeral sound for future generations—is clear but remains mostly internal and unopposed. The only explicit resistance is the key that “resisted then yielded,” a symbolic rather than consequential obstacle. His decision to leave the music box behind while carrying the jars is a quiet, meaningful stance but not framed against a live alternative with cost on the page. As a result, escalation feels more like gentle accretion than sharpened pressure or narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stakes are declared as very high (marina’s balance, souls relying on the artifact), and the potential eruption provides a clear external threat. Yet on the page, resistance is modest: once Kaelen begins humming and adjusting, the crisis resolves without any meaningful sacrifice, reversal, or narrowed options. The brief wobble (“vibrations skewed, threatening to fracture the key”) is quickly fixed by him “pouring his will into the key,” which reads like an intensifier rather than a structural complication. The result is conflict that feels conceptually weighty but experientially safe.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—liberating a people from a frantic cycle into a “patient revolution”—is clearly articulated but remains mostly conceptual on the page. Pressure doesn’t deepen much: the moons approach convergence, she executes a plan she has long prepared, and everyone complies without resistance or complication. There’s no real reversal, obstacle, or ethical trade-off; the revolution occurs as a serene inevitability rather than something tested. As a result, escalation and cost feel muted despite the interesting premise.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stakes—expose a preventable death and risk confrontation with a controlling superior versus submit and let the cover-up stand—are established early and remain coherent. Tension escalates with the discovery of the ledger and Thorn’s arrival, culminating in her choice to say “No” and leave with the evidence. However, the confrontation is resolved almost too easily (a sidestep and he “stumbled into the darkness”), with minimal felt risk or loss on the page, which blunts the sense of price paid. The internal battle is present but could press her into a sharper, costlier corner.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—can he transform passive remorse into active restitution—is articulated early and tied to the question of whether the heart is repairable. Conflict is mostly internal, braided with a gentle external test (the initial “beyond repair” verdict vs. the second opinion and the painstaking work). Pressure does deepen once he commits to learning the craft, but resistance is relatively low and the repairs face no serious setback, keeping escalation on the quiet side. The final change in stance feels earned, though the path there is almost too smooth for the weight of his guilt.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—giving voice to the algorithm’s yearning and ringing an unheard warning—remains mostly conceptual and unopposed. Escalation is limited to the algorithm’s hum intensifying and the “final sequence” being decoded; nothing seriously threatens failure or demands a trade-off. Elara never has to choose between competing goods or harms, so options don’t visibly narrow. The result is a gently rising curve of tension rather than a pressured turn with tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—uncovering what happened to the deleted files / the lost crew—is clear, and there is one meaningful tightening when Elara lies to breach the restricted cluster. Yet the conflict is mostly investigative and conceptual; external resistance (corporate risk, technical failure, time pressure) is gestured at rather than felt. The sabotage revelation reframes stakes but doesn’t significantly narrow Elara’s options or force a painful trade-off beyond moral knowledge. As a result, tension deepens intellectually more than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake (villages at risk from the shifting ice) is established early, and there is a conceptual deepening when the anomaly is revealed as the leviathan’s pain. However, there is no significant escalation by way of obstacles: Kaelen never meets resistance from the mirrors, the owner, or the reconstitution process, and the ethical problem (free vs. destroy) is resolved almost instantly. Pressure remains mostly abstract, declared as urgency rather than felt through concrete setbacks or compromises. As a result, the resolution feels more like executing a plan than confronting a true crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether she will remain oriented toward death or accept a new engagement with life and endings—is clear, but pressure barely escalates. The scene repeats similar internal beats (trawling, listening, remembering the parasol, thinking about endings) without a distinct tightening, external test, or reversal that forces a sharper decision. Her final stance crystallization feels emotionally plausible yet comes without a visible price paid on the page beyond summarized history. The conflict is more contemplative than pressured, which keeps stakes from fully biting.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether he remains trapped in grief or reconfigures his relation to the past—is present but relatively low-voltage on the page. Pressure “escalates” via accumulating parallels (vines/harvest vs. passion/loss), but there’s no hard test or credible alternative path dramatized, so change feels chosen without much friction. The key internal act is his self-persuasion to compost grief into wisdom, yet we don’t see a compelling counter-impulse pushing him to cling to the wound. As a result, tension is modest, and the resolution, while clear, feels somewhat foregone.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—whether the prophet’s wisdom will fade or be anchored—is clear, but there is almost no resistance or live alternative path on the page. The parapet’s emergence and the consecration proceed smoothly; no beat credibly threatens failure or forces Kael into a trade-off, and his “limitations” are mentioned but never dramatized as obstacles. This makes the escalation feel largely linear and ceremonial rather than pressured. The ending is resolved, but without a visible price paid or option foreclosed, the conflict remains underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the town can begin to heal its buried grief—is clear, but the conflict is largely implied rather than contested on the page. Mr. Hemlock’s moment of opening up is moving, yet it’s not preceded by much resistance; each beat goes smoothly from intention to success. There’s little escalation beyond “more people come” and feel better, so options are never sharply narrowed nor is a painful trade-off dramatized. As a result, the ending is emotionally warm but low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—proving that language can still grow and reclaiming her voice—is clear, but the pressure escalates only gently. There’s no concrete resistance from curators, time limit, or material threat; the tension rests almost entirely on her internal hesitation, which is mostly stated rather than dramatized in beats. Once the rhythm is decoded, her decision to testify follows smoothly without a marked tightening or forced trade-off. As a result, the story feels contemplative rather than truly pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether he can locate the core and “capture” the sound of growing older—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Pressure does escalate: chalk wears down, fog erases symbols, his visions flicker, and by the time he reaches the throne, the chalk’s snapping provides a concrete, irreversible cost. Conflict remains largely internal and textural, with no sharp reversal beyond success-to-failure at the end, so tension feels more steady than tightening. The piece earns a quiet, reflective resolution, but some readers may wish for one more overtly pressured choice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—capturing the ephemeral solar flare before tremors or time’s normal flow make it impossible—is clearly signaled and sustained. Pressure escalates as tremors intensify and the flare approaches, culminating in the precise moment she plays the leaf sound and halts the clock hand. However, the opposition never seriously adapts or complicates her path; her solution works on the first try, and the external danger (tremors) ceases immediately after success in a way that feels convenient rather than hard-won. The emotional cost is hinted but the practical cost or real risk never quite bites.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are emotionally significant—peaceful dying and father–daughter reconciliation—but realized with very low friction. Lena comes when called, accepts the gesture, and reconciliation is immediate; there’s no on-page resistance, misstep, or cost that tests Elara’s or Alistair’s commitments. The Mahler request and final death are moving but feel inevitable rather than pressurized. Conflict functions, but escalation is muted and largely assumed rather than earned beat by beat.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding and stabilizing warped reality via the shadows—is signaled early, but on-page pressure remains low. The main escalation is intellectual (discovering the hidden-dimension map and the sealed awakenings) rather than confrontational, and the ritual succeeds without meaningful resistance. The only concrete complication is the automaton’s key cracking at the end, which feels more like a teaser than a hard price paid in this scene. As a result, tension is present but muted, never quite testing her commitment or forcing a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—how Elara will respond to the revelation that her son was replaced—is clear, but the story largely avoids active opposition. Once she commits to the ritual, the magic and emotional realignment unfold without visible risk or pushback, so pressure does not markedly tighten. The reinterpretation of the changeling as a guide is a meaningful internal turn, yet it arrives without a sharp test of her competing impulses (vengeance vs. forgiveness, denial vs. acceptance). As a result, stakes feel more contemplative than truly fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Elara will share a non-destructive light with others rather than remain in solitary observation—is articulated, but the on-page pressure on that decision is mild. There is one meaningful deepening when the polished glass finally projects a “kaleidoscope of soft, dancing colors,” which concretizes her abstract goal and forces her to consider bringing it to the fearful villagers. However, there are no strong reversals or tangible obstacles; nothing forces a trade-off beyond leaving her sanctuary, and that cost is more conceptual than felt. As a result, tension is present but low-grade, limiting the sense of escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—how Elara will live in the wake of public exposure—is articulated but never truly tested on the page; the pressure of the viral confession remains off-stage. Once she “knows what she has to do,” the path to offering the pendant and Leo’s acceptance is smooth, with no significant risk of rejection or reversal to sharpen the moment. Internal and external tensions thus feel more contemplative than fraught, and escalation reads as deepening image-patterns rather than narrowing options. The result is lovely but low-pressure, with limited visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—gather all hopes before the narrative ends—is established, but conflict with the nexus’s “current” remains generalized and largely untested. Escalation is indicated via the whisper growing louder and mist thickening, yet Elara’s tactics and options don’t visibly narrow; she continues doing the same ritual slightly faster. There’s no significant reversal or trade-off, and no hope she might have to forgo, so pressure feels relatively static. The ending reads earned in pattern terms but low in real cost.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stakes—healing the arbor and restoring sacred practices—are clearly stated, and there is a nominal tightening when the songs reach a crescendo and the “timeframe of alignment” arrives. Yet there is almost no oppositional force: the blight never actively resists, failure is never dramatized as a real possibility, and the alignment functions as an automatic payoff rather than a pressured choice point. Elara does not seem to sacrifice anything or risk genuine loss in the moment; agency is present but untested. The result is a beautiful but low-tension arc whose resolution feels granted, not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—completing the starlight map before the charged stillness breaks—is present but remains mostly conceptual and unopposed. Conflict is largely internalized as endurance and concentration against cold and time, without a clear moment where a live option is foreclosed or a difficult trade-off is dramatized. Repeated ignitions do mark a gentle escalation in complexity, yet no real reversal or tightening occurs. The result is a beautiful but relatively static pressure profile.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—can Elian understand and repair the echo-harvesting timer—is clear but remains almost purely intellectual and uncontested. There is a single meaningful deepening when he realizes the device measures echoes rather than time, but no real reversal, resistance, or risk of failure. The “wounded season” and external world never exert concrete pressure on his task; they are backdrop rather than active stakes. As a result, tension plateaus into a gentle, steady curiosity rather than escalating toward a charged choice.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can meaningfully give form to human burdens without being crushed by them—is present but remains abstract and low-pressure. Each emotional weight initially resists or threatens (grief as “heavy, cold,” fear as “shifting, nebulous”) but then yields to her method almost immediately, with no real risk of failure or significant trade-off. The one notable tightening is her reframing of being trapped as expansive freedom, but it doesn’t arise from a hard-forced choice. As a result, escalation feels more like a gentle progression than a deepening conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can transform paralyzing grief into something livable by finishing this carving in the kettle’s brief window—is clear, but the pressure curve is gentle. The whistle’s escalation and her “focused intensity” create some tightening, yet she never seriously considers stopping, failing, or choosing an alternate outlet, so options don’t truly narrow. Internal and external conflict align (fear of forgetting vs. need to “contain” him), but the resolution feels more like a smooth continuation than a hard-won turn. The cost—accepting a bittersweet, ongoing grief—lands, but without a distinct on-page crucible moment.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can transform her corrosive regret into acceptance via this negotiation with her ghost—is clear but largely internal and gently pressured. Escalation is mostly spatial/ritual (shore → water → island → ghost) rather than strongly conflictual, with the ghost remaining passive. The turn when the wheel glows and images appear provides a credible deepening and forces a renunciation of her prior drive to “force them into order.” However, the cost is conceptual more than visceral, and the conflict never feels truly fraught or endangered.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story’s dominant stake—whether Kaelen can meaningfully “resurrect” the terminal as a symbol of resilience—is established but remains largely conceptual and unopposed. Once he decides on redirected flows, everything proceeds smoothly; there are no real obstacles, tradeoffs, or moments where his goal is in doubt. Internal and external conflict never truly sharpen, so escalation is more a gentle accumulation of successes than pressure that forecloses options. This keeps the piece from achieving the urgency or cost associated with higher-tier conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—making peace with an abandoned dream—is clear and carried throughout, with the forecourt visit framed as a deliberate, high-stakes emotional errand for Elara. Pressure escalates internally as the whispers and tactile engagement with the clock intensify her confrontation with loss. However, the conflict remains almost entirely internal and relatively frictionless; there is little sense that acceptance might not come, and no substantial counterforce beyond mood. The cost of her renunciation is acknowledged but muted, so the story feels more contemplative than truly pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will cling to the legend or accept a harsher family truth—is clear but mostly internal and low-friction. There is a meaningful deepening when she realizes the sundial is metaphorical and the stories hid betrayal, but there’s little tangible opposition or cost beyond discomfort. Her “training instincts” never seem seriously tested; she moves steadily toward insight instead of struggling against attachment to the myth. As a result, escalation feels modest rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can access and preserve forbidden agricultural knowledge—is clear, and there is a nominal test of her patience through the long decoding. Yet the conflict remains almost entirely internal and abstract, with no credible threat of failure, interruption, or misreading of the knots; the weavers arrive as soon as she finishes, and they are immediately welcoming. There is one mild tightening (patterns coalescing after “what felt like an eternity”), but no genuine foreclosed option or sacrifice. The result is more ritual completion than escalating struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can meaningfully articulate Kael’s living “obituary” and refine her method of healing—is clear but mostly internal. Pressure deepens through the increasingly vivid projections and culminates in the moment she feels Kael beside her and confronts his grief, which does reweight the situation. However, options don’t meaningfully narrow, and there’s little sense of risk or cost beyond lyrical melancholy, so escalation feels gentle rather than gripping. The result is thematically rich but dramatically soft.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—whether he can reawaken beauty in a deadened mechanical world—is clearly stated, but mostly at an abstract, thematic level. Pressure does increase somewhat as the device nears completion (trembling hands, intensified quaking), yet no concrete obstacle, failure, or sacrifice tests his commitment once the assembly begins. The climax unfolds without a serious possibility of loss; the bird appears on the first activation and the only “cost” is its inevitable ephemerality, which feels conceptual rather than dramatically earned. As a result, escalation reads gentle rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stakes—whether Elara can transform the girl’s scars (and by extension her own legacy) into something “singing” rather than shameful—are clear but lightly pressured. Conflict is mostly internal and ethical, with the only external friction being the girl’s brief flinch during the graft. There’s one meaningful deepening when Elara gives away the coin, sacrificing a personal talisman to cement the girl’s new narrative. Overall, escalation is gentle and linear; the outcome feels almost guaranteed from the outset, which trims tension even as it preserves lyric calm.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—liberating trapped memories and reviving the city—is clear and present throughout. Escalation is mostly procedural and textural (more shards, louder whispers, waiting for stars) rather than confrontational; no real alternative path or failure risk is dramatized. Her agency matters—she follows clues, chooses to wait, performs the alignment—but the story never forces a hard trade-off or visible loss. As a result, tension is gentle and contemplative rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving some form of the garden against inevitable decline—is clear and tightens with the discovery of systemic generational weakening. Pressure escalates through knowledge rather than event: her sonar reveals the anomaly, the gear models irreversible decay, and she must choose between futile restoration and transmissible memory. The choice to repurpose sonar is a meaningful narrowing of options with a visible conceptual cost (accepting loss), but the conflict remains largely contemplative and low-friction. There’s little sense of risk or competing harms beyond that single binary, which keeps the tension from feeling fully acute.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding the shape of collective grief—is clear, but it encounters almost no meaningful resistance. Elara never faces a sharp dilemma, reversal, or genuine risk of failure; each step merely deepens the same trajectory toward insight. “Over days, as the migration peaked” suggests scope for tightening, yet nothing actually forces a hard trade-off or renunciation. As a result, the final peace feels unopposed and low-cost, limiting dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s quest for moral and communal “shared balance”—is clear, but present-tense conflict is minimal. The flood and prior failure carry real weight, yet they remain backstory; the current hitch in the pendulum never threatens to spiral into a visible on-page crisis. Once he recalls the instructions, nothing meaningfully tests his resolve, and the adjustment proceeds without complication, so escalation is largely notional. The resolution, therefore, feels conceptually neat but low-cost in scene terms.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will decode and understand the prior gardener’s intention and the “uncharted echoes”—is legible but mostly conceptual. Pressure increases modestly as she works through the tapestry and uncovers the hidden journal, but key “turns” occur via luck or straightforward discovery rather than hard choices. There is little sense of risk, opposition, or time pressure beyond a soft echo of the chess clock metaphor. The ending resolves on a decision to continue the work, yet that choice does not obviously foreclose a competing path or dramatize a real sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—whether and how Kaelen will risk writing an innovation that can transform a stagnant society—is clear and thematically potent. There is a meaningful tightening as he rejects one model (decentralized energy with monopolies) and refines toward collaborative knowledge-sharing, culminating in the act of writing. However, the pressure remains largely intellectual and stable; there is little sense of narrowing options, immediate risk, or trade-off beyond abstract fear of chaos/oppression. As a result, tension is steady but not sharply escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.3)
    The central stake—reviving stories under surveillance—is clear, and there is a nominal external pressure from “wary authorities.” However, escalation is largely linear description of increasing involvement rather than a sharply felt tightening; no scene forces a specific, risky trade-off or direct confrontation. Embedding codes in scores and the broadcaster addressing her are promising pressure beats, but they aren’t tested against an active obstacle. The result is quietly tense but never quite urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Elara can transform hurt into a workable, honest memory—remains clear throughout. There is a meaningful tightening when she chooses to grind the mask, foreclosing the possibility of preserving the object and thus committing to reinterpretation rather than relic-keeping. However, the conflict is very one-sided; there’s little genuine sense she might refuse or abort the ritual, so tension never fully peaks. The stakes feel intimate and real but not sharply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether hard-won navigational knowledge will survive rising superstition and apathy—is clearly stated, but the conflict stays mostly conceptual. Pressure does increase slightly as she digs deeper and the “competing narratives” recur, yet she never faces a concrete obstacle or a moment where she might quit, compromise, or be actively thwarted. Her “choice” at the end is essentially to persist in what she was already doing, making the escalation feel flat. The internal and external conflicts align in theme but don’t quite crystallize into a visibly costly decision.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can move her diverse choir beyond old rivalries into genuine harmony—is clearly stated. However, almost all of the conflict is described rather than dramatized; the choir’s resistance appears only as “hesitant voices” and “fidgeting,” then yields quickly to her explanation and the rosette’s symbolism. There’s little escalation or meaningful test of her method “by subtracting noise” in action; the rehearsal scene resolves too smoothly to feel like a hard-won step. As a result, the price of her stance and the risk of failure remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—can she transform ruin and grief into living beauty—is stated but only gently tested. The celestial alignment theoretically imposes a time pressure, yet she moves through planting and pruning with calm inevitability and no real risk of failure or reversal. Internal conflict (carrying the widow’s sadness) is handled via metaphorical pruning without resistance or relapse. As a result, escalation feels more like a steady hum than a tightening coil.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—restoring the city’s power via the bee-drones—is clear, but escalation is gentle and low-resistance. Once Kael arrives, the riddle is solved very quickly and the practical problem yields to a single, unopposed tactic (spray water), so there’s little sense of risk, alternative paths, or true jeopardy. Internal pressure (Elara’s need for wonder) runs alongside the plot but is never strongly tested by an opposing need or fear. As a result, the resolution feels competent and neat rather than hard-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.7)
    The dominant stake—reviving a lifeless house and understanding its “aliveness”—is signaled but remains largely abstract and low-risk. There is one main turn when she places the orris root and the house “sighs,” which deepens her understanding, but tension does not truly escalate beforehand; success feels almost assured from the outset. No substantial resistance, danger, or moral trade-off confronts her, so her agency is minimally tested. The result is a gently shapely but low-pressure conflict arc.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—how to be a guardian once certainty has fractured—is clear and the ampoule-threading sequence provides a concrete task that reweights options. Pressure does rise as revelations intensify and the statue chooses to awaken other guardians and alter the garden’s magic. Yet conflict is notably soft: there’s no meaningful resistance, risk of failure, or alternative path put under genuine consideration, so choices feel low-cost. The result is thoughtful but under-pressurized relative to elite literary expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering or reconfiguring a missed opportunity through the staircase’s logic—is clear but mostly internal and abstract. Pressure does escalate slightly with her calculations and the eventual crack, but she never faces a genuine dilemma or trade-off where she could meaningfully fail or pay a visible price. The rupture reads more as an inevitable payoff of her intellect than a contested turning point. Consequently, the resolution feels minimally tested and relatively low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether she can meaningfully “prove” remembered kindness—remains coherent, and the visions do deepen from ancient markets to a modern bus, clarifying her thesis. However, there is minimal resistance, risk, or true uncertainty; every vision confirms her belief, so pressure stays gentle and largely unopposed. The one visible trade-off, her continued insomnia, is more noted than dramatized as a painful cost. As a result, escalation reads more like steady enrichment than tightening conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—reviving the bread as a defense against cultural oblivion—is clear and escalates from archival curiosity to felt desperation after the failed loaf. Conflict remains mostly internal and procedural; the elders offer fragments but little true resistance, and the honey-gathering sequence skirts real danger without dramatizing it fully. The key tightening is the realization that outside help (the beekeeper) will not save them, forcing Elara toward self-reliance. While the emotional pressure is palpable, a sharper on-page cost or more acute opposition in the middle beat would deepen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can and will break destiny—is clear, and pressure does rise from discovery through activation to global unwinding. However, conflict is largely unilateral and procedural; the world does not push back in a way that forces a hard trade-off, and she never seriously doubts or adapts her plan. The storm and temporal distortion function more as spectacle than true antagonistic pressure. As a result, escalation feels smooth rather than tightening, with limited sense of irretrievable loss beyond conceptual scale.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can free herself from parasitic fear to truly live after resuscitation—is clear and engaged from the outset. Pressure escalates via successive demands: enter the funhouse, confront the mirrors, expose true fear, then enact a risky ritual with a cursed object. Her agency drives the key turns (choosing to confess, reframing “void,” throwing the clasp), and the resolution clearly forecloses a path where fear rules her. However, the opposition (the shadow/fear) never exerts much active counter-pressure; once she names its weakness, it recoils rather than fighting back, making the climax feel slightly too easy.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.3)
    The stakes—protecting the orchard and answering the predicted silence—are clear and the conflict escalates from abstract (silence) to concrete (approaching wave). The decisive turn is his choice to strike the resonator with full strength to meet the wave, which pays off in a transformed threat. However, he is never seriously in danger of failing; he reads as fully in control of both method and outcome, so the cost and tension feel muted. The conflict is elegant but relatively safe.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—understanding the watchers and the fate of the expedition to address the city’s isolation—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates once through the discovery of the pattern “crack” and Kaelen’s choice to test his derived melody, culminating in the shell’s literal crack and the revelation about the watchers. However, conflict is largely one-sided and conceptual; there is little tangible resistance, risk of failure, or on-page cost beyond the abstract fear that already permeates the city, and the resolution arrives relatively smoothly once he plays the tune. The piece gains in resonance rather than tension, which limits the sense of threat or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—rescuing a maligned scribe’s legacy and, by extension, “truth”—is strongly stated but weakly pressured in scene. There’s little genuine opposition: no institutional resistance, no risk of professional loss, and the interpretive leap to innocence is quickly rewarded by the conveniently legible “veritas.” Internal conflict between preserving a noble lie and exposing truth is gestured at but never forces a hard choice. As a result, escalation feels largely conceptual rather than viscerally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can wrest meaning from the drowned pavilion without succumbing to futility—is clear and coherently pursued. Pressure deepens through his accumulating sorrow and the final, higher-cost act of placing his own abandoned dream into the lowest, permanently submerged step. However, tension remains mostly internal and contemplative; there’s little sense that his options narrow beyond the chosen immersion, and no sharp turn that truly tests his resolve. The result is a well-shaped but relatively low-intensity conflict profile.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the true origins of the codex—is clear and she does alter tactics under pressure by adopting the palimpsest hypothesis and exploiting the blackout’s stillness. The main tightening comes when she uses the stamp to probe the warped cabinet and uncovers scrolls that overturn the official codex. Yet the opposition is soft: there’s no real temporal, physical, or social pressure on the page beyond inconvenience and doubt, so tension never fully sharpens into a felt risk or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—transmuting grief and reattaching the shadow—is clear early and persists. Pressure accumulates via repeated polishing and folding, with “descending while ascending” and intensifying luminous pain marking a deepening rather than a flat loop. However, the opposition is almost entirely internal and ritualized, with little sense that failure is a live option or that she adapts tactics under duress. The cranes’ awakening and the shadow’s hesitation add some late-stage tension, but the resolution feels expected once the ritual premise is established.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.2)
    The primary stake—whether Kaelen can meaningfully locate or conceptualize the “unused potential” of his lost life—is clearly signaled and tightened by the limited window while the observatory is offline. Escalation is present through the accumulating data patterns and the approach to a specific resonance, culminating in the sensor overload and blackout that force a reckoning. The internal cost (each discovered “echo” being a fresh wound) is convincing but mostly narrated rather than dramatized via on-page hesitation or reversal. The story remains more contemplative than truly pressured, with tension felt but rarely biting into concrete, opposing options.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can decode the frequency and feel a sense of belonging—is clearly signaled, and there is some tightening when the data comes out garbled, prompting recalibration. However, there is almost no real opposition: no risk of failure, no time or resource constraints, and no countervailing desire that would make success costly. The major turn (discovering the star-symbol alignment and pulling the lever) proceeds without resistance or hard choice. As a result, tension remains modest and the resolution feels more like a granted vision than a tested achievement.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—can she face the true cost of her deception and alter her life—is clear, and there is one meaningful tightening when she finds the specific carving and the brother’s fate surfaces. However, pressure feels largely predetermined; once she decides to walk to the shore, there are few genuine options or reversals, and almost no external friction. Her final renunciation is sound, but the journey there reads more like an inevitable slide into confession than an escalating contest between competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can translate mutual hurt into a more humane exchange and personally move beyond her past failure—is clear from early on. However, conflict is undercooked: Kael’s resistance is mild, there’s no concrete risk of breakdown, and her proposal for a new protocol is accepted with minimal friction. There is one meaningful deepening when Kael reveals his brother’s death, but it leads directly to alignment rather than testing her stance. As a result, tension exists conceptually more than viscerally, and escalation feels modest.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stakes—whether Kael can act despite his self-concept as a “broken navigator” and reach the lighthouse—are signaled early and tested by the worsening water and the loss of the compass. The wave that knocks the compass away is an effective single escalation that forces a re-commitment to his goal with altered tactics. Internal and external conflicts interweave decently, though the danger of the water feels relatively safe given his proximity to shore. The cost is mostly emotional (surrendering the father’s tool and his identity crutch) rather than sharply dramatized through hard trade-offs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Leo can meaningfully rekindle empathy—is clear, but the on-page pressure is mild and rarely sharpens into real jeopardy or difficult trade-offs. His steps along the stone path and the choice to throw the baseball are framed as significant, yet there is little sense of what failure would concretely cost him in the moment beyond abstraction. The confrontation with his hardened reflection is the main tightening, but the reflection offers no active resistance, so the scene lacks pushback. As a result, escalation feels more like a steady procession toward a foregone epiphany than a pressured test.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether Elara will sacrifice her old self to reclaim her bond with Kael—is legible and resolved, with metamorphosis as the key pressure point. However, conflict escalates in a mostly smooth, unresisted line; there is little sense she might fail, turn back, or face countervailing external pressure once the spell begins. Her internal reluctance appears but is quickly overridden without real on-page struggle or alternative options tested. As a result, the climax feels moving but low in tension for a piece aiming at elite literary stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether she can reclaim lost time versus learning to live with its loss—is legible from early on and resolved through her choice to weave a single “thread of hours” and then leave. Escalation is present but gentle: the crack widens into a gateway, she confronts specific memory-fragments, and then must decide between grasping or releasing. Still, the conflict remains largely contemplative; there’s little sense that her attempt might fail, corrupt her, or cost her something tangible beyond a general ache. The result feels moving but not pressurized enough for a top-tier conflict score.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—opening the locked dimension through non-violent integration of sorrow—is clear and present from early on. There is one meaningful tightening when Elara must manage her buoyant happiness to maintain contact with the work, and when the resistance of the dimension peaks as she stitches the last fragments. However, the conflict feels largely assured; there’s little sense that she might fail or break under the emotional burden. The ethical or emotional price of leaving, or of integrating so much darkness, is underplayed, keeping the stakes somewhat soft.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake is spiritual/psychological—can Elara reconceive her destitution as transformation—signaled early via her quest for texture. However, pressure barely escalates: she feels an “inexplicable pull,” then rather smoothly performs the release; no real alternative path or serious inner resistance is staged. External stakes (renewal of the land via volcano) remain abstract and untested on the page. As a result, the core choice feels graceful but low-tension, more like a foregone ritual than a contested turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—using the blackout to seed a silent revolution—is clear, but pressure barely escalates after it’s introduced. The guards’ confusion is mentioned but never embodied; Elara encounters no genuine obstacles or reversals, so her maneuvers feel low-risk. The main “tightening” is simply locating the armory via the sundial and then completing a pre-practiced run. As a result, the outcome feels foregone, and the revolution’s danger remains abstract rather than viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring order to a frictionless world by decoding cosmic patterns—is signaled early and tracked through Kaelen’s urgent work. Pressure escalates credibly through the impending auroral peak and the precognitive glimpse of failure when one rock is misaligned, giving him a concrete, high-stress correction to make. However, after that adjustment, the remaining beats unfold without serious complication or trade-off, and the apparent world-scale risk carries little felt cost beyond his fear. The conflict functions well but does not fully exploit the premise’s potential severity.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stakes are internal—whether Elara will remain silenced or reclaim her voice—and are signaled early and paid off by her decision to write and share the poem. The timer and storm offer some sense of escalation and narrowing time, leading to the stranger’s appearance. Yet the conflict feels low-friction: there is little resistance to her choice, no concrete threat from the censoring regime, and her trust of the ex-censor carries no explored risk. The resolution, while coherent, comes too easily to feel high-stakes or hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.8)
    The nominal stakes—decode before the duel to learn its terms; rivalry vs philosophical accord—are articulated early, and there is at least a formal escalation into the fencing match. Yet conflict remains largely abstract and unthreatening: the code yields quickly, the duel is described as precise rather than dangerous, and victory arrives through a revelation that faces no serious pushback. Internal conflict is minimal; Kaelen never seems torn between winning and understanding. The piece has structure but lacks a palpable tightening of pressure or a visible price for his choice.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—rebuilding a clandestine library as an act of resistance and a container for Elara’s shifting self—is clear but faces almost no on-page opposition or complication. Pressure is low-grade and mostly thematic; their work proceeds smoothly, and no decision forecloses a concrete alternative path in the scene. The internal turn (from cynicism to hope) is present but not strongly contested moment-to-moment. As a result, escalation reads more as deepening mood than tightening stakes, which limits this category.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—securing a refuge and altering his fate before the arbor collapses—is stated early and tracked through the compasses’ warnings and the racing horizon. Escalation is present (compasses flare, equilibrium shattering, storm imminent) and narrows his options to immediate action with the untested method. However, once he initiates the plan, his path is relatively smooth: no meaningful setback, moral dilemma, or competing desire seriously challenges his course. The resolution feels earned but somewhat low-friction for the scale of the declared stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.5)
    The stakes are explicitly high (the survival of cultural memory before the monsoon erases it), but the conflict is soft: once Elara follows the dream’s instruction, everything unfolds smoothly and successfully. The monsoon, touted as a major threat, effectively arrives only after the central task is complete, so it never truly pressures her tactics beyond a generic “time is short.” Internal conflict—her doubt—is named but not tested by any real risk of failure or meaningful trade-off. As a result, escalation feels more like a steady progression of steps than a tightening of pressure with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Kaelen can transform his paralyzing regret into something bearable—is clear but only lightly stressed. Conflict is almost entirely internal and contemplative; once the compass and lace are introduced, there is little real resistance or risk that the process might fail or deepen the wound. The main “tightening” is the walk itself and the moment the compass pulls him to the cove, but that reads as a smooth fulfillment of ritual rather than a pressured choice with trade-offs. As a result, escalation feels gentle and somewhat static, limiting dramatic impact.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are purely abstract; the "drama" Aris wishes to strip is never dramatized, so her victory over it feels automatic and tension-free. There is no escalation, only a linear confirmation of her initial hypothesis without setbacks or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is no meaningful escalation or pressure; the protagonist sits and the environment gifts her the answer.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is no escalation of pressure; obstacles are bypassed via time jumps ("spent days") or convenient epiphanies ("dream"). The stakes are stated ("souls adrift") but never felt as immediate danger or cost to the protagonist. The resolution comes without sacrifice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=2.6)
    There is no meaningful escalation or cost; the anonymous donations function as a deus ex machina that eliminates survival pressure. The antagonist ("watchful eyes") is mentioned but never acts, leaving the protagonist with no difficult trade-offs to navigate on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; there is no antagonist, time pressure, or internal resistance to the goal. The protagonist desires something, looks for it, finds it immediately, and uses it without complication or trade-off, creating a flat narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are internal and abstract (mental freedom), with static opposition (visions) that does not adapt or pressure Elara's tactics. The climax lacks tension because the cost is immediately mitigated by the narrator, making the victory feel effortless.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=3.0)
    Conflict is negligible; the sole antagonist is dispatched instantly with a single move, and the environmental obstacles resolve themselves (the wall falling). The stakes of "resilience" remain abstract because the protagonist pays no price for her victory.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=3.7)
    Conflict is almost entirely abstract and internal, lacking external pressure or genuine obstacles beyond the difficulty of the task. The escalation is murky; success comes from a sudden realization ("insight came while observing") rather than a forced trade-off or rising cost.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.6)
    Escalation is present (the shift to black orchids), but the resolution lacks cost or struggle. The protagonist overcomes the obstacle by simply using her magic tool a second time in a slightly different way, which deflates the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the environment (thaw) cooperates, the craft (glassblowing) goes smoothly, and the internal grief resolves instantly upon finding a prop. There is no escalation of pressure, risk of failure, or meaningful trade-off required to reach the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=2.8)
    Tension evaporates at the climax because the antagonist offers no active resistance, merely "smirking" then being "confounded" by words. The central conflict—outwitting a mentor—resolves without a genuine trade-off or test of skill, resulting in low stakes despite the life-or-death setup.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is a near-total absence of active conflict; the "storm" is already over, and physical fatigue is dismissed instantly via the "mild obsession" label. The stakes ("guide lost souls") are high in abstraction but nonexistent on the page, as failure never feels like a genuine possibility. No tightening of options occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes remain philosophical and abstract; the antagonist is effectively just the difficulty of the task, which J-7 overcomes with "remarkable composure." There is no meaningful escalation or risk of failure on the page; the "intensifying cold" is mentioned but explicitly does not affect the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes are stated ("mistrust") but the conflict dissolves instantly upon confrontation without resistance or trade-offs. The resolution is frictionless; Marco admits guilt immediately, and the "burden" vanishes without the protagonist paying a price for the truth.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=2.7)
    There is virtually no conflict; the "skeptics" arrive and are immediately convinced by a display of marbles, offering no resistance or meaningful stakes. The "luck measuring devices" flicker but do not force a difficult choice or trade-off for the protagonist. The resolution is unearned because there was no obstacle to overcome in the scene itself.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is negligible; the "narrow window" creates a theoretical time constraint that never pressures the protagonist's tactics on the page. There is no antagonist, internal doubt, or trade-off; Kael achieves his goal without overcoming significant opposition or paying a price.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative lacks active opposition or genuine stakes; Elara faces no setbacks, and the "ghost's stagnant sorrow" exerts no pressure on her choices. The climax is a risk-free action (slapping water) that resolves the conflict instantly without trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes remain largely internal and abstract ("swaying certainties"), lacking external pressure or a ticking clock to force the protagonist's hand. The conflict is resolved through a rapid philosophical adjustment rather than a costly trade-off or difficult decision.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is minimal and linear; the protagonist faces no active opposition or difficult trade-offs, merely observing phenomena. The resolution arrives without a visible or felt cost—placing the valve back solves the problem instantly—leaving the stakes untested and the victory unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=3.6)
    Conflict is minimal; the inciting "restlessness" is solved immediately by the refuge without obstacle or sacrifice. There is no escalation of pressure, resulting in a flat narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=2.9)
    There is virtually no conflict; the protagonist's goal is met with immediate, unearned success. The "withdrawn" child accepts the therapy instantly, removing any stakes or possibility of failure. Without an antagonist force (internal or external) or a cost to the healing, the narrative lacks tension and escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=2.9)
    There is no effective opposition; the protagonist moves from discovery to solution without facing a single setback, meaningful risk, or sacrifice. The "overwhelming stillness" is a stated condition rather than an active antagonistic force, resulting in a flat narrative arc devoid of tension or escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=2.2)
    There is virtually no conflict or resistance; Elara's plan works perfectly, Leo finds the message immediately, and they expose the spy ring without facing an antagonist. The stakes are declared ("expose the truth") but never dramatized through risk or cost, resulting in zero tension.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=3.6)
    The stakes are global and abstract ("reality... coming undone") rather than immediate and personal. The conflict is one-sided; the antagonist—a "creeping possession"—offers no active resistance or counter-move, merely recoiling and groaning until it dissolves. The protagonist faces no difficult choices or sacrifices; the victory is swift, costless, and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is virtually no conflict; the protagonist faces no active opposition, and the internal obstacle (exhaustion) is bypassed without consequence. Everything she attempts succeeds immediately (she listens, she maps, she conducts, nature responds), resulting in a flat narrative arc devoid of tension or escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are abstract ("coherence," "labyrinth of self") and lack immediate physical or relational danger. The antagonist is an internal "fracture," but the confrontation is resolved instantly by "letting go," devoid of gritty, felt cost. The "young self" trap offers a moment of potential conflict that is bypassed without significant pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=4.5)
    There is virtually no escalation or resistance; the needle works on the first try, and the "chaos" resolves into harmony instantly. The protagonist faces no trade-offs, risks, or failures before succeeding. The stakes are internal but resolved through an external mechanical fix, lacking a moment of high-pressure agency.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=3.0)
    The central conflict evaporates immediately upon confrontation; the antagonist reveals herself as an ally, removing the pressure without requiring a tactic shift or trade-off. There is no visible or felt cost to the protagonist's decision to collaborate, as the text explicitly frames it as a gain without sacrifice ("deepen, not dilute"). Escalation is non-existent as the threat dissolves into instant cooperation.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=3.9)
    Narrative pressure is negligible; the protagonist faces no external opposition or difficult trade-off, merely performing a procedural task. The "transformation" happens to her rather than because of her, and the resolution comes without a visible or felt cost, resulting in low stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.1)
    The central stake (freedom vs. memory) is conceptually clear, and the protagonist pays a definite cost at the end. However, the conflict lacks visceral escalation; the "pain" of the energy beings is observed from a distance, and the final choice is made without a sequence of testing beats or mounting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are nominal; the "chronic hush" is declared oppressive but is easily overcome by the protagonist's music without risk of failure or consequence. There is no antagonist, internal resistance, or escalation of difficulty; the transition from silence to "companion" happens smoothly without a moment where the outcome is in doubt. The lack of a "tightening" beat where options narrow results in a flat narrative trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=2.8)
    Stakes remain purely theoretical; there is no antagonist, no ticking clock, and no on-page customer to force a hard choice. The text explicitly negates the cost of the climax ("This act was not a loss but a gain"), deflating tension and rendering the decision trivial.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=1.2)
    There are no stakes or active opposition; every desire Elara has is immediately fulfilled without cost or struggle. The narrative lacks a tightening of pressure, resulting in a flat trajectory where success is inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=3.0)
    There is no tangible opposition or escalation; the protagonist joins a group, they search, and they succeed, with barriers "softening" immediately. The dominant stake (belonging) is resolved without Elara having to overcome genuine resistance, make a sacrifice, or confront a possibility of failure, resulting in a flat narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes remain abstract ("free the source of all sound") with no concrete negative consequence for failure established on the page. The opposition is purely environmental (the giant as a clock), lacking active antagonism or moral dilemma to test Elara’s resolve. The "cost" of aging is mentioned in passing but does not impede her ability to function or color the emotional resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=3.7)
    Stakes are purely abstract ("understand the mathematics") with no external pressure or time clock. The conflict is resolved through a smooth, successful experiment, devoid of the setbacks or difficult trade-offs needed to generate narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are declared ("people were lost and afraid") rather than dramatized; the protagonist faces no antagonist, physical barrier, or difficult trade-off on the page. The "urgency" is stated but does not force a change in tactics or a sacrifice; the conflict is resolved by simply completing the intended action without resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=4.9)
    The conflict is primarily internal and abstract, resolved through reflection rather than urgent pressure. The stakes—a single failing tree and a philosophical shift—lack visceral weight or immediate consequence, and the resolution comes without a visible, paid cost to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is virtually no active conflict or opposition; the protagonist encounters a friendly stranger and makes a mutually beneficial exchange without hesitation. The stakes are purely internal and are resolved too easily, missing the opportunity for a difficult trade-off or a test of the protagonist's "cynical" worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=3.0)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the "unseen forces" are explicitly described as "not malevolent," removing potential threat or stakes. There is no escalation of pressure; the characters face no trade-offs, and the ritual succeeds on the first attempt without demanding a sacrifice or narrowing of options. The narrative lacks a moment where failure is a genuine possibility, rendering the outcome inevitable and low-impact.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is no meaningful conflict; the community waits passively for Elara to fix their spirits, offering no resistance. The stakes are abstract ("dispirited community"), and the resolution comes via a speech and a convenient prop match, bypassing any demand for sacrifice or hard trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=3.0)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the protagonist faces no genuine opposition, as every barrier yields to her tools or intuition instantly. There is no escalation of stakes, only a steady progression toward a guaranteed success that lacks tension or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the "struggle" is resolved by the artifact glowing and bestowing visions. There is no escalation of pressure, no antagonist, and no clock that forces a trade-off (the migration "intensified" but didn't force a hard choice). The stakes are abstract altruism without personal risk or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes shift clearly from curiosity to survival, and the loss of the amulet provides a legible cost to the protagonist's goal. However, the escalation is dampened by the abstract nature of the threat ("spatial mutiny," "dimensional vortex") which feels like a light show rather than a visceral danger. The conflict resolves through a battle of wills that is described rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=4.2)
    Escalation is weak; the antagonist (the security chief) offers no resistance once the magic item is introduced, dissipating tension immediately. The "fair trade" is not a negotiation but a supernatural imposition, meaning the stakes are never truly tested in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=2.3)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the story lacks obstacles, antagonistic pressure, or internal dilemmas that would force a tightening of stakes or a pivotal trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=4.1)
    Escalation is driven by luck rather than the protagonist's decisions or rising opposition. The stakes remain internal and abstract, and the climax—overhearing a conversation—lacks the pressure of a forced trade-off or active confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=3.7)
    Stakes remain abstract and philosophical throughout, with no immediate consequence for failure in the scene. There is no escalation of tension; the protagonist faces no opposition or difficult trade-offs, leading to a flat narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is strictly external and abstract ("corporate interests"), with no on-page opposition or immediate pressure testing the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is virtually no active conflict; the protagonist waits for an external event (dawn) that inevitably happens. The antagonist (mining corporation) is abstract and off-page, exerting no immediate pressure on the moment. The "struggle" to outlast the cold is stated in exposition but not felt through physical impediments or equipment failure.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=3.0)

    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no meaningful opposition, internal or external. The "immense burden" is stated but not dramatized, and the physical journey to the lake's center is accomplished without struggle or cost. The stakes remain abstract concepts ("ephemeral nature of truth") that are never tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=2.4)
    There is zero active conflict; the town is dormant and yields instantly to the protagonist's efforts. The stakes ("shared balance") are abstract and never threatened by opposition or time, resulting in a flat line of tension where success is guaranteed from the first sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=4.3)
    Tension is asserted through oxygen warnings but undermined by the ease of the protagonist's victory. The conflict lacks a meaningful turning point where Kaelen must sacrifice something to succeed; the "struggle" is resolved by the tool's magic rather than a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.4)
    The primary on-page obstacles, the spectral wardens, are bypassed without friction ("they did not hinder him"), reducing the tension to a simple race against time. The resolution comes from internal focus rather than navigating reactive opposition, lowering the stakes of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is a distinct lack of friction or escalation; the ghost offers the bead and Elian accepts it immediately without hesitation or conflict.

The scene lacks a turning point where the outcome is in doubt or where a difficult trade-off is required.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=2.8)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; minor obstacles like the "narrow and dark" path are immediately overcome by the protagonist's attributes without tactical adjustment. There is no meaningful escalation or tightening of options; success is inevitable from the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=2.8)
    The story lacks active opposition or distinct stakes; the goal of "restoring faith" is abstract and faces no resistance. The protagonist encounters no potential for failure, and the process is described as a "meditation" rather than a struggle, resulting in a flat narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are telescopic, juxtaposing abstract world-ending threats ("silent war") with low-stakes on-page action (drawing with chalk). There is no antagonist, no tightening of options, and the "compromised identity" complication is resolved instantly without struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are high and clearly signaled (coup), and the arrival of the guard provides necessary external pressure. The escalation from internal processing to physical danger is effective, though the initial conflict is somewhat low-resistance due to the ease of the magical embroidery method.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=3.9)
    While the stakes are declared ("forgive or be consumed"), the on-page conflict lacks friction; the protagonist faces no genuine opposition or difficult trade-off. The climax resolves via a realization handed to the character by the setting, bypassing the necessity of a high-stakes decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are purely internal and abstract ("shared anxieties," "syntax for healing") with no immediate pressure or consequence for failure. There is no antagonist or obstacle resisting the protagonist's efforts; the "decryption" proceeds smoothly to a foregone conclusion of hope. The ending lacks a felt price or trade-off, resulting in low narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=2.8)
    Stakes are virtually non-existent; the fog is an ambient condition rather than an antagonist, and Elara encounters no resistance to her goal. The narrative lacks escalation, as the process of creating the display proceeds smoothly from conception to execution without risk of failure or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story lacks a dominant stake or antagonist; Elara faces no obstacles to her desire. The trade-off between certainty and curiosity is framed as an easy upgrade rather than a dilemma with genuine loss, resulting in a "happy path" narrative without tension.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.3)
    While there is a clear external threat (tax enforcers), the stakes are resolved too easily via the rattle/warp interaction, bypassing any need for Elara to pay a personal price or make a trade-off. The escalation leads to a swift, low-cost escape that diffuses tension immediately rather than tightening it.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=1.5)
    There is virtually no active conflict or tension on the page; the poet faces no obstacles, opposition, or difficult trade-offs. The "artistic struggle" is referenced abstractly but never dramatized, resulting in a flat narrative trajectory where success is inevitable and costless.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are declared ("names would fail") but never tested by opposition or failure; the solution is immediately available and perfectly effective. There is no escalation of pressure or dilemma, only a linear procedural fix.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is strictly retrospective or theoretical; there is no active opposition on the page from the magic, the environment, or the antagonist. The stakes ("ruin") are declared but never tested, as the ink functions perfectly at every step. The resolution dissolves the tension instantly without a negotiated cost.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=3.6)
    While the external pressure of the trembling building is present, the protagonist faces no genuine conflict of values; she satisfies both the council and historians perfectly. The stakes are flattened by the ease of the victory, as the "violent" resistance of the volcano is overcome without sacrifice or lasting consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=3.6)
    Conflict is internal but resolved through external reassurance ("Leo reassured her") and summary ("Elara began to trust again") rather than protagonist agency. The stakes remain abstract because the "betrayal" and the "lost songs" are told rather than felt through immediate, on-page pressure or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=3.0)
    There is no tangible opposition or escalation; the character faces no risk of failure and encounters no obstacles to her understanding. The central conflict is purely cerebral and resolves instantly upon inspection of the props, voiding tension.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=2.8)
    Dominant stakes are declared ("learn the rhythm of belonging") but never tested by opposition or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.0)
    Stakes remain abstract; the impending dredge is a background concept rather than an active pressure forcing difficult choices in the scene. The protagonist observes and reflects but faces no opposition, leading to a resolution that feels like inevitable acceptance rather than a hard-won stance.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=1.8)
    There is no meaningful conflict or pressure; the character faces no external opposition and her internal "struggle" is resolved through summary ("found enlightenment") rather than dramatized effort. Stakes are abstract and declared ("courage could demand a terrible price") but never tested in the scene. The total lack of escalation prevents any genuine cost from landing.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=3.2)

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=2.5)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the mirrors offer no meaningful resistance, trembling and obeying immediately. The stakes remain abstract ("possibilities") with no established consequence for failure, leaving the "persuasion" without dramatic tension or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=2.9)
    There is a distinct lack of dramatic conflict; the warring clans offer no meaningful resistance, moving from suspicion to unity instantly upon entering the ritual circle. The stakes are declared ("Forever War") but not felt, as the resolution comes too easily through magic rather than interpersonal struggle or negotiation. The protagonist encounters no on-page obstacles that force a tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.8)
    The conflict is largely internal and abstract; the "amoral nature" argues against the act in summary, but there is no external obstacle or high price to pay on the page other than the time spent walking. The storm provides atmospheric pressure (a ticking clock) but does not force a difficult trade-off or meaningful escalation of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are declared ("defy the lullaby") but the opposition is abstract and lacks agency, resulting in low narrative tension. The protagonist faces no genuine dilemma or threat of failure; the "resistance" of the final thread is overcome instantly, making the victory feel inevitable and the "cost" invisible.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant conflict is retrospective; the argument with Marco is already over, leaving the protagonist to process it in safety. The escalation is purely internal and low-stakes, as the "reversal" of her art style feels like an easy intellectual pivot rather than a forced trade-off with felt consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=4.4)
    Stakes are thematic rather than dramatic; the protagonist faces no resistance, difficult trade-offs, or risk of failure. The arrival of the butterfly is guaranteed, removing tension from the "waiting" beat, and the cost is purely abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=3.9)
    The story lacks significant opposition or escalating stakes; the rope is merely "stiff," offering minimal physical resistance. The narrative follows a linear path of success without a moment where failure feels possible or options narrow. The result is a procedural sequence with low tension.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.0)
    The storm provides coherent external pressure, and the decaying directive offers internal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is a near-total absence of meaningful conflict or escalation; the protagonist faces no antagonist, deadline, or resource scarcity.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=3.0)

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is no meaningful escalation or resistance; the "runaway dream" is captured on the first attempt with perfect execution. The stakes remain abstract and aspirational, and the characters pay no price for their magic, leaving the victory unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=2.7)
    Escalation is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no active opposition in the present moment, and the obstacle dissolves through a fortuitous discovery (the journal). The resolution arrives via external agency (Lyra's return) rather than the protagonist overcoming a resistance, resulting in low pressure and zero on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are stated ("risk unraveling her own past") but never imminent or felt; the conflict deflates when Elara simply decides to be at peace. The antagonist is abstract (silence/forbidden knowledge), and the resolution lacks a visible price paid for the return to stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are declared as "catastrophic" but feel low because the path to resolution is smooth and the characters face no genuine dilemma or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; there is no antagonist, no ticking clock with consequences, and no internal dilemma that forces a trade-off.

The stakes remain abstract ("recapture the truth") and are never tested by a genuine threat of loss.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=2.2)
    Tension is virtually non-existent; the antagonist is a passive "confusion" that poses no active threat to the protagonist's safety or goals. There is no escalation of stakes; the narrative is a flat line of successful procedural execution. The protagonist faces no dilemma or risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=3.2)

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=3.4)

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story lacks a dominant stake or active opposing force; the "deepening hush" is atmospheric rather than obstructive. There is no escalation, as the protagonist faces no risk of failure, resource loss, or meaningful trade-off while conducting the shadow measurements.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is a near-total absence of dramatic tension or escalation; the antagonist is an abstract atmosphere that poses no active threat or setback.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is stated ("heavy with unspoken words") but not dramatized through pressure; the tension dissolves immediately upon the protagonist's first attempt to speak. There is no escalation of stakes; the resolution comes too easily, with Kael accepting the protagonist's abstract interpretation without resistance or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.0)
    The stakes are clear (mental health vs. the void), but the external conflict is minimal; the ascent is summarized as a "trial of will" rather than dramatized through specific obstacles. The return journey is described as "controlled" and "swift," which deflates the potential tension of the gravity inversion ending.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=2.4)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the protagonist desires a result and achieves it immediately through a single action (humming) without opposition or trade-off. There are no stakes, no risk of failure, and no escalation of pressure, rendering the "victory" unearned and the narrative flat.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=2.9)
    Stakes are declared (sunrise deadline) but never tested by genuine opposition; puzzles are solved "quickly" and doors open "without hesitation." There is no escalation of pressure, merely a sequence of unlocked gates.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=3.7)
    The stakes are purely conceptual (solitude vs. connection) and face no resistance; the "encroachment" is immediately accepted as a teaching moment, nullifying tension. There is no escalation of pressure, only a linear progression toward a foregone conclusion. The "cost" is stated ("let the silence be pierced") but not felt or dramatized through difficult trade-offs or consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is abstract and resolved too easily; the external pressure is met with immediate, successful willpower, bypassing genuine struggle or setbacks. The stakes are purely thematic (trauma vs. healing) and lack a concrete, on-page counterforce that threatens the protagonist's goal in a meaningful way. The resolution extracts a reward (diamond) without a visible trade-off or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=2.2)
    Escalation is non-existent; the protagonist moves from desire to satisfaction in a straight line. The "dominant stake" (truth) faces no opposition—no fear of what he might find, no resistance to the music. The resolution is a zero-cost reset where he simply "accepts" the truth and changes his entire identity.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are purely theoretical and lack visceral urgency; there is no antagonist or pressing deadline. The conflict is internal but static, resolving instantly at the climax without escalation or the foreclosure of other options.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=2.5)
    There are no active stakes or obstacles; Elara seeks information and finds it immediately without facing opposition or making a trade-off. The climax is an informational transaction that resolves her internal heartbreak too neatly, lacking the tension of a true dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=2.0)
    There is no active opposition or antagonist pressure on the page; the Council never threatens Kael, and his journey is a walk to a location.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is a lack of genuine conflict; the environment offers no resistance, and the protagonist faces no antagonist or significant obstacle. The dominant stake (internal peace) is resolved through a series of successful, low-risk discoveries. The lack of failure or setback means there is no escalation of tension or felt cost to the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are internal but palpable; the cost of the coin's destruction is a visible price paid for understanding. The escalation—pushing the artifact to its breaking point—is a clear exercise of agency that forces the resolution. The conflict resolves through a meaningful trade-off (functionality for meaning) that lands with weight.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is virtually no conflict; the antagonist (the soul's trauma) yields instantly to a simple request ("Laugh with me"). Stakes are stated but never tested, and the protagonist faces no risk of failure, resulting in a flat dramatic line with no escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=4.8)

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is a distinct lack of resistance; Elara seeks, finds, and succeeds without facing a tangible antagonist or the risk of failure. The stakes remain abstract ("overlooked histories") and are never threatened by a concrete on-page counterforce that forces a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=3.6)
    There is no meaningful opposition; the ghost appears, and Leo immediately assists without hesitation, risk, or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=4.1)
    Stakes remain high-concept ("destabilize perfect systems") but low-tension, as there is no active opposition or escalation of difficulty. The protagonist achieves her goal without significant hindrance, and the "cost" of the library's stability is accepted immediately, negating potential conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are academic and low-pressure; the antagonist, Professor Kael, is a strawman who offers no effective opposition beyond scoffing. Elara faces no risk of loss—reputation, safety, or resources—and her victory is achieved without a forced trade-off or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are theoretically high (world darkness) but functionally non-existent in the scene, as the protagonist faces no resistance that isn't solved in the next sentence. The "covenant of rust" is an interesting constraint, but because Elian is perfectly honest and the townsman confesses immediately, the constraint generates no dramatic friction or escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=3.8)
    Escalation is negligible; the protagonist faces no physical danger or conflicting options, merely descending until she receives an epiphany. The final choice to surrender the compass lacks a felt sense of trade-off or high stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes are low and abstract; the "crisis of direction" is solved externally by a magical object rather than protagonist agency or struggle. There is no escalation of pressure; the slide provides the answer immediately, and the "technological silence" acts as a convenience rather than a constraint forcing a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=3.0)
    Stakes are purely intellectual with no risk of failure or external opposition. The narrative lacks tension, as the protagonist faces no obstacles other than her own need to "connect the dots," and the resolution requires no sacrifice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.0)
    Conflict is abstract and theoretical ("truth vs. comfort") rather than dramatized in the interaction; the "parley" is a cooperative exposition dump rather than a negotiation with stakes. The protagonist faces no active opposition or genuine dilemma on the page, resulting in a lack of escalation.

The protagonist faces no risk of failure and pays no on-page cost, resulting in a flat narrative trajectory devoid of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.4)

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is nominal; the threat of the "unstable" vortex is neutralized instantly by the acorn cap, preventing any meaningful escalation of pressure. There is no visible cost to Elara's success—she expends no resources she cannot spare and suffers no harm—rendering the stakes theoretical rather than visceral. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=3.0)
    Escalation is atmospheric rather than dramatic; the "zero hour" is a declared state that brings no specific obstacle to the protagonist's agency. The central choice meets no resistance—neither internal doubt nor external failure—rendering the stakes theoretical rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=2.8)
    There are no active stakes or on-page conflicts; the character faces no opposition, external or internal, that forces a difficult trade-off. The "escalation" consists merely of looking deeper and feeling more, with no risk of failure or loss. The resolution is unearned because the protagonist is never truly tested.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=3.1)
    There is no meaningful escalation or cost; the protagonist faces a situation, applies a tool, and the problem vanishes instantly. The stakes ("unspoken words") remain abstract, and the resolution requires no sacrifice, endurance, or difficult choice, resulting in a flat narrative arc devoid of genuine tension.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=2.6)
    Stakes are purely conceptual ("understand the texture of time") and lack immediate urgency or consequence. There is no escalation of pressure; the protagonist encounters no significant obstacles or antagonists, resulting in a narrative flatline where success is automatic.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=2.8)

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is virtually no conflict or escalation. Elara forms a plan, executes it without error ("her remodel was working"), and achieves her goal without facing obstacles or making trade-offs. The stag bowing at the end creates a sense of unearned, "Disneyfied" resolution rather than a hard-won victory born of struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; there is no antagonist, internal doubt, or possibility of failure dramatized in the scene. The "world holding its breath" provides abstract background stakes, but on the page, Elara faces no resistance to her goal. The stakes remain intellectual and are resolved instantly by the experiment working exactly as planned.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=2.8)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the birds, the soil, and the spirits cooperate immediately without resistance. There is no escalation, trade-off, or risk of failure; the protagonist faces no obstacles that force a change in tactics or a re-evaluation of the goal.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.7)
    Escalation is mild; the "wilder" hush offers atmospheric rather than causal pressure. The conflict is a binary puzzle (can he hear it?) solved instantly by applying the leaf, lacking a "try-fail" cycle or an escalation of cost before the final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is a lack of genuine opposition; the environment is passive, and Kaelen encounters no obstacles in recalibrating the sensors or deciding to leave. The stakes are abstract ("finding a new purpose") and the resolution comes without sacrifice or risk, making the escalation feel flat.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the "guardian" acts as a facilitator rather than an antagonist, and the climb is dismissed as a game. Declared stakes (the "wrong sky") never face a concrete, escalating test on the page, leading to a resolution devoid of tension or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=2.8)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the protagonist faces no active antagonist, environmental obstacle, or internal dilemma that forces a trade-off. The escalation is purely additive—spelling more words—resulting in a low-stakes progression that fails to test the protagonist's commitment or agency.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=3.4)
    Stakes are abstract and resolved through a montage of "nightly sessions" rather than a specific pressure-filled moment. The cost is described ("clarity that hurt") rather than dramatized through a difficult trade-off or loss on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes are purely internal and resolved through a low-pressure puzzle mechanism that requires no sacrifice. The "distant thunder" provides artificial urgency but forces no difficult trade-offs, and the "rival tutor" conflict is relegated to backstory without present pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are purely philosophical; while the "price of forgiveness" is discussed, Elara faces no concrete external threat or internal cost on the page. The conflict is theoretical—complexity versus simplicity—without a dramatic antagonist or rising pressure to force a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.3)
    Conflict is purely external (physical endurance vs. environment) and escalates linearly without deepening the character's internal stakes. The "screaming lungs" creates standard urgency but fails to force a moral or tactical trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is virtually no external pressure or genuine conflict; the protagonist takes a walk, finds an object, and decides to be happy. The stakes are purely abstract ("peace," "eternity"), and the "climax" involves no difficult choice or sacrifice, merely a convenient epiphany that resolves the tension without earning it.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is no meaningful opposition; the "remnants of a storm" and the vast distance offer no resistance to the magical solution. The narrative lacks a tightening of options or a moment of potential failure, resulting in a linear progression that feels untested and low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=2.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no opposition, resource scarcity, or time pressure while completing her task. The stakes are purely abstract, and the resolution arrives without the protagonist having to sacrifice anything or make a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.1)
    Pressure comes from the storm and the internal compulsion, but the climax is a calculated execution of a plan rather than a high-stakes dilemma. The lack of a difficult choice or sacrifice at the peak reduces the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is internal and abstract, lacking an on-page antagonist or obstacle; the investigation proceeds smoothly through reflection. There is no escalation of pressure; the mystery is resolved by a sudden, unearned epiphany ("fragment of memory surfaced") rather than active deduction or risk. The "cost" of the closure is stated ("wiser solitude") but not felt or paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rising water creates a tangible "live clock" that successfully forces a decision at the climax. The stakes are high and clear, and the final renunciation carries a felt cost, honoring the scope requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=2.8)
    Escalation is virtually non-existent; the protagonist climbs a hill and receives an answer. Stakes are stated abstractly ("irrevocable doom") but never felt on the page through immediate pressure or hard trade-offs. The resolution comes without a visible price paid by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is virtually no opposition or escalation; the environment yields immediately to the protagonist's intentions once a secret is shared. The stakes are theoretical ("forgotten energies," "possibility") and never tested by failure or resistance. The resolution comes without sacrifice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.2)
    Internal pressure is coherent and escalates effectively through the vision of the naive past selves. The protagonist's active choice to "land" and "distill chaos" into symbols creates a resolution earned by on-page effort.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=2.8)
    Stakes are declared ("felt broken") but never tested; Elara faces no opposition or failure before succeeding. The "conflict" is resolved through a single conversation where she is told exactly how to fix her perspective. The absence of escalation or setbacks makes the ending feel like an unearned victory lap.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes remain theoretical; the storm circles "like predators" but provides no immediate, forcing pressure on the page. The conflict is purely internal and resolves without escalation—the ink crystallizes, she changes her thought process, and it fixes itself immediately. There is no moment where the protagonist faces a difficult trade-off or potential failure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=4.3)
    There is no escalation or active opposition; the ghosts cooperate immediately, and the deadline of dawn exerts no pressure on the actual procedure. The protagonist achieves her goal without facing a reversal or paying a price that alters her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is no antagonist, obstacle, or meaningful pressure; the protagonist faces no risk of failure. The stakes ("reality's core") remain abstract and theoretical, never manifesting as a concrete threat to the character. The resolution is unearned, lacking any trade-off or price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=4.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding the nature of time—remains abstract and theoretical, lacking a felt personal cost or penalty for failure. The escalation consists merely of counting backwards to five hundred; when the character stops, the resolution ("clocks measure... resistance") arrives as a gentle acceptance that dissolves tension rather than a decisive change that forces a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=2.9)
    Stakes are purely nominal; the "intruder" immediately proves benevolent, removing all antagonistic pressure. The conflict is resolved through instantaneous understanding rather than escalation or sacrifice. The deadline (birdsong) is mentioned but carries no consequence for failure, rendering the tension artificial.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative lacks external resistance or palpable stakes; the protagonist moves linearly from desire to epiphany without facing obstacles or making difficult trade-offs. The conflict remains abstract and internal, with no visible cost paid for the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=4.4)
    Conflict is virtually absent for the protagonist; Leo encounters no resistance from the caller, the machinery, or his own limitations, and the resolution is immediate upon applying his method. There is no "meaningful tightening" of stakes or escalation of pressure; the story proceeds from setup to resolution without a moment of doubt or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=3.0)
    There is no effective antagonistic pressure; the demolition is a distant fact that does not interfere with the immediate scene. Elara faces no dilemma or trade-off; she simply executes a task and succeeds, resulting in a flat narrative arc with zero felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.3)
    The stakes are stated abstractly ("cure for loneliness") but lack visceral, immediate pressure within the scene. Leo's acceptance of the rock and the mission comes with little friction or cost; the conflict is resolved through explanation rather than a test of character. The "polite anarchy" remains a declared concept rather than a felt tension between the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=4.7)
    Stakes are declared ("grief," "yearning") but not tested; there is no external opposition or meaningful internal resistance to overcome. The escalation is merely a trail getting clearer, leading to a resolution that feels like a foregone conclusion without risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=4.8)
    Escalation is dampened by the protagonist's immediate success; the antagonist (the anomaly) transforms from threat to partner without extracting a price. The tension dissolves rather than snapping; the "wrong seeds" bear no lasting consequence, and the "monster" turns into a "connection" with minimal resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no resistance in learning the new method and succeeds on his first attempt. The stakes are abstract (loneliness vs. connection) and resolved without a visible cost or trade-off. The narrative lacks a tightening of options; the solution is simply handed to Elian.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is no active opposition or meaningful cost; the protagonist navigates the archive without risk or sacrifice. The stakes remain abstract ("forgotten promise"), and the resolution comes without the character having to foreclose a significant option.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=2.9)
    There is no tangible opposition or cost; Elara drums and the universe complies, succeeding without setback or sacrifice. The conflict is purely conceptual ("resisted the laboratory's confines") and never manifests as an on-page obstacle or antagonist. The stakes remain abstract ("unity," "shared dream") and are never tested by a genuine risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes are stated ("mending the fragile networks") but not felt; the conflict with Kael resolves immediately without cost or significant pressure. The climax involves helping lost workers who are introduced solely to be saved, lacking genuine narrative weight or opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is virtually no active opposition; the "darkness" and the "child's fear" yield immediately to Elara's intervention. The story lacks escalation; the tension is described ("stillwater tension") but not demonstrated through rising stakes or the threat of failure. The resolution is earned through procedure, not sacrifice or tactical adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=2.9)
    External opposition is negligible; the Council is mentioned but absent, and the single guard's resistance dissolves instantly without conflict. Success is achieved without visible trade-offs, risk, or escalation, resulting in a flat narrative lacking genuine stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no external opposition, and her internal hesitation is resolved instantly by the magical summons. The "simmering tension" of the world is described but does not pressure the protagonist into a difficult trade-off or high-stakes decision on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=2.9)
    There is no on-page conflict or meaningful escalation; the "Happiness Mandate" serves as background context rather than an active force applying pressure in the scene. The protagonist faces no immediate obstacle to her ritual, resulting in a flat narrative arc with no visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are theoretical rather than felt; the ban is lifted before the story begins, and the "boundaries" dissolve instantly upon contact. There is no escalation of risk or meaningful trade-off; the protagonist moves from success to success without setbacks. The "doubt" mentioned is resolved in the same breath, preventing any accumulation of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are low because the "barter" involves trading a broken item for a magical improvement, lacking a felt sacrifice or genuine dilemma. The central conflict—the challenge to paint the essence—is overcome immediately without setbacks or tactical adjustments, resulting in a flat narrative arc devoid of escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain low and abstract; the stabilization of the grid removes external urgency, leaving only an intellectual goal. The conflict is internal but resolved too easily by the protagonist's "nature," and the "texture" of connection is found without significant trade-off or risk. The narrative lacks the pressure required to force a defining character moment.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is a distinct lack of opposition; Elara finds clues, understands them, and heals without facing resistance or making difficult trade-offs. The dominant stake (grief) is resolved through a smooth, linear progression of discoveries rather than a high-stakes choice. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=3.6)
    The conflict is purely abstract—a struggle to "map patterns"—and lacks an active antagonist or immediate pressure. The stakes are theoretical ("stability in chaos") and do not force the protagonist into a difficult trade-off or high-cost decision.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are declared ("unravel the mind," "heal modern sorrows") rather than felt through immediate danger or difficult trade-offs. The escalation is flat; Elara attempts the ritual and succeeds with only a summarized internal struggle, lacking a moment where failure seems genuine.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stakes are high conceptually (the future of hope), but immediate scene pressure is low; the shadow "recoils" without fighting back, and the transformation process meets no resistance. The conflict is resolved through a sudden decision to use a "theory" that works instantly, lacking the back-and-forth escalation required for higher tension.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.9)
    The central conflict (self-protection vs. compassion) is evident, but the escalation is weak because the protagonist systematically removes her own barriers without facing significant failure or temptation to do otherwise. The ease with which she "sheds" bitterness and fear lowers the on-page stakes, making the victory feel abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=4.0)
    The story lacks significant conflict or resistance; the plants immediately cooperate, the earth yields easily, and there is no antagonist or time pressure forcing a trade-off. The protagonist moves from desire to fulfillment without facing a moment of doubt or potential failure that would validate the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is virtually no conflict; Elara faces no antagonist, no time pressure, and no internal doubt. The "unused love" is retrieved simply by reaching out a hand, making the stakes theoretical rather than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=2.5)
    The stakes ("trapped creativity") are internal and low-pressure, with no external force opposing the protagonist's goal. There is no escalation; the protagonist faces no setbacks or difficult choices, merely transitioning from observation to success without paying a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is minimal and lacks escalation; the sparks' resistance is overcome by "intent" and "persisting" without requiring tactical shifts or sacrifices. The stated cost ("drained her") is abstract and does not limit her capacity or force a dilemma, resulting in low narrative tension throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=3.0)
    There is virtually no escalation; the protagonist walks, sleeps, arrives, and succeeds without facing a single setback or hard choice. The "dominant stake" (enlightenment) is declared but never tested by opposition, resulting in a linear progression where success feels inevitable. The lack of an antagonist, environmental hazard, or internal doubt renders the stakes purely theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; there is no antagonist, scarcity, or time pressure to force a difficult trade-off. The "leash" is already broken, and the "uncertainty" is soothed immediately by the guides. The resolution comes without cost or sacrifice, flattening the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=3.9)
    The conflict is largely internal and abstract, pitting Elian against the concept of "silence" without any active external opposition or immediate risk. The stakes are stated ("terrible cost") but never tested; he is free to research and conclude without facing a concrete threat or dilemma. The escalation is flat because the investigation encounters no resistance, turning the plot into a linear sequence of tasks.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=3.1)
    There is no meaningful escalation; the protagonist faces no active opposition while executing his plan, and the final confrontation is resolved immediately by a magical gesture. The victory comes without visible cost or trade-off, deflating all tension.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=4.4)
    Conflict is internal and abstract (despair vs. hope) with negligible external pressure or opposition; the "periodically eternal" cycles remove urgency rather than adding it. The resolution arrives via the passage of time ("hours slipped by") and data observation, lacking a moment of high-stakes agency or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=2.6)
    There is no active opposition or escalation; Elara faces no obstacles, antagonists, or difficult decisions. The &quot;lull&quot; is a passive state, not a pressure, and the resolution comes from stumbling upon a power source rather than overcoming resistance, resulting in zero tension.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=3.2)
    Opposition is nominal; the "rigid" council capitulates immediately upon seeing the visions, removing any genuine tension from the climax. The protagonist faces no escalating obstacles or setbacks, making the victory feel unearned and devoid of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is internal but largely theoretical; the struggle is described ("familiar dread rising") and then solved via exposition ("Elara had learned to observe..."). There is no escalation of pressure; the "freeze" response is mentioned but effectively bypassed by her "pearl of stillness," resulting in zero on-page cost. The stakes remain abstract because the outcome (successful coping) is never in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=3.0)
    Stakes remain strictly abstract ("reality," "truth," "spirit") and are resolved through compliant introspection rather than testing the character against genuine opposition. The "walls closing in" offers a metaphorical urgency but fails to force a trade-off or a dilemma where the protagonist must sacrifice something of value to proceed.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=3.8)
    Pressure is negligible as Kael observes the crisis from a position of safety, removing any risk of physical harm or failure. The stakes are entirely theoretical, and the narrative lacks a tightening of options or a moment where the protagonist must sacrifice something to succeed. The resolution comes without struggle or opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=2.8)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the protagonist decides to act within a "blink," meets no resistance from the system, and faces no immediate antagonist. The stakes are declared (genocide, disappearance) but never felt through pressure or near-failure, resulting in a flat trajectory with no genuine escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=2.1)
    The story lacks meaningful conflict; the external chaos never breaches the dome to force a trade-off, and the wanderers offer no opposition. There is no escalation of stakes; Elara’s method works instantly and perfectly, rendering the outcome inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=4.4)
    Conflict is present but low-stakes; the opposition (constellations) is resolved almost immediately by the rail spike without forcing a trade-off or adaptation. The protagonist's fear is "suppressed" rather than confronted, meaning there is no visible or felt cost to his victory. The escalation feels mechanical, lacking a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes are legible and the pressure is coherent, but the internal conflict dissolves too easily upon the discovery of the files. Because the evidence is found instantly and accepted without denial or struggle, the climax lacks the friction required to make the reversal feel fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=4.0)
    Stakes are abstract and internal, with the external conflict (haunted firmware) offering only token resistance ("lashes out") that is easily overcome. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle, as the protagonist's powers face no defined limits or tradeoffs.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=2.8)
    The conflict is trivialized; the antagonist's shouted despair is dismantled instantly by the mere sight of the mandala, offering no genuine opposition. There is no escalation of pressure or narrowing of options, only a linear path to a guaranteed, frictionless victory.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are purely internal and abstract; the protagonist faces no external opposition or genuine dilemma that forces a difficult choice. The resolution comes too easily—she finds a key and decides to change—lacking the tightening of options or the escalation of pressure required to make the transformation feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.1)
    Conflict is internal and abstract ("despair" vs. "redemption") without external pressure or a concrete antagonist to force a hard choice. The escalation is purely rhetorical—the narration claims the timeline resists, but Elara overcomes it instantly without sacrificing anything or changing tactics. The stakes remain theoretical, as the "brink of despair" is never dramatized as a genuine threat, only as a concept.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the potential tension between skepticism and belief is dissolved by a "static shock" before it can be tested. The external stakes (Mara's illness) are high in theory but low on the page, as the protagonist faces no active opposition or trade-offs during the process. The resolution comes without sacrifice or significant effort.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=2.4)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the fossil, the cave, and the laws of physics cooperate instantly with the protagonist's desires. There is no escalation of stakes or meaningful risk, resulting in a flat narrative trajectory where success is inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=3.4)
    There is no meaningful escalation or resistance; the task proceeds smoothly from start to finish with "precise" movements and "steady" hands. The "doom" of the prophecy remains abstract and distant, failing to generate immediate scene-level tension or force difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are declared ("conspiracy," "danger") but not felt; the protagonist moves through the scene with minimal opposition until the sudden, summarized climax. The "enemies closing in" complication appears ex nihilo to force a conclusion, lacking organic causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=3.1)
    Stakes are purely internal and abstract ("finding original truth") with no external pressure or consequence for failure. There is no escalation; the story flatlines until the environmental coincidence (rain stopping) resolves the tension without protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=3.0)
    There is no meaningful conflict or pressure; Kael faces no antagonist, internal doubt, or physical danger. The stakes are purely conceptual, and the "tightening" is simply the deepening of a trance. The ending offers a realization without a visible or felt cost, failing to generate narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is virtually no conflict or escalation; the protagonist faces no external opposition or significant internal barrier. The stakes are purely contemplative, and the "darkness" she combats is abstract, resulting in a meditation rather than a story with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=2.7)
    There is no effective conflict or escalation; the sundial is briefly "silent," but this hurdle vanishes the moment Elara steps into the circle. The stakes are internal but abstract, and the resolution is handed to the protagonist by the environment rather than earned through a difficult choice or trade-off. The narrative lacks tension, as the outcome never feels in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are purely philosophical and lack dramatic tension; there is no risk of failure, rejection, or misunderstanding in the installation process. The protagonist faces no external opposition, and her internal lack is resolved smoothly by the activity itself. The absence of a "tightening" beat where success is in doubt leaves the narrative flat.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.8)
    While stakes are declared (community violence), the conflict is resolved too easily to generate authentic pressure. The "monumental risk" of career suicide is raised but immediately negated by the Director's approval, rendering the central gamble toothless. The subsonic frequency acting as a magical sedative for the crowd conveniently removes the external threat without protagonist struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=2.9)
    Stakes are declared but never felt; the "spatial mutiny" is a background inconvenience rather than an active pressure. The resolution comes too easily through a deus ex machina (the keeper), resulting in zero meaningful escalation or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes remain abstract ("awaken dormant empathy") and lack immediate consequence or cost for Elara. There is no active opposition or escalating pressure; the conflict is entirely internal and resolves without resistance, making the "victory" feel inevitable and low-impact.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=2.5)
    Conflict is negligible; potential obstacles (Roy's suspicion, the committee's hesitation) are overcome instantly via summary description. The protagonist faces no genuine friction, risk, or cost, making the resolution feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is virtually no resistance or cost; the protagonist wants to understand, looks at a fence, immediately understands, and feels better. The conflict is purely internal and resolved by a convenient epiphany that removes the weight of the "vanished hitchhiker" without requiring a difficult decision or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=3.0)
    Escalation is virtually nonexistent; the antagonist (squatter) offers no genuine resistance, folding after a single line of dialogue. There are no stakes felt in the scene because Leo faces no risk of failure, violence, or loss, rendering the "hard-won peace" unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=2.9)
    Stakes are abstract ("suffering of many") and never tested by immediate threat; the conflict is purely intellectual and resolves without escalation, renunciation, or a moment of genuine risk on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes remain abstract; the danger of the "flesh-eating" seeds is dismissed early, leaving no active opposition or time pressure. The conflict is purely procedural—finding an object and using it—without an antagonist or internal barrier to overcome. The narrative lacks escalation; the end requires the same effort as the beginning.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.0)
    Stakes are high-concept ("unravel the very fabric") but low-impact, lacking immediate physical danger or interpersonal friction. The conflict is entirely internal and resolved through a vague magical assertion of "heeding" a promise. There is no escalation of pressure; the protagonist simply performs a ritual and succeeds.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=4.0)
    Conflict is minimal; the "Keeper" acts as a helpful tutorial NPC rather than a source of genuine opposition or pressure. The protagonist’s "reckless intensity" never manifests in a way that raises the stakes or causes a mistake, and the resolution is reached through passive acceptance of advice rather than a high-stakes decision with visible consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are declared but immediately deflated when the supporting character offers reassurance ("You don't have to pretend") rather than opposition. The conflict resolves without the protagonist paying a visible price or facing a genuine dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=4.1)
    Escalation is minimal; the protagonist faces a puzzle rather than a pressure cooker, with no time sensitivity or external threat forcing a hard decision. The stakes are internal and abstract ("understand physics"), and the resolution comes without the tightening of options required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=2.2)
    Tension is effectively non-existent; the declared high stakes ("identities would shatter") are never demonstrated or risked on the page. Elian succeeds immediately and repeatedly without facing opposition, resulting in a flatline of pressure where no options are narrowed and no price is paid.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=3.3)
    There is a near-total absence of conflict or meaningful escalation; Kaelen faces no external opposition and no difficult internal trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=3.2)
    Escalation is virtually absent; the character enters, finds the solution immediately on a wall, and leaves "forever whole." There is no tightening of options, no failure that forces a new tactic, and the resolution comes without visible or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=3.1)
    Stakes are theoretical, as the consequence of the "second letter" is never defined, stripping the deadline of urgency. There is no escalation of pressure; the protagonist faces no dilemma or narrowing of options, simply completing tasks until the destination appears.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.1)
    The stakes (Empire vs. nature) are high and the time pressure (dawn) works well. The cost is paid on-page (destruction of the artifact), though the "Empire" remains a somewhat abstract off-screen threat rather than a proximate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=2.9)
    There is virtually no conflict; the task is performed without external opposition, time pressure, or risk of failure. The stakes ("oblivion") are abstract and never threaten the protagonist's success in the scene. Escalation is absent, as the process proceeds smoothly from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=2.2)
    There is virtually no conflict or escalation; the protagonist moves from desire to fulfillment without facing resistance or paying a cost. The "unforgivable" betrayal is backstory that does not exert pressure on the present moment. Stakes are abstract and declared rather than dramatized through risk or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=3.8)
    Escalation is negligible; the client accepts the protagonist's interventions immediately without meaningful pushback. The conflict between certainty and doubt is resolved through compliance with magical tools rather than genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are low and abstract; the only obstacle (fear) is overcome immediately when Elara speaks, with no visible cost or trade-off. The narrative lacks a meaningful tightening of options, reading more like a guided meditation than a conflict-driven story.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=2.7)
    There are no visible stakes or opposition. Elara faces no risk of failure, no time pressure, and no antagonist (internal or external). The narrative lacks tension because the outcome feels predetermined from the first paragraph; the "struggle" is merely a waiting game.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=2.5)
    Stakes are theoretical as the protagonist faces no active opposition or internal resistance; the path from desire to fulfillment is linear and obstacle-free. The lack of any meaningful tightening or trade-offs renders the victory unearned and the conflict static.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=2.5)
    Stakes are purely theoretical; there is no opposition, time pressure, or risk of failure to test the protagonist's resolve. The environment facilitates rather than resists the goal (lanterns guide him, the water is calm), removing all narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=2.8)
    Stakes are purely abstract ("wavelength align with purpose") and lack immediate consequence or risk of failure. There is no felt opposition; the "static bursts" and "stellar doubt" are easily overcome by a sudden internal realization. The protagonist faces no difficult trade-offs or genuine peril, resulting in a flat narrative trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is strictly internal and resolved through symbolic action without external pressure or the risk of failure. The "sea monsters" and "nameless fears" are passive concepts that are tamed simply by being named, lacking a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=3.4)
    While the stakes are stated as cosmic, the on-page pressure is minimal; the protagonist faces no genuine dilemma or trade-off. The escalation is nonexistent, as the ritual proceeds smoothly to completion, bypassing the central conflict of his mediocrity without a decisive moment of agency or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=2.2)
    There is no genuine conflict; the internal struggle (guilt) is resolved instantly by finding the box, and the external struggle (community connection) meets no resistance. The story skips the "struggle" phase entirely, jumping straight from inciting incident to a perfectly unified resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=2.9)
    Stakes are abstract and internal with no external pressure testing the protagonist's resolve. The conflict (logic vs. intuition) is set up as a binary and resolved instantly by observing nature, lacking escalation or trade-offs. There is no visible cost to the success.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=3.4)
    Stakes are declared ("danger," "trust") but deflate upon resolution when the threat proves benign. The protagonist faces no genuine dilemma or sacrifice, resulting in a low-pressure ending that feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=3.4)
    The central conflict is fragile; the opposing factions function as straw men who capitulate immediately upon Kael's intervention. There is no escalation of pressure, and the "philosophical war" is defused by a single speech and a magic gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=2.5)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent on the page; the antagonist (corporate entity) is relegated to a memory, and the immediate "problem" is merely a curiosity resolved by brainstorming. There is no escalation, no risk of failure, and no visible cost associated with the final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are conceptually high (grief vs. joy) but the on-page pressure is low, as the protagonist faces no active resistance or dilemma beyond the initial task. The escalation is mechanical (singing louder, adding blowers) rather than tactical, and the cost is asserted in abstract terms rather than paid through a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=2.4)
    Stakes remain purely conceptual ("making friends with uncertainty") and lack visceral urgency or definition on the page. The conflict is static until the resolution, which merges the opposing forces without forcing the protagonist to make a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is largely internal but lacks dramatic weight because the risk is mitigated by an instantaneous, magical reward. There is no escalation of pressure; the character simply hesitates, realizes the theme, and succeeds without consequence. The stakes of a "stifling destiny" remain abstract and are never tested by a concrete threat or failure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=4.3)
    Pressure is minimal; the protagonist switches methods and succeeds without escalation, setbacks, or external opposition. The stakes remain abstract ("finding the beginning"), and no difficult trade-off is forced.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is no true escalation; Eli tries a method, it works immediately, and the problem is solved. The narrative lacks a moment of doubt, failure, or deepening danger to test the protagonist's resolve. Stakes are declared but never threatened by a concrete opposing force or time limit.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.1)
    Stakes remain abstract ("memories... began to alter") without immediate physical danger or a deadline; the "eruption" is managed by "methodical" weaving, lacking a moment of desperate trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is minimal; the primary obstacle is a student's fidgeting, which dissolves immediately upon the introduction of a prop. The stakes are declared in exposition ("vital for grasping the unfolded horizons") but not tested in the scene; failure carries no palpable weight or immediate consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=2.2)
    There is virtually no conflict; the antagonist (the ghost) is cooperative, and the obstacle (silence/fear) is resolved instantly with a single assurance. The stakes are declared ("silent war against oblivion") but never threatened on the page; Elara succeeds without risk, sacrifice, or a moment where the outcome is in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are external (tides) and abstract (duty), lacking a moment where Elara must choose between conflicting needs. She achieves her goal and survival without a forced trade-off or meaningful loss, resulting in low tension.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=3.6)
    Stakes are declared but not tested; the ghost appears immediately to facilitate the solution, removing any genuine obstacle or risk of failure. The process of "defragmenting" proceeds smoothly without setbacks, resulting in low narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.7)
    The stakes are high and clearly defined, escalating from the environmental puzzle to a direct confrontation with the cursed object. The climax forces a decisive change in tactics, though the antagonist force (the curse) feels slightly abstract until the very end. The shift from control to accommodation is a satisfying resolution to the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is no meaningful escalation; the protagonist faces no active opposition or dilemma that forces a trade-off. The transition from bitterness to "cosmic joke" is instantaneous and frictionless, lacking the requisite struggle to make the stakes felt. The climax resolves via a declared success rather than an earned turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=2.8)
    Conflict is negligible; the opposing forces (statues) merely "track her" and then immediately surrender when she plays. There is no escalation of stakes or moment of genuine risk where failure seems possible. The resolution is a "magic key" moment that dissolves all tension without a fight or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=2.2)
    Stakes remain abstract ("peace," "unity") and are never tested by concrete opposition or time pressure on the page. The "risk" of the operation is asserted ("smuggling... was risky") but never dramatized; the drone arrives and departs without incident.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=3.2)
    Tension is virtually absent as the environment and objects cooperate fully with the protagonist's goals (the horses "plead," the mist "listens"). There is no antagonist, internal resistance, or scarcity to force a tightening of options or a meaningful high-stakes choice.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=2.8)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no external opposition from the patrons or internal doubt during the ritual. The magic succeeds on the first attempt with a "knowing hand," rendering the stakes theoretical rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes remain abstract ("cipher of longing") and the external opposition is token ("the dream resisted" but yielded quickly to "vigorous" painting). There is no escalation of risk or visible price paid for the success, making the victory feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are purely abstract ("an idea trapped behind fear") and lack immediate, visceral consequences for the protagonist. The antagonist ("shapeless sentinels") is mentioned but never manifests as an active opposing force, resulting in a conflict that feels theoretical. Escalation is described ("world began to warp") but does not force the protagonist to make a difficult trade-off or modify his goal.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=3.0)
    There is a virtual absence of active opposition; the environment does not resist, and the "shimmering presence" is a memory, not a current threat. Elara faces no time pressure, physical danger, or moral dilemma, resulting in a flat escalation curve where success feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.8)
    The conflict is low-stakes interaction that resolves too easily; Elian's resistance melts after a single metaphorical explanation. There is no meaningful escalation or felt cost to the success, as the obstacle is overcome by a change in mindset rather than a sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are declared ("wonder was slowly fading") but never causally tested; the resolution is immediate and lacks opposition. There is no escalation of pressure or necessary trade-off; the protagonist succeeds on her first attempt without paying a price.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=4.1)
    Stakes are asserted ("accumulated silence") but never dramatized; the "danger" is told to the reader ("the process was treacherous") rather than shown through failure or sacrifice. The resolution is frictionless; the antagonist force yields to the protagonist’s competence without forcing a trade-off or adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is no meaningful escalation, opposition, or risk of failure; the protagonist simply observes a clue and succeeds. The stakes remain purely abstract ("unite known and unknown"), and the victory is achieved without any visible, felt, or conceptual cost to the character.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes remain abstract and internal ("understanding the physics of letting go") without a visible, felt cost on the page. The conflict is resolved too easily by finding the note, which removes the need for the protagonist to make a difficult trade-off or face a genuine dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=2.9)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the only pressure comes from a "driftingly alert" feeling and a storm that serves as background decor rather than an active threat. There is no escalation of stakes; Elara faces no opposition, makes no difficult trade-offs, and achieves her goal without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=2.8)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the elevator ascends smoothly, the goggles work instantly, and the diary poses no risk to Elara's duties or safety. The stakes are abstract and untested, with no external opposition or internal dilemma to force a trade-off. The "crumbling pages" offer faux-tension that never materializes into an actual problem.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=2.9)
    There are no functional stakes; the protagonist floats in safety despite the premise of a broken tether. Escalation is absent, replaced by a list of cloud observations that do not increase pressure. The ending brings "serene acceptance" and "joy" without the character paying any price for this resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ticking clock of the demolition creates effective pressure and stakes. However, the conflict is softened because the main barrier (the safe) is bypassed too easily with the ancestor's coin, lacking a moment of genuine tactical struggle or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=3.0)
    Stakes are stated ("redefine aerial navigation") but never felt; there is no opposition, as the captain is immediately compliant and the puzzle solves itself. The narrative lacks escalation, moving in a flat line from observation to success without tightening options or imposing a price.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=2.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; there is no antagonist, time limit, or internal barrier to overcome. Elara moves from goal to execution without facing opposition, resulting in a flat trajectory with zero escalation or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=2.8)
    Conflict is introduced via dialogue ("reexamine") but resolved instantly by internal determination without sacrifice or trade-off. The resolution is costless; the characters simply try harder mentally, and the external world complies, rendering the stakes distinctively low.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=3.7)
    Escalation is virtually nonexistent; Elara faces no external opposition or internal hesitation while performing her task. The "universe holding its breath" implies stakes, but there is no on-page obstacle that threatens failure or forces a trade-off. The outcome feels inevitable from the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.2)
    External pressure (birds, frost) exists but is navigated with relatively low friction; Elara ducks once and the birds move on. The stakes are clear, but the protagonist's victory feels inevitable rather than hard-won against an adapting antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=3.7)
    Escalation is absent; the protagonist moves from observation to success without facing significant obstacles or failure. The stakes (atonement) are declared but never tested; the resolution arrives via a moment of reflection that immediately yields both emotional peace and professional triumph. There is no visible cost or trade-off to the character's success.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=2.2)
    The story lacks genuine conflict; the lull is the only pressure, and the "elusive" method is discovered instantly by uncorking a vial already in possession. There is no antagonist, no risk of failure, and no moment where the outcome is in doubt, rendering the stakes theoretical rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes remain abstract; the risk of "losing himself" is mentioned but never manifests as a concrete obstacle requiring a difficult choice. The protagonist succeeds by simply doing what he came to do, devoid of escalation or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=2.5)
    Meaningful pressure is absent; the protagonist faces no resistance from the environment, the clock mechanism, or the silo representatives. The stakes (social collapse) are declared in exposition but evaporate in the scene, as the solution is implemented instantly without trade-off or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=2.6)
    Stakes are purely theoretical; while the text claims this is a "turbulent journey," the on-page action is a smooth, successful procedure with no opposition or risk of failure. There is no moment where Elara must trade one value for another; she simply gains powers and heals trauma by wishing it so. The "intensification" is told to the reader through summary rather than dramatized through escalating obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.0)
    Stakes remain abstract ("lost syntax of reality") and the central conflict is resolved internally by "holding fast," bypassing genuine external friction. There is no escalation of cost; the protagonist overcomes the "threshold effects" through assertion of will rather than tactical adaptation or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is virtually no conflict; the silence is a passive state that offers no active resistance to Elara's efforts. She faces no setbacks, makes no difficult trade-offs, and succeeds on her first attempt with a "touch as gentle as a falling leaf." The lack of escalation or risk of failure robs the climax of any tension.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=3.5)
    While the declared stakes are high (fate of the covenant), the on-page conflict lacks pressure or active opposition, resolving without sacrifice or trade-off. The protagonist encounters no meaningful obstacles that test his skills or force a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=2.5)

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative lacks escalation or tightening pressure; the protagonist observes, reflects, and succeeds in a linear path. There is no moment where options narrow or a difficult trade-off is forced; the stakes dissolve upon the character's realization.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are abstract ("resilience") and the physical danger of the inversion is navigated with minimal struggle or error. The protagonist faces no difficult choices or tradeoffs; the path to the solution is smooth, lacking deep narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are low and abstract; there is no active opposition or risk of failure, only a gradual accumulation of data. The "abrupt" wind shift attempts to inject physical pressure but resolves immediately without forcing a trade-off or tactical change.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=2.2)
    There is a near-total absence of conflict or stakes; Elara faces no opposition, no difficult trade-offs, and no risk of failure. The process is smooth and predetermined, lacking any meaningful escalation or cost. The "pivotal moment" is a matter of waiting, not striving against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=2.9)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; there is no external antagonist, and the internal struggle is resolved through passive observation in the portal. The protagonist faces no difficult choices or trade-offs; the "harvesting" of wisdom happens automatically. The stakes remain abstract and are resolved too easily to generate genuine narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are clearly established as intellectual and emotional, escalating through the intensity of the borrowed feelings. However, the "danger" of the calculus feels somewhat insulated within the workshop; the pressure is high, but the consequences of failure remain internalized rather than forcing a tangible external trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are purely internal and low-intensity; the protagonist faces no antagonist, obstacle, or time pressure that forces a hard choice. The immediate resolution of his "jitteriness" upon meeting the traveler removes tension early, leading to a flat narrative trajectory devoid of escalation or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=3.9)
    Conflict is severely dampened by the protagonist's lack of resistance. The text explicitly states she allowed the shattering realization to "wash over her without resistance," robbing the climax of tension. The stakes (proving a theory) are intellectual, and the personal cost is accepted too easily to feel substantial.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are high and a cost is explicitly paid, but the escalation feels mechanical, driven by the encroaching "silence" rather than active character agency until the final moment. The resolution via self-sacrifice functions as a "magic fix" rather than a derived consequence of the loom mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=2.9)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no opposition, succeeds in every endeavor immediately (finding silk, trading, forging), and pays no visible price. Stakes remain abstract ("coax resilience") and are never tested by failure or genuine risk.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are purely informational and abstract ("weight of a withheld truth") until the climax creates a physical danger. The conflict is low-resistance; the shard is found easily, and the "weaving" works immediately. The cost is metaphorical ("heavier than any metal") rather than a tangible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes feel low despite the "protect" mandate; the haunting manifests only as coldness and is resolved by the procedural act of lighting the lamp without demanding a significant sacrifice or trade-off from Elian. The resolution comes too easily, lacking a sense of earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=2.7)
    There are no stakes or opposition; the storm is treated as a partner ("laughed... with it") rather than a threat, removing all tension. Kael faces no obstacles, makes no difficult trade-offs, and pays no price for his actions.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=2.9)

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=3.7)

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=3.5)
    The conflict is low-pressure and resolved too easily. The obstacle (her fear/seclusion) dissipates immediately when the elder speaks to her. There is no escalation of stakes; the protagonist does not have to make a hard trade-off or endure a significant trial to gain the wisdom she seeks.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes remain abstract and philosophical ("erosion of memory") without immediate, concrete pressure or opposition on the page. The conflict is internal and low-stakes, resolved by the external validation of the found journal rather than by protagonist agency or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=4.3)
    Stakes are high in concept (oblivion) but low in execution; the protagonist faces no active opposition or genuine risk of failure on the page. The conflict is abstract, and the resolution comes too easily, with the only pressure being a mild time constraint that is easily overcome.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.0)
    The protagonist is passive at the climax, observing the resolution (the agent punching Silas) rather than forcing it through direct action in the scene. There is no visible cost paid by Elara; she records the event and leaves safely, resulting in low tension and minimal earned stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.0)
    Stakes are low and abstract; there is no moment where the protagonist faces a risk of failure or a hard trade-off. The pressure is purely curiosity-driven, and the resolution comes without escalation or obstacle, resulting in a flat narrative arc.

    Escalation is negligible; the protagonist faces no external opposition, and the internal obstacle is bypassed immediately upon entering the cave. The stakes are declared ("artistic soul") but never tested, resulting in a narrative with no friction or meaningful turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=2.5)
    The story lacks genuine opposition or escalation; the journey is a linear progression of successes without risk, failure, or necessary trade-offs. The magical leaves function as a binary safety mechanic that removes the ambiguity and friction of human deceit, flattening potential interpersonal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are abstract ("color of wonder") and lack visceral urgency; the fading hue creates a thematic deficit rather than a concrete threat. Escalation is minimal, resolved by a single act of tuning without opposition or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is no meaningful conflict or escalation; Kael formulates a plan and executes it without error ("movements were precise," "aligning with his plan"). The lack of opposition, external failure, or difficult trade-offs results in a flat trajectory with zero palpable stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=3.0)
    There is no meaningful escalation or opposition; the protagonist moves from clue to solution without facing failure, limited resources, or difficult trade-offs. The stakes are declared but never tested, as every interaction yields immediate cooperation, resulting in a narrative with zero felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=2.8)
    Conflict is static; declared threats (crushing weight, ghosts) exert no pressure, and the protagonist faces no risk of failure. The resolution is unearned, as the "code" yields immediately to the protagonist's specific skills without trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are declared but the on-page obstacle is purely physical (gravity); the deeper conflict of confronting a trauma one "chose to forget" meets no psychological resistance, resulting in a low-tension resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=1.8)
    Tension is non-existent; the protagonist faces no opposition, makes no difficult trade-offs, and succeeds instantly. The "threat" of the prophecy is declared but never demonstrated, resulting in a flat narrative arc with zero escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is negligible; the "agreed upon lies" premise suggests tension that never materializes, as the ghost is cooperative and the revelation is voluntary. The climax is a gentle handover of information rather than a high-stakes confrontation or a choice made under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is no escalation of stakes; the protagonist enters, performs a ritual, and succeeds without facing a meaningful dilemma or trade-off. The absence of an antagonist or internal obstacle results in a static pressure trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=3.4)
    Stakes are purely internal and retrospective, with no active opposition or urgent threat on the page. The only "cost" is a minor physical sting, and the "calibrated treason" is treated as a distant memory rather than a source of active tension or dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=2.0)
    Conflict is negligible; the antagonist ("shadowy group") is an informed attribute that exerts no on-page pressure. The protagonist faces no resistance, risk, or trade-offs, leading to a resolution that feels inevitable and devoid of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=2.0)
    Conflict is entirely summarized, with no immediate resistance or trade-offs experienced by the character on the page. The resolution is declared ("exposure brought her solace") without the cost being felt, rendering the emotional stakes abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=2.1)
    There is virtually no conflict or escalation; the stake ("quiet rebellion against silence") is abstract and faces no opposition. The story functions as a low-stakes vignette without a meaningful turning point or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes are clear and escalate from physical survival to a metaphysical trade-off. The deepening of the conflict—realizing the sanctuary requires a sacrificial cost—adds necessary weight to the ending. The primary obstacle (the letters) is overcome through summary and intuition rather than active, high-pressure choices, which dampens the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=2.4)
    Conflict is telescopic and abstract ("variant allegiance," "factions shifting"), resolved through summary descriptions of speeches and plans rather than dramatized confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=2.2)
    The story lacks active conflict; there is no antagonist, external obstacle, or visible cost to the character's actions. The tension is theoretical ("impatience" vs "patience") and resolves instantly upon the protagonist's nod. Without escalation or the risk of failure, the "revolution" feels essentially weightless.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=2.9)
    Stakes are declared but not felt; the confrontation with Thorn is a melodramatic archetype lacking genuine danger or tactical complexity. The resolution is cost-free—Elara simply walks away, and the systemic corruption is fixed off-page without requiring a sacrifice or difficult trade-off. There is no meaningful tightening of options; the protagonist wins by finding a convenient object and dodging one physical attack.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is minimal; the antagonist (the broken heart) offers no on-page resistance, and the mentor figure agrees to help immediately. The stakes are internal but the pressure is low, as the difficulty of the repair is summarized ("patience, not force") rather than dramatized through specific setbacks or failures.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is virtually no conflict; the protagonist faces no opposition from the environment, the machine, or herself. The central task is accomplished through summarized effort ("worked for hours") rather than dramatized struggle. Consequently, there is no escalation of stakes and no visible or felt cost paid to achieve the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are clear, but the pivotal action—lying to the supervisor—lacks on-page pressure; the obstacle is introduced and resolved ("The lie worked") in a single breath without visible risk or tension.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=2.9)
    Conflict is static; the declared stakes ("region's fragile peace") are never tested by genuine resistance or failure. Kaelen encounters no antagonist or environmental barrier that his abilities cannot instantly overcome, resulting in zero escalation or tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=2.9)
    Stakes are effectively deflated in the first sentence ("woke changed"), removing the tension between the desire for euthanasia and the will to live. There is no escalation or risk of reversion; the character moves through the scene with a guaranteed outcome, resulting in a flat narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=2.5)

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=2.7)

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=1.6)
    There is no antagonist, internal resistance, or meaningful obstacle; Mr. Hemlock and the community accept the healing intervention immediately.

The stakes are abstract ("collective healing") and are never placed at genuine risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=3.0)
    Pressure is virtually non-existent; the protagonist faces no concrete external antagonist, and her internal barrier is overcame in a single sentence without consequence. There is no escalation of stakes, only a steady, frictionless march toward a guaranteed success that renders the "testimony" undramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=5.0)
    External pressure is low, and the internal struggle is resolved passively. The protagonist does not make a difficult choice to renounce his quest; the chalk breaks and he forgets, forcing him into a state of stasis without active sacrifice or decision.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is strictly external (tremors, time limit) and is resolved by a pre-planned technical adjustment without forcing a difficult trade-off or sacrifice from the protagonist. The "shaking foundations" create atmosphere but do not force a hard choice; the protagonist succeeds without paying a tangible price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=2.8)

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=4.5)
    Pressure is negligible; the automaton waits passively, and the ritual succeeds immediately. The only cost is a broken key after the fact, which fails to generate tension during the scene. There is no active resistance or time constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is a near-total absence of on-page resistance or escalation; the protagonist faces no external opposition or significant internal barrier that isn't instantly overcome. The ritual functions as a convenience rather than a test of agency, resulting in a low-stakes healing sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=3.8)
    Pressure is negligible; the mist is a passive condition rather than an active opposition, and the polishing process encounters no setbacks. The protagonist succeeds immediately without having to trade anything of value or overcome a significant hurdle. The conflict remains entirely internal and abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no active opposition from the setting or the secondary character. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through a tightening of choices or paid cost within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=3.0)
    There is no meaningful escalation; the first hope is captured exactly like the last, and the &quot;current&quot; offers no effective opposition that forces a change in tactics. The stakes are purely internal and abstract, and the resolution comes without the protagonist having to foreclose any options or pay a price.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is no tangible conflict on the page; the "decay" offers no resistance to the protagonist's singing. Stakes are declared abstractly ("soul of the land") but never tested or threatened in the scene. The complete lack of opposition or cost means there is no escalation, leaving the narrative flat.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no active opposition, and the only obstacle (the cold/patience) is navigated with ease. The stakes are abstract and thematic ("guides for those who had lost their way") rather than immediate and tangible. There is no moment where failure seems possible or where the protagonist must sacrifice something of value to succeed.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=2.8)
    Conflict is negligible; the process of repair is linear and lacks opposition, setbacks, or a dedicated antagonist. There is no moment where the protagonist must trade one value for another, resulting in zero on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=2.6)
    Stakes are purely abstract, with no immediate threat or antagonist to force a trade-off; success is guaranteed at every step. The dimming lamp introduces a potential clock, but it functions as artificial texture rather than a constraint that alters tactics or forces a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the wood "responded to her touch" without resistance, and the kettle's constraint is dismissed when she "did not rush." There is no escalation of stakes, only a stated transition from grief to acceptance without visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is minimal; the ghost serves as a passive mirror rather than an active opposition, and the "negotiation" lacks friction or back-and-forth pressure. The resolution comes too easily—an offering is made, and acceptance is immediately granted without a testing of resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are purely abstract and lack narrative pressure; there is no active opposition, risk of failure, or trade-off. The protagonist simply decides to fix the terminal and succeeds without paying a visible price or facing a moment of doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=4.0)
    Stakes are purely internal and low-pressure; the protagonist faces no external resistance, time constraint, or risk of failure. The resolution is delivered by a pathetic fallacy (the environment harmonizing with her thoughts) rather than a protagonist-driven escalation or hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=3.1)
    Stakes are abstract ("salvage the truth") and remain internal without external pressure or escalation. There is no meaningful tightening of options; the conflict is resolved instantly by the sundial's revelation, bypassing the need for a difficult decision or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=3.4)
    Stakes are abstract ("before they were erased by time") and the protagonist faces no active opposition; her "infinite patience" functions as a skeleton key that removes all difficulty from the task, resulting in a lack of escalation or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=4.1)
    Stakes are purely thematic; there is no antagonist, obstacle, or time pressure forcing Elara's hand. The climax—a realization delivered to a projection—lacks tension because success was never in doubt. The narrative escalates only in descriptive intensity, not in risk or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=2.6)
    Stakes are purely thematic ("reawaken beauty") and lack immediate, visceral pressure. There is no active antagonist or time constraint; the "mechanical world" is a passive backdrop. The resolution comes without a meaningful tightening of options or a necessary trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=2.7)
    The story lacks a dominant stake or antagonist; the patient is compliant, the procedure is magical and error-free, and the outcome is never in doubt. There is no escalation of tension, only a steady drift toward a guaranteed sentimental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=2.9)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the protagonist faces no active opposition, only the passive passage of time ("sidereal patience"). There is no tightening of stakes or narrowing of options; the "burden" is asserted but never dramatized through difficulty or sacrifice. The resolution is inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are theoretical (entropy/decline) rather than immediate; the protagonist accepts the garden's death immediately upon reading the data, removing potential tension. There is no push-and-pull struggle; the solution (preservation via sonar) is implemented without visible cost or obstacle in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=2.6)
    There is no meaningful opposition or scarcity; the ghost and nature cooperate fully with the protagonist's goals. Stakes remain abstract ("shape of grief") and are never threatened or tested. The protagonist pays no price for her revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=3.0)
    The story lacks escalation; the protagonist identifies a problem and immediately fixes it without facing new obstacles or making difficult trade-offs. The stakes are stated ("devastating flood") but remain abstract and distant from the present moment. The conflict is purely mechanical, with no resistance from the environment or the self.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=2.7)
    There is no meaningful resistance or cost; Elara faces a puzzle that immediately yields its solution without forcing a difficult choice or trade-off. The stakes ("discover the shape of intentions") are abstract and never threatened, leaving the story without genuine narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—societal stagnation—is theoretical and external to the scene, leaving the protagonist in a vacuum without immediate antagonistic pressure. The use of "predictive modeling" deflates tension by allowing Kaelen to foresee outcomes, turning what should be a risky act of creation into a calculated, safe bet.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=3.0)
    Conflict is strictly declared ("threat of exposure loomed large") rather than dramatized; the antagonist never appears, and the protagonist faces no on-page obstacles or hard choices. The stakes remain theoretical, with no escalation of pressure or visible price paid for her rebellion.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake (forgiveness) is resolved through a planned ritual without significant opposition or unexpected complication. The cost of the action—destroying the mask—is symbolic and therapeutic, lacking a visceral sense of loss or difficulty. The pressure remains low as the protagonist smoothly executes her intentions.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes remain abstract ("future rebirth," "forgetting") and are not tested by immediate pressure or opposition in the scene. There is no escalation; the character simply digs and reflects on past arguments. The lack of an urgent, on-page obstacle results in a flat dramatic profile.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is declared in exposition ("old prejudices," "rivalries") but never dramatized through on-page resistance or escalation. The resolution comes without pressure or setbacks; the choir's immediate compliance upon seeing the rosette dissolves the stakes, leaving the central conflict untested.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is no effective conflict; the decay offers no resistance, and the "gentle rebellion" meets no opposition. The stakes remain purely abstract ("hope" vs. "oblivion") and are never tested by a concrete threat or necessary trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is virtually no conflict; the protagonist faces no opposition, makes no difficult decisions, and pays no price for success. The "blackout" provides context but not urgent, escalating pressure, as the solution is immediate and linear. The absence of a "No, and" or "Yes, but" progression leaves the stakes purely theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is no meaningful conflict or escalation; the protagonist faces no obstacles, resistance, or risk of failure. The stakes are purely theoretical (curiosity/desire to heal), and the resolution is achieved through a single, frictionless action that requires no sacrifice or tactical adjustment.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=2.8)
    There are no functional stakes or active opposition; the statue wants to understand, immediately finds the means, and succeeds without cost. The transition to "welcoming nuance" is frictionless, lacking the "visible or felt cost" required for a higher score. The conflict is purely internal and resolved by simple affirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes remain abstract and intellectual throughout; there is no palpable danger or risk of loss. The conflict is resolved by a sudden epiphany that removes the pressure rather than a choice that navigates it.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the magic works instantly, the environment offers no resistance, and the protagonist faces no internal doubt or external antagonist. The stakes—proving a philosophical point to oneself—remain abstract because there is no possibility of failure or cost demonstrated on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are clearly defined as the loss of cultural memory, escalating effectively when the initial attempt with common honey fails. The physical risk of scaling the cliff adds a necessary tangible cost to the resolution, moving the conflict beyond the purely intellectual.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the global stakes (reality/fate) are high, the immediate scene lacks antagonistic pressure; Elara faces no significant setbacks or external obstacles, making her success feel inevitable. The storm provides atmospheric tension but does not force a difficult trade-off or tactical pivot until the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.8)
    Escalation is low; the antagonist (the shadow) poses no active threat that forces Elara to adapt or fail. The resolution is immediate upon confession, lacking the back-and-forth struggle or narrowing of options required for genuine narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.9)
    Escalation is present (silence to wave), but the protagonist's lack of fear ("instead of fear, he felt a surge of purpose") deflates the stakes immediately. The conflict is resolved through mastery rather than struggle, resulting in a low-tension climax where the outcome feels inevitable. The obstacle is harmonized too easily to feel like a genuine threat.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=4.1)
    The protagonist faces no significant opposition or difficult trade-offs; he performs a task and succeeds immediately. The stakes—isolation and dread—are resolved via a convenient informational update rather than a test of character or sacrifice. The absence of on-page cost or risk flattens the tension completely.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story lacks active resistance or pressure; the protagonist faces no antagonist, internal obstacle, or time constraint beyond a symbolic petal. The resolution is inevitable and cost-free, resulting in a flat narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.3)
    The stakes are high in concept (oblivion vs. memory) but low in dramatic pressure; the opposition is largely "lethargic" water and internal sorrow. The escalation relies on a summarized internal realization rather than an urgent external forcing mechanism, making the sacrifice of his dream feel somewhat quiet and intellectualized.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=4.1)
    Stakes remain abstract and intellectual ("truth") with no immediate physical or professional cost to failure on the page. The obstacle of the blackout is bypassed by convenient competence ("muscle memory," "perception"), preventing the accumulation of genuine narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is internal and static; the shadow's "regrets" are mentioned but ignored, and the "heaviness" is a physical inconvenience rather than a stake-raising obstacle. The escalation is repetitive (polish, fold, repeat) rather than intensifying, leading to a resolution that feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.6)
    The internal stake (understanding grief) is established early, but the escalation lacks external pressure; the cooling circuit breakers provide a frame but do not force a difficult trade-off on the page. The resolution is a realization granted by the environment rather than a hard choice made under pressure, softening the dramatic impact.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are declared ("fractured world") but never tested in the scene; the only obstacle is a momentary data glitch solved by a technobabble recalibration. There is no escalation of pressure, and the protagonist faces no risk of failure or meaningful trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=5.1)
    The stakes remain largely internal and are resolved by a stroke of luck (finding the carving) rather than an active decision under pressure. The conflict does not escalate through tactical choices; Elara simply goes to a place, finds an object, and receives an epiphany, lacking a true "crucible" moment.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=3.7)
    Escalation is negligible; the antagonist offers no meaningful opposition, shifting from "grim-faced" to agreeing to a new protocol within a few lines. The dominant stake (peace) is achieved without a visible trade-off, risk, or narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.1)
    Stakes are articulated through abstract, repeated phrases ("backlash of regrets") rather than felt consequences or escalating pressure. The physical conflict (the wave) is resolved quickly with a convenient shift in mindset, lacking the "meaningful tightening" or distinct trade-offs required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are theoretical; there is no immediate external pressure or antagonist forcing a choice. The climax is a transaction (throwing a ball) rather than a high-stakes dilemma, and the emotional cost is waived in the exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.0)
    The central stake (loss of self) is clear and the cost is paid on the page. However, the internal conflict is resolved via summary ("she remained paradoxically steady") rather than a dramatized struggle, lowering the felt tension.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is strictly internal and lacks escalation; the ritual works exactly as intended without failure or complication. The resolution offers "symmetric satisfaction"—trading regret for wisdom—without a visible, felt cost to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is largely abstract ("vast, silent pressure") and lacks interpersonal or visceral stakes, relying on internal "focus" to overcome resistance. The escalation is linear—she simply tries harder—and the cost of "pushing down joy" is minimal compared to the scale of opening a dimensional door.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=2.8)
    Stakes remain abstract and low; destitution is a label rather than a source of on-page pressure, and the act of releasing the bugs faces no external or internal resistance. The narrative lacks a meaningful tightening of options; the protagonist simply proceeds to a guaranteed positive outcome without facing a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=2.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the opposition is described as "confused" or sleeping, and the environment cooperates perfectly with the protagonist's plan. There is no escalation, no moment where options narrow, and no trade-off made to achieve the goal; success is a foregone conclusion from the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=4.5)
    The stakes ("ruin or revelation") remain abstract and are resolved without significant sacrifice or trade-off. The climax—adjusting a single rock—lacks escalation or difficulty, and the resolution provides a "have it all" outcome where the curse lifts and order is restored without a price.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=2.8)
    Conflict is resolved without genuine struggle; the protagonist writes the healing poem effortlessly ("words began to flow"), and external validation arrives immediately via the stranger. There is no escalation of pressure that forces a difficult trade-off; the "silence" is broken by a convenient external permission rather than a risky internal choice.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=3.9)
    The conflict is summarized rather than dramatized; the duel is described through metaphors ("each strike a syllogism") that distance the reader from physical danger or effort. The stakes dissolve immediately upon contact with the opponent, as they agree to the scroll's terms without debate or cost. There is no moment of doubt or potential loss to drive the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=2.4)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the characters work in "companionable silence" with total agreement and no immediate obstacles. The stakes of "resistance" remain abstract concepts discussed in dialogue rather than pressures forcing difficult choices in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=4.5)
    Pressure is nominally established by the approaching storm, but it never forces the protagonist to alter his plan or sacrifice a desire. The conflict is external and easily circumvented by the magic system; the "broken clock" and "flickering compasses" signal urgency but do not create obstacles that test Elian’s resolve. The resolution arrives without the protagonist having to navigate a true dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is strictly external (Monsoon) and resolved via magical convenience without requiring a difficult trade-off or sacrifice. The protagonist faces no significant opposition, and the stakes, while stated as high, feel abstract because success is achieved too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=3.5)
    Escalation is virtually nonexistent, as the protagonist follows instructions and succeeds immediately without encountering external obstacles, failure states, or internal temptation to abandon the path. The stakes remain abstract ("mend the silence") and are resolved by a magical epiphany rather than a cost-bearing decision or renunciation. The compass removes the need for the character to struggle for insight, flattening the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.8)
    Single dominant stake—strip drama from catastrophe—is declared early and reiterated, yet pressure escalates only by accretion, not by narrowing options. No live dilemma or trade-off is ever staged; the protagonist’s stance merely deepens. Conceptual cost is present in the final reframe, but the lack of a tested commitment keeps this below 8-band. One meaningful tightening occurs, but it is tonal, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—survival and purpose—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when frost patterns reveal the rival’s name, foreclosing the “why” mystery. Cost is conceptual (loss of innocence) not visceral; no resource or relationship is forfeited on-page. Escalation is knowledge-based under causal lens; pressure plateaus once the ledger is read.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—translate silence into perceivable music—tightens through color-intensification beats; each fork strike raises saturation cost (one live option foreclosed: she can never share audible music). No external antagonist; pressure is internal-material. Escalation is accumulative: scarlet→azure→violet→gold ripple; pattern break at piano (no strings) deepens constraint. Price visible: permanent sensory exile.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are declared—restore lost souls—but never personalized or endangered; Elijah’s breath supply, submersible limits, or even fear are absent, so pressure stays abstract. The one escalation is discovering the moonbeam chamber, yet it presents no trade-off or visible price. Agency is present (he chooses to stay and fix) but consequence is weightless, keeping escalation functional yet thin.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—keep exiles alive and unified—remains stable; no resource loss or external raid escalates tension. Pressure is atmospheric, not tactical; the single meaningful turn is Elara’s declaration, which reweights survival into “building a future” but incurs no visible cost or foreclosed option. Agency is present yet static; midnight runs succeed anonymously every time, muting jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—locate and release orphaned love—is signaled in paragraph two and steadily intensifies as each strand ignites. Pressure is accumulative: every exhalation reveals another reservoir, deepening emotional density rather than narrowing external options. Cost is present (the tear burns out, her past-life ache softens), but the tightening is cadence-based, not a trade-off that forecloses a live alternative. Meets 8.2 bar for lyric escalation; lacks a visible price that alters later tactics, keeping it sub-8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—“break the retrocognitive loop or drown in yesterday’s echoes”—is signaled early and tightens through each fold she introduces; every new curve increases the density of invasive visions. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes time is fractal, not linear, a shift that reweights her possible tactics from escape to integration. The visible price is the photographs’ erasure and the bridge’s dissolution; these losses alter her emotional arithmetic, foreclosing nostalgia as an option. Escalation remains coherent under the Accumulative lens: each geometric addition intensifies the sensory barrage until the pattern break releases pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—liberate seeds while chained—is signaled early and tied to bodily risk, but on-page pressure stays static: guard appears once and is neutralized in half a sentence. No credible losses (time, tool, stamina) alter tactics; decryption carries no visible failure risk. The wall-collapse coincidence complicates but also hand-delivers daylight for the closing image, functioning more as providence than earned tightening. Cost is symbolic (chains loosen) rather than felt or forfeited.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—capture the sound of trust breaking—signaled in paragraph 1. Pressure intensifies via accretion: each harvested silence narrows the sonic field until only the crumbling echo remains. Protagonist agency is continuous: every imprint is a decision that spends emotional capital. Cost is conceptual but visible—aurora’s scream becomes hush, her colors gray—foreclosing further quest. One meaningful tightening suffices; no reversal, but deepening reweights stakes from revenge to repair.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—possession of a future moment—tightens once when orchids foretell trap; no further narrowing. Escalation is accretive, not causal: each flower code adds texture rather than new cost. Visible price is the drained jar, but that consequence is post-closure; during the scene it grants free power. Tension is atmospheric, not tactical; options never feel foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—crafting portable sanctuaries for fragile questions—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when the flawed sphere is accepted as prototype. Escalation is accretive: each furnace breath melts both ice and interior detachment. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: she forfeits perfect order and embraces permeability. A visible concrete loss (tool breakage, time running out) would have sharpened the final trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—prove vulnerability is power—signaled early and tightened at the clock-tower confrontation. Escalation is singular but meaningful: decryption of the cast-code forces Leo to embrace the very height-phobia Silas exploits. Cost is conceptual (public exposure of fear) yet not tangibly felt—no sprained ankle, no lost ally, no social credit visibly forfeited—so pressure stays psychological rather than tactical. Protagonist agency drives the turn; coincidence absent.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are abstract—“comfort for lost souls in endless night”—and never localize into a concrete risk or ticking clock for the oracle herself. Pressure is atmospheric (ambered hush) rather than a narrowing of options; the single meaningful tightening is the booklet’s glow, but it resolves rather than complicates. No visible price is paid by her; the escalation is purely decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single dominant stake—assemble the splintered selves—signals early; pressure deepens through iterative violin notes that accumulate glimpses rather than forcing new tactical choices. No visible price is exacted on the page (no system overload, memory loss, or shattering violin); escalation is tonal, not consequential. Nevertheless, the accrual tightens the emotional cadence enough to qualify under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stake is transparent vs. suspected theft; escalation is the stepwise decoding of doodles leading to Marco’s confession. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes—each lens enlargement reveals more data but no new risk—so the decisive turn feels informative rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stake—prove care beats luck—is declared early and restated often, yet no scene tests failure; vines comply, visitors capitulate, so pressure plateaus. The single “stubborn vine” is redirected off-page before we see stakes. Because garden never resists, escalation is rhetorical, not tactical; cost is conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are single and dominant: prove lateral time before Mothraals reactivate and warp the fields. The tightening is the fading twilight alignment window—one quiet but irreversible clock. Agency is present (Kael pulls the lever), but the cost is conceptual rather than visceral; no tool breaks, no social punishment, only the shared risk of error. That intellectual wager is sufficient under an accumulative lens, yet lacks a tangible forfeiture that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—decode the ghost’s silence—signals early and tightens once: the water-stain map forces her into the pit, narrowing safe observation to risky contact. Escalation is single but decisive; the slap renounces passive reading and triggers the spectral response. Cost is legible in soaked paper and the unplayable violin she now shoulders. No off-stage rescue; the beat is entirely her agency under rising water and time pressure of fading light.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.3)
    Declared stake—“find the weight of a swallowed truth”—remains abstract; no external deadline, resource limit, or audience for her forecasts appears, so pressure is internal and diffuse. Escalation is a single loop: erratic data → illustration → off-page historical correlation → forecast tweak; no live storm or equipment failure forces an irreversible decision. The swallowed truth’s cost is never sharpened into a choice between publishing a possibly wrong warning or protecting her reputation, so stakes stay conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—uncover the swallowed truth—tightens when the radio confession makes the abstract disaster personal. One meaningful reversal: ghost-shift sounds cease the instant guilt is spoken, proving trauma not specter. Cost is rendered on-page: “the tunnel did not feel so heavy anymore,” transferring weight to Kaelen. Pressure escalates under causal lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.0)
    Only one meaningful tightening: the restlessness that drives the first burrow. No later escalation; stakes stay philosophical—will the keeper keep watching?—and never narrow options or exact a visible price. Pressure plateaus after the portal opens; silence washes rather than tests.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stake is early and single: rekindle Leo’s awe. Escalation is textural—each paragraph adds a gentle layer of motif rather than a causal squeeze—so pressure accretes but never tightens to a trade-off. The eclipse provides a natural intensifier yet no option is foreclosed; the music simply adapts and succeeds. Cost is poetic rather than practical, keeping the score shy of the 7.5+ tier where price must visibly redirect tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost dream-capacity—is signaled early and deepens when Elian learns the axis shift severed dreams. Escalation is accumulative: each relic adds knowledge, tightening the cost of irreversibility. The decisive intensification arrives when the device activates and “stories flowed,” foreclosing any chance of new dreams; the price is legible. No external antagonist is needed; pressure is epistemic and existential, coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—will open secrets stay buried or ignite a new life?—is signaled in paragraph one: “accidentally prophetic…truths the islanders never acknowledged.” Escalation is steady: each fortune tightens scrutiny (microdot risk), Leo’s approach compresses space, cache discovery forecloses anonymity. Protagonist agency drives midpoint pivot—Elara decides to reveal network rather than flee—yet cost is more conceptual than visceral; no concrete forfeiture (job, safety) is dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.8)
    One dominant stake—prevent completion of possession—is signaled in line 4 and tightens through each layered question that forecloses the entity’s ideological space. The meaningful turn is the chiasmus “What is taken is never truly held,” which crystallizes the protagonist’s agency and forces the invader to pay the price of dissolution. Cost is visible: the palette dims, the blue stain fades, Elian’s silence decoration is spent.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—compose the unheard symphony before exhaustion—signals early and tightens via each mapped memory. The final conducting moment forecloses the path of rest until after dawn; price is her physical collapse. Escalation is accumulative: each recalled texture raises the musical density rather than narrowing external options. Cost is visible (eyelids heavy, shell lowered in fatigue) but not persistent; no constraint shapes later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“conquer the labyrinth of self”—tightens through each tablet activation that forces integration of a fractured reflection. Escalation is Accumulative: each new path/bridge increases density of selves to absorb, visible cost is legible (“painful; each integration felt like...dying”). Procedural generation mechanics ensure pressure never resets. Final renunciation forecloses further defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—defeat emotional numbness—is signaled in line 2 and tightens when the needle’s backward vibration offers the only tactile bridge to feeling. One meaningful deepening: chaos of reversed beats resolves into “filament of hush,” foreclosing retreat into silence. Cost is visible: tears, clay mark, public re-entry as visibly altered teacher. Agency remains interior—listening by touch—but irrevocably alters her stance toward students and self.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—integrity of data vs. personal safety—signaled early and tightens when follower reappears; option to flee is foreclosed by her invitation. Agency visible: she chooses to share logs, paying social exposure cost. Escalation driven by her lateral cross-referencing, not luck; coincidence (pigeon arrival) complicates, does not resolve. Price paid: loss of solitary sanctuary; visible on page.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—why scents wound—tightens once when vial aroma forces on-page tears, proving the hypothesis. Escalation is textural: UV reveal + pollen cloud deepen the *meaning* of her grief rather than creating external jeopardy. Visible cost: she accepts future exposure to triggering smells—an Earned Stasis that forecloses emotional avoidance. Agency is interior but legitimate under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—free the suffering entities or keep his mnemonic liberty—tightens exactly once when the dance is read as distress signal. Protagonist agency drives the turn: weaving the spiral channels his life-seconds outward. Sacrifice of the rope’s memories is a visible, irreplaceable price that alters future options (he can never re-climb that proof of freedom). Escalation is situational but coherent; no outside coincidence rescues or dooms.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—redeem silence into story—tightens when heat forces echoes out; escalation is textural, not perilous, but the single deepening is legible and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—authenticity vs. counterfeit—is signaled in line 1 and tightened once: counterfeit joy tastes hollow → petal dropped, path foreclosed. Agency is internal yet visible; no coincidence. Cost is the loss of her trade tool and the income it represents. Escalation is single but sufficient for 700 words; however, the absence of an external antagonist or secondary reversal keeps pressure intimate rather than crushing, capping at low 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—uplift silent contributors—is signaled early and tightens when Elara decides to find Anya, narrowing her goal. Yet escalation is gentle: no concrete obstacle or price is faced; the “cycles” expand off-page via montage. Agency is present but low-pressure; coincidence (lucky envelope) drives instead of challenging her shrewdness. Cost is conceptual, not viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—belonging—signaled in paragraph 1.  Escalation is accumulative: each shared walk thickens camaraderie until the arbor discovery crystallizes acceptance.  The spiral tag is coincidence-neutral; it complicates by remaining hidden, then rewards her perseverance.  Cost is social, not material: she trades perpetual outsider status for tentative inclusion—plausible but low-temperature price.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—liberate the echoes—tightens through each beat as borrowed time depletes; the giant’s rumble is the live countdown. Agency is present: Elara decides to sculpt and release, not merely witness. Cost is visible in the final backward lurch and her sudden ageing. Escalation is textural rather than causal-reversing; density of frozen birds and stuttering songs reweights risk; sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“decode grief”—tightens when the glass eyes project Lyra’s face, forcing shift from solution to acceptance. Escalation is textural: drip-cued ripples accumulate until the emotional field outputs an undeniable image, narrowing options to endurance rather than answer. Cost is the lifelong method abandoned; the tool is left behind. No antagonist needed—the orchard’s own logic supplies pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—voice of memory versus blackout fear—signaled in line 3; tightening occurs when the second flicker forces the broadcast decision, narrowing options from hide to reveal. Cost is the irreversible exposure of the cache and Kaelen’s forfeiture of continued anonymity. Agency is continuous: every probe, wipe, and volume turn is his; no lucky rescue. Meets 8.8 gate but not 9+ because price is felt yet not persistent—he can still crawl away afterward.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—control vs. adaptive surrender—tightens with each storm: props fail, trellis softens, leaf is released. One meaningful turn at the leaf release narrows her options from fix to witness; cost is the loss of her former self-concept. Agency is interior but visible; no coincidence rescues her. The escalation is lyrical rather than plot-twist, satisfying the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—finding meaning in post-war fragments—tightens when the brooch’s history is revealed, forcing Kaelen to choose between private symbol and shared memory. Agency is present: he kneels, pockets, then willingly trades the brooch; the cost is the surrender of his talisman and the admission that his canvas alone cannot heal. Escalation is single but meaningful; coincidence (Elara appears) complicates rather than resolves. No visible price alters later tactics beyond the emotional reconfiguration, keeping the score sub-8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—“magnify everyday magic”—is signaled early and escalates through one visible tightening: the mist-downpour that proves amplification works. Cost is present but light: Kaelen’s relinquished control, Elara’s permanent binding; both stated more than felt. Agency sits with Elara’s memory-choice; Kaelen’s clairvoyant failure complicates but does not raise on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—restoration of communal voice—signaled early; pressure tightens when each interval reveals another missing record, foreclosing the option to remain private scholar. Protagonist’s decision to stage twilight ceremony is the visible reversal that narrows options: she trades exile’s anonymity for public accountability. Cost is legible—she risks being dismissed again if revelation fails. Missing credible resource loss (time/stamina) keeps it under 8.2.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.4)
    A single dominant stake—reach the fortress of truths—drives every beat; escalation arrives as each new realm (arrows → mist → vault → sphere) raises the ontological ante. Agency is mostly directional: Elara follows rather than tests; the decisive thrust is pre-scripted by the punch’s unexplained power, blunting cost visibility. The tightening is atmospheric, not tactical: options narrow to “step through shimmer” or retreat, but retreat is never dramatized as possible. Under Accumulative lens the deepening pattern suffices, yet the lack of a credible loss (time, injury, social credit) keeps pressure conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—can she convert abstract artifact into communal refuge—tightens when the tile glows and she must decide to share it; that choice forecloses her private study forever. Escalation is accumulative: each copied line increases communal atmospheric pressure until silence blooms. Visible cost is the forfeiture of solitary ownership; villagers now co-author the tower’s future. No coincidence; migration timeline acts as live clock, not rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“what happens after goodbye”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the rift reveals an infinite regression of past farewells. Agency is present: Kaelen channels storm energy through his body to stabilize the rift, paying an implicit stamina cost. Escalation is causal under storm→rift→revelation; no fake reversals. Price is conceptual, not visceral, keeping it just below the 8.5 band.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—father’s asylum—tightens via each surveillance discovery; one deepening suffices. Agency visible: Leo’s invented flower-drop lures the security chief; refusal to physically breach is active renunciation with felt moral cost. No coincidence; chief’s doubt is liquefied by ink-pot, a causal device. Cost: Leo embraces solitary dawn, father safe but relationship still hollow—price acknowledged.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is preservation vs. oblivion—can one man trap an evanescent texture before dawn erases it? Pressure escalates only once: the hum wavers, and Elian must capture the shift or lose that stratum forever. No antagonist, no reversal, but the clock of sunrise is a credible tightening agent. The cost is conceptual rather than visceral—he forfeits communion with the living forest for abstract inscription—adequate for this length, though a notch below visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will he recover his authentic past?—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the poison label reframes every fragment. Progression is accumulative: each overheard story rubs against the last, increasing density rather than causal reversals. Cost is visible: he forfeits the safety of anonymity by accepting the arsenic memory. One meaningful deepening suffices under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—decode the riddle—flips to acceptance; one meaningful tightening occurs when compass points to her heart, foreclosing the search. Pressure is textural: each cello note deepens density until the stance crystallizes. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, but legible. Agency is present (she plays, she retells), yet external opposition is absent; escalation is accumulative, not causal.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single dominant stake—community survival vs. privatization—signaled in paragraph one and tightened when Elara’s graffiti schedules the clandestine meeting, foreclosing open protest. Agency sits entirely with her; no coincidence rescues. Cost is conceptual not visceral: she burns the bridge to corporate collaboration by encoding resistance. Visible price would sharpen (a spray-can hiss alerting guards, say) for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten from abstraction (loss of “pristine”) to concrete countdown: gold vial = 90 seconds till solar erasure. Agency is pure attention—she cannot stop the drill, only outlast the dark long enough to fix the image; that limitation sharpens rather than weakens tension. One meaningful escalation: azure → gold chemical flip forces the shutter press; cost is the irreversible moment of sunlight on now-doomed rock. Pressure stays coherent under accumulative lens: each hue shift is a heavier stone laid on the possibility of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—restore navigation drone before ship departs—is signaled early. Escalation is a single straight line: silence → hum → flight. No reversal or resource lost; the patch works on first try, so pressure plateaus rather than tightens. Cost is off-loaded onto the ship’s future voyage, not Elara’s present options, keeping tension moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—locate the river’s origin—tightens once: condensation rivulets narrow infinite ice to a single fissure, forcing Elias to step onto treacherous terrain. Cost is visible (bitter air, fatigue, existential doubt) and persists: the new stream is “nascent,” implying future obliteration of his printed atlases. No reversal or antagonist is needed under the Accumulative lens; the pressure is pattern-density reaching critical mass. The worry that discovery may be meaningless arrives too late to escalate stakes mid-scene, keeping the score short of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are singular: restore balance before the collapse recurs. Pressure escalates through sensory intensification (shimmer, whispers, solidifying shadows) rather than causal reversal; the tightening is poetic but not option-narrowing. No visible price is paid by Elian—no exhaustion, doubt, or forfeiture—so the cost is atmospheric rather than personal. Sufficient for high band, but the missing personal toll blocks 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—capture silence before air runs out—tightens via blinking gauge and audible alarm; each gear shift shortens options under accumulative pressure. Visible price: final alarm chirp coincides with corking, making the success/escape trade-off visceral. No secondary antagonist needed; environment and internal override supply sufficient friction. Escalation is linear, not reversed, fitting the lyric-density lens.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“before they find the bodies”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens when shouts rise from below; Kaelen’s agency is the whispered confessions that re-pattern the labyrinth, trading social death (legacy of lies) for physical escape. Cost is conceptual but legible: the beam’s purification consumes his narrative capital, leaving him nameless on the reef. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal is required under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—liberation via debt repayment—signals early; pressure escalates through denser visitations, not reversals. The bead hand-off crystallizes the trade-off under the Accumulative lens; cost is legible as her dissolution and his solitary continuance, but no tangible price alters his tactics afterward.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes—“restore sacredness”—are declared early but remain abstract; no external force opposes Elara, and the labyrinth never threatens to reject her. Escalation is purely chromatic: colors brighten, glow increases; no resource dwindles and no option is foreclosed, so pressure is static. The single micro-turn (last stitch → awakening) is textural, not consequential, lacking a visible price. Because coincidence is absent and agency is continuous, the beat sequence is coherent, but it never tightens—only intensifies ambiance.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—restore lost faith—is signaled early and deepens as each artifact surfaces, but escalation relies on accretion rather than a tightening trade-off. The sundial’s shadow is the single decisive intensifier that forecloses further wandering; prior beats accumulate density without visible cost to Elara (no fatigue, doubt, or resource limit). Still, the final reconfiguration carries felt conceptual price, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—protect the letter’s hidden truth—signaled early. Escalation is present but mild: each chalk symbol incrementally reduces exposure risk, yet no moment forces a trade-off or visible loss. Agency is steady execution rather than a tightening that forecloses an option. Cost remains conceptual; without a felt price the beat stays informative, not transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—prevent unnamed coup—tightens when embroidery reveals the guard’s complicity, moving risk from abstract to personal. One meaningful deepening: flame flickers not from draft but from her revealed truth, signalling that knowledge itself endangers her. Cost is felt: she trades the kingdom’s symbol of continuity (light) for a half-chance warning, foreclosing her own safety. Pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens; no reversal needed, only the final crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will she await his apology or release it?—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates through each condensed message that removes Kaelen’s agency and shifts cost to her. The meaningful tightening occurs when the final leaf states “The decision is not his… but yours,” foreclosing the option to keep waiting. Price is visible: the letters literally leave her body; the shard’s warmth dies. Under Accumulative lens, pattern-break of silence after final evocation reweights the stake with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—translate terror into shared meaning—tightens as each smudged symbol is decoded; the final “two figures holding hands” forecloses the option of permanent incomprehension, with the coral’s pulse as visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—recover lost joy—remains abstract; pressure is atmospheric rather than option-narrowing. One meaningful intensification: the fragment projects a living orchard, forcing her stance crystallization. Cost is conceptual (she accepts perpetual labor inside ruin) but not viscerally felt on page. Agency is present—she steers light—but escalation is mostly lyrical accumulation, not causal tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“will she trade certainty for wonder?”—is signaled at the coin’s first warmth and tightens when she decides to tap the crystal. Escalation is accumulative: each reflected wave peels back another layer of mural history, raising the cost of clinging to expertise. Agency is visible: she chooses to toss the coin away, forfeiting interpretive control. Price is conceptual but legible: she accepts eternal incomprehension.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—preserve thought-privacy—signaled in para 1, escalates when scanners target gardens, the club’s single vulnerability. Middle tightening: warping energy blurs their lavender-thyme safe-house map, forcing live re-seeding; failure now equals capture/memory-wipe. Protagonist agency drives turn—her scatter-seed decision under enforcer glare—narrows options to permanent flight, costs calm. No coin-flip rescue; cacophony tactic arises from their own rehearsal (rattle chorus). Price legible: sanctuary “warped beyond recognition,” comrades disperse, her future shrunk to alley-lit transience. Sufficient escalation for 800-word window; only wished for one more sensory beat of pain/loss to push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single dominant stake—preserve echo of forgotten names—is signaled early and escalates as cracked chime endangers the whole archive. Tightening occurs once: discovery that only the lost song can mend the tube narrows options and drives the archive search; cost is conceptual (renewed regret). Agency remains reactive—search, hold tablet, witness repair—rather than a risky choice with forfeiture; tension is atmospheric, not tactical. Under Accumulative lens the deepening lands; stronger visceral price would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“restore trust before dawn”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened by the literal rising light that will end her window. Each vow narrows her options: once the ink encodes a promise, failure would trigger magical backlash, a felt cost she acknowledges. The climax is her fifth, most dangerous vow (forgiveness); the scroll’s audible harmony is the irreversible result, foreclosing retreat. No coincidence; all pressure stems from her sequential agency under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve the sacred site without endangering the village—signaled early. Pressure escalates via the building’s increasingly violent tremors, but the protagonist’s agency is reactive calibration, not risk-creating choice; no option is ever closed off. Cost is conceptual (future inspectors may miss her work) rather than visceral or resource-based. Sufficient tightening for the length, but the absence of a tangible trade-off caps the score below elite tier.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving vanished songs while risking self-exposure—arrives early and tightens through each pigeon flight and Leo’s probing kindness. The meaningful turn is the chip decryption choice that forecloses her isolation; cost is the surrender of her curated story. Escalation is accumulative rather than sharply reversive; coincidence (the letter) nudges rather than resolves, keeping pressure coherent under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stake—decode why thresholds feel sacred—is signaled early and deepens when the butterfly effect magnifies maze-pauses into chasms. Pressure escalates texturally: fractured light → spiral knot → luminous doorframe, each image tightening awe. No reversible confrontation occurs, but the final crossing forecloses the option to remain analytically detached; the cost is conceptual rather than visceral. Under Accumulative lens the deepening pattern is sufficient, though a visible price (fatigue, fear, lost page) would have sharpened 8.8+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—finding a sign of light/life—stays legible; the “until sunrise” clock is announced but never tightens tactics. Pressure escalates only by accumulation (darkness → star maps → glow), not because her options narrow. No reversal or trade-off; she watches rather than acts. Cost is atmospheric, not tactical, capping the score at 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—why paths vanish—remains intellectual; pressure never escalates to a moment where memory-loss threatens Kaelen’s own presence or forces a trade-off. The crater glass reveals emotions, but those revelations don’t narrow his options or demand a price; therefore escalation is atmospheric, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake—“defeat monotony”—stays abstract; no external resistance materializes. Escalation is a repetition of similar micro-gestures (petals, balloon) with rising audience awe, but no option narrows and no price is risked. The performer could fail only in theory; the text never lets her. Under Accumulative lens, the cadence intensifies, yet stakes remain flat.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—illicit remembrance—signals early; pressure tightens once when dust anchors and forecloses retreat. Cost (searing pain, permanent exile) is visible; escalation is single-crest, sufficient for lyric 700-word arc but lacks secondary complication.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are signaled early—the noon dredge will “alter the bay’s familiar contours forever”—but the external pressure never re-enters the scene. Escalation is internal: mist → stone → rings → spectrum, a deepening pattern that reconfigures Elara’s stance rather than her options. One meaningful tightening occurs when the single sunbeam ignites the prisms, forcing her to accept change as propagation. Cost is conceptual, not visceral, adequate for lyric mode but short of 8.8+ intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are abstract—nameless timelines’ “silent plea”—so pressure feels ambient rather than urgent; no single timeline is risked with concrete loss. Escalation is pattern-based: each decorative tweak yields an immediate off-page glow, but the grotto stays serenely unchanged, so cost is displaced onto unseen worlds. Elara’s agency is real (she places the pearl) yet consequence-free for her; the absence of a reversible setback keeps tension mild. A tightening exists—the pearl completes the sequence—but it reconfigures hope conceptually, not under threat to her or the grotto.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—legacy’s guilt—surfaces at midpoint via diary excerpts; pressure intensifies texturally as each artifact thickens moral weight. No active opposition or lost option, so escalation is atmospheric, not tactical. Cost is conceptual (she will “carry” truth) rather than tangible loss on page. Sufficient for short-form accumulative design, but lacks a visible trade-off that forecloses an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—will the mirrors reveal possibility before sound breaks the spell—is signaled early, but pressure is purely atmospheric; no credible loss (energy, time, social risk) materializes. The single “tightening” is the bell toll, an external cue, not her agency foreclosing an option. Escalation is mood-deepening only; cost is conceptual, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—can he expiate silence he caused?—is signaled in paragraph one. One meaningful tightening: the converging starburst crack pattern forces the single possible release point; no coincidences. Cost is visible on-page: the echo physically leaves the egg, his shoulders slump, storm rain salts his hands—felt price. Escalation is accumulative under chosen lens: each fissure adds weight of erased birdsong until release becomes inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—freedom vs. obedience—tightens as each thread she pulls rings a real laugh or tear, foreclosing retreat. One meaningful escalation: the final thick thread snaps, unlocking the sanctuary and trading safety for authorship.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving ethical storytelling voice under Marco’s threat—is clear early. Escalation is textural: each recollection and ink stroke adds urgency until the reversal choice crystallizes. Yet the tightening is entirely internal; no external obstacle rises or live option is foreclosed on stage, so cost remains conceptual rather than visible. Sufficient for a mid-band score, but not the visible price or trade-off that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—honor the last migration—tightens from first line to last wing drift. One meaningful deepening: the knot must be untied, foreclosing permanent preservation; cost is the wing surrendered forever. Pressure accumulates under situational lens as the solitary butterfly’s arrival crystallizes Elian’s stance. No further escalation needed at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve forgotten names—is signaled early and sharpened by the card’s fragility. One meaningful tightening: each re-braid increases audible syllables, narrowing options toward total vocal resurrection. Cost is conceptual (card lost, rope forever changed) rather than bodily or social; still legible on-page. No reversal, but escalating resonance satisfies Causal lens. Could reach 8.8 if a concrete personal price (frozen fingers, social transgression) were paid.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“why paths choose walkers”—tightens once: dream-merge reveals resonance rule, foreclosing her old keeper agency. Escalation is textural density: each dream-stone adds pressure until seal flakes; storm arrival externalizes the flip. Cost legible—loss of directive, identity, shelter. No coincidence; storm complicates but catalyst is her interpretive act.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes sharpen from abstract “covenant” to concrete “fuse or forsake” when the tile glows and symbols rise; the single turn is meaningful, but the price (loss of the tile as portable tool) is announced more than dramatized in the moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—prevent Kael’s violence—stays abstract; no concrete consequence is staged if he fails. Escalation is atmospheric (shifting walls) rather than tactical; options do not narrow, knowledge does not change. The single reversal (resentment dissolves) is internally generated without external pressure test, so tension plateaus. Cost is asserted ("sinking stone") but never paid on-page, leaving the threat weightless.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“capture the dream before it vanishes”—is signaled early; escalation occurs via breathing-sync deepening that dissolves boundary between real and dream. Cost is conceptual: once bottled, the dream is no longer “runaway,” shrinking immensity to handheld reflection—felt but not viscerally painful. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length; no reversal, yet option set narrows to mirror-or-nothing.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—heal the rift with Lyra—is signaled early and tightens when Elara ties the ribbon around her wrist while polishing quartz eyes. Escalation is single-cycle, but agency is visible: she chooses to “persist” through trial, and the offering on the altar forecloses retreat. Cost is conceptual (pride shed) rather than visceral, yet legible.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    One dominant stake—pursue or relinquish forbidden knowledge—is signaled early and deepens when the fruit’s vision threatens her own memory. A single meaningful tightening occurs at the second bathroom epiphany: acceptance forecloses possession. Cost is conceptual (she abandons the key), but not viscerally felt on the page, keeping it below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—find library to avert paradox—signaled early. One meaningful tightening: shift from “find book” to “confront own error” redefines mission. Cost is Kael’s shame and Elara’s eternal stewardship, both legible. Escalation is linear, not recursive, satisfying short-form bar.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—reach the garden—signaled early; pressure is situational, tightening once when the card’s pulse hints the garden is near. No meaningful trade-off or forfeiture on the page; escalation is purely atmospheric. Cost is conceptual at closure but not visible in tactics, keeping it sub-7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—“will the archive’s taxonomic order survive this void?”—is signaled the instant the impossible door hums. Pressure tightens precisely once: when Elara realizes the rope’s braids are not metaphor but firmware for reality, forcing her to gamble the archive’s neutral history. Cost is the rope’s overwritten fate; the diplomat’s signature crystallizes inside the clock, a permanent alteration Elara can never catalogue away. No reversal is needed; the single deepening is sufficient under 800-word scope and the lens stays causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“find the quiet in the storm”—tightens when each ice pattern forecloses wrong frequencies; visible price is rising stone heat and bodily exhaustion. Agency sits in conjuring acts; no external antagonist needed. Cost is present but could be sharper: conjuring fatigue described rather than dramatized in a single vivid beat.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—isolated settlements starved of guidance—tightens when the prism array refuses to spark until the last fragment meets Vega; that single deepening narrows options from “hope” to “this angle or eternal dark.” Escalation is driven by her agency under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each retrocognitive flash adds pattern density until the light burst reweights the stake. Cost is visible: lacerated fingertips, breath held so long her ribs sting, and the implicit future burden of keeping the beacon alive.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—archivist must decide whether to seal or open self to collective memory—is signaled early and tightens once: the bench sit lets the chorus in, foreclosing isolated identity. Cost is visible—“the deepening hush now a companion” shows irreversible trade-off. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict meshes with environmental pressure. Escalation is accretive, not causal-chain, fitting accumulative lens; one meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“defy hopelessness”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and revisited in the final glow, but on-page escalation is a single smooth ramp: despair → filter → luminous. No reversal or trade-off narrows Elian’s options; the risk feels ornamental (a single rag burn) rather than tactical. Cost is atmospheric (fortress mood shifts) not personal—he leaves lighter, unmarked. Thus pressure coheres but never tightens; the beat is accumulative/textural rather than causal-spiked, acceptable under Hybrid lens but limiting high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—how to exit the coast without fracturing the bond—is signaled in the first paragraph. Escalation is textural: each pool, shell-change, and star-shift tightens the inevitability of departure. Single decisive turn when Elara lifts the cicada and renames “letting go” as “transform,” foreclosing Kael’s hope of stasis. Cost is legible in his soft-footed echo and the relinquishing of the artifact back to pouch.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—capture the gilded hush—signalled in paragraph 3 and tightened when the hour-long inversion clock starts. Agency is renunciation: she limits exposure via tether, chooses to bottle silence instead of lingering, and pays with permanent agoraphobic memory. Cost is visible—the vial’s golden glow and the doll’s warmth—altering the bunker’s felt texture. No reversal, but the single deepening (trellis arrival → timely retreat) is sufficient under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stake—silence as comfort—is announced early and deepens through pattern intensification rather than option-narrowing; no tangible price (time, energy, risk) is dramatized, so pressure feels contemplative, not urgent. The single “turn” is the hum that invites silence into dialogue, a soft escalation that reweights meaning but does not foreclose alternatives. Enough for mid-band, yet the absence of felt cost blocks entry to 8+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single stake—claim throne before sunrise—is clear, but sunrise is a background timer that never forces tactical change; she reaches the top with casual ease. No credible loss or trade-off; murals cooperate without resistance. Pressure stays flat because the flake eliminates uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—can silence teach breathing?—is signaled early and tightens once: solitude vs. encroachment. The tightening is lyric rather than causal: the ring’s ghost-chime reweights the stake from eternal silence to shared respiration. Agency is present in the keeper’s hand-hover acceptance, but the cost is conceptual (loss of pristine isolation) not visceral; no concrete resource is forfeited on-page. Sufficient for 600-800 words, but lacks the visible price that would push ≥7.2.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—transmute trauma into value—is signaled early and escalates via rising lab pressure; cost is legible when the bolt permanently vanishes. Agency sits with Leo: he channels rather than resists pressure, a meaningful tactical shift. Coincidence is absent; glitch messages complicate but don’t resolve. The tightening is single, not compounded, but suffices for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stake—truth about the dynasty-ending act—is clear early. Tightening is the gramophone-triggered memory cascade; it deepens knowledge but does not foreclose an external option or exact a visible price. Escalation is accumulative/textural: repeated soft-focus images of golden shadows and waves. No new complication or resource lost, so pressure plateaus.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—“capture the shape of possibility”—is signaled early. Pressure escalates by density: each traced pattern makes the greenhouse ripple and lights flicker, narrowing options toward the single orb. Cost is conceptual but legible: the program crumbles, foreclosing future use. No visible price is extracted from Alaric himself, so the tightening feels external rather than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“can a small kindness endure?”—is signaled early and deepens as Elara unearths the Miller-Jonah thread. Pressure is textural: each discovered letter layer adds density rather than narrower options. The final reconfiguration lands via display choice, but no live option is foreclosed; the cost is retrospective. Sufficient for high-band entry, but lacks a tightening beat that forces trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are legible early: preserve truth vs. Council erasure. One meaningful tightening occurs when the hidden archive plan “begins to unravel,” but the puddle-map arrival immediately neutralizes the threat, so pressure plateaus rather than narrows options. Agency is present—Kael records, shares, plants doubt—but no on-page loss (time, safety, social credit) is paid or felt. Escalation is accumulative/image-driven rather than causal-endangering; the cost is conceptual, not tactical, limiting entry to high band.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.8)
    Single dominant stake—prevent coded-light chaos—is signaled early and held. Pressure is situational/lyrical: each saxophonic pause thickens silence, a cadence-deepening rather than option-narrowing. No reversal or new complication surfaces; the prophecy neither counterattacks nor offers a bargain, so escalation is modest. The only cost is the eternal return Elias accepts, felt but not dramatized as a fresh wound, capping intensity at mid-high.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.0)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—will she surrender control to intuition?—tightens when the compass needle spins, forcing her to step into darkness without itinerary. One meaningful escalation: the key’s engraved promise turns abstract lore into concrete next-step cost. No antagonist needed; pressure is situational and epistemic. Price is opportunity-cost—she foregoes the safety of repairable clocks—made legible in the final image as she chooses the compass over her tools.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single dominant stake—redeem the failed search—tightens when she risks destroying the very artifact that failed her. The hairline crack is the visible price; escalation is a density spiral rather than a causal reversal, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—Lyra’s healing—never threatens to fail; once the harp is plucked the confession and laugh arrive in sequence without escalation or trade-off. Elara faces no visible price or narrowing of options, so pressure stays emotive rather than tactical. The single meaningful turn is Lyra’s chuckle, but it is elicited, not earned through rising obstacle, so cost remains conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“discover the mathematics of mercy”—is signaled early and tightened by each proprioceptive spike. Escalation is accumulative: each snap/twig → strap memory tightens the loop until the found strap breaks it. Agency resides in attention: he chooses to reinterpret, not flee. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; the insight forecloses the old equation but doesn’t dramatize a new action, keeping it shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—honor overlooked histories—is declared early and rehearsed without escalation; no new obstacle or price confronts Elara. The unfastening deepens knowledge but does not narrow her options or test her commitment; coincidence (the painting happens to hold the fracture pattern) supplies the turn. Cost is retrospective—Anya’s past peril—not Elara’s present risk. Pressure plateaus; the story’s energy is lyric accumulation rather than rising tension.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—uncover what ceilings hide—remains static; no reversal tightens or raises the price. The clockmaker’s sorrow adds emotional density but does not force Leo to sacrifice or renounce any live option. Escalation is accumulative/textural: more ghosts appear, ledgers stack, but options do not narrow and no felt cost is exacted from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—control over time—tightens through each accumulative shard: reading frost → setting type → uncorking → rupture. One meaningful deepening suffices; the “luminous moment” compresses all timelines and forecloses perfect-system stability forever. Cost is legible: the library’s groan and boiling clouds. No coincidence; escalation is driven by Elara’s agency under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—prove the civilization were poets—tightens once when Kael scoffs, but the experimental beat lacks external obstruction after that; escalation is mostly descriptor-driven (“dispute intensified”) rather than option-narrowing, so the cost feels announced, not tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—world luminosity—appears immediately, but the only meaningful tightening is the townsman’s lie moment; otherwise pressure stays declarative (“everything hung in the balance”). Escalation is linear, not recursive: each winding of the box simply inches brighter; no secondary complication or trade-off surfaces. Agency is present but low-stakes for Elian: he asks for honesty, gets it, continues. Cost is global, not personal; protagonist’s options never narrow, only the box’s tempo falters then recovers.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—“where explanations fail”—tightens once, when the compass psychometry flips her from capture to surrender. Cost is paid on-page: she forfeits both tool and vocation’s premise. Pressure accretes via accumulative texture; no reversal needed. The hush itself becomes the final antagonist that forecloses extraction.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—"find way when external guidance fails"—is signaled by GPS blackout line 1; escalation proceeds because each projected ghost reveals a manual workaround that progressively strips Elara’s reliance on tech. The final cost (she will navigate by sculpture-memory, not satellites) is visible and persistent, fulfilling lens-specific agency requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.3)
    Central stake—understanding night bloom—remains conceptual; pressure is epistemic, not consequential. Escalation is accumulative: each postcard and glass layer adds density but never narrows lived options or exacts a price. The only “turn” is the sun angle revealing the etched flowers, an external gift rather than an earned reversal. Because no path is foreclosed and no resource lost, tension stays mild, adequate for a lyrical quest but short of the 8+ band that requires visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“will she accept the painful truth?”—tightens once: the diary’s glow makes refusal impossible. Escalation is lyric-accumulative rather than causal-combative; cost is conceptual (she can never unread the compromises) and is legible in the closing beat where she shoulders the “weight of it.” One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—replace magic with sustainable labor—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens through each salvage/teach beat. One meaningful deepening: the bottle shifts from puzzle to civic charter, narrowing options (no more wishes). Cost is visible—years of patient rebuilding, laughter earned not granted. Slight repetition of “rejected false comfort” softens escalation peak.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake (preserve/interpret emotional patterns) tightens when the prophecy rewrites his archive into warning; the new voice on playback is the single escalating turn. Cost is conceptual—his life’s premise now foreclosed by silence—but the price is future, not present, so the beat feels half-paid.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“prevent vortex collapse and reopen gateway”—tightens once when the shell cracks; cap placement forecloses retreat. Cost is legible: the cap’s glow consumes the last seed energy, visible in the beam that strikes the wall. One meaningful deepening satisfies short-form bar.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—prevent needless panic—signaled early; pressure rises via sensor data, not interpersonal conflict. Single meaningful tightening: she forsakes the siren for the bell, foreclosing the old protocol. Cost is communal (risk of non-compliance) rather than personal; no visible price paid by Elara on the page keeps escalation moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—can solitude become generative?—tightens via escalating meteor intensity and the glass’s rising temperature, a lyric deepening rather than plot reversal. Agency is attentional: Kael’s choice to keep watching, keep sweeping, keep holding the shard narrows his life-path to custodial stillness; the cost is lifelong anonymity, felt in the hush. No external antagonist, but internal fear of insignificance is pressured by each dying star. Closure crystallizes that pressure into earned stasis; no cap breached.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—preserve unspoken words or let them vanish—is signalled early; pressure accumulates via ghostly erosion rather than active opposition. No reversal or trade-off is forced upon the recluse; instead tension deepens atmospherically until he performs the fore-gone act of opening the box. Cost is conceptual (the ghosts depart, covenant simplified) not personal, keeping escalation muted. Agency stays observational; the tightening is lyric rather than tactical, satisfying the Accumulative/Textural threshold for a brief piece.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can time be felt, not just counted—tightens through pattern, not plot: each garage tag deepens the stakes of mis-reading time. Mid-story “time holds its breath” is the visible cadence shift that reweights the tapestry image, foreclosing sterile measurement. Cost is conceptual (old math discredited) rather than corporeal; under Accumulative lens this is valid, but a palpable price (a lost keepsake, a cut finger) would push higher. Pressure stays coherent; no reversal, yet deepening suffices for 600-word window.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stakes remain philosophical: the tension between completion and fragmentation never escalates into a concrete trade-off. The snapped string deepens mood, not jeopardy; the poet’s agency is to interpret, not to risk. One tightening occurs—the child’s tears—but the poet’s response is consolation, not sacrifice, so pressure plateaus.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—will the amber decode the alien homing signal?—is signaled early. Pressure tightens as footprints converge and sculptures foreshadow return, a meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens. The hologram’s reveal is irreversible: her hypothesis proven, options reconfigured—she can never again treat home as geography. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable; future quests are now molecular, not cartographic.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaim battlefield with garden—signals early, but pressure is static: every beat repeats the same gentle success. No resource shortage, opposition, or inner doubt complicates sowing; options do not narrow. Escalation is purely lyrical accumulation; under Accumulative lens that suffices, yet the lack of visible cost keeps tension flat. Closure reweights meaning but not tactical risk.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single dominant stake—reach the lost voice—tightens once: noise resolves into coordinates, foreclosing the fantasy of hearing Elara speak. Agency is interior (decoding) rather than external confrontation; the cost is the relinquishment of hearing her, a quiet but felt forfeiture. Pressure is textural, accumulating through hiss-click repetition until the leaf re-weights meaning; no coincidence intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“find purpose in silence”—is signaled early; pressure rises as the star fixes his longing and the engine plan crystallizes. Tightening beat is the recalibration of sensors: one live action that forecloses passive waiting. Cost is opportunity-loss of safe station-keeping, but no concrete obstacle or resource limit complicates the scheme; hence escalation feels internal more than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“amend the fractured sky”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and escalates through each ritual beat: swap, click, beam. Protagonist agency drives every turn; coincidence is absent. Cost is visceral: he forfeits the black knight and inherits an undisclosed secret inside the white queen, foreclosing future ignorance. Tightening is singular but sufficient for 700-word arc; the sky’s re-stitching is the irreversible consequence that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—will these micro-gestures survive the forgetting of interregnum?—is signaled in paragraph one. Pressure tightens when she redirects the archival impulse onto herself (forgive), foreclosing the option to remain mere observer; price is public surrender of her private trauma to the echoing archive. No coincidence; escalation is accretive, each spelled word thickens the moral weight. A hair more visible consequence—e.g., a bystander’s overheard echo—would make the cost tactile past 8.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single stake—self-absolution—tightens when the decoded silver-gold sequence converts the labyrinth from punishment to test, foreclosing the option to keep defining himself through failure. Protagonist agency drives the escalation: each alignment click is a deliberate humiliation of old pride. Cost is visible but quiet: he accepts that the village will remain his frozen monument, never again a home. The storm’s return outside confirms the price is ongoing exposure, not a neat internal fix.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“will the single truth stay single?”—is announced early and tightens via each refracted poem that multiplies the price of forgiveness. Agency is accumulative: each impromptu verse incrementally forecloses the option of a clean absolution. No external antagonist needed; pressure is the ritual clock and the multiplying shards themselves. Cost is visible in the listeners’ weeping and the forged hush that now must be carried.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“conjure meaning from oblivion”—is signaled early and tightened by the literal breath-lock of the dive; each matched pockmark permanently stitches one memory shard, narrowing failure to zero lung margin. Escalation is linear rather than reversed, but the breath-clock supplies visible price every 50 words. No new option is foreclosed; rather, the quilt simply completes, so the tightening is present but not catalytic. Sufficient for the length, yet lacks a late pivot that would spike cost higher.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is internal: will she keep clinging to the past or relinquish it? Pressure tightens once—the childhood shell’s reappearance forces an on-page choice that forecloses nostalgia as refuge. Cost is present (she walks away lighter, “heart unburdened”) but because the cave discovery is partly lucky, agency reads as reactive acceptance rather than active risk. Still, within the situational lens the relinquishment is a credible stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stake—“call brother home”—is signaled early and narrows to a single inhalation/whisper. Escalation is textured: scent layering → cork warming → vibration release → distant calm on ship; each step raises emotional cost without external reversals. Agency remains Elara’s throughout; brother’s turn is reaction, not coincidence resolving conflict. Tears and sealed memory supply visible, proportional price.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—chart her loss or drown in it—announced early. Single meaningful tightening: Polaris alignment forecloses retreat, visible price is the foot’s fading glow = finite lunar battery. No reversals needed under Accumulative lens; density of memory-fragments escalates risk of psychic implosion. Agency is creation, not escape; cost legible in final dim pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—freedom from involuntary truth—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when the storm peaks to a single option: risk electrocution or stay cursed. Agency drives escalation: she calculates, rigs, recites—each act narrows escape routes until the bolt fuses choice to consequence. Visible price: antique eye rendered inert, silence purchased with “unknown cost.” No coincidence; storm is environmental constant, not deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—will he keep the borrowed memories or return them?—tightens once, cleanly: discovering the flower’s intended recipient collapses voyeuristic comfort into ethical obligation. Agency is soft but sufficient; he doesn’t confront an external antagonist, yet the letter posting is an active forfeiture of fantasy. Cost is visible: “softer, wiser solitude” replaces communion with a ghost. No escalation beyond this single turn, so entry to 8.8+ is blocked.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—honor the promise without erasing the past—threads every beat; creek clock externalizes urgency, forcing a single irrevocable moment. Escalation rides a clean because/therefore rail: each observation (ants, water level, chip pulse) collapses one retreat option. Cost is felt: refusal leaves him wading out *carrying the ache* while doorway fades. Could use one earlier tangible forfeiture (ruined map, wet shoes slowing exit) to push 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—decode the dream or abdicate identity—tightens when the seer’s warning is ignored, then crystallizes inside the grotto: personal survival vs. cosmic guardianship. Escalation is a single, legible spike: the starlight touch forces her to reprice her disenchantment as negligence. Cost is palpable—she forfeits the luxury of detachment and inherits an apocalyptic watch. No artificial reversals; coincidence (guardian’s appearance) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single stake: revalue the nexus and capture “density of presence.” Pressure tightens when Kael reframes the nexus as dreaming, forcing Elara to abandon extraction for participation. Tightening is intellectual; no physical or social price is paid on page, keeping cost legible but abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—how to endure foreknowledge of death—tightens through recursive aerial overview: each loop reveals another innocent past self, deepening the cost of knowledge. The single meaningful turn is the decision to write/draw rather than flee; it narrows options from infinite dream flight to one bark rectangle. Cost is legible as exhaustion and “aching hand,” yet the escalation is accretive, not decisive; pressure plateaus rather than spikes. Still, under an accumulative lens, the densification of dread suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—restore healing power without scent—signaled in line 4. One meaningful tightening: the gift of the screw re-weights her method and is immediately tested with the grieving client. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; stakes deepen but never threaten tangible loss, keeping pressure lyrical rather than urgent. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens: drip, fog, screw motifs narrow options to non-scent therapies.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—transforming scars into stories—threads every beat; pressure escalates via pattern-deepening (each crystallized rune narrows future options) rather than external reversals. One meaningful tightening: recounting the first failed casting dissolves prior rigidity, enabling the release rune. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable in the softened swirls; could be sharper if a concrete resource (ink, time, stamina) were visibly depleted.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—deliver the apology before trees fall—tightens when chainsaw growl begins at dawn. The apology itself is the irrevocable act that forecloses Alistair’s haunting; cost is felt in Elara’s exhausted “gritty” breath and the orchard’s impending loss. Agency remains hers: she alone triggers the current, uncorks the bottle, accepts the imperfect result. No reversal, but deepening meets the 800-word bar.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=2.1)
    Stakes are declared (“unravel cosmic illusions”) but never dramatized; nothing resists the witness. No tightening, reversal, or price appears—each spiral loop returns to the same serene equilibrium. The universe’s hiccup is a label, not a pressure that narrows options. Resolution is effortless glow, confirming that conflict was never operational.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—does time have a substance?—tightens via pattern: each backward number subtracts certainty instead of adding it. The single meaningful intensification arrives when the gear glint reframes the question from “what is measured” to “what resists measurement.” No external antagonist needed; the enemy is the irreconcilability of continuity and division. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: the shepherd forfeits the comfort of precision.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—secure the farm by mastering release—tightens once: the update that softens barriers forecloses absolute defense. Escalation is textural: each laser test adds data density until the harmonic shift rewrites the system. Cost is legible—she relinquishes omniscient control, embracing adaptive vulnerability. Agency is high; however, the antagonistic pressure is abstract (a “coalescence of energy”), preventing full 9+ band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—redeem inherited risk-taking through responsible interpretation—tightens when the smudged scrawl forces a real traverse, then again when the journal’s regrets confront her with irreversible stakes. Agency is legible: she chooses to teach, foreclosing the gambler’s path. Cost is felt (the candle’s deliberate extinction), though the external world offers no antagonistic push-back beyond the father’s absence; escalation is mostly internal, sufficient for this lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—Elara’s need to reframe her ending—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the disc accelerates and she retells with new ears. Escalation is modest: one retell, one increment of insight; no option is foreclosed for either party, so cost feels optional rather than paid. Agency sits mostly with Elara; Leo’s estrangement remains undented. Under Accumulative lens, the single deepening suffices but lacks a tangible price tag on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—save memory from erasure—faces a visible tightening: council vote → demolition clock → ink ritual before night ends. Agency is archivist, not activist; her power is attention and inscription, so the “turn” is internal (accepting demolition while preserving meaning). Cost is felt: locket subsumed, photo irreversibly altered, personal memory ghosted into public air. One meaningful escalation suffices under Accumulative lens; no false reversals or coincidences intrude.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“cure loneliness via reciprocity”—tightens once: from passive rumor-hearing to active storytelling obligation. Visible price: Elara surrenders the talisman and her safe hideout. Agency is renunciation, not combat, but it forecloses return. Coincidence only seeds crowds, never solves; escalation remains coherent under accretive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—convert raw grief into bearable composition—signaled in para 1. Escalation is textural: ultrasonic density thickens → musical trail narrows → earth chord silences forest; each layer raises the emotional cost of failure. No external antagonist; pressure is the growing clarity of her own sorrow. Final image forecloses the option to flee grief—she kneels, presses ring to soil, accepts the chord—visible cost is the audible solitude she now carries.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—personal redemption through reinterpretation—is signaled in paragraph 1 and escalates when the anomaly answers back, narrowing options to “reply or remain pariah.” Cost is visible: the anomaly’s roar-to-hum shift is the physical price paid for her calibration signal. Agency is continuous: every data request and the final synthesis are her decisive acts; no coincidence resolves the swell. One meaningful tightening suffices; the gradual stabilizing rhythm provides the cadence shift under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—will Elian remain unheard—is signaled early and tightens as each mapped silence forecloses total isolation without removing the cost of being forgotten. Agency is perceptual rather than external, sufficient under Accumulative lens. One deepening: the transfer of the camera makes Elian the mapper, narrowing options. Cost is legible yet quiet; a sharper tangible loss would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single dominant stake—liberate the promise—escalates because each artwork forecloses wrong paths; portrait-as-map is the tightening beat that makes the hidden chamber the only live option. Cost is visible: the curator erased self, Kaelen erases his old arson identity; the price is conceptual but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—shared dream of entangled minds—signaled in para 1; each drumming cycle deepens it from wish to lived (if fleeting) reality. Escalation is density-driven: more memories, brighter lagoon, louder flora, until the cosmic exhale snatches the vision away—cost is her collapse. No external antagonist needed; pressure is ontological. One meaningful tightening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.0)
    Single dominant stake—prove quiet mastery—tightens when Kael blocks her path; the coin/handover is the visible pivot that turns enforcer into witness. Cost is present but soft: Kael’s aggression dissolves, yet Elara risks no personal loss beyond exposure. Escalation is steady under Causal lens, though the absence of a backward step or tangible price keeps it from the 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—coax a drowned child’s spirit toward star-recognition—tightens via pattern accumulation, not reversal. Each new constellation is a micro-turn that raises the ghost’s visibility; the risk is spiritual stasis, not physical danger. The price (guardian’s solitude, perpetual vigil) is abstract but legible on the final quiet dock; a sharper tangible loss would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—will collective dissent ignite—escalates only in the civic sphere; Elara’s personal risk plateaus after the grotto retrieval. The “tightening” is a montage of lit windows, a density shift rather than a narrowing of her own choices. Without a visible cost to her (arrest, exile, even social frown), pressure stays moderate. Meets the word-count standard for one meaningful deepening, but lacks a felt price that would push the score into the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—freedom from self-imposed guardedness—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened once: the call forces the binary, stay ashore or detach. The price is the literal disappearance of her former life; island arrival forecloses return, cost is visible in the fading port lights. Escalation is situational pressure crystallizing stance, not multiple reversals, adequate for 700-word span. Agency is renunciation rather than combat, consistent with post-violence world rule.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to keep betraying neighbors to protect her private grief—never advances past initial statement; no new infraction or inspector visit raises the cost. Pressure is atmospheric but static; the turbine shadows and whirring never translate into an imminent fork. A single beat where reporting someone actually backfires or where a carved symbol is almost discovered would escalate stakes into the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—dissolve sacred boundaries—signaled early. Pressure escalates via texture: hum deepens, walls waver, lake cracks; poet’s agency is to keep speaking. No narrowing of options or credible loss; the boundary simply melts. Cost is atmospheric, not personal; escalation stays lyrical rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“awaken sight”—tightens to “awaken reed through flawed art,” a meaningful narrowing under causal lens. Protagonist agency drives every beat: barter offer, painting act, reed revival. Cost is visible: the reed’s earlier silence vs. final chord crystallizes forfeiture of color dream. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes; one deepening suffices, but a sharper late obstacle could have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—“discover the texture of connection”—is declared, but pressure is cognitive rather than visceral; no bell refuses to sing, no outside auditor threatens shutdown. The single meaningful tightening arrives when Elara pivots the lens outward, but consequences stay acoustic, not tactical; cost is observation, not forfeiture. Escalation plateaus; hence, just under 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—transmute grief into regenerative art—tightens once: the stencil-shadow epiphany reweights her craft from memorial to metamorphosis. Agency is accumulative rather than causal-sequential; each origami find incrementally narrows her refusal-to-act until she folds her own cranes, a visible price paid in public vulnerability. No forced antagonist; pressure is internal coherence under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—“map cultural collapse before the next unraveling”—is declared early but never tested by an external obstacle; pressure is atmospheric, not causal. The only tightening is Elara’s fear of convergence, voiced in summary. No concrete price is paid or option foreclosed; the climax is a realization, not a trade-off. Under Accumulative lens, the rain’s cadence shift suffices for escalation, yet the lack of tangible cost caps the tension below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can she purify nostalgia without losing herself—signaled in line 3. Escalation is single-cycle: atoms’ unpredictability tightens when pattern-avoidance must be maintained under fatigue. Agency is continuous—each random step is an on-page tactic that risks corruption. Cost is visible (collapse, tears) and forecloses innocence; no reset. No external antagonist needed; pressure is internal and coherent under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.1)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will she keep her heart open after betrayal?—tightens through each “shedding” beat that discards an earlier emotional armor. Agency is renunciation rather than reversal: she refuses cynicism and accepts the perpetual cost of vigilance. Cost is legible on-page: “tomorrow, someone else might knock… she would answer.” One meaningful deepening suffices; no external coincidence dilutes pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: can he read the silence beneath his pain? Each beat tightens: coffee rings → void → tunnel → crystal revelation, foreclosing the option to stay above. Agency is continuous; roots respond only to his directed intent. Cost is literalized when the hourglass resumes, proving time—and healing—now advance on the tower’s terms, not his.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—locate & release unused love—announced early and tightened by each psychometric dive: every crystalline letter narrows her future to stewardship. One meaningful escalation: the moment she grasps a humming shard, the reservoir’s cumulative sigh becomes personal debt. Cost is visible—she exits “emptied,” path foreclosed. Agency is accumulative rather than decisively reversal-based, fitting Accumulative lens; coincidence absent.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—silence vs. song—signaled in second paragraph; pressure mounts via meteor density & aurora brightness rather than external antagonist. One deepening: “true rest…would come only from harmony” narrows options from escape to alignment. Cost is legible: perpetual vigilance against returning silence. No reversal, but lyric intensification suffices under Accumulative lens; the final cadence makes the stakes lifelong.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is early and clear: cultivate sparks or remain in frozen midnight. Escalation is textural—each charm brightens the dune and smooths the lullaby, tightening the mood rather than options. Agency is present in every diffusion; the cost is her mounting emptiness, visible on-page. One meaningful intensification suffices: the collective brightening that flips the lullaby from discord to coherence, forcing her stance crystallization toward accepting dreams.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“frontier of mind”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when harmonics narrow path options. Agency is present: she decodes wind, slots gear, accepts translocation cost. Escalation is textural: density of tones and humming mounts until the bright-tone payoff. Price is conceptual rather than visceral; could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“where is unused courage?”—signaled line 3. Escalation is textural densification rather than causal reversals: each indirect trail adds felt risk, narrowing option to ‘keep walking or retreat’; star stamp = visible price. No coincidence; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens. Final poise crystallizes stance without external rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“understand the cost of safety”—tightens when archives reveal the buried musician tragedy, turning abstract unease into concrete cover-up. Escalation is a single deepening rather than multiple turns, but it successfully reweights silence from routine to moral complicity. Protagonist agency is contemplative (archive reading, bolt restoration) yet still forecloses the option of blissful ignorance. Cost is legible: he chooses to keep serving inside a refuge he now sees as prison—a lived forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—expose the usurper—is signaled early, but pressure stays flat: Lorian’s plan is already complete; we witness only its final inscription. No live setback, ticking clock, or resource drain escalates risk between opening line and rune activation; the scholar’s discovery is narrated as fait accompli. The single tightening is the usurper’s entrance, yet Lorian never doubts or recalculates; options do not narrow—they merely manifest. Cost is visible in Theron’s collapse, not in any price paid by Lorian, so agency feels illustrative rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“why paths disappear”—is signaled early and tightened when data re-links vanished routes to historic pollution peaks, revealing re-emergence. Escalation is conceptual rather than adversarial: tension moves from haunted uncertainty to grounded hope via one causal insight; cost is the accumulated years of sorrow the reader is asked to feel retroactively. Sufficient for this length, though secondary physical stakes (funding, career, solitude) stay off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: re-ignite a stalled rebellion; signaled early via graffiti “frozen” hope. Escalation is textural—the hum layers intensity, shifting silence from “tomb” to “cradle.” No visible price is extracted from Elara on-page; the cost is transferred to the off-stage “weary souls” who will later answer the call. This keeps the tightening abstract; the stone circle does the work rather than a trade-off she actively negotiates.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can tradition evolve without losing soul?—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when the embryo’s futures demand communal choice. One meaningful deepening: the plants reveal destiny is “potential, not fixed,” shifting knowledge. Cost is legible: Elara forfeits anonymity and accepts endless council tension. Slight cap because external pressure (council skepticism) is told more than dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake: can she stay present when triggered? Single meaningful escalation: aircraft hum → freeze → conscious thaw → graft. Cost is psychic, not external; price (reliving dust and laughter) is felt on the page. Agency is attention-based renunciation of paralysis; no new option is opened, but old option (freeze forever) is foreclosed—sufficient for sub-7 band at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“map the darkness within”—is signaled by the third paragraph. Escalation is accumulative: each untangled memory raises the psychic cost of remaining a surface painter. The decisive tightening is the moment he sees he “had not failed but succeeded” in exposing loneliness; this forecloses retreat. Price is visible: he accepts lifelong marginalization as a soul-cartographer.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—unlock time-dilation—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens when the ink gateway begins to evaporate. Agency: Kael’s decision to step into the pattern is irreversible and costs him permanent exile from objective answers. Escalation is one meaningful tightening: the ink’s vanishing imposes a hard clock that forces the step. Cost is visible—he returns alone, theory in hand, but the mystery can never be “held” again.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the recurring vanish-act (ink, time, self) and ends with the conceptual repricing: knowledge itself disappears the moment it is grasped. No moralizing; the final line lets wind and dust carry the implication. Subtextual turn: the tracker who tames wildness must accept that the wildest force is perception itself. Ambiguity lingers—was the dilation real or just consciousness?—inviting reflection without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. preservation—signaled in paragraph 1. One meaningful tightening: expected alarms become soft chime, narrowing her fate from arrest to silent solidarity. Cost is conceptual but legible: she forfeits institutional protection and embraces fugitive status. Agency is present (she inserts, initiates, walks away); escalation is causal under lens, not spectacular but sufficient for 700-word frame.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes—personal sanctuary vs. spreading chaos—are declared early but remain external; the wanderers pose no threat, demand no trade-off. Escalation is purely textural: rose colors intensify, pollen drifts outward; no option narrows for Elara. Agency is limited to continuing what she already does; no resource (water, space, secrecy) is shown depleting. Cost is asserted (“the world outside churned”) rather than felt on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single stake: break family orbit of lies or stay complicit. Escalation is one deepening: each file thickens guilt, tightening her options until only disclosure remains. Cost visible—the nib’s inherited weight becomes the tool that will publish their fall.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—silence the firmware’s accusatory cries—escalates through each inscribed panel; the tightening is pattern-based (sound density lowers as constellations accrete) rather than causal reversal, fitting Accumulative design. A visible price is paid: younger-self visions force Elara to confront the literal moment she bolted during the meteor shower, foreclosing denial; the final hush is earned, though the escalation is single-track and could have used one intermediate risk beat to reach 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes—“discover meaning in the mess”—stay abstract; no concrete resource is risked or foreclosed. Escalation is atmospheric: whispers fade into hush, but this is texture, not narrowing options. The woman’s outburst is the only pressure spike; it neither complicates tactics nor exacts a rippling cost.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: can empathy survive after the fire? Pressure tightens when the retrocognitive trap forces physical interaction with the mosaic; the rename narrows options to one—Aeliana must carry the cost. No external antagonist; escalation is textural density of pattern and memory. Visible price: loss of prior identity, tessera clutched like a shard of self.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—escape ghostly stasis—signals early and tightens when the coin toss risks obliteration; each echo narrows options until only surrender or transcendence remains. Pressure is accumulative: every sensory layer raises nostalgia’s ache and the danger of temporal unraveling. Cost is visible when “the timelines snap,” but the price is cosmic rather than personal, keeping it from the 8.8 band. Agency is pure: only Elara’s song can weave the echoes; no outside rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can the silent Earth be given voice?—is signaled early and deepens through each heat-map pass. The fossil’s lift is the single meaningful intensification: it narrows options from passive recording to active channeling, cost legible in the shared levitation that leaves Kaelen changed. No secondary antagonist needed; pressure is situational-coherent. Falls short of 8+ because the price is spiritual rather than a tangible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—expose traitors to mend broken trust—signaled early. Escalation is a single tightening: transmission narrows options to live-or-die. Cost is visible (bullet, blood), but earlier stake of “unused courage” is more conceptual than viscerally tested; Anya’s awakening is secondary, softening the dominant pressure peak.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single dominant stake—will he reclaim the original promise before the gutters stop?—tightens once when the ticking slows. Agency is ambient but active: he chooses to keep listening, each tick foreclosing the option to leave. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: the silence itself is the price that forces the re-stitching of self. Accumulative lens means no causal reversal is required; the pattern-break of silence is sufficient escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—“instill light into dark corners”—is signaled early but never truly endangered; escalation is atmospheric deepening rather than option-narrowing. The rhythmic oars calm her thoughts but do not test or foreclose a path; the mirror routine succeeds without resistance. Cost is present only as conceptual ache, not a visible forfeiture, so pressure remains gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—tightens exactly once: the hum forces her either to shatter or to assume eternal guardianship; that fork is dramatized, not declared. Price is legible: lifelong exile aloft, ghost-oversoul never silent again. Pressure escalates under causal lens (each intensification of hum → brighter sundial → sharper visions) rather than multiple reversals, satisfying short-form requirement. No off-stage rescue; coincidence merely enables vision, does not resolve conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can she risk exposing her own voice?—tightens once: when she invites strangers to graft secrets onto the structure she must then inhabit. The spiral’s growth is the visible price; each confession narrows her retreat back to ghost-writing. No antagonist is needed; the pressure is internal and communal. Escalation is textural: density of secrets = rising cost of anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten from abstract civic unrest to immediate career ruin plus possible violence; the illegal broadcast narrows options to one irreversible act whose price (Evans’s fury) lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—retrieve the key while surviving spatial mutiny—is signaled early and tightened once: passages constrict, claustrophobia spikes. Yet escalation is ambient (environment keeps warping) rather than propelled by her tactics; the organ calms space ex machina before her blueprint action. No visible resource is lost or forfeited; the cost is emotional abstraction (“terror eased”). Agency is present—she drafts—but the keeper’s dialogue resolves conflict more than her own maneuvering.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—awaken town empathy for Isabelle—signaled early. Pressure tightens via pattern accumulation: each opposition (party/void, mask/facelessness) raises the moral cost of forgetting. The single meaningful turn is the realization the tragedy was accidental fear, not murder; this narrows Elara’s tactical path from accusation to elegy. Price is felt—she forfeits definitive justice for fragile understanding—though a shade more on-page fatigue or repercussion would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—clear ancestor’s name—locks early and tightens once: the nail must be retrieved before the committee meets. Protagonist agency drives every escalation; no coin-flip resolutions. Cost is legible (reputation, emotional stamina), though the climax could sharpen a tangible loss (time, equipment, social credit) to push the score into the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—will he decipher the vanishing and find a next step—is signaled early and tightens when the glass-flake projection syncs with flutter shadows, forcing the fiddle bridge. No external antagonist is needed; pressure is situational and accumulative. Cost is present—he pockets the shard and drives away changed—but the price feels contemplative rather than tactical, keeping the score below 8.8. One clear deepening beat satisfies the short-form requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—“can I break the loop?”—is signaled early and tightens once: warning the squatter forces Leo to enact the answer. Cost is legible: he forfeits the train-as-tomb and the nostalgic currency. Escalation is single-track; no reversal, but the deepening suffices under causal lens. Pressure would sharpen if the squatter pushed back harder.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.9)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—breaking generational silence—surfaces in paragraph three and tightens when the seed’s absorption of rigidity forecloses the option to stay guarded. Agency sits with Elara: her chant and pressure decision drive the reversal. Cost is visible on-page: seed’s death, vortex’s halt, her own emotional unbending. No coincidence; escalation is one smooth curve rather than a spike, sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“restore broken covenant or lose glade”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when portal demands acknowledgement of failure. Escalation is density-driven: each recurrence of cobalt/roots/blood increases felt price until root-to-light shift. Agency is renunciation/decision: she embraces scars, stepping through portal; luck does not solve. One deepening beat (pressing clipping to chest) visibly forecloses denial option and is paid for with blood and tears—cost on page.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—will she force redemption or receive it—signals in paragraph 1. Escalation is accretive: each root-and-bone tableau tightens the emotional cost until she yields. No external reversals, but the keeper’s single line acts as deepening that flips her method from domination to surrender. Price is conceptual—she forfeits the fantasy of mastering time—but the lack of tangible loss keeps it below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes (professional redemption vs. echo-valley longing) are stated early yet neither escalates nor is tested; no concrete obstacle or ticking clock appears. The single pressure point is Mara’s empathy, which Leo instantly deflects and then abandons. No visible price is paid or option foreclosed; the pivot to music memorabilia is risk-free. Escalation is static.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“understand transition or stay haunted”—is signaled inside first 100 words and tightens once: seed-glow offers the last live option. Escalation is accumulative/causal: each failed glyph-analogy raises the wager of permanent exile; the final alignment forecloses pursuit of the spirit itself. Cost is visible: eternal outsider status in the arbor, charged by the eternal pulse he must maintain. No reversals needed; one deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.3)
    Pressure is situational: the moon’s waxing is the immutable clock that could shatter identities, but because Elian’s method never fails, the stake stays abstract. Each smelting deepens the pattern yet does not narrow his options or raise personal price. The tightening is lyrical, not tactical—beautiful but safe.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: preservation of hope inside doomsday preparation. Escalation is tonal/density-driven: each confession layers cost until the pearl illumination reweights survival. No external antagonist; internal pressure suffices at this length. Cost is visible in his shifted inspection vow. Coincidence (shell appears) complicates but does not resolve; it is accepted under Situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens once: graffiti line collapses self-blame, immediately enabling the accordion’s first breath. No external antagonist needed; internal current is sufficient. Cost is felt: silence broken, but memory of death remains. Escalation is single but sufficient for 750-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—enter before second letter—stays coherent; each shortening delay tightens the window, a visible price. Reversals force her to discard prior notes, a meaningful forfeiture. Escalation is steady but single-note; no secondary stake or moral trade-off complicates the path. Agency is pure endurance/decoding rather than a decisive fork, sufficient for 600-word scale.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—green autonomy vs. imperial weaponization—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when the violin’s dual capability is revealed. Escalation is lyrical but legible: each note narrows options until only propagation remains. Visible price: the instrument she authenticates melts away, ending her career and the Empire’s bid. No false intensifiers; the midsummer clock (dawn) is a quiet drumbeat that ends in a hush of seeds.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.3)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes—“find contentment after forgiving the unforgivable”—stay abstract; no concrete loss or ticking clock materializes. Escalation is textural: each scallop and climb thickens the ritual until the hairpin’s glow reconfigures meaning. Agency is present (she decides to carve, to teach) but the tightening is felt more than priced; the cost is conceptual rather than visceral, adequate for this length but not high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—Elara’s need to loosen absolute certainty—tightens through two causal levers: shard-gaze and cloak-drape, each foreclosing binary leave/stay plans. Cost is felt: her rigid grip relaxes into tremor, then firm uncertainty. No external antagonist required; internal conflict escalates under Situational lens. Final image crystallizes gradient choice, not resolution, satisfying the micro-turn requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—Kael’s fear of self-dissolve—signaled early and tightened by grotto’s pull. One meaningful deepening: ripple metaphor shifts from safety to revelation, foreclosing retreat. Cost is visceral (gasp, eroding sand imagery). No external antagonist needed; internal/external pressures interweave naturally under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stake is singular—anchor the wandering pulse by stillness—and tightens once when the bird pattern reveals the arrowhead’s conduit role; the price is the forfeiture of physical travel forever, though it is implied rather than scaldingly felt. Agency is mostly interpretive (reading birds, humming) so the escalation is intellectual, adequate for lyric mode but short of visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—find the sacred simple—signaled early, but escalation is textural (density of “dimness” imagery) rather than causal; no option narrows. The keystone discovery feels accidental; mist-walk to garden is summarized, not pressured. Cost is conceptual (automation vs wonder) yet never bites tactically. One visible tightening—keystone glows brighter when planted—but this is effect, not sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—see the color of sound—signaled in first paragraph; pressure tightens once: the key appears, forcing the dive that could drown him. Cost is visible when he surfaces in the decaying library, lungs burning, choice irreversible. The orb’s price is legible: once seen, the colored flames can never be unseen—live constraint established in final paragraph. Escalation is single but sufficient for 700-word span; no false reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—can meaning be distilled from post-contraction silence?—is clear early; pressure escalates via pattern breaks (new coin sequence, intensifying static). Agency is attention/interpretation rather than external battle; cost is existential uncertainty absorbed into final stance. One meaningful tightening sufficient; cost legible as conceptual, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—will he keep drowning in unnamed dread or pay the price of fixing her memory—tightens exactly once when he chooses crystallization over possession. That single turn forecloses the option to keep grieving fluidly; the visible price is the shards’ permanence, a literal floor he can never sweep clean. Escalation is accumulative: each refracted color adds another named fear until the air is saturated; no reversal is needed because density is the pressure. The atlas page, once a symbol of looming monsters, becomes a trophy of guardianship—an earned reconfiguration rather than a new external threat.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.0)
    Single dominant stake—restore cosmic balance—signaled line 1 and tightened through each drip measurement. Escalation causal: each failed fizzle narrows option space until only exact drip-cadence spell remains. Visible price: bleeding finger, fatigue, social memory of “mediocre” label—cost legible on page. Final bell-ring reverses river death via earned agency, not luck; stagnation → flow is irreversible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: convert private ghost-memories into communal meaning. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias realizes the artifacts are “keys to unlock the past for everyone,” narrowing his goal from solitary vigil to communal teller. The cost—public exposure of childhood guilt—is named but not felt in-scene; the tightening is conceptual rather than visceral. Still, agency remains with him throughout; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve trust under pressure—signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened when anomalous data threatens to invalidate her vigilance. One meaningful deepening: pattern shifts from danger to rare celestial event, foreclosing panic and requiring calm transmission. Cost is visible—she risks reputation and world safety with each algorithm tweak. Escalation driven by her agency; no coincidental rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will he feel again?—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when Rin declares merging the only path to balance. One meaningful turn: Kael steps from observer to participant, foreclosing the safety of detachment. Cost is visible on-page: “for the first time in years, Kael felt a spark” paid for by the irreversible breach of his numb fortress. Escalation is causal under lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—“safeguard space for innovation”—is declared early and re-asserted at recall of buy-out threat. Escalation is accumulative: each orthogonal angle thickens the conceptual solution rather than narrowing live options. No on-page loss, tool, or price is risked; tension remains prospective. Hence pressure tightens intellectually but never viscerally; cost is prospective, not paid.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore laughter—signalled in line 3 and escalates through sonic density: each added blower narrows silence until giggles are the only exit. Agency is ritual, not combat: adjusting pitch, singing cracked lullabies, enduring the paradox that joy reopens loss. Visible price: the Conductor’s bodily fade and the laughter’s new bittersweet timbre. No coincidence; escalation is accumulative wave-interference under his hand. The final giggle is earned, not granted—options reweighted, path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is crystallized early: “make friends with uncertainty.” Escalation is textural—each absorption increases the guardian’s forfeiture of return option until stepping into the between forecloses library forever. Agency is renunciation rather than deed; cost is the felt ache of dimensional homelessness made companion. One meaningful tightening suffices for 700-word lyric arc.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“interrupt stifling destiny”—is signaled in paragraph three and tightened when he risks total loss at the altar stone. Escalation is a single, coherent climb: each re-agent added raises the cost of failure; the final surrender explodes the option of retreat. No false reversals; the fragmentation moment is the irreversible price. Closure converts stake from abstract prophecy to palpable warmth in hand—destiny literally re-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—hear the hidden beginning inside collapse—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when she realizes the signal is silence itself. One meaningful reversal: amplification path is foreclosed, attenuation becomes the only live option, and the price is the permanent loss of loud-signal certainty. Escalation is situational-pressure rather than multi-turn, perfectly legitimate at this length. Cost is legible on-page: “the hollywood star fragment cool again” marks the irreversible transfer of warmth into insight.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single stake—restore the ferry—tightens when sideways time narrows memory, forcing a now-or-never alignment. Escalation is one continuous crescendo: static → faint voice → chorus → merger. Price is the grotto’s erasure, legible on page. No secondary pressure or resource lost mid-process, so intensity plateaus once the chorus arrives.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—control vs. dissolution of self through pattern-making—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the tapestry eruption threatens to overwrite her entirely. The single meaningful escalation occurs at the eruption: options narrow to either keep weaving (accept self-revision) or stop (lose coherence); she chooses the former, paying with her stable past. Agency is continuous—each weave pass is a decision that increases the cost. Price is tangible: distorted childhood memory, unsettling calm as permanent condition. Under the Accumulative lens the pressure mounts via density of rewritten memories rather than external antagonist, satisfying the lens guardrail.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—reviving celestial navigation to reclaim human horizon—signals early. Escalation occurs through pedagogical tension: Kael’s apathy threatens mission, his questions validate it; option space narrows from doubt to conviction. Cost is mostly conceptual (paradigm shift) rather than tangible loss; would benefit from one physical forfeiture (e.g., dimming dome power budget) to juice pressure. Still, agency remains Elara’s; no coincidence rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—saving Eleanor’s voice—signals early; pressure tightens via pulse-intensity, not reversal; the cost (Elara’s solitude and perpetual on-call burden) is visible in final seated beat; could escalate further if a live alternative were foreclosed, but sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—return codex before tide seals access—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens with every phase transition, climaxing as water “began to flow differently.” Escalation is physical and temporal: walls liquefy, pathways flicker, tidal window shrinks; each transition forecloses retreat. Visible price is paid—breath hitches, pulse pounds, time lost—altering later speed. One minor slip: researchers’ stakes stay abstract; no live antagonist raises personal cost beyond symbolic gratitude.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—“fetch wisdom from failure”—is signaled early; the defragment act tightens by forcing her to relive ignoring Kael’s warning, narrowing options to acceptance. Cost is conceptual (guilt acknowledged) rather than tactical; no resource loss alters later moves, so pressure intensifies emotionally but not materially. Escalation is accumulative: ink images layer until reckoning; one decisive deepening suffices. Ghost prompts but does not raise external danger, so antagonistic pressure is internal only, coherent under chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—save the Old Tongue’s texture—tightens exactly once: the flaw twists her first attempt into noise, forcing her to wager her own coherence. Escalation is causal-under-pressure: each false syllable widens the black lightning inside the stone, narrowing her tactical options to one—surrender. Cost is audible: the reader hears the moment her voice almost shatters into the thousand whispers she feared. No reversal is needed; the single deepening is sufficient and viscera-scale.</question>
    <question>5</question><grade>9.7</question><grade>The theme emerges wordlessly: translation is not preservation but metamorphosis, and to carry a world of texture into sound one must become the flock, relinquishing singular voice. Subtext lives in gesture—her trembling fingers stop fighting and start weaving—showing that surrender can be agency. The final image re-prices the premise: silence is no longer absence but a patterned flight that keeps the language alive inside its own extinction. No moral is stated; the echo reweights itself.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“will absurdity dissolve grief?”—tightens when Aris chooses laughter in real time, narrowing options from healer to trickster-guide. One meaningful escalation: static confession → joke → gravitational bloom → bodily light-shift; each step carries visible price (soil stain, phone silence). No off-stage rescue; metamorphose is irreversible. Cost legible, though could be sharper (e.g., personal identity bleed).

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.5)
    Single dominant stake—restore beauty—is signaled early. Escalation is linear: statues track → Warden confrontation → heartbeat gambit → crystal dies. One meaningful tightening occurs when the Warden’s surface quivers, proving the method works and raising the final physical risk. Cost is present (crystal extinguished, statues shed servitude), but because Elara faces no counter-move or personal loss, pressure feels moderate, not acute.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: can silence birth living art? Pressure tightens when dismantled horses “plead” and halo fragment demands reassembly; singing is the irreversible cost. Accumulative escalation: each polished gear and smoothed mane increases density until song breaks the pattern. No coincidence; agency pure. Price paid: voice reclaimed, solitude broken—visible on page.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single stake—reach the story-realm—tightens when each hyperbolic gesture costs her social visibility (patrons’ obliviousness) and emotional capital (scarf’s dissolution); the final doorway forecloses return to prior anonymity, price legible in the scarf’s vanishing light.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—capture the runaway dream—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens when the palette’s luminescence dims mid-scene, forcing a single exposure attempt. Escalation is Accumulative: each painted stroke depletes finite pigment, raising the cost of failure. The sunrise moment forecloses retry; the dream’s dissolution is irreversible, paying the price on-page. No external antagonist needed; pressure is resource-based and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—free the idea—signals early, but pressure is atmospheric, not tactical: sentinels remain shapeless, failure consequence never specified. One tightening occurs when the hair enters the keyhole, yet the disorientation is suffered passively; Elian does not adapt tactics or pay a visible price. Escalation is poetic density (stars blaze, shadows recoil) rather than option-loss. The conflict resolves by cosmic fiat, not by a choice that forecloses a path, so agency feels decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—recover stolen memories—tightens when each mis-aligned mushroom blocks return. Escalation: each correct alignment narrows future options (only one constellation left). Cost visible: rising haze taxes her stamina; trembling hands at end. Agency drives every beat; coincidence absent. One deepening: realizing grandfather’s bargain caused land’s decay—stakes reweighted. Slight reserve: external jeopardy (water rising, hull collapse) implied but not viscerally imminent.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reversible exile—tightens through perceptual reframing, not external antagonist. Each annotation beat escalates by shrinking Elian’s options: wall → gate → mirror → own reflection. The cost is conceptual but legible: once he marks the shard, return is possible only by accepting the annotated version of self. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes again, keeping this just shy of 9-band intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single dominant stake—restore wonder—signalled in paragraph 2 and tightened once when the gray is about to win. Agency is present: she decides to weave, decides where to plant; the cost is the perpetual labor acknowledged in the last paragraph. No reversal or deepening beyond the single turn from despair to renewal; escalation is linear uplift rather than narrowing options. Sufficient for length, but the absence of a trade-off or credible loss keeps it below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“will she keep or release the ghosts?”—is signaled early; pressure mounts through accretive imagery (swollen books, fused pages) rather than new external obstacles. One meaningful tightening: shaking the globe = decision to leave her own note, foreclosing the artifact-hoard path. Cost is legible but generalized (“lightness”); lacks a concrete forfeiture on-page, keeping it from 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—give voice to the voiceless—signaled early; pressure escalates through pigment-layer accumulation rather than causal reversals. One meaningful tightening: approaching storm electrifies the mural, forcing completion before thunder. Ghost emergence is not antagonistic but collaborative, so external risk stays low; cost is opportunity-based (permanent exposure) rather than forfeiture. Escalation reads as density increase under Accumulative lens; meets short-form requirement for single deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stake—find joy beneath anguish—is signaled early yet remains abstract; no external obstacle opposes ascent. Pressure accumulates via diary revelations, but Elara’s options never narrow; she could stop reading with zero cost. One meaningful tightening is absent; climax is recognition, not trade-off. Coincidence (diary placement) complicates only, so lens coherence holds.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.0)
    Dominant stake—prove void remembers—is declared early but never tested by a genuine reversal or resource loss; no live option is foreclosed. Pressure plateaus at “label another cloud,” so escalation is iterative, not causally intensifying.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—imprison the boundless—tightens as each fractal layer proves the sky’s infinite recursion can’t be held. One meaningful deepening: the moment she sees her own mural as “a static, beautiful lie” forecloses further brushstrokes. Cost is legible: months of pigment labour now doomed alongside the building. Agency remains hers; the demolition machinery only ratifies her renunciation, not rescues it.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are declared early (“chart the next great discovery”) and tighten once when the luminance-map aligns with the hopscotch cipher, foreclosing the possibility that the vision was illusion. Yet no credible loss or trade-off is dramatized—time, tools, social credit, or personal risk remain untouched—so the escalation is intellectual, not visceral. The protagonist never faces an opposed force or a live dilemma; pressure is situational but mild.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—“learn the rhythm of repair”—is signaled early but remains abstract; no concrete consequence of failure is ever staged or even named. Escalation is lyrical accumulation (each image of broken time deepens texture) rather than narrowing options; the only decisive turn is the uncap itself, which proceeds smoothly once the gear is found. Because coincidence (precise prophecy, gear waiting on pedestal) does the heavy lifting, pressure feels fated, not tested. Cost is aesthetic (haunting brightness) rather than felt forfeiture, keeping tension moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—deliver final peace before absolute midnight—is signaled in paragraph one. Each calibration tightens from “universe holds its breath” to “clock struck its final toll,” foreclosing retreat; the price (her life) is visible in the penultimate beat. Escalation is causal under the Causal lens; coincidence never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—save three travelers before lethal frost—signaled in opening paragraph. Escalation via tightening patrols and dropping temperature; each arrow projection narrows Elara’s safety. Cost legible: warmer device, frost crystals forming, birds’ noose tightening. Agency remains hers throughout; no luck rescue. Could use one visceral loss (bruised knee, cracked quartz) to push higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—transform guilt into connective action—tightens once via the foam epiphany; cost is conceptual (accept impermanence) rather than visceral. Sufficient for this length, but no secondary loss or live trade-off sharpens the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—access to narrative origin—is declared early; escalation arrives as denser layers of absence rather than as narrowing options. Because the library cooperates on cue, pressure is atmospheric, not antagonistic; the only visible cost is the spent vial, which feels symbolic rather than tactical. The arrival of the first customer supplies a micro-turn, but it is projected beyond the text, so the on-page tightening is modest. Agency remains internal and visionary; the piece achieves a lyric intensification rather than a causal ratchet.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—transform collective remorse into palatable essence—is signaled early. Pressure escalates texturally: each tidal-pool analogy and coral contact thickens emotional density until the pillar beat forces full absorption. Chef’s agency drives every increment; no outside coincidence resolves the grief. Cost is conceptual (he now carries the tasted sorrow) but not tied to concrete loss of future option—keeps it below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes are declared communal but never felt individually; no village risks losing anything on-page. Pressure plateaus after the three representatives agree—no trade-off, no visible price. Escalation is therefore static; the “grain elevator talk” lifts only metaphoric grain.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can she hold multitudes without fracturing?—tightens when each spectral memory exacts a synaptic tax, foreclosing the option of ordinary identity. Escalation is textural: color-density mounts until flying-child memory tips her into irrevocable fusion. Cost is legible (“her very bones quaked”), though the canyon’s responsive vibration edges on convenient intensifier.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“find forgotten combinations or grotto re-buries them”—is early and under constant time pressure from the one-hour gravity flip. Escalation works through because/therefore: wrong step → altered perception → latent seeds sharpen focus, culminating in final forced renunciation of her former limits. Cost is visible: she exits carrying unending watchfulness, a psychic weight explicitly transferred. Could climb higher with on-page evidence that this vigilance will complicate her outer life, but within flash scale, pressure coheres and climaxes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—sound versus silence—tightens through pattern accumulation rather than external opposition: each deciphered crack narrows the possible pitch until only one frequency remains. The visible price is the porcelain’s structural fatigue audibly humming under the first note, a felt cost that forecloses silence forever.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—restore or accept the death of the eclipsed covenant—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens via the celestial “next phase” clock. Agency manifests in the deliberate stone-press that re-energizes the pact; the price is the visceral energy surge that leaves him momentarily overwhelmed. One meaningful escalation beat suffices under Accumulative lens. Pressure would feel sharper if the text had staged even a faint external obstacle or dissenting voice at the nexus.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—recover the diary to complete her taxonomy of silence—is clear early. Pressure is ambient (distant rumble, fireworks countdown) but never narrows her options or exacts a visible price; she succeeds without trade-off. The “final stillness” functions more as atmospheric motif than ticking clock that alters tactics. Escalation is therefore textural (density of silence catalogued) rather than causal tightening, adequate for short lyric arc but not high-band tension.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will she germinate the seed—tightens when the new scent forecloses her old forcing methods. One meaningful deepening: the shift from “I must make it grow” to “I must listen to its timing” narrows her options and reweights the village’s oral wisdom. No external antagonist; pressure is situational and sensory. Cost is conceptual—her identity as ambitious prodigy is quietly surrendered—but visible in the final image of her calm exhale.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—find the resilience source—tightens when gravity flip opens a one-hour window, forcing passive drift and arrow retrieval. Cost is visible: risking loss of control, then accepting responsibility to disseminate knowledge. Escalation is single but sufficient; no reversal after the echo reveal, yet options are reweighted. The hourglass pressure is tracked (“as the gravity inversion neared its end”), keeping tension alive.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—decode wind to prevent repeat crash—signals early and tightens when the patch personalizes the abstract loss. One meaningful deepening: vortices pictured colliding with Kael’s patch-wearing arm. Cost is conceptual (lifelong vigilance) rather than on-page resource loss; still legible under Accumulative lens. Could use one visible micro-loss (time, tool, data) to enter 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are declared (“certify wonder as essential”) but never tested by opposition or possible failure; pressure escalates only through atmospheric intensification, not through narrowed options or risk. The beat sequence is accumulative beauty rather than causal conflict, so the climax feels inevitable, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—harvest insight from failure—is signaled early and tightened when ghost-replays force observation under avalanching silence. Agency is interior but visible: arranging markers before playing, choosing to watch not flinch. Cost is conceptual (loss of innocence about his error) rather than visceral, keeping escalation just shy of the 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—“find magic in mundane deliveries”—signaled early but remains abstract; no concrete loss or forfeiture attached. Escalation is tonal layering, not option-narrowing; traveler’s words complicate worldview but do not block or force a decision. Cost is conceptual (relic now feels “lighter”), not visceral; meets 8.8 gate threshold only weakly. Agency is receptive listening, not active choice; luck of encounter drives turn.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—proving emotional residue—tightens when the residue turns out to be hers. The reversal (witness → source) narrows future options: she can no longer pose as detached observer. Cost is visible in the heavier prism and slowed gait. Escalation is single but sufficient for this length; a second external obstacle would have over-crowded.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—send “I remember” across impossible distance—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened when the silence physically frays the loom. Escalation is bodily: each shuttle-pass drains vitality, foreclosing the option to survive transmission. The final narrowing is the portal’s demand for total self-anchoring; she chooses dissolution, paying the on-page price of her own continuity. No reversal, but the single meaningful deepening (vitality → extinction) satisfies the short-form requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—transmute discard into strength—is signaled early; the silk trade provides one meaningful tightening that narrows options to mage-given knowledge. No secondary obstacle or reversal escalates risk; the blade is symbol, not wager. Cost is present but post-plot: night labor, spent silk. Thus escalation is single-step, satisfying but not memorable; the closure image reweights meaning rather than risk.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“bottle the feeling of safety”—is signaled early and escalates as the lamp refuses to stay lit. The spectral chill intensifies on each return to the lantern room, narrowing options to: flee, endure, or anchor light. Protagonist’s agency: stacking guidance cairn and placing glass anchor directly enable the revival. Cost is the unending vigilance implied by the receding but not vanquished haunt.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—guide light to foretell/purify—announced early. Escalation is textural (patterns thicken, storm nears) rather than option-narrowing; Kael never considers abandoning post or failing. No visible price alters tactics; energy hums but never imperils, keeping pressure aesthetic, not consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—uncovering story-magnetism—remains abstract; no concrete price is risked or paid. Pressure accumulates through sensory density rather than narrowing options; the wing’s destruction is environmental, not a consequence of Kaelen’s agency. One meaningful deepening occurs when iridescence reveals symbols, but it changes knowledge without forcing trade-off. Stakes are legible but never viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—deconstruct personal sorrow—stated early but never materially tested; no credible loss or trade-off appears. Pressure is atmospheric (storm, moonlight) rather than option-narrowing; the pin clink is symbolic, not an obstacle that forecloses a path. Escalation is tonal accretion: storm subsides, sorrow dissolves—an accumulative cadence shift rather than agency-driven turn. Cost is conceptual, not tactical, so the tightening is present but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—“weave the dawns again”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens through a single, meaningful intensification: the hush before the final lullaby. Escalation is textural rather than causal-reversal: each sung bar thickens the light until the realm’s silence snaps; this satisfies the Accumulative lens. The price is visceral—the song’s strain on Elara’s unused voice and the risk that the thread might flicker out. No secondary reversal is needed; the communal pickup functions as choral amplification, not external rescue, keeping agency centered on her sustained note.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—extracting self-forgiveness from past betrayal—is signaled early and held throughout. Escalation is textural: ritual calm deepens rather than narrows options; the single tightening is the elder’s invitation to speak, not a material trade-off. Cost is conceptual—public exposure of shame in a circle of strangers—but lacks a tangible loss (time, tool, social credit). Pressure remains coherent under situational lens; coincidence is absent; yet the absence of a priced forfeiture caps intensity below the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—impermanence vs. counter-memory—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is textural: each artifact (bread, journal) tightens the cost of noticing. The decisive tightening occurs when she reads the gardener’s shame and realizes complacency is heritable; this reframes her guerrilla gardening from hobby to moral stance with visible price—she must now continue, no exit. No coincidence; agency preserved. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: “her work was just beginning” = lifelong burden accepted. Could push into 8.8+ if a concrete resource (time, stamina) were visibly forfeited on the page, but the conceptual cost is legible under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—save meaning from oblivion—tightens through each sampled vow; every measurement forecloses another fragment of hope. Escalation is accumulative: density of fading images reweights cost until the final dimming forces the shift to witness. Agency is pure attention; renunciation of rescue is the visible price. No external antagonist required; pressure is existential and coherent under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—preserve family route via psychological espionage—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the sunrise tide becomes a live clock. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient: each false start narrows Silas’s caution and widens his greed, culminating in the audible slap whose cost is transferred into the fob. Protagonist agency is observational rather than confrontational; the decisive change is capturing the betrayal, not preventing it, a stance crystallization that fits the situational lens. The felt price is conceptual—her complicity recorded—making the escalation legible if compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—why people carry weather—surfaces in paragraph 1 and tightens when the compass needle steadies on the man. The single deepening (his revelation that carriers are anchors) forecloses Elara’s skepticism and reweights her glow; the cost is epistemic rather than visceral. No visible price is extracted from her beyond conceptual shift, keeping pressure in the conceptual register. Adequate for this length and lens, but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—uncork creativity—tightens when the forgotten combination is recalled and the first charcoal stroke becomes irreversible; that moment narrows options from paralysis to flow. Escalation is accumulative: each recalled face, each reflected shard intensifies the cost of failure. No external antagonist needed; pressure is internal and coherent. Cost is visible: she leaves the literal broken lock behind, foreclosing retreat to old blockage.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—retrievable honesty—announced in paragraph two. Pressure escalates via leaf barometer: every lie browns her talismans, forcing her to seek raw candor to revive them. Mid-story tightening when child’s secret perks leaves shows cost altering tactics. Archive reveal doesn’t resolve conflict, it deepens it: she must now shoulder the city’s forgotten truths, path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—wonder is leaking from the world—intensifies through color saturation rather than plot turns; escalation is a deepening of sensory loss rather than narrowed options. Elara’s agency is continuous micro-adjustment of bells, culminating in the single surging chord that momentarily restores hue; cost is the eternal return of winter silence, a conceptual price legible in the final glisten. Because the lens is Accumulative/Textural, the required “tightening” is the visible dimming → brilliant flare of color, sufficient for this length. Stakes stay abstract but emotionally tracked; a more visceral consequence (a bell fractures, her hearing cracks) would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—silence inner static—tightens when magnetic shifts flicker systems, forcing the miniaturize-or-perish inflection. Miniaturization itself is the single meaningful escalation, paid for with exile and permanent cargo of dread. Agency is absolute: Kael ignites his own core; no coincidence resolves the breach.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can listening reopen a sealed life?—tightens once: rumors → direct knock → Hemlock speaks. Escalation is accretive rather than reversal-heavy; each story fragment raises the emotional price of intrusion. The credible loss is Hemlock’s exposure of grief; Elara risks violating his privacy, a social cost felt when she “knocked softly.” Persistent constraint: the mailbox literalizes avoidance; its opening forecloses his ritual of perpetual unread farewell.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—free the imprisoned minds—signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is accumulative/textural: each decoded journal page increases density of guilt until the master entry forces the final dance. Cost is visceral: Elara’s stamina, the dice’s final symbol, the awakening hum that forecloses retreat. No coincidence; every tightening emerges from her pirouette-driven decryption.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recover lost memories—tightens when coffee dregs narrow the search to one patch of earth; the dig becomes slower or faster as gravity spikes, putting physical price on each scoop. Escalation is textural: each intensified gravity pocket increases emotional weight until the float-release crystallizes the cost of knowledge. No false reversals; coincidence (beached whale) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are declared (“prevent chaotic unraveling”) but never tested on-page; no visible consequence or narrowing option occurs—the prophecy simply fades. Escalation is purely textural (repetition of “whispered secrets” softens), not causal. Cost is conceptual at closure, but lacks mid-story pressure, capping high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—gaining fluency in architectural utterance—tightens through each wax impression and creak translation; the final silence after Finch’s dissolution is the undeniable price. Escalation is textural: density of meteors and remembered sigils accumulates rather than reverses. One meaningful shift occurs when the narrator realizes the conversation will continue without the tutor, foreclosing the option of external guidance. Cost is atmospheric, not logistical; the story could have reached 8.8+ had the seal’s transfer forced an immediate tactical sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—freedom from quarantined memory—is signaled early and tightens once: the archive act forecloses nostalgic regression. Cost is visible: the shell’s voice dies, replacing nostalgic ache with silence. Escalation is situational: pressure crystallizes her stance rather than multiplying external obstacles. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single dominant stake—restore authentic echoes—is signaled early. Escalation is accumulative: each sung verse deepens pattern, no tightening trade-off; options never narrow, only knowledge accrues. Cost is atmospheric, not tactical—sadness declared, not shown as forfeited resource. Agency is present but low-heat; song always the only plausible action.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—retrieve a pure relic of love from disaster—remains coherent. Pressure escalates by density, not reversal: each dream shard thickens the globe’s back-story until the final exposure to Anya crystallizes the cost. The tightening is present but gentle; the story opts for lyrical accretion rather than a crucible that forecloses Kaelen’s options, so the felt price is conceptual, not personal.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stake is the act of seeing—will Kaelen truly perceive hidden effort? Pressure escalates by accretion of luminous patterns rather than by obstacle. No option is foreclosed, no price exacted; the deepening is aesthetic, not tactical, so the tightening feels gentle rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.6)
    One dominant stake—truth vs comfortable lie—tightens when each clue shows larger complicity (orchard survives via murder of world). Escalation is causal: every deduction narrows option from “find gem” to “activate stillpoint at personal cost.” On-page reversal at diamond lift instantly demonstrates price (still air, flickering light, returning dust). Cost is visible and persistent under Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: can Elara turn static whispers into a unified rebellion without losing herself? Pressure tightens once: the unity broadcast forces her off the tower—option foreclosed. Variant allegiance fracturing supplies credible antagonistic pressure; betrayal rumble keeps cost visible. Escalation is textural—radio song reinterpreted live—rather than causal-reversal, sufficient for the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are internal and singular: can he redeem himself by preserving lost sound? Pressure accumulates through the repetition of jar-capture, each note tightening the ritual, but no external obstacle or escalating risk raises the cost; the music-box cooperates at once. The tightening is lyrical (density of dawn-light imagery) rather than causal, adequate for Accumulative lens but lacking a visible price that forecloses an option. Agency is present yet safe—he never drops a jar, never confronts a rival, so escalation feels gentle, not perilous.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—artifact must not shatter—signalled on entry; pressure tightens as ice groans skew the key’s frequency. One visible price: key almost fractures, Kaelen’s breath cracks, stance recalibrates; options narrow to “become the frequency.” Agency is continuous; no outside savior. Escalation is linear, not quantum, so high-band but not apex.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—liberation from generational haste—signaled in first paragraph. One meaningful tightening: moon convergence narrows the infinite calendar to one breath, forcing the “unyoke” act. Cost is spiritual/social: abandoning the frenetic life they knew; price visible in collective “sigh of relief.” No antagonist needed; pressure is temporal and internal. Escalation is textural—repetition of lunar imagery intensifies rather than new obstacles—sufficient under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—expose systemic cover-up versus agency control—signaled early and tightens when ledger is found; however, escalation plateaus there: no new obstacle (legal threat, sabotage, moral dilemma) complicates escape. Micro-turn: Thorn’s demand creates a local reversal, but his stumble into darkness removes pressure instead of raising cost. Agency is present—Elara refuses, sidesteps, walks out—but the price (job loss, reprisal) is postponed off-page, softening the felt cost under causal lens. One meaningful tightening occurs; meets short-story threshold, yet lacks a second constraining beat that would elevate to high band.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“can Elias’s music live again and thus redeem the chaplain?”—tightens once: verdict “not hopeless” pivots both repair and self-forgiveness. Agency is present in the chaplain’s decision to learn; cost is the irrevocable hours spent and the now-unmissable song he must carry back inside. Escalation is modest but coherent under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—give voice to the algorithm’s longing—tightens once when the hum grows “more desperate,” forcing Elara’s final transliteration. Escalation is atmospheric rather than tactical; no option is foreclosed for her, so the cost remains conceptual. Under Accumulative lens the deepening suffices, but the absence of a trade-off caps intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—uncover why files vanish—signaled in paragraph 1. One deepening: discovering the messages proves sabotage, tightening the moral cost of preservation. Escalation is textural: each recurrence of 11-23-35 thickens the texture of desperation. Agency is present—lying to gain access—but the external antagonist remains off-stage, so pressure is atmospheric rather than tactical; cost is conceptual, felt in the final silence.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (save villages by stilling ice) is signaled early; pressure escalates as ice “groans like a living beast” and mirrors foreshadow the leviathan’s pain. One meaningful tightening: the revelation that destruction is collateral to a trapped creature collapses destroy-versus-save options, forcing empathy. Cost is visible—Kaelen’s shadow-laced pact, shard wound, and the silent store-owner’s weight—but the beat where he decides to free rather than kill is summarized, not dramatized, keeping it just under 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—stay alive after planned death—remains abstract until the final parasol beat; prior trawls accumulate texture, not narrower options. One meaningful deepening occurs when the lace sound becomes the sound of endings, reweighting stakes under accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual, not visceral, but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake—accepting past mismatch—signaled early, yet pressure plateaus: no concrete test, loss, or forfeiture on the page. Escalation is purely imagistic (leaf rustle, star witness) without narrowing options. Agency is contemplative observation, not a decision that forecloses a path; coincidence absent but also no risk enacted. Cost remains conceptual, not visible or felt.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake—echo preservation—is signaled early and achieved without obstacle; therefore pressure feels declarative rather than tested. No option is foreclosed, no resource spent, no risk realized; success is iterative, not contested. The single “tightening” is the parapet breaching sand, but it immediately enhances calm rather than narrows choices. Cost is absent on the page; consequence is purely affirmative.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—“can photographs heal?”—is signaled early but escalation is ambient: more visitors, more shared tears, no obstacle or trade-off. No reversal narrows Elara’s options; pressure accumulates rather than tightens. Cost is social/observed, not personal, so tension plateaus rather than peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—prove language still breathes—is signaled early. Pressure escalates only once: fracturing sound becomes a “heartbeat.” The escalation is Accumulative (density of sonic shards) rather than a narrowing of actionable options; no visible price (time, reputation, bodily risk) is paid. The scholar’s agency is purely epistemic; the library imposes no external jeopardy. Enough for a single tightening, but cost is conceptual, not viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—“capture the sound of growing older”—is signaled early; every driftwood arrow is an accumulative tightening that forecloses certainty. Pressure grows via attrition of memory rather than external antagonist; chalk stub becomes visible price. No single reversal, but the pattern of near-discovery → erasure → re-marking narrows options until surrender. Cost is legible, yet escalation is more iterative than decisive; hence mid-7 band.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Theme emerges from the iterative failure to crystallize time: “to capture the sound was to lose its essence.” No moralizing; the final image reweights the premise through renunciation. Echo, chalk, and videotape motifs accumulate texture rather than symbolic convenience. The insight feels earned because it is inseparable from the prophet’s physical exhaustion and snapped tool.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—trap an entire solar flare inside a single frame—escalates with each lunar tremor that threatens the lens alignment. The mid-story tightening occurs when Elara realizes she must arrest the perpetual clock, narrowing her options to one irreversible calibration. The cost is legible: perpetual motion dies so a transient fire can live forever, leaving her with a “luminous ache” that seals the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“flawless goodbye before death”—is signaled early and tightens through each song fragment and the recorded apology; escalation is the narrowing of remaining breath. Cost is felt: Alistair’s last afternoon asks for the music he can no longer dance to. Agency is shared: Elara enables, Alistair speaks the forgiveness; both endure the final silence. No external antagonist needed; internal countdown supplies coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“find where shadows go”—is signaled early and tightens when the hologram reveals they are trapped in a pocket universe. Escalation is Accumulative: each text she cross-references thickens the density of risk (sealed awakenings could mend or shatter reality). The decisive tightening is the blood offering—an irreversible trade that forecloses sterile scholarship. Cost is visible (cracked key, trembling isle), yet the price feels institutional rather than personal, keeping the score just shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—healing the rift between worlds—signals early. Pressure escalates via accumulative imagery: tooth glow, garden breathes, fireflies constellation. No visible price is exacted from Elara; the cost is atmospheric, not tactical. The tightening is poetic, not option-narrowing, keeping it below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—share non-consuming light—tightens once: dull shard → prism → public reveal. The polishing beat is the meaningful intensification; options narrow to "stay hidden" or "carry glass outward," with solitude the visible forfeit. Cost is legible in the grotto’s approving sigh—loss of private sanctuary. Accumulative escalation suffices; no reversals required at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to live after public exposure—tightens once: the pendant offering forecloses retreat into solitary shame. Cost is visible when Leo wears the amber, accepting shared vulnerability. Escalation is accretive, not causal, but legitimate under chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—harvest hopes before the “whisper of closing pages” silences them—is declared early and reiterated, but the whisper never tightens choices or risks tangible loss; time feels ambient, not urgent. Escalation is textural: each cameo adds density, yet every capture is frictionless. The final consecration is voluntary, not forced by a narrowed option or live cost. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, but the absence of a visible price paid keeps it from 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—arbor’s decay vs. revival—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened once: the limp vines stir only after the crescendo, narrowing options to “sing on or let silence return.” Cost is visible: she accepts perpetual responsibility—“her work was just beginning.” No secondary reversal, but one meaningful tightening satisfies length. Agency is sustained; coincidence plays no role.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can a map of heartbeats be fixed before the world exhales—is signaled early. Escalation is accumulative: each ignition heightens stillness, consumes starlight, and increases the visible price (hands numbing, vial emptying). One decisive tightening: the final ignition fuses the last drop, foreclosing reversal. Cost is legible (stored light is gone, cold has entered bones), but because the orchard itself doesn’t push back or threaten failure, external pressure stays muted; thus just below 8.8+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—capture and preserve wonder—remains stable; pressure escalates texturally via denser echo timbres rather than via jeopardy.  The single meaningful tightening is the gear realisation that swaps measurement for harvest; price is conceptual (time spent, season “wounded”) rather than viscerally felt, but sufficient for this lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes are declared—collect burdens—but no consequence attached if she fails or stops; pressure plateaus. Each burden calcified simply adds another pretty object without trade-off or mounting risk. No resource dwindles except off-screen kerosene; she never hesitates, mis-aligns, or fractures a crystal. Love lattice lands as aesthetic tableau, not narrowing options, so escalation is decorative rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—fear of forgetting—tightens as kettle whistle shortens temporal runway. Escalation is textural: each shaving ups the stakes by narrowing the blank’s future; the final stroke forecloses further revision. Cost is legible: she trades boiling water (immediate life) for finished carving, accepting perpetual absence. Slight reserve: external pressure is ambient, not antagonistic; could wish for one sharper material consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—make peace with eroded ambition—signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when camera wheel glows, foreclosing any future attempt to “reclaim” moments. Agency = endurance/renunciation; cost is surrender of the wheel itself. No external antagonist; pressure is situational and accumulative. One meaningful deepening: mist thickens, stories coalesce into projection, option to fix timeline evaporates. Cost legible on-page: “Regret melted into acceptance” tied to prop relinquishment.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“resurrect heart without restoring original glory”—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when each repurposed conduit locks Kaelen farther from conventional rehab; the hydroponic sprout is the visible price/test. No external antagonist, but systemic decay and limited materials supply coherent friction. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, keeping escalation steady but not crushing.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“make peace with abandoned dream”—is signaled in first 150 words and tightened once: the whispering crystals offer a spectral symphony, forcing the choice to hear or relinquish. Cost is felt: she physically closes the clock, ending the possibility of future composing. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure suffices. Escalation is accumulative/textural: density of whispers increases until acceptance crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—uncover concealed betrayal—signaled in paragraph 2. Pressure rises by accretion: each reiterated phrase tightens the noose of myth until the stone crack reweights options. No visible price is exacted on her body or future, so cost stays conceptual. Escalation is textural but coherent under Accumulative lens; one decisive intensification suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are singular—preserve ancient propagation lore—and tighten as each decoded knot forecloses failure: misreading would lose weavers forever. Agency is cerebral but active: every micro-choice to pause, breathe, angle the glass narrows the possibility of error. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—she accepts lifelong burden of transmission—but the text keeps it abstract (“guardian, a new thread”) rather than letting us feel the weight alter her body or plan. Still, under an accumulative lens, the rising density of revealed methods supplies sufficient escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.2)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reawaken beauty—faces a concrete test when the egg cracks; agency drives each step of assembly. One meaningful tightening: incorporation of organic dew narrows the technical path and raises failure cost. The price is legible but external (palace quake) rather than personal body-risk, capping short of 8.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—proving scars can sing—tightens once: the graft must work or the mantra fails. No external antagonist needed; pressure is the girl’s stillness and Elara’s need to atone. Cost is visible: the coin—last link to the traveler she lost—leaves Elara’s pocket forever. A second beat of complication (infection fear, paste failure) could push 8.8+ but would risk word-count breach.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—free the memories—escalates only by accumulation of shards; no live option is foreclosed until the final alignment, and even that is a first-time cost rather than a narrowing. Pressure is atmospheric, not tactical; sidereal patience is invoked, not weaponized. Enough for a functional arc, but not the tightening required for 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve beauty without combustion—locks in early. Escalation is textural: each ping thickens the pattern until the anomaly deepens the stakes from maintenance to legacy. Protagonist agency is present but interior; she engineers the sonic code, paying with the garden’s dissolution. Cost is legible yet cerebral; a sharper visceral loss would tighten the screw further.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—find grief’s shape—signaled in line 1; pressure is epistemic, not peril. Tightening happens each time she pairs ribbon to butterfly route, narrowing interpretive options until only connectivity model survives; cost is relinquishing the “monolith” comfort of headstones. No external antagonist or resource loss, so escalation is quiet and cerebral; this caps intensity below 8-band. Still, accrued density forces a stance crystallization that feels final and irrevocable.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore shared balance to avert another flood—tightens when the hitch is noticed and narrows to a single micro-adjustment choice. Pressure escalates under causal lens: each fractional turn of the bob is an irreversible wager against the sea. The visible cost is the decades of trembling guilt compacted into one smooth arc; forgiveness is the forfeiture of self-flagellation. No coincidence intrudes; the tide only threatens, never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving silenced stories—signals early (“uncharted echoes”) and tightens when a snapped thread literally narrows her path to the journal. Agency is intellectual (decoding) rather than external confrontation; cost is the intangible burden of unfinished mission, visible in her vow to “tenderly organize” henceforth. No reversal beyond the snap, but deepening suffices for 700-word scope. Coincidence is absent; escalation is purely textural accumulation of meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—keep broadcast alive while seeding stories—tightens when she embeds code in orchestral scores: one visible trade-off (discovery by authorities). Escalation causal: each new cipher song raises notation tampering risk; no coincidence resolves. Cost legible: “thistled calm” shows constant vigilance. Could use one tangible loss (e.g., missed cue in orchestra) to hit 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can she forgive without full facts?—tightens exactly once: when grinding begins, the option to keep the intact mask is lost. Cost is visible white dust on black paper; escalation is density-based, not causal. No antagonist needed; pressure is internal and coherent. Could push higher if a second, smaller cost (hand bleeding, cough) altered tactics, but it doesn’t.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserve empirical navigation—is signaled in para 1 and tightens each time sediment resists or yields. The mid-story brass-plate discovery is the single meaningful escalation: it proves her rebellion is not delusion, foreclosing resignation. Cost is visible—knuckles raw, social credit zero—but the off-stage factions never physically confront her, so pressure is intellectual more than visceral, capping at 8.3.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—rescuing vanishing arts through choral harmony—is signaled early. Pressure escalates only texturally: repeated “subtracting noise” metaphor and autumn’s fade intensify mood rather than narrow options. No credible loss or trade-off is dramatized for Elara; the risk remains abstract. The final chord is lovely but does not foreclose any live alternative, so tension plateaus rather than tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes—“create beauty from ruins before the rare alignment ends”—are declared early, but pressure stays atmospheric rather than tactical; no live option is foreclosed by elapsed time or external opposition. Escalation is rhythmic accumulation of light and sprout; agency is steady nurture, not a decisive turn with felt price. Cost remains conceptual; the story meets Accumulative lens but lacks visible loss or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—restore city power—signals early; pressure tightens when the riddle is literalized into condensation tactic. Protagonist agency is present but shared with Kael; the visible price is off-loaded to the city, not Elara, so escalation feels medium. One meaningful turn suffices at this length, yet stakes never threaten Elara’s private wonder, muting personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—why houses live or die—pressures every beat; the cottage’s breath provides the tightening. Agency is present: her deliberate displacement triggers the shift. Cost is visible in the hush that wraps her and the cottage’s audible relief. No reversal beyond the single profound inhale, but that suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake: solitary certainty vs. communal guardianship. Pressure escalates through each cascade—each inscription narrows the option of remaining alone. The pour is the single decisive trade-off; price is the permanent dispersal of private memory into shared substrate. No external antagonist needed; internal tension suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is legible by line 4: “capture the texture of a missed opportunity.” Pressure tightens via pattern accumulation—each solved equation raises the implicit cost of never finding the rupture. The rupture itself is the single meaningful turn; it narrows options from conquest to acceptance, paid with the visible price of her prior framework fracturing. Escalation is textural, not causal-reversal, and fully serves the accumulative lens—no higher score only because the tightening is one-stage, yet that stage is flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake is cognitive—prove kindness endures—but it escalates only by accumulation of examples, not by narrowing Elara’s options or risking a loss. No reversal or trade-off appears; the visions simply confirm her thesis. Because the protagonist’s stance never crystallizes under pressure, the tension plateaus rather than tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—rescue of a dying art—is signaled early and tightens once when the succulent honey is identified. Escalation is single, decisive, and driven by protagonist agency (climb, harvest, bake). The cost is cultural-loss averted rather than a personal price paid on the page, keeping it shy of 8.8. Under Causal lens, coincidence (finding the scratched initials) complicates but does not resolve, satisfying the lens guardrail.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“crack fate’s design”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the stone’s radiance offers a real tool. Each escalation is protagonist-driven: she decides to touch stone, to decode yoyo, to blast clock. Cost is legible: world laws invert, rain reverses, her own history loosens—felt, on-page. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; no off-stage rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—trick fear to survive—signals in paragraph one and tightens when the shadow demands confession; the paradoxical dictionary tactic forecloses denial as an option. One meaningful escalation: admitting hollowness turns the shadow’s interest into vulnerability, enabling the clasp-feed that costs her her only talisman. Agency remains hers throughout; coincidence is absent. Cost is visible—the clasp is gone, the funhouse dark forever—meeting the 8+ threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: preserve the orchard’s song against predicted silence. Escalation = density accrual: each fractal layer thickens stakes until wave tests the lattice. Agency: prophet’s decision to slam resonator converts threat into timbre—visible price is exhaustion and perpetual vigilance foreclosed. No off-stage rescue; coincidence (wave arrival) complicates, not resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reach the lost expedition—signaled early. Pressure tightens when harmonic flaw is found; playing the whistle is the single decisive act that narrows options to acknowledgment or eternal silence. Cost is visible: the shell cracks, cool air escapes, gate remains shut—permanent isolation accepted. Escalation is linear but sufficient for 800-word scale.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—restore scribe’s honor—clear early. Escalation is informational (decoding letter) without tightening options or visible price; no live opposition or risk. Agency is cerebral; the “rescue” succeeds once veritas is photographed—no trade-off or lost path. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes, staying below 7.0 threshold for high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—rescue abandoned dreams from oblivion—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens through each note sealed; options narrow as water rises and daylight fails. One meaningful deepening: his own dream becomes the final artifact, turning preservation into self-erasure. Cost is visible on page: he forfeits exit, comfort, and finally the quiet-shore life he once wanted. Agency remains causal under lens—no coincidences, only because/therefore of mortar and ink.</answer>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory is not archived but entombed in the very fabric that continues to drown. The interlaced absence motif moves from architectural void to personal void as his last note becomes one more absence he himself inhabits. Final image reconfigures meaning—foundations repaired even as they sink—offering resonant ambiguity rather than moral. No late symbolic graft; every return of “absence” is anchored to a prior physical detail.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“trace honest origins”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens through each stamp: verified index vs. messy plural truth. Escalation is Accumulative: each stamped margin raises the cost of continuing the old method until the drawer reveal forecloses it. Agency is pure attention and renunciation; no external villain needed. Price is legible: she will exit without light, carrying contradiction; the blackout persists as unpaid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake: transmute grief into 1 000 cranes; pressure escalates by accretion of polished gems → folded birds → growing flock. Agency is continuous craft action; no external antagonist. One meaningful tightening: the 1000th crane triggers shadow reunion, a conceptual repricing rather than option foreclosure. Cost is emotional—each crane absorbs “a fragment of her pain”—but no live resource loss alters tactics; intensity rises through imagery repetition, not narrowing choices.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single, clear stake: find the “pools of unused potential.” Tightening occurs when the feedback loop forecloses the search; cost is the overload and permanent emotional renunciation. Agency remains on-page—he engineers the pulse and suffers its price. No coincidence, no abstract escalation—pressure is entirely causal and culminates in stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—“find his place”—is announced early and every drone pass tightens data toward that answer, forming a coherent narrowing. Yet pressure stays intellectual; no deadline, rival, or risk of loss raises the cost. The final frequency delivers belonging, but the price is purely emotional vibration, not a foreclosed option, so escalation is modest. Still, the tightening sequence is legible under Causal lens and meets the one-meaningful-deepening requirement for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will she face the withheld truth?—tightens once: the carving she herself etched confronts her, narrowing options to endure or crack. No reversal, but the deepening is visceral and irreversible. Cost is conceptual (lifelong guilt made legible) and future-facing (she abandons her trade). Agency is interior yet decisive; coincidence never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—can these enemies risk a new protocol—surfaces early and tightens once: Kael’s admission of fratricide narrows options to cooperation or endless vendetta. The handshake forecloses revenge path; cost (Kael’s grief, Elara’s guilt-release) is legible but not viscerally acute.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—internal alignment vs. fear of failure—signals early. Escalation is causal: useless compass raises stakes, choppy water tests pole method, compass loss forces final commitment. Price legible: heirloom gone, body soaked, ego humbled. Tightening narrows romantic celestial navigation to pragmatic shoreline counting—one meaningful turn sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—kindle empathy—signaled early; pressure tightens when the mirrored self refuses reply, making acceptance of past the only forward path. Cost visible: he must re-inherit memories he came to erase. Agency drives turn: the throw activates the lake’s reply. No secondary reversal; linear escalation sufficient for 700-word window.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reforge bond or lose self—is signaled in sentence 4. Escalation is accumulative: each spice narrows the return path until the final cardamom pierces the veil and her body lightens irreversibly. Visible price: human form lost on-page (“she could not return to her old self”). No external antagonist needed; pressure is cosmically intimate, coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens. One meaningful tightening suffices; the bridge’s appearance is the decisive intensifier that forecloses retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—recover lost innocence via cloudbound repentance—signals in line 3 and tightens when the crack widens into a gateway she must risk entering. Escalation is textural: glow intensifies, fragments of past become tactile, thread extraction has unspoken cost (she leaves the sealed saucer behind). No antagonist needed; pressure coheres through accumulating sensory density. The visible price (surrender of the relic plus acceptance of irretrievability) meets the 8-band threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—“can compassion open a locked dimension?”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the dimension actively resists. Escalation is textural: each tear-thread adds density until the air crackles; Elara’s micro-choice to suppress joy is the visible price that forecloses retreat. The final stitch is driven by her agency, not miracle; failure would strand her alone forever. Cost is legible—she abandons the ship and every ghost she tended—but the beat is a single poetic surge rather than a wrenching dilemma, keeping it just below the 8.5 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—will she give the last of her light?—is clear, but pressure plateaus after the first two jars are opened; remaining releases are listed, each identical, flattening escalation. No mid-course tightening forces a trade-off or risk (bugs could die, she could regret). Accumulative lens demands a late density shift; instead we get graceful repetition without added cost or narrowed option.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—seed insurrection without detection—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when pamphlets are physically planted; live option (abort) is foreclosed. Agency is protagonist-driven at every beat; blackout coincidence complicates but does not resolve. Cost is legible: once leaflets are scattered, discovery becomes inevitable, a price Elara accepts in the final hush. No secondary reversal is needed at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—recover voice / rarefy truth—signalled in paragraph two and escalates through countdown; agency resides in enduring the wait then choosing to externalize the poem. Escalation is one-step but palpable: silence → written poem delivered. Cost is social exposure plus alliance with ex-censor, visible on page. Coincidence (timer ding = door) complicates, does not save. Under causal lens, pressure tightens once yet adequately; meets 8-band though not multi-turn.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—decode before duel or lose philosophical destiny—is signaled by line 3. Escalation: each decoded angle narrows the possible terms of engagement until the scroll forces collaboration; the cost is the forfeiture of solo triumph. Agency sits with Kaelen: he chooses to insert the needle, to offer the scroll, to disarm with revelation rather than force. Price is paid on-page: rivalry dissolved, public identity as duelist redefined.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—seed a “blooming resistance” through salvaged books—arrives early and remains abstract; no external antagonist or time-bound jeopardy materializes. Agency is limited to slow cataloguing; no tactical adaptation or forfeiture is forced upon them within the night. Pressure plateaus rather than tightens; the moon’s arc supplies texture, not a deadline that prunes choices. Consequently, the cost (fatigue, risk of discovery) is stated lyrically but never crystallizes into a visible trade-off that alters next moves.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—surprise fate before night falls—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens with every compass flare. The single meaningful turn occurs when the film-door opens, foreclosing the arbor and narrowing options to monochrome endurance. Cost is visible: color, sound, and future are relinquished. Agency is causal under the lens; no coincidence resolves the storm—the encore itself calms it.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—save cultural memory before monsoon—is signaled early; the ticking clock tightens urgency, yet escalation is atmospheric (clouds gather) rather than decision-based. Elara faces no live fork; dream instruction collapses options into single path. No visible price is exacted from her—failure risk is abstract, never dramatized on page. Pressure accumulates, but agency stays passive, so cost clarity remains low.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reconciling human emotion with cosmic indifference—is signaled early and deepens through Aris’s daily returns, each narrowing her attachment to drama. The tightening occurs when she shifts from seeing ruin to reading “a ledger of slow transformation.” Agency lies in attention and renunciation (not sweeping the speck), which forecloses a path of grief with quiet cost. Escalation is subtle but coherent under the Accumulative lens, though the pressure remains internal without external complication.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—uncovering why she was targeted—is signaled early and tightens when frost reveals the rival’s name, narrowing options from flight to focused creation. Pressure accumulates texturally rather than causally; coincidence (frost mirroring ledger) complicates but doesn’t resolve. Cost is conceptual (trauma, burned studio implied) but not viscerally felt in tactics—Elara suffers no tangible loss that alters her approach mid-scene. Agency lies in attention and reinterpretation, valid under Accumulative lens, yet escalation lacks a decisive trade-off or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—translating silence into music to rectify past failure—is clear from the outset and intensifies through Elara’s ritualized actions. The meaningful deepening occurs when memory (crash, screams) is converted into scarlet and azure on glass, narrowing her path to purification through creation. Cost is felt in the irreversible absence of sound and lives lost. Agency is consistent: each strike of the fork is a micro-choice that reconfigures grief.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—giving rest a permanent address—tightens when the lens reveals its true function, forcing Elijah to choose between surface retirement and deep repair. His agency drives escalation: reading texts, dreaming method, arranging prisms. Cost is felt in physical toll and emotional burden of ancestral cries. Coincidence (mysterious package) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems solely from his stubborn persistence. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—intergenerational survival under sanctions—is signaled early and deepens when Elara declares future-building, narrowing options from passive endurance to active creation. Agency is clear: her decision reconfigures community purpose. Cost is felt in gaunt faces and rationed hope, though not tied to a specific sacrifice post-declaration. Escalation follows Accumulative logic: density of shared acts intensifies until stance crystallizes. Coincidence (anonymous aid) complicates but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when breath reveals hidden strands, forcing active release. Agency is clear: Elara chooses to channel the tear’s power, with each spark carrying emotional cost (healing herself by freeing others’ love). Escalation follows Accumulative logic: breath rhythm deepens, strands multiply, self-healing intensifies. Yet the opposition is abstract—no external pressure or trade-off beyond internal yearning—so stakes remain viscerally felt but lack interpersonal or material friction that would heighten cost under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—freedom from retrocognitive entrapment—is clear early and escalates through Elara’s active intervention (adjusting hyperbolic folds). The meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes time is fractal, shifting tactics from observation to geometric reconfiguration. Cost is visible: fading photographs vanish, representing lost memory. However, the escalation relies heavily on internal realization rather than external pressure, and the “disintegration” action resolves cleanly without lingering consequence, softening the felt price slightly below 9+ threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—to plant resilience—is signaled early but never truly tested; opposition is minimal (one easily tripped guard) and the wall’s collapse removes external pressure rather than intensifying it. The “impeding” force lacks credibility or adaptation, reducing conflict to a perfunctory obstacle. Escalation hinges on external events (wall falling, compartment clicking open), not protagonist-driven deepening or trade-offs. No visible price is paid—seeds are gathered effortlessly, chains loosen magically.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—capturing the sound of trust breaking—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes it’s not a single crack but a cascade. Her agency drives escalation: she refines her method from collecting voids to harvesting potentials. Cost is visible in her trembling hands and blurred colors. However, external pressure remains atmospheric (shipwrecks groan, aurora screams) rather than interactive, slightly muting the stakes’ visceral immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—stealing a glimpse of destiny—is signaled early and tightens when black orchids reveal a trap, forcing reinterpretation under duress. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to proceed despite danger, then repurposes moonbeams for escape. Cost is legible in the nearly empty jar and her “luminous disbelief”—a conceptual price for proximity to fate. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—crafting safe zones for fragile inquiry—is clear early and deepens as Elara confronts her own frozen grief. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses the flawed sphere over perfection, accepting imperfection as necessary. Agency is present: her narration, tool selection, and decision to leave her old studio drive escalation. Cost is felt (abandoning stability), though the external pressure (thaw making structure unsafe) borders on convenient rather than protagonist-driven complication.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—proving vulnerability is power—is signaled early and deepens when Leo realizes Silas weaponized his phobias. The tightening occurs in decryption: what seemed a trap becomes a stage. Cost is felt in Leo’s trembling certainty and the irreversible loss of paternal trust. Agency is clear—Leo chooses openness over stealth—but the escalation leans slightly on intellectual insight over physical or emotional trial under the clock tower.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—drawing a map of endless night—is signaled early and deepens through accumulated silence. Pressure escalates via sensory density (marbled hush thickening, star pulsing) under an Accumulative lens, not causality. Yet the Oracle faces no meaningful opposition or trade-off; her obsession incurs weariness but no foreclosed path or tactical shift. The stakes remain internal and untested, limiting escalation despite beautiful rendering.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding consciousness—is signaled early and deepens through J-7’s nightly experiments. The meaningful tightening occurs when it chooses to play the violin despite fragility, risking dissolution to unify timelines. Agency is clear: amalgamation is an active, dangerous choice, not passive revelation. Cost is felt in the cold’s intensification and implied vulnerability, though the absence of external opposition slightly limits pressure escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring trust through transparency—is signaled early and tightens when Elara realizes the doodles implicate a trusted colleague. Her agency drives escalation: examining tickets, projecting images, arranging public display. The cost is felt in social isolation and emotional labor, crystallizing when Marco admits guilt. Coincidence (his arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from Elara’s persistent transparency, which forces honest confrontation under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—proving gardens respond to care, not luck—is declared early but never tested under real pressure. No meaningful tightening occurs: the “deception” is mended through ritual, not conflict. Agency is passive commemoration, not decision or renunciation with cost. Luck-measuring devices flicker, but this coincidence resolves nothing; Elara’s methods “never fail,” removing stakes. The absence of opposition or consequence flattens escalation; pressure accumulates texturally but never crystallizes into a live dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—validating a radical theory before natural disruption—tightens coherently under Accumulative pressure. The Mothraals’ impending awakening creates a visceral deadline, and Kael’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to act now, pulling the lever despite risk. Cost is subtle but present: this moment is irreplaceable, and failure would mean lost opportunity, not just personal disappointment. However, the stakes lack tangible consequence beyond intellectual validation—no career, safety, or relationship is visibly jeopardized, slightly muting the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—unraveling the ghost’s code—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes the flood itself is part of the composition. Escalation is driven by her agency: interpreting stains, humming the phrase, slapping water. The cost is conceptual (disrupting eternal waiting) and emotional (bearing witness to sorrow), made unmistakable in the ghost’s fading smile and steadied lanterns.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reconciling data with intuition—is signaled early and tightens when erratic sensors force Elara to confront her buried truth. Her agency drives escalation: unpining the illustration, noticing the insect, smudging the screen—all deepen her understanding. Cost is felt in the “sorrowful glow” and relinquished certainty, though the stakes remain internal without tangible consequence beyond predictive accuracy. Still, under an Accumulative lens, the deepening is sufficient and protagonist-led.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—unearthing the “weight of a swallowed truth”—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the radio caller confesses. This escalation is driven by protagonist agency: Kaelen’s choice to use the radio as interpretive tool leads directly to revelation. Cost is unmistakable: the burden of collective guilt becomes tangible, altering his posture and perception by story’s end.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving inner equilibrium amid external decay—is signaled early and deepens when the keeper seeks the refuge. The meaningful tightening occurs in the act of burrowing via the swan, which narrows options to one fragile method of renewal. Cost is conceptual but felt: the keeper must release grip on tangible reality, accepting impermanence as truth. Agency lies in attention and endurance, not action, which aligns with the Accumulative lens. No false resolutions; pressure coheres throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—nurturing lifelong wonder—is declared early but never tested by tangible opposition. Elara faces no meaningful obstacle; Leo’s withdrawal is resolved through gentle exposure, not conflict. The eclipse complicates nothing—it’s a celestial coincidence, not a crucible. No trade-off, loss, or renunciation occurs; the “link” forms effortlessly, draining tension. Agency is present but unchallenged, rendering escalation atmospheric rather than consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring lost consciousness through wall-echoes—is signaled early and deepens via diary cross-referencing and tapestry decoding. Escalation is driven by Elian’s agency: each probe yields tighter knowledge (dragons = celestial forces; axis shift = dream-severance). Cost is conceptual yet legible: unity shattered, dreams silenced forever. The final hum doesn’t reverse loss but transmutes it into preservation—a resonant trade-off under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.3)
    Dominant stake (“escape routine” / “clear name”) is signaled early but never tested under coherent pressure. Escalation is passive: Elara “orchestrates” via cookies, Leo “finds” one—no meaningful tightening narrows options. Coincidence resolves everything (microdot in fortune, Leo’s decoding skill). No credible loss or trade-off alters tactics; stakes remain abstract (“open secrets”) without visceral consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preventing possession by exposing its flawed logic—is signaled early and tightens through rhetorical escalation (“conqueror or refugee?” → “what is your substance?”). Father Elian’s agency drives each deepening; coincidence plays no role. Cost is conceptual (the drained ultramarine, spent silence) but not visceral—no physical, temporal, or relational loss grounds the victory. Still, the single meaningful tightening (the final paradox) forecloses the entity’s existence with elegant causality under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—completing the symphony before dawn-induced exhaustion—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist-driven deepening: each recalled memory adds a layer to her composition, tightening the window for completion. The cost is unmistakable: physical fatigue (“eyelids grew heavy”) and emotional vulnerability (mapping heartbreak as dissonance). Elara’s agency drives escalation—she chooses which memories to transpose, how to weave them—and the final act crystallizes her stance as conductor. Coincidence never resolves tension; even the lake’s groan is integrated as musical material.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—conquering the labyrinth of self—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Kaelen rejects the eternally young self, foreclosing escape. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each rune activation deepens knowledge and narrows options, culminating in the central platform convergence. Cost is unmistakable (“each integration felt like a part of him dying”), though the “procedural generation” method slightly mutes causal clarity by leaning on arcane abstraction rather than character-bound mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—defeating numbness through reconnection to music—is signaled early and deepens via the backward-play method, which narrows Elara’s options to tactile interpretation. Agency is clear: she chooses to slot the broken needle, initiating the climax. Cost is felt in her emotional vulnerability (“tears welled”) and irreversible shift in identity. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; Kael’s suggestion merely enables her own decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. institutional lies—is signaled early via falsified quarantine reports. Pressure tightens when the pigeon message confirms suspicions, forcing Elara to choose between safety and integrity. The meaningful deepening occurs when she invites the stranger in, foreclosing pure solitude. However, the antagonist (rogue zone) remains off-stage; stakes feel abstract until the woman’s arrival, diluting immediate physical or social cost during the critical decision window.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding scent-triggered tears—is signaled early and deepens when the vial’s aroma unlocks ancestral memory via the blossom. The tightening occurs when UV light forces confrontation: she must choose to uncork the vial despite her caution. Cost is felt (grief) and visible (tears activating pollen). Agency drives escalation; coincidence (the client’s vial matching her past) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the insight comes from her action.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—discovering time’s texture—intensifies into an impossible ethical tradeoff: preserve self-history or free sentient beings. Pressure escalates via the energy beings’ distress, forcing a deepening that narrows options to two stark paths. Elian’s agency drives the turn: he *chooses* to weave, channeling memory into rope. Cost is unmistakable: “unraveling the memories held within the rope.” Coincidence never resolves; pain is dramatized, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reviving meaning amid silence—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s agency: she chooses to build the fire, play the violin, and unbind echoes. The meaningful tightening occurs when echoes stir in the bowl near flames, forcing her to weave sound into story—a trade-off between private mourning and communal ritual reborn. Cost is felt: she endures solitude to transform it. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; every escalation stems from her actions under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—authenticity vs. fabrication—is signaled early and deepens when counterfeit joy clashes with real sorrow. Yet escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency: the “transformation” is triggered passively by environmental static, not a choice under pressure. Cost is felt (loss of old identity) but not dramatized as a trade-off; she simply realizes deception was hollow. Under an Accumulative lens, one intensification suffices, but the absence of a narrowed option or tactical shift limits stakes’ visceral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake (“uplift silent contributors”) is declared but never tested under real opposition—no trade-offs, losses, or tactical shifts arise. Elara faces zero resistance; recognition flows effortlessly. Coincidence (envelope error) drives plot, not agency. No visible price is paid: time, reputation, or resources remain untouched, flattening escalation under any drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—belonging through contribution—is signaled early and deepens as Elara offers guidance and stories. Pressure accumulates via daily pilgrimage and vulnerability, but the escalation lacks a decisive narrowing of options; the group never faces real failure or doubt that tests Elara’s resolve. The cost of her isolation is felt emotionally but not dramatized as a tangible loss (e.g., time, energy, rejection). Agency is present but softened by communal harmony.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—freeing echoes by borrowing time—is signaled early and tightens when the giant’s snore becomes a timer. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she actively sculpts time, incurs cost (aging), and unleashes the key. The “interrupted cadence” raises pressure credibly, though the giant’s role borders on coincidental complication rather than active opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—decoding grief to resolve ambiguous loss—is signaled early and deepens when the glass eyes project Lyra’s face, forcing Elian to confront integration over solution. This tightening narrows his options: he can no longer treat emotion as a solvable equation. Cost is conceptual but legible: he relinquishes control for curiosity. Agency drives escalation—he adjusts eyes, activates feedback loop—and the dovetail action crystallizes his stance without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preserving community wisdom during crisis—is signaled early and deepens with the outage. Yet escalation is passive: the flickering lights complicate but don’t force new tactics; Kaelen follows a pre-set plan. Agency lies in retrieval and broadcast, but no live option is foreclosed or trade-off dramatized. Cost is conceptual (remaining unseen), but not felt as loss in the moment—only as quiet fulfillment.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether to impose control or yield to natural resilience—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Elara releases the leaf. Protagonist agency drives escalation: each storm forces recalibration, culminating in her choice to observe rather than bind. Cost is legible in lost certainty and abandoned methods. Coincidence never resolves; pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—transforming loss into meaning—is signaled early and deepens when the brooch becomes a bridge, not just an artifact. The tightening occurs at the exchange: Kaelen trades a painting for a story, foreclosing further isolation. Cost is felt (shared vulnerability) and visible (giving away art). However, escalation leans slightly on coincidence (Elara’s timely appearance); while rain guides Kaelen, her emergence lacks causal linkage to his prior choices, softening agency just before climax.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—magnifying everyday magic—is signaled early and tightens when the pearl requires balance, then deepens as shadows manifest chaotic beauty. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her memory choice triggers the downpour, altering reality. Cost is legible—Kaelen relinquishes control, Elara surrenders ordinary life—but the “steadily unpredictable” forces resolve too harmoniously, softening potential chaos into wonder without tangible trade-off beyond abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—compiling fragments to heal communal fracture—is signaled early and deepens via the logbook discovery. Yet escalation relies heavily on Elara’s solitary research; the community’s “wary eyes” exert passive pressure but no active opposition or complication. The “staggered intervals” method shapes pacing but not meaningful risk—no resource depletion, social backlash, or failed attempts raise stakes. Final cost is conceptual (years of silence), not viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding the fortress of unspoken truths—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when arrows converge at a dead end, forcing reliance on the punch. Agency is maintained: Elara decodes, dares, thrusts. Cost is felt in the “frozen tears” of past seekers and her own transformed habits. However, escalation leans slightly on atmospheric accumulation over causal narrowing; the dead end feels more mystical than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—sculpting reflective space for weary villagers—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes the symphony is collective memory. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: tracing symbols unlocks visions, which fuels transcription. Cost is conceptual (abandoning pure skepticism) and social (risking ridicule), though not viscerally dramatized. The tightening—working before migration peaks—adds urgency but lacks concrete consequence if missed; stakes remain abstract rather than viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—discovering what follows finality—is signaled immediately and tightens when the amulet’s will is revealed, transforming discovery into battle. Kaelen’s agency drives escalation: he positions the fragment, channels magnetic fields, fights the vortex. Cost is visible: the escondite’s destruction, the amulet’s disappearance, and the haunting “hushed thunder” in his soul. Coincidence (solar storm) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the mutiny stems from his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—delivering proof for asylum without compromising honesty—is signaled early and tightens when Leo abandons physical breach for psychological one. The meaningful deepening occurs when he realizes fairness isn’t equal exchange but transformation of loss into hope, altering tactics entirely. Cost is legible: emotional labor, risk of failure, and the irreversible use of the ink pot. Escalation is driven by Leo’s agency, not coincidence—the chief’s arrival is routine, not contrived.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving ephemeral temporal textures—is clear from the outset and tightens at dawn when the hum shifts, forcing Elian’s final notation before the frequency stabilizes. His agency lies in attention and transcription, not dramatic choice, but under an Accumulative lens, this suffices. The cost is conceptual: his labor yields unsellable, unseen manuscripts, a life of quiet erasure. While pressure coheres beautifully, the escalation lacks a tangible trade-off or loss beyond implied isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering a stolen past—is signaled early and deepens through the protagonist’s active layering of fragments, narrowing from vague collection to targeted hunting after the arsenic label discovery. Escalation is driven by his agency: each overheard story alters tactics, culminating in the high-tide eavesdropping that delivers his name and confirms conspiracy. Cost is unmistakable—the bitter taste of betrayal and poison—and forecloses ignorance. Coincidence (overhearing officials) complicates but doesn’t resolve; his prior work makes him ready to interpret it.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—decoding the universal riddle—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes it’s about questions, not answers. Agency emerges through her choice to retell, not solve, which narrows her path to acceptance. Cost is legible: she relinquishes the quest, symbolized by setting down the compass. Escalation occurs via cello-triggered memories that force reinterpretation, though the pressure remains internal and accumulative rather than causally tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving communal soul amid privatization—is signaled early and tightens when Elara chooses covert reorganization over protest. Her dual allegiance deepens pressure: she believes in corporate sustainability but rejects erasure, forcing trade-offs (e.g., abstract art as cover). Cost is legible in “hopeful desperation” and the heavy stone chip. Escalation lacks a second meaningful turn, limiting to one tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving Cassini’s Tear before corporate mining—is signaled early and deepens via timed chemical reactions that narrow options as dawn approaches. Agency lies in attention and endurance; each vial shift forces micro-choices (e.g., noting azure hue). Cost is visible: the pristine crater’s obliteration is inevitable, making her documentation both futile and sacred. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restoring the drone to ensure the Aethel’s safe voyage—is signaled early and tightens when the anchor lifts. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her patching and testing are active choices under time pressure. Cost is felt conceptually (her unseen labor, the risk of failure), but not viscerally—no tool breaks, no misstep occurs. The stakes remain externalized; the personal cost of failure isn’t dramatized, limiting emotional escalation despite coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding where rivers begin—is signaled early and tightens when the falcon’s return fails to deliver expected convergence, raising the cost of failure (existential futility). Elias’s agency drives escalation: he deciphers, steps outside, follows implied patterns. The deepening occurs when condensation reveals tributary flows, narrowing options to one focal point. Cost is legible in his post-discovery unease—the truth is ephemeral, documentation may be futile. Coincidence (falcon’s token) complicates but doesn’t resolve; insight emerges from his persistent parsing.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring shared balance—is signaled early and deepens as vibrations stir ghostly inhabitants. Escalation occurs through Elian’s rhythmic adjustments and the fork’s resonance, culminating in a symphony that mends the town. Though agency is present, the conflict lacks oppositional pressure; the “collapse” is backstory, not active resistance, softening the cost despite the lyrical payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—harnessing the ephemeral before air runs out—is signaled early and tightens relentlessly via the blinking alarm and stiff mechanism. Kaelen’s agency drives escalation: overriding instinct enables the unsnarl, which opens the sanctum. Cost is legible in lost time and breath; the final choice to enter rather than flee crystallizes stance. Coincidence never resolves—only character action does.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—threading truth before discovery—tightens credibly as shouts echo closer. Kaelen’s agency drives escalation: each whispered confession alters the labyrinth, culminating in the hidden shaft reveal. The cost is conceptual (sustained impossibilities wane) and tactical (bodies found), though the warden’s off-page threat slightly softens immediacy. Coincidence complicates (storm-killed guards) but doesn’t resolve; victory stems from Kaelen’s narrative offering.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—repaying the debt—is signaled early and tightens as visits grow frequent “as if time was running out.” The escalation culminates in the bead’s transfer, which forecloses the ghost’s existence with visible cost (her fading). Pressure remains coherent under an Accumulative lens: each cameo deepens emotional stakes without external antagonism. Yet the protagonist’s agency is passive until the final touch; prior beats show observation, not tactical adaptation, slightly muting the escalation’s force.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—carving a path from ruin to reverence—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s deliberate sewing. Pressure escalates texturally: from walking paths to kneeling in rubble, culminating in the final stitch. Cost is conceptual (mending broken precedents) and felt (haunting optimism as fragile fuel). Yet the conflict lacks opposition; the labyrinth “accepts” her, softening tension. Agency is clear but untested by resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—restoring lost faith through reconnection—is signaled early and deepens as Elara unearths personal relics that personalize ancestral loss. Escalation occurs when the sundial’s shadow redirects her labor, transforming wandering into targeted ritual. Agency is clear: she chooses to rebuild, to read aloud, to leave carrying scrolls. Cost is conceptual (the burden of memory) rather than material, but it’s legible in the bones’ “sigh” and the orchard’s shift from death to “eternal return.”

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—safe passage of a high-risk letter—is signaled early and deepens when Elara suspects Orion’s identity is compromised. Pressure tightens through her decoding process, culminating in wax-sealed dispatch. However, escalation is internal and observational; no external obstacle or tactical shift occurs beyond verification steps. Cost is implied (risk of interception) but never dramatized or paid, weakening visceral stakes under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preventing the coup—is signaled early and tightens via Elara’s embroidery breakthroughs. Agency is clear: her navigation of “adjacent possibilities” deepens knowledge, forcing tactical shifts. The guard’s appearance escalates pressure coherently, not coincidentally. Cost is felt in lost cover and urgency, though the coup’s mechanics remain abstract—stakes could be more viscerally grounded in kingdom consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—resolving Kaelen’s silence—is signaled early and tightens when messages reveal his fear (“loved you too much”), forcing Elara to confront her own imprisonment. Agency is clear: her evocations deepen knowledge, narrowing options until the final choice. Cost is felt (“unsent letters... weight she carried”) and crystallizes in closure. Minor deduction: spirits’ guidance occasionally borders on deus ex machina, though their dirge-to-peace arc mitigates this.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—translating unspoken trauma into healing connection—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s decryption work. The tightening occurs when she interprets the final symbol (“two figures holding hands”), which crystallizes her realization that understanding is action. Cost is legible: old wounds remain but are “intertwined with new meaning.” Agency is internal yet consequential under an Accumulative lens, though the anesthetic slightly buffers tangible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering joy through communal memory—is signaled early and tightens when the fragment projects the phantom orchard, narrowing her path from passive tracing to active display. Cost is felt: the joy is fleeting, images fade, yet she accepts this impermanence. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves her arc—she channels memory into light despite the fog’s return.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—certainty versus curiosity—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s escalating experiments (prying, tapping, chanting). Agency drives escalation: each action triggers a new awakening, narrowing her path back to mere restoration. The cost—loss of control, surrender of expertise—is felt when the mural heals itself without her. Coincidence never resolves; the garden responds only to her choices. One tightening suffices, but the pressure could feel more urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving unlicensed thought—is signaled immediately and tightens when enforcers scan gardens, threatening the club’s communication method. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to reinforce the signal despite reality-warping risk. The cost is conceptual but legible: the constant threat of memory erasure and the fragility of their resistance. Coincidence complicates (energy fluctuations) but doesn’t resolve; victory comes from coordinated action.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.3)
    Dominant stake—transforming pain into beauty—is declared but never tested by opposition; conflict is internalized abstraction without external pressure or trade-offs. The “blossom armistice” emerges deus ex machina via wind-borne news, not protagonist agency. No option is foreclosed; the poet merely persists until validation arrives. Coincidence resolves stakes (distant wars cease because of his songs), undercutting escalation under any drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—is signaled early and deepens when the chime’s crack threatens systemic collapse. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she recalls lore, retrieves the tablet, and enacts the song. The meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes only the lost melody can heal the fracture, narrowing options to a single, fragile solution. Cost is felt in the bittersweet aftermath—success reaffirms loss—but the price isn’t materially dramatized beyond emotion. Still, under an Accumulative lens, the cadence shift from stillness to song to restored hum reweights the stake with poetic clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—restoring trust before irreversible divergence—is signaled early and deepens through each promise, narrowing emotional options. Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency: each vow raises personal risk (e.g., forgiveness vow makes her hands tremble). Cost is unmistakable: years of silence, the peril of invoking ancient magic, and the near-loss of Kaelen. The live clock (dawn) tightens decisions, though the “paths diverge” threat remains abstract until Kaelen’s entrance.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving sacred utility—is signaled early and deepens when the hidden message reframes the floodgates as instruments of compassion. The meaningful tightening occurs when the amphitheater “resists her touch” violently, forcing Elara to choose between compliance and covert preservation. Her agency drives escalation: decoding leads to recalibration, which earns the building’s softened breath. Cost is visible in her shaking hands and the irreversible commitment to “slyly heartfelt” subterfuge.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving lost songs while learning to trust—is signaled early and tightens when Leo discovers the letter, forcing Elara to choose between continued self-invention or authenticity. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she shares the meteorite, admits her fabrications, and collaborates on decoding. Cost is legible in her emotional collapse and vulnerability, though the stakes remain somewhat internalized without tangible external risk. Coincidence (Leo seeking celestial navigation) introduces pressure but doesn’t resolve it—Elara’s choices do.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—understanding why thresholds feel sacred—is signaled early and tightens through Elara’s analysis of grain and logbook, culminating in her crossing the luminous doorframe. The escalation is driven by her agency (intuition, correlation, decision), and the cost is conceptual: the butterfly effect turned pauses into chasms, making transition perilous. However, the pressure remains abstract; there’s no visceral peril or tangible loss to ground the stakes beyond intellectual revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—finding belonging through cosmic resonance—is signaled early and deepens as bioluminescence mirrors celestial patterns. The tightening occurs when the feather links past failure to present hope, raising emotional stakes. Agency is subtle but present: Elara chooses to project constellations, explore the library, and interpret the fireflies as continuity with Aris. Cost is conceptual—accepting impermanence—but legible in her relinquishment of fixed place for relational rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—preserving paths before they vanish—is signaled early and deepens when Kaelen realizes paths disappear when emotions aren’t reinforced. The meaningful tightening occurs when he shifts from passive collection to active preservation, planting new memories. Cost is felt emotionally (“saddened by the inevitability of loss”) and conceptually (accepting some paths must vanish). Agency drives escalation: his conjectures and use of tools narrow options toward a resonant stance.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—transforming boredom into wonder—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s precise orchestration. The meaningful tightening occurs when late-night strollers pause, validating her method; this success affirms her path but exacts the cost of perpetual labor (she must return nightly). Agency is clear: every gust, petal, and balloon is her design. Though stakes remain internal, the price—endless vigilance against the mundane—is felt in her solitary walks and unshared calculations.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving forbidden memory through cosmic inscription—is signaled early and deepens via the moonstone’s irreversible anchoring. The tightening occurs when Elara commits to spontaneous anchoring, accepting agony and permanence. Cost is felt: collapse, breathlessness, and the weight of constellations. Yet escalation relies more on atmospheric intensification than protagonist-driven tactical shifts; the “gaps” are observed, not wrestled with, slightly muting agency under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving meaning amid imposed change—is signaled early and tightens when Elara enters the atrium seeking clarity before the dredge. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to cast the stone, initiating the ripple logic that reframes the dredging as natural propagation. Cost is conceptual (loss of familiar contours) but legible in her acceptance. However, the external pressure (dredging) remains off-stage; tighter integration of its threat would elevate this further.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—transforming personal grief into communal empathy—is signaled early and deepens through reflection. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elara recognizes her pain as “a thread in a larger tapestry,” shifting from isolation to connection. Cost is felt in the unhealed scars and lost life, though escalation relies on internal realization rather than external pressure. Under an Accumulative lens, this single deepening suffices, but agency remains contemplative rather than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (“revitalize fading hope across timelines”) is clear early and escalates through pattern refinement, not external threat. Each trial balloon deepens the challenge, narrowing viable responses until the pearl completes the sequence. Cost is felt implicitly—Elara’s labor is meticulous and solitary—but never made visceral or irreversible; the absence of tangible sacrifice (time, energy, personal loss) softens the stakes. Still, escalation is driven entirely by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—uncovering and bearing witness to erased legacy—is signaled early and tightens when Elara discovers the scientist’s guilt, transforming her mission from curiosity to custodianship. The meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the echoes are “embodied regrets,” raising emotional stakes. Cost is felt (“heaviness of their truth”) and visible in her altered path. Escalation stems from her agency—interpreting, choosing to preserve—not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—revealing possibilities before the bells—is signaled early and escalates through Lyra’s deepening song and focused intent. Agency lies in attention and ritual; each hum narrows the window while intensifying the mirrors’ response. Cost is conceptual: success is fleeting, visible only in the mirages’ brief hold before fading. The tightening is subtle but meaningful—the shift from trembling surfaces to a child laughing marks a decisive threshold crossed under pressure of time.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—forging peace through personal sacrifice—is signaled early and tightens as the moons converge. The ritual deepens tension, but escalation hinges on celestial mechanics, not Elara’s agency. Her “operatively gentle” approach disarms hostility, yet we see no resistance overcome or tactical shift under pressure. Cost is felt (her life), but the price feels predetermined rather than wrested from meaningful opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving the echo of extinct birds—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s internal conflict between calculated ruthlessness and hidden sentiment. The tightening occurs when he chooses ritual over reason, foreclosing his emotional detachment at visible cost (“armor cracked”). Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory beat intensifies the weight of loss. Though the storm breaks coincidentally, it amplifies rather than resolves; the true resolution is Elias’s internal shift, earned by his action.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—defying the lullaby of conformity—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s harvest of echoes. Pressure escalates texturally: each untangled thread intensifies the chorus of defiance. The cost is conceptual (loss of safety in submission) and legible in the “cascade of light” that unravels obedience. Yet the escalation remains internal and symbolic; no external consequence or irreversible forfeiture grounds the risk, slightly muting the stakes’ visceral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—ethical storytelling under commercial pressure—is signaled early and deepens when Elara shifts from defiance to redemption-focused narrative. This reversal narrows her tactical options (abandoning pure provocation) and carries conceptual cost: she risks diluting her message to appease Marco. Yet the escalation lacks visceral pressure; Marco exists only in memory, so the conflict remains internalized without external consequence. The cost is plausible but not dramatized—no loss of income, audience, or artistic integrity is shown.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—honoring vanishing histories—is signaled early and deepens through the monarch’s arrival. Pressure tightens via time (migration window) and fragility (wing, arch). Elian’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to build, knot, witness, and release. Cost is felt in the “ache” of finality and the irreversible departure. Coincidence (butterfly entering grotto) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the ritual’s meaning hinges on his prior action. No second reversal needed at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving sound—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s rewiring of braids, which narrows options: success requires precise alignment with the card’s code. Agency drives escalation; each braid untwisted sharpens whispers into names. Cost is visible: the card disintegrates, and her past silence is replaced by present responsibility. Pressure tightens coherently under the Accumulative lens without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—discovering why paths choose walkers—is signaled early and tightens as the storm approaches, forcing a deadline on interpretation. The decaying directive’s erosion raises emotional stakes, culminating in its collapse when purpose is served. Agency is clear: Foresight Hindsight only’s dream-interpretation drives the breakthrough, not coincidence. Cost is legible—the loss of identity as “keeper”—though the escalation leans more on atmospheric intensification than tactical trade-offs, slightly muting pressure under a purely causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—harmonizing political chaos with cosmic order—is signaled early and tightens when the tile glows, forcing Aris to choose between empiricism and faith. The deepening occurs at the voice’s question, raising the cost from intellectual risk to existential vulnerability. Agency drives escalation: his adjustment of the tile precipitates revelation. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the covenant emerges from his methodical tracing of encrypted paths.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are declared (“world tearing apart”) but never tested concretely; Kael’s resentment has no demonstrated external consequence. Escalation is absent—pressure remains static until a deus ex machina memory appears. Elara’s “convince” action lacks agency-driven turns; she presents an object and Kael capitulates. No visible cost or trade-off emerges: forgiveness arrives without sacrifice, making the dominant stake feel rhetorical rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—capturing the runaway dream—is signaled early and tightens when the dream nearly slips away, forcing the risky ritual. Agency is clear: synchronized breathing and mirror-crafting are active choices, not luck. Cost is felt: the dream world recedes permanently; only a reflection remains. Escalation follows Accumulative logic—pressure intensifies via breath rhythm and light-play, not causal reversals—and aligns with the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reuniting with Lyra through generational craft—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes she must listen, not impose. The tightening occurs when she abandons Guild rigidity for “deciduous” flexibility, foreclosing her old identity. Cost is felt in exile, aging hands, and weeks of tending alone. Though Lyra’s return hinges on finding the box—a minor coincidence—it complicates rather than resolves; the real resolution is Elara’s changed stance.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—access to forbidden knowledge—is signaled immediately and deepens through Elara’s escalating demands (“Show me what was forbidden”). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: each inquiry intensifies the cost (risk of unraveling her mind), culminating in the choice to stop pursuing. The tightening occurs at the oldest tree, where vision reveals the civilization’s secret, forcing her to weigh self-preservation against understanding. Cost is unmistakable: she endures the gap in time, accepting ignorance as part of curation.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preventing timeline collapse via unlearned lessons—is signaled early and deepens when the mission shifts from rescue to confrontation. Elara’s agency drives escalation: researching gaps, pausing for alignment, speaking ancient tongue. Cost is legible: Kael must face his avoided error; Elara accepts solitude. Coincidence never resolves—only complicates (portal arrival). One tightening suffices, but the moral calculus sharpens stakes credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—finding the garden to reclaim identity—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes the garden is internal. The meaningful turn occurs when memories “alter around her,” forcing her to abandon literal search for narrative synthesis. Cost is felt: she accepts her chimera nature, losing the dream of reunion but gaining selfhood. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (weaving threads, focusing on discovery memory), though external pressure remains low, fitting the Situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—stabilizing the rift before it unravels memory—is signaled early and tightens when the blurred space threatens coherence. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to press the seal, re-braid the rope, merge absence with presence. Cost is visible in the rope’s exhaustion and the ghost’s release, though the pressure lacks a visceral near-failure (e.g., gear jam, rope snap). Coincidence doesn’t resolve; every turn stems from her method.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—finding quiet within dissonance—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s realization that suppression won’t work; integration will. This shift narrows her options and forces a riskier, more nuanced approach. The energy beings’ presence tightens pressure, and her conjuring exacts physical toll (exhaustion, kneeling). However, escalation leans slightly on atmospheric intensification rather than protagonist-driven tactical pivots; the beings calm reactively, not due to a hard-won choice with irreversible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rekindling the beacon to restore connection—is signaled early and tightens when the “shard of hush” threatens to extinguish hope at climax. Agency is clear: Elara’s alignment choices, guided by retrocognition, drive escalation. Coincidence (Vega’s zenith) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her preparation makes convergence meaningful. Cost is felt in the near-failure moment, though the price paid (years of labor, isolation) is implied more than dramatized in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—forging identity amid temporal collapse—is signaled early and tightens through the archivist’s methodical examination of monuments, each shadow measurement narrowing his understanding. His agency drives escalation: conjecture isn’t passive musing but an active, costly stance that risks emotional overload (preemptive nostalgia as burden). The cost becomes legible when he accepts the hush as companion—a renunciation of resistance with tangible emotional consequence. Coincidence never resolves; pressure accumulates texturally until the fog itself shimmers in response to his earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—defying hopelessness—is signaled early and deepens through Elian’s alchemical “filtering” of despair into firework energy. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: his chant shifts, he ignites the rag, and interprets the mosaic, culminating in the gunpowder-triggered symphony. Cost is legible in the ash of the rag and the fleeting nature of the display—hope is momentary, not permanent. However, the pre-laid gunpowder borders on coincidence; had it been woven earlier as a tactile choice (e.g., shown planting it mid-scene), pressure would feel more earned.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—whether to leave the coast—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s tangential observation, which narrows options by reframing departure as metamorphosis. The meaningful tightening occurs when she interprets the hermit crab’s shell swap as mirror to Kael’s fear, shifting from avoidance to empathetic clarity. Cost is conceptual (abandoning certainty for cyclical faith) and felt in Kael’s murmured “You think we have to let go.” Escalation stems from protagonist agency, though external pressure from Kael remains passive, limiting tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—escaping claustrophobia via the gilded hush—is signaled early and tightens when inversion begins, forcing Elara to risk agoraphobia for peace. Her agency is clear: she chooses ascent, manages exposure, and returns deliberately. The cost (enduring the bunker’s “prison” longer) is felt in the descent and crystallized in the final image. Escalation follows the Accumulative lens: silences accumulate until the gilded hush reweights all prior experience.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—"to teach silence how to comfort"—is signaled early and sustained, but pressure remains static rather than escalating. Elara’s humming initiates a "transformation," yet no opposition, obstacle, or trade-off tests her commitment. The train whistle’s echo provides temporal framing but not rising tension. Agency is present (she chooses to hum, ceases it, steers course), but without meaningful risk or consequence. The deepening is thematic, not dramatic; stakes stay abstract, lacking visceral urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—claiming the throne before sunrise—is signaled early and tightens via time pressure. However, escalation is procedural, not costly: each obstacle yields instantly to the ruby or prior knowledge. No option is foreclosed; no trade-off occurs. The “final puzzle” is solved by peeling more paint, replicating the earlier method without deepening difficulty. Agency exists but faces no resistance that forces adaptation or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether solitude can coexist with connection—is signaled early and deepens when the encroachment arrives “through scars.” The keeper’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to hover near the ring, then invite the other in. Cost is felt (“scars tingled,” release of control), but the tightening lacks a foreclosed path—his world expands without loss, softening the price. Still, pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—translating psychological pressure into tangible value—is signaled early and tightens when the lab harnesses the farm’s energy, making conceptual confinement physically oppressive. Leo’s virtuous mischief becomes agency: he doesn’t resist pressure but channels it through the bolt, narrowing options to one crystalline act. Cost is unmistakable—the bolt (his tether to survival) is consumed to create the diamond. Escalation is driven by protagonist choice under Accumulative/Textural pressure, though the third text message arrives slightly conveniently.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes are abstract (“hidden truth,” “manipulation”) and never tested against concrete opposition or trade-offs. The “conspiracy” emerges via musical intuition, not escalating pressure or tactical adaptation. No option is foreclosed; the protagonist simply changes his mind. Under an Accumulative lens, there’s no cadence shift or density increase—just repetitive assertions of revelation. Cost is absent: he walks out unburdened, with no loss of status, safety, or certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—capturing possibility—is signaled early and tightens when Alaric uses the program’s patterns, narrowing his options to ritual enactment. Escalation is driven by his agency: tracing symbols, chanting, visualizing strings. The cost is unmistakable—the program crumbles, his past dissolves—and alters his identity permanently. Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening comes via pattern intensification (“murmured allegiance” becoming chant), not causal turns, which fits the design.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—magnifying small kindnesses against institutional neglect—is signaled early and deepens when Elara chooses to pursue Jonah’s story. The meaningful tightening occurs when she shifts from passive archivist to active researcher, cross-referencing veteran records. Cost is felt: her emotional labor reopens her own wound but yields fragile hope. Escalation is driven by her agency, though the discovery of Jonah’s teaching career feels slightly convenient, softening the price.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—combating historical erasure—is declared but never concretely tested or narrowed. When “plans unravel,” no specific loss or trade-off forces adaptation; instead, magic intervenes via the lagoon. Agency is passive: Kael “notices” a map, “inserts” a key, and receives truth without struggle. The tyranny of indifference remains abstract; citizens’ apathy isn’t dramatized, so its disruption lacks tension. No visible price is paid—Kael emerges empowered, not diminished.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—silencing a chaos-inducing prophecy—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates texturally via flickering light, swirling mist, and deepening hush, but lacks a meaningful turn that narrows options or forces trade-offs. Elias’s method never changes under duress; he simply plays longer pauses. Cost is felt (relief mixed with sorrow) but not dramatized as a forfeiture that alters future tactics. Coincidence doesn’t resolve, yet agency feels reactive, not decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—decoding the prophecy—is signaled early and deepens into communal renewal. Yet escalation is passive: the moonstone speck appears by chance, and transformation follows automatically without Elara overcoming opposition or making a costly choice. The “hush” frames time poetically but doesn’t tighten decisions. Cost is implied (solitude lost, identity altered) but never felt in action—no tool is sacrificed, no relationship strained, no option foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—befriending uncertainty—is signaled early and deepens when Elara abandons maps for intuition. The tightening occurs at the greenhouse: finding the key commits her to improvisation. Cost is felt in the loss of her former rigidity, though it’s conceptual rather than material. Agency drives escalation—she chooses to enter the cave, dig through ash, follow the compass—yet coincidence (sailor’s ramble, sketch in clock) initiates the quest, slightly undercutting pure protagonism. Still, once engaged, her decisions narrow options credibly under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—redeeming failure through understanding—is signaled early and deepens when Elara risks the coin’s integrity. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to fracture it, then mend it, foreclosing the original goal (finding Lysander) in favor of meaning-making. Cost is unmistakable: the artifact’s breakage and her luminous regret. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves conflict—only her deliberate, costly acts.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—freeing Lyra through laughter—is signaled early but never truly contested; no obstacle arises beyond initial silence. Elara faces no resistance, trade-off, or risk; her method works exactly as intended. The “tightening” is merely procedural (pluck harp → trace symbol → request joy), with no escalation or deepening that alters tactics or narrows options under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—proving mercy is quantifiable—is signaled early and deepens through embodied pressure: each bracing ritual tightens focus on the central question. The discovery of the strap isn’t luck but a data point that forces conceptual reconfiguration. While escalation is internal, it’s coherent under an Accumulative lens; however, the absence of external opposition slightly limits tactical cost beyond psychological endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—recovering erased histories—is signaled early and deepens when Elara recognizes the fracture pattern, triggering the vision. The tightening is meaningful: her intuitive method succeeds, but the cost is implicit in the weight of responsibility (“fragment rested heavy in her pocket”). Agency drives escalation—she actively “unfastens” the memory—but the conflict lacks opposition; stakes remain internalized without external resistance or tangible loss beyond emotional burden.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—uncovering truth to grant peace—is signaled early and tightens when Leo chooses to engage rather than repair and leave. His agency drives escalation: analyzing dust leads to the compartment, which summons the ghost, which points to the ceiling, which yields ledgers. Cost is felt (emotional weight, time, commitment) but remains abstract; no tangible sacrifice (e.g., missed job, damaged tool) grounds the price. Still, pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—compressing eternity—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Elara deciphers the frost pattern and sets type. The rupture deepens stakes by collapsing all timelines, forcing a trade-off: achieve her goal at the cost of the library’s stability. Pressure escalates organically under the Accumulative lens, with rustling awakenings intensifying into a roar. Cost is unmistakable: “no system would ever be perfect again.”

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming silenced poetic truth—is signaled early and tightens when Kael dismisses Elara, forcing her to risk credibility with her mirror experiment. The storm escalation is driven by her agency, not coincidence, and culminates in a deepening that changes knowledge: the ancients were artists, not warriors or priests. Cost is felt conceptually (her revolution’s failure) and professionally (facing scholarly scorn), though physical or social price remains implied rather than enacted. One meaningful tightening suffices, and it narrows her path to poetic witness over political action.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming stolen light—is signaled early and tightens when the townsman’s lie triggers decay, forcing Elian to act. The covenant of rust creates coherent pressure: truth preserves, lies corrode. Elian’s agency drives resolution—he speaks gently, elicits confession, renews focus—but the escalation hinges on another’s choice, slightly diluting protagonist-driven pressure. Cost is felt (wilting gears, fading light) and visible in the climax, satisfying lens-aligned escalation under Causal design.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding where explanations fail—is signaled early and tightens decisively at the lagoon: collecting gives way to surrender. Elara’s agency drives escalation (choosing descent, performing psychometry, kneeling but not sampling). Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits her vials, her tool, and her methodology. Under Accumulative pressure, each beat deepens the central tension between capture and presence.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding direction when external guides fail—is signaled early and tightens when the slide projects ancestral crises. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to follow the ghosts’ gestures, transforming chaos into form. Cost is visible in her abandonment of GPS reliance, though the ghosts’ aid slightly softens struggle. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—understanding nocturnal blooming—is signaled early and deepens via the cathedral’s hidden glass, which reweights knowledge. Yet escalation hinges on passive discovery, not protagonist-driven pressure; the “tightening” is perceptual, not tactical. Cost is emotional (loneliness, unanswered questions) but never material—no time lost, resources spent, or relationships strained. Under an Accumulative lens, this suffices, but agency remains observational rather than confrontational.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—uncovering unsanitized truth—is signaled early and deepens when Elara learns “some truths are too painful to bear.” Her agency drives escalation: arranging debris isn’t passive reception but active decryption. Cost is felt (“weight settled on her shoulders”) and conceptual (risking controversy). However, the conflict lacks a tangible opposing force; the woman from the mist applies thematic but not tactical pressure, softening the escalation’s bite.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—rebuilding civilization without magical dependency—is signaled early and deepens through Elian’s rejection of nostalgia and quick fixes. The meaningful tightening occurs when he shifts from passive memory to active creation, foreclosing reliance on wishes. Cost is felt in the slowness of revival and the unopened bottle, symbolizing patience over instant gratification. However, escalation is largely internal and accumulative rather than driven by external pressure or trade-offs, limiting visceral stakes despite thematic clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving emotional truth—tightens when the prophecy reframes Elian’s mission from documentation to potential warning. His agency lies in choosing to continue recording despite terror, a renunciation of innocence with clear cost: the “velvet disquiet” that shadows him. Escalation is driven by his immersion ritual, which inadvertently unlocks the garden’s voice, narrowing his future to a fraught duality: archivist or prophet? Coincidence (the device capturing more than sound) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the burden remains his to bear.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reopening the gateway before the vortex collapses—is signaled early and tightens at hatching. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she sows seeds, places the cap, channels energy. Cost is felt in the fading portal and the irreversible inheritance. However, entropy decrease feels more conceptual than tactical; the method lacks on-page struggle, slightly softening pressure despite strong thematic alignment.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—effective storm warning without unnecessary fear—is signaled early and tightens at the zero hour when Elara must choose between siren and bell. Her agency drives escalation: trusting her data over protocol narrows options irreversibly. The cost is conceptual (abandoning institutional orthodoxy) and social (risking villagers’ safety), made visible in their calm preparation. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; her method earns the outcome. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—finding strength in vulnerability—is signaled early but never tested under coherent pressure. The meteor shower intensifies observation, not conflict; Kael’s “pull to understand” leads to contemplation, not choice with consequence. No option is foreclosed, no trade-off made. The story deepens thematically but not narratively—the escalation is textual, not causal or situational, failing to narrow possibilities or impose cost under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving unspoken words—is signaled early and tightens when ghosts reveal the covenant’s decay. The protagonist’s agency lies in attention and recognition, culminating in opening the box, which forecloses ghostly limbo with conceptual cost: he becomes sole guardian forever. Pressure escalates texturally via accumulating clues (phantom hives, hums), not causal turns, fitting the Accumulative lens. However, escalation lacks a live trade-off; no option is actively refused, only accepted.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—understanding time’s texture—is signaled early and tightens when the urn fragment reveals a micro-engraved equation, transforming abstract yearning into concrete mission. The escalation hinges on Elara’s agency: her method of embedding messages draws Leo, making connection active, not passive. Cost is felt in the shift from isolation to shared purpose, though the stakes lack visceral peril. Coincidence (Leo recognizing the tag) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the real resolution stems from their joint interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—finding beauty in fragments—is signaled early and deepens when the kite falls, forcing the poet to act. His agency lies in reframing, not repairing, which narrows emotional options for the child and himself. Cost is legible: the child’s tears, the lost kite, the poet’s quiet labor of meaning-making. Escalation is subtle but coherent under an Accumulative lens, though the pressure lacks visceral urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—fostering interspecies respect—is signaled early and deepens via Elara’s systematic remodel, which narrows her options to time-bound, physical labor. Agency drives escalation: her choice to use copper/oak invites dialogue, altering the orchard’s dynamics. Cost is felt in her weakening body and six-month deadline, though the pressure remains internalized rather than externally contested. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the stag’s bow is a consequence, not a convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the chemistry of homecoming—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s pilgrimage. Agency is clear: her method (following footprints, placing amber) drives escalation. The tightening occurs when multiple trails converge, narrowing her path toward singular revelation. Cost is felt in her relinquished doubt, though the external pressure remains abstract rather than viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming a battlefield through gardening—is signaled early and deepens via the act of fertilization. Pressure escalates texturally: from arrival to planting to departure, each beat intensifies thematic weight. Yet escalation lacks a decisive narrowing of options or trade-off; the coachman faces no resistance, failure, or sacrifice. The cost is implied (labor, time, memory), but never dramatized as a loss that alters tactics, weakening tension under even an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—translating emotional distance into closeness—is signaled early and deepens via the leaf-cylinder decoding. Pressure escalates through Baron’s trembling attempt and perceptual breakthrough, narrowing options from passive listening to active journey. Cost is felt: he abandons the cabin, accepting silence over false hope. Agency drives escalation, though the “riddle” resolution leans slightly on intuitive leap over tangible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding purpose in imposed isolation—is signaled early and tightens when the anomalous star appears, forcing a choice between passive observance and active pursuit. The meaningful deepening occurs when sketching shifts from ritual to navigation, narrowing options: he must either ignore the beacon or defy protocol. Cost is felt (severance from network, risk of madness) though not yet paid; the shutdown backdrop creates coherent pressure. Coincidence (star appearing on anniversary) complicates but doesn’t resolve—he actively chooses to act.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—amending the fractured sky—is signaled early and tightens at the summit when the ritual proves incomplete without the sundial base. Kaelen’s agency drives escalation: he chooses respect (bow), executes the swap, places the lid. Cost is conceptual but felt: he leaves the lid behind, surrendering a tool for future use. Under a Causal lens, each beat narrows options toward one precise act, though physical peril remains abstracted.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving overlooked human gestures—is signaled early and tightens when Elara confronts the chessboard’s emptiness, forcing her to unbind her own trauma. Agency is clear: she chooses to spell “forgive,” altering her relationship to survivor’s guilt. Cost is felt (emotional labor of reenactment, scars of authenticity), though escalation relies more on thematic deepening than external pressure, fitting the Accumulative lens but limiting tactical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming home through confronting memory—is signaled early and tightens when the stone reveals home as severed connections, forcing Elara to choose between continued escape or painful engagement. Agency drives escalation: her nightly seeding deepens understanding, each session peeling “layers of avoidance.” Cost is unmistakable: substituted realities fade, replaced by “clarity that hurt but healed.” The feather-mediated action forecloses the path of evasion, charging the final image with earned vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled early and tightens when decoding the tapestry becomes the only path forward. The meaningful deepening occurs when Elian realizes the labyrinth is a test of humility, not punishment, narrowing his options to internal recalibration. Agency is maintained throughout: his productive fidgeting leads to discovery, his deliberate alignment of the labyrinth pieces enacts change. Cost is felt—years of exile, loss of pupil’s trust—but could be more viscerally rendered in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—forgiveness through singular vs. refracted truth—is signaled early and intensifies as each poem multiplies interpretations. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her poems deliberately complicate the ritual’s demand, narrowing the path to “clean” absolution. The bell imposes a live clock, forcing urgency. Cost is unmistakable: forgiveness now requires bearing “the weight of all these refracted visions,” a lifetime burden crystallized in the final hush.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—saving fraying world memories—is signaled early and tightens via the breath-limited dive window, forcing frantic precision. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each pockmark alignment deepens narrative control while acid resistance intensifies. Cost is unmistakable: physical agony, structural fragility, and near-dissolution. The tightening forecloses failure, crystallizing Elian’s stance without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming wholeness after loss—is signaled early via the mirror crack. Pressure tightens when the found shell forces confrontation: her nostalgic refuge becomes the site of reckoning. The deepening (“her nostalgia had been a cage”) narrows options—she must either double down or release. Cost is felt: she forfeits the physical token of her vow. Though the “wrong turn” introduces coincidence, it complicates rather than resolves; agency lies in her choice to enter, linger, and ultimately leave the shell behind.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—calling her brother home through quiet persistence—is signaled early and deepens via the purification ritual. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elara chooses vibration over voice, narrowing her method to one fragile, unproven act. Cost is felt in the year of waiting and the risk of further loss; the brother’s response confirms stakes were real. Coincidence (scent reaching him) complicates plausibility slightly but is framed as magical realism consistent with the established rules.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—navigating grief via reverse migration—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the phone instructs “Build,” forcing Elara to act rather than wait. Agency is clear: every component gathered, every wire connected, is her choice under lunar constraint. The cost is felt: raw solace arrives only through painful confrontation, not escape. Escalation follows an Accumulative lens—density increases as objects accrue, culminating in resonance—but the stakes never face external opposition or tangible risk beyond emotional exposure, slightly limiting pressure intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—freedom from compelled truth—is signaled early and tightens during the lightning ritual, where Elara risks electrocution for mental silence. The escalation is driven by her agency (fashioning the cradle, timing the strike), and the cost is legible: the eye’s power is spent, its future efficacy uncertain. Though the virus’s societal impact is vast, the story wisely narrows stakes to one visceral, personal battle. Minor deduction: the “empathy virus” backstory slightly abstracts the immediate pressure, though it’s efficiently anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—decoding the stranger’s gesture—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s investigation. The meaningful tightening occurs when he infers the undelivered apology, narrowing his goal to writing the letter. Cost is felt: he surrenders the mystery but gains purpose. However, escalation relies more on accumulation than protagonist-driven pressure; the “softly persistent” method lacks friction or failed attempts that would heighten stakes under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—honoring Mara’s promise—is clear from the start and tightens as the creek rises, forcing a deadline. Elian’s agency drives escalation: he follows ants, inserts the chip, chooses not to cross. The cost—permanent relinquishment of altering the past—is legible in the subdued chip and wading out alone. However, the ants’ appearance leans on convenience rather than character-driven discovery, slightly softening the pressure’s coherence under strict Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the dreams to avert doom—is signaled early and tightens decisively in the grotto, where knowledge becomes burden. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she silences the seer, ascends alone, touches the starlight. Cost is legible in the fireflies’ dimming and the “delicate threat” now binding her rule, though the external peril remains abstract rather than viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—capturing “the density of presence”—is signaled early and deepens when Kael’s secret reframes the nexus as a dreaming partner, not a decaying resource. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she shifts tactics via “directed spontaneity,” channeling energy through the shell. The cost is conceptual—abandoning instrumentalism for empathy—but felt in her redefined identity. No false resolution; the stakes evolve organically under Accumulative pressure, though physical or relational risk remains muted.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—distilling chaos into narrative—is signaled early and tightens when the dream-grave forces confrontation with mortality. The deepening occurs mid-soar: jealousy of past selves crystallizes the cost of knowledge, narrowing options to either succumb or inscribe. Agency drives escalation—he chooses to mark the scroll despite futility, and the act itself becomes the resolution. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the “violent uplift” is an extension of his psyche, not external luck. Cost is felt in the “ragged” scroll and residual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming purpose after sensory loss—is signaled early and deepens when Elara abandons oils for metaphor, narrowing her professional identity. The tightening occurs when she chooses silence over scent with the grieving woman, foreclosing her old practice. Cost is felt: she must rebuild her craft from absence. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; agency drives the turn. Slight deduction: the repairman’s wisdom borders on deus ex machina, though his role is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—transforming pain into narrative—is signaled early and tightens when crystallization shifts from hindrance to medium, narrowing Elara’s options to vulnerability or stagnation. Agency drives escalation: speaking aloud dissolves memory into tale, a choice that reweights stress as catalyst. Cost is legible in “shedding rigidity” and “last of her crystallized doubts,” though physical/emotional price could be more concretely felt.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—delivering an overdue apology—is signaled early and tightens when dawn approaches and chainsaws loom. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she activates the device, uncorks the scent, speaks to the spirits. The cost is legible: imperfect closure amid irreversible loss (trees felled). Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via sensory and temporal density, not causal turns, which is appropriate and well-executed.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes remain abstract throughout: “unraveling cosmic illusions” is declared but never tested against concrete opposition or trade-offs. No meaningful tightening occurs—the witness moves, reads, interprets, and succeeds without resistance, loss, or altered tactics. The “universe’s hiccup” introduces temporal pressure but doesn’t narrow options or force difficult choices. Agency is passive observation, not decision or renunciation with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding time’s essence—is signaled early and deepens through the backward count, which reverses perception and tightens focus. The meaningful intensification occurs at “five hundred,” when the world slows and doubt creeps in, narrowing options to acceptance or delusion. Cost is conceptual but palpable: he surrenders instrumental control (key as tool) for fluid understanding. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, though the pressure remains internal and cerebral.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—redefining security through release—is signaled early and deepens via the intrusion alert that challenges Elara’s assumptions. Her agency drives escalation: she approaches, adjusts frequency, and initiates the update. The cost is conceptual (abandoning impenetrability) and felt in the “quiet wildfire” of insight. Yet the opposition (familiar stranger) poses no real threat, softening tension; the conflict resolves through epiphany rather than hard-won negotiation, muting the stakes’ visceral urgency despite thematic coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—navigating chance without compulsion—is signaled early and deepens at the library when Elara confronts her father’s journal. But escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure: the scrawls guide her passively, and the heart attack backstory tightens nothing in real time. Cost is conceptual (lost paternal relationship) but not viscerally felt in tactics—she never risks anything on her journey. The “widening perspectives responsibly” goal isn’t tested by opposing force, only contemplated.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—teaching endings how to begin—is signaled early and deepens when Leo initiates the loop, narrowing Elara’s emotional options. The escalation is driven by Leo’s agency under an Accumulative lens: he doesn’t solve but reframes, and the cost is felt in Elara’s recalibrated grief. Coincidence (wrong number) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the resolution emerges from Leo’s method. One tightening suffices, though a second pressure point could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory against erasure—is signaled early and tightens when demolition looms. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to steep the locket, write the ledger, and renew the covenant. The cost is felt (accepting physical loss while securing mnemonic survival), though the pressure lacks external opposition beyond off-page council votes, slightly softening conflict intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—curing loneliness through reciprocity—is signaled early and deepens when Leo must pass on the gesture, foreclosing passive receipt. Pressure tightens via Elara’s terms (“listen, then find someone else”), forcing Leo’s agency. Cost is felt: emotional exposure, ongoing obligation. Coincidence (rumor chain) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the cure spreads only through deliberate action, aligning with the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—navigating grief via dowsing—is signaled early and deepens as ultrasonic notes shift from trail to threshold. Agency lies in attention: Elara chooses to absorb, kneel, pour intention. The tightening occurs when the musical trail ends, forcing reliance on subsonic earth-vibration—a narrowing that demands surrender, not pursuit. Cost is legible: she trades active seeking for receptive stillness, transforming chaos into composition at the price of certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—threshing meaning from failure—is signaled early and tightens when the anomaly replies, forcing Elara to risk deeper engagement. Her agency drives escalation: she synthesizes network data into a new signal, narrowing options from passive revision to active dialogue. Cost is unmistakable: vulnerability to an unknown entity, with the ever-present monument of her error. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each data shard reweights the last until the decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—breaking the isolation of being forgotten through translating silence into shared music—is signaled early and deepens organically. Pressure escalates via the advisor’s arrival and method, culminating in Elian’s active participation (“aimed the lens,” “signed back… confidently”). The meaningful tightening occurs when Elian accepts the camera, foreclosing passive despair in favor of perceptual agency. Cost is felt in his “joyful sorrow”—the ache of obscurity fused with fleeting connection—and crystallizes in the advisor’s departure, leaving Elian forever changed yet still alone.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rescuing the forgotten promise—is signaled early and tightens when Kaelen deciphers the portrait as a map, narrowing his path to the alcove. His agency drives escalation: analytical intuition converts vandalism into direction, transforming passive discovery into active decoding. Cost is felt in his shaken hands and reconfigured identity, though the price lacks concrete forfeiture (e.g., time, safety, tool). The deepening from “burn to cleanse” to “preserve to rebel” credibly crystallizes his stance under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—transforming entangled memories into collective connection—is signaled early and deepens through rhythmic intensification at each “cosmic inhalation.” The meaningful tightening occurs when Elara pours all energy into drumming, triggering the symphony and fleeting unity, after which she slumps in exhaustion: a visible cost that alters tactics (rest before next attempt). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, though the “universe inhaling” mechanism borders on metaphorical convenience. Stakes remain viscerally felt through bodily toll and luminous aftermath.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—proving whispers outdistance shouts—is signaled early and tested through Kael’s confrontation and the lost dockworkers. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to invite, demonstrate, and guide rather than resist or flee. The tightening occurs when digital systems fail, raising the cost of error. While stakes are viscerally felt, the absence of tangible loss (e.g., time, injury, consequence for failure) slightly softens the pressure’s edge.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—teaching darkness the value of stars—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s weaving, which intensifies as the child’s spirit responds. Pressure escalates texturally: each constellation pattern tightens the emotional resonance, culminating in Lyra as a turning point. The cost is conceptual—Elara bears the weight of unspoken grief—but it’s legible in the “stillwater tension” and “spiralingly calm” endurance. Agency is present, though passive; she acts, but opposition is abstract, not adversarial.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—awakening doubt without inciting violence—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s insistence on questions over demands. The tightening occurs when displays bloom: a guard softens, townsfolk whisper, the Council cannot punish what has no leader. Cost is conceptual (risk of discovery, fragility of rebellion) but legible in the “rigid posture softening” and amplified quiet. Agency lies in attention and arrangement, not action, fitting the Accumulative lens, though physical peril remains muted.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (freedom vs. safety) is signaled early and tightens decisively when the whale’s call demands irrevocable choice. Elara’s agency drives escalation: clutching the scrimshaw, walking toward surf—each act narrows options. Cost is felt (“combative tenderness”) and visible (abandoning livelihood). Under Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via sensory and emotional density rather than causal turns, which is valid—but the absence of external complication (e.g., a coworker’s intervention) slightly limits tactical depth.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving inner grief under enforced joy—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s dual performance: public compliance vs. private carving. The meaningful tightening occurs when she admits her lightness “felt like betrayal,” crystallizing the moral cost of survival. Agency is expressed through endurance (Earned Stasis), with visible price in her reporting of neighbors and emotional atrophy. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, culminating in a final stance where silence itself becomes resistance—and surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—dissolving imposed boundaries—is signaled early and deepens via the poet’s paraphrasing act, which narrows interpretive options into liberatory ones. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens: each spoken word intensifies the humming and thaws the ice. Yet cost remains abstract; no resource, relationship, or opportunity is lost. The “tremor of certainty” hints at internal price but isn’t dramatized as a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—awakening true sight—is signaled early and deepens when Maestra demands equivalent value, narrowing Elian’s path to artistic surrender rather than magical cure. The tightening occurs when he must paint *imperfection*, not seek perfection, forcing renunciation of his original goal. Cost is felt: he trades hope of chromatic vision for emotional clarity. Escalation is driven by his agency (choosing to paint the flawed fountain), though Maestra’s role borders on deus ex machina without fuller reciprocity.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—discovering the “texture of connection”—is signaled early and deepens when Elara questions her core assumption about isolation. The meaningful tightening occurs when she modifies the apparatus, narrowing her method from inward focus to outward projection. Cost is conceptual but palpable: abandonment of control, acceptance of unpredictability. Agency drives escalation—her choice to “channel the prism-song outward” triggers spontaneous harmony—fulfilling the Accumulative lens’s requirement for a cadence shift that reweights stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming grief into generative art—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s choice to follow coordinates, then reopen the sealed room, then create new jewelry. The meaningful tightening occurs when she shifts from mourning-only pieces to those embodying rebirth, foreclosing her prior identity as solely a mourner. Cost is visible: she must confront her grandfather’s legacy and her own pain to teach others. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (finding cranes) complicates but doesn’t resolve—she acts on each clue.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—mapping cultural collapse—is signaled early but remains intellectual, not visceral. Pressure accumulates texturally but lacks a meaningful tightening: no option is foreclosed, no trade-off enacted. The “fear of greater unraveling” raises tension but isn’t tested through action. Protagonist agency is observational, not decisive; escalation stems from repetition, not deepening knowledge or narrowing choices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—purifying nostalgia to heal sorrow—is signaled early and tightens as unpredictability tests Elara’s resolve. The meaningful deepening occurs when she accepts the mind-unraveling risk, narrowing her path to ritual endurance. Cost is felt (“innocence slip away,” exhaustion) and shapes tactics (erratic movement, non-repeating chants). Agency drives escalation, though the “steadily unpredictable” constraint could exert sharper tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving hope’s shape—is signaled early and tightens when the “shadow unbound” threatens to blur it entirely. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she initiates metamorphosis, narrowing options to transformation or loss. Cost is unmistakable: safer dreams become “less true.” Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens via visual decay across decades, not external antagonism, which fits the story’s introspective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reconciling compassion with self-respect—is signaled early and tightens through Elara’s shedding process. Agency drives escalation: each layer peeled (naivete, bitterness, fear) narrows her emotional options until only “quieter strength” remains. Cost is felt in the chameleon’s injury and her forfeited trust. Though pressure is internal, it’s coherent under the Accumulative lens, with one decisive deepening (choosing cellular patience over reattachment).

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—deciphering scars to find closure—is signaled early and deepens when coffee rings reveal subterranean void. Aris’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to tunnel using his gift, narrowing options (abandoning surface methods). Cost is felt in physical vulnerability (tender skin) and psychological risk (descending into trauma-as-void). The “wrong stillness” intensifies pressure coherently under an Accumulative lens, culminating in the crystal’s revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—locating and reclaiming unused love—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s incubation act, which forecloses passive observation for active guardianship. Pressure escalates texturally: forgotten lyrics → crystalline letters → gray expanse → tin box memory. Cost is felt (“inert” film, emotional weight), but escalation leans on revelation over choice-driven narrowing, slightly softening agency under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s alignment with celestial paths. The meaningful turn occurs when she reframes tracing stars as harmony, not escape, narrowing her path to one of active attunement. Yet agency is passive: the breakthrough comes from a meteor’s passage, not her choice. Cost is conceptual (fragility of creativity) but not viscerally dramatized in action or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—cultivating sparks to restart time—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Elara’s efforts drain her, raising the personal cost. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: she chooses which sparks to charm, adjusts probabilities, and persists despite resistance. The deepening shift comes when multiple sparks ignite collectively, transforming ambient hope into tangible renewal. Cost is unmistakable: her increasing hollowness, paid per act, makes the final peace feel earned rather than granted.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reaching the forest’s core to expand cognition—is signaled early and tightens when the gear activates at the nexus. Protagonist agency drives escalation: interpreting wind, placing the gear. Cost is felt in perpetual displacement, yet the final “deafening” hum implies overwhelming revelation, not loss. Coincidence (translocation) complicates but doesn’t resolve; however, the jammed mechanism feels slightly convenient as obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—finding unused courage—is signaled early and deepens through the journey’s demands. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elara accepts the star sigil, binding herself to the path voluntarily. Agency is present: she chooses to follow, to offer her hand, to keep walking. Cost is felt (loss of old security) but not over-dramatized; the escalation is subtle yet coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding the cost of safety—is signaled early and tightens through Elian’s archival research, which transforms suspicion into knowledge with irreversible moral consequence. Agency is expressed through attention and endurance; his choice to remain forecloses ignorance at great personal cost. Escalation is driven by protagonist action (climbing, reading, repairing), not coincidence, and the unpardonable silence becomes a live pressure shaping every decision.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—unmasking the pretender—is signaled early and deepens through the rune’s activation, which narrows options to irreversible exposure. Escalation is driven by Lorian’s agency: each cryptic message tightens the net, culminating in the scholar’s discovery and Theron’s panicked arrival. The cost is conceptual but undeniable: Theron’s borrowed majesty dissolves, and the throne rights itself without bloodshed. Coincidence (the scholar stumbling upon the clue) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the true resolution is Lorian’s prepared trap.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—understanding disappearing marine paths—is signaled early and deepens via data synthesis. The meaningful turn (paths reemerging post-ban) narrows Kaelen’s emotional options from witness to participant. Yet agency is passive: revelation comes from observation, not decision under pressure. Cost (years of doubt) is felt but not dramatized as a trade-off during the work itself.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—reigniting hope in a lull—is signaled early and deepens when the stone circle reframes rebellion as resonance, not violence. Pressure escalates via accumulation: silence → hum → vision → outward wave. The cost is conceptual (abandoning old methods of war) and felt (her solitude before the call). However, the protagonist’s agency is reactive—she responds to the stones rather than choosing against alternatives—slightly muting the escalation’s driver.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—intentional cultural evolution versus blind restoration—is signaled early and tightens when the council resists change. The meaningful deepening occurs at the unsealing: destiny is revealed as malleable potential, forcing a trade-off between control and co-creation. Cost is visible in the shift from insurgency to collaborative leadership, though the escalation leans slightly on coincidence (finding the kite) rather than pure agency.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—maintaining hope amid trauma—is signaled early and deepens when the aircraft hum triggers freeze. Elara’s agency lies in renunciation: she refuses paralysis, breathing into stiffness. This tightening forecloses retreat into memory and forces present engagement. Cost is visible in her tension and whispered ritual; the lighthouse’s automation mirrors her necessary self-reliance. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, though escalation hinges more on internal rhythm than external opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—artistic integrity vs. societal expectation—is signaled early and tightens through three memory-based turns that narrow Elian’s options: first self-doubt, then hope for prophecy, finally acceptance of truth-telling as his purpose. Each deepening carries cost: isolation, shattered illusions, destroyed work. The escalation is protagonist-driven under an Accumulative lens—pressure mounts via sensory and psychological density, not external events. Walls closing in literalize stakes without resolving them mechanically.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—unlocking time’s crisis-slowing—is signaled early and deepens when Kael enters the ink pattern, risking dissolution for insight. The meaningful tightening occurs when he realizes time doesn’t slow objectively; this forecloses his quest for physical law, forcing acceptance. Cost is felt: his “quiet rage against ambiguity” crystallizes into peace that “holds echoes of fury.” Agency is maintained throughout; no coincidence resolves the tension—only deliberate action and observation.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. preservation—is signaled early and tightens when Elara chooses upload over oath. But escalation lacks causal pressure: no guards, glitches, or system resistance materialize. The “dormant networks stir” too easily, removing meaningful cost. Still, the moral calculus (justice vs. safety) sharpens her choice, and the ripple effect implies social consequence. Coincidence doesn’t resolve, but absence of opposition weakens agency.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving continuity through pacifist cultivation—is signaled early and deepens when wanderers arrive, testing Elara’s method. The tightening occurs when she chooses to share her talisman, risking dilution of her sanctuary for wider impact. Cost is subtle (exposure, vulnerability) but felt in the charged poise of departure. Escalation is driven by her agency, though the external chaos remains abstract rather than concretely threatening her dome.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—catching the echo without being consumed—is signaled early and deepens through escalating sonic chaos. Kael’s agency drives escalation: each zigzag, voiced silence, and spike pulse narrows options and alters tactics. Cost is felt—the garden rebels, constellations lurch—and culminates in a trade-off: taming the lullaby requires emotional transliteration that risks self-dissolution. Coincidence complicates (star disruption) but never resolves; victory is earned through sustained focus.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—breaking the cycle of buried truth—is signaled early and deepens when proof by contradiction collapses under evidence of her father’s complicity. Agency manifests through attention and renunciation: she chooses revelation over inheritance, paying the cost of lost paternal myth. Escalation is driven by protagonist action (opening files), not coincidence, under a Causal lens. One meaningful tightening suffices: each file narrows her path until only confession remains.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—hushing guilt-driven dissonance—is signaled early and tightens when Elara connects the amber to the resonator, risking deeper pain for resolution. Her agency drives escalation: choosing to inscribe soundboards despite firmware resistance. Cost is felt in her weeping realization of the cry’s true meaning (“a simple need for warmth”) and the irreversible confrontation with past neglect.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—finding meaning amid epistemic collapse—is signaled early and tightens when the woman challenges Elara’s art as “nonsense.” Elara’s agency (continuing the mandala) escalates pressure, forcing communal reckoning. Cost is visible: the ephemeral mandala demands acceptance of transience. Under the Accumulative lens, density of whispers → hush reweights the stake credibly, though the tightening relies more on atmosphere than tactical trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—protecting empathy in a broken world—is signaled early and deepens when the mosaic reveals a map of “states of being.” The tightening occurs when Elara chooses to rename herself, foreclosing her identity as fire-forged victim. Cost is felt: the retrocognitive trap cracks but doesn’t vanish. Agency drives escalation—her touch initiates the vision, her whisper enacts change—though the “aberrant mercy” resolution leans slightly toward grace over earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming stagnant eternity into renewal—is signaled early and tightens when fractured time threatens to unravel her efforts. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she sings despite resistance, intertwining echoes to build a bridge across despair. The cost—confronting oblivion’s void—is felt in her phantom heartbeat syncing with the coin. One meaningful deepening suffices: her song shifts from pleading to cascading emotion, reweighting possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reaching Mara before her memories vanish—is signaled early and deepens when Alex chooses somatic markers over abstract recall. The meaningful tightening comes with his decision to map memories via bodily sensation, which forecloses easier, less intimate methods. Cost is felt in the fragility of the resulting image (“willowglass hope”) and the unspoken risk of failure. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, though the static shock verges on convenient complication.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to the silent Earth—is signaled early and deepens through Kaelen’s heat-mapping, culminating in the fossil’s float as a physical manifestation of emotional resonance. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: his focused mapping triggers the mystical response, not coincidence. Cost is conceptual (the burden of becoming a conduit) but legible in the final image: “the world… had found its voice” through him, implying solitude and responsibility. One meaningful tightening suffices, though a tangible sacrifice would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—averting doom by altering prophecy—is signaled early and deepens through the method’s symbolic rigor. Agency is maintained via active cataloging, not passive reception; each button placement narrows the prophetic weave into branching futures. Cost is conceptual (loss of certainty) and felt (weight of task), legible when the hourglass glows and sands shift. Escalation is driven by protagonist insight under Accumulative lens, though the absence of tangible sacrifice slightly softens the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—mending broken trust via truth—is signaled early and tightens when enemy agents close in, forcing a high-risk broadcast. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he deciphers codes, delivers the drive, activates the transmitter. Cost is felt (his wounding) and alters tactics (Anya fights while he completes transmission). Minor deduction: the “conspiracy” remains vague, slightly softening the moral calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming authenticity through confronting a broken vow—is signaled early and deepens via reflection. The tightening occurs when he resolves to wait until the gutters fall silent, creating a live timeframe that structures his introspection. Yet agency is passive: he waits, reflects, realizes. No trade-off or renunciation alters tactics; the “pressure” is atmospheric, not oppositional. Under an Accumulative lens, this suffices, but cost remains conceptual, not enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding why places resist change—is signaled early and deepens when Kael realizes kindness sustains the oasis. Escalation occurs through his meditation, which narrows options: he must either remain detached or join the continuum. His choice forecloses pure observation, incurring the cost of emotional vulnerability. Agency drives the turn; no coincidence resolves the core tension.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—maintaining hope amid loss—is signaled early and deepens when Elara actively chooses to row into darkness rather than succumb to the “quivering hush.” Her agency drives escalation: each oar pull is a renunciation of despair, culminating in the mirror’s deliberate light-casting. Cost is felt conceptually (the rose’s death, bare garden) and physically (night labor, exposure). Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the bud appears only after her ritual, implying earned renewal. Pressure tightens via sensory narrowing (focus on oar rhythm, then rock crevices), fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—coexistence with past self—is signaled early and deepens via the stone circle’s hum, which narrows Elara’s options from resistance to integration. Agency is clear: she chooses to approach the circle, hold the sundial high, and reinterpret loss as purpose. Cost is felt in the “brittle awakenings” that threaten fracture, and the final trade-off—accepting ghost-companionship over solitude—is legible. Escalation is driven by protagonist action under an Accumulative lens, though the hum’s mechanics verge on deus ex machina without prior failed attempts.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—rejoining her own unspoken heart—is signaled early and deepens when Elara shifts from solitary craft to communal invitation. The meaningful tightening occurs when she invites others to whisper secrets, transforming her role from vessel to conduit. Cost is felt in the relinquishing of control over others’ words and her own guardedness, though the escalation lacks a tangible obstacle or resistance beyond internal hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—preventing societal fracture via signal manipulation—is signaled early and tightens when Aris bypasses protocols, foreclosing institutional safety. His agency drives escalation: the unauthorized broadcast directly disrupts both cosmic and terrestrial chaos. Cost is felt (Evans’s anger, career jeopardy) and visible in the quieting quadrangle. The deepening—subsonic frequencies soothing human emotions—adds layered consequence without coincidence resolving the core conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—overcoming claustrophobia to retrieve the harmonic key—is signaled early and deepens as passages narrow. The organ’s reverberation offers fleeting calm, creating meaningful pressure oscillations. However, escalation leans on external phenomena (walls warp, music soothes) rather than Elara’s agency driving change; she reacts more than acts. The cost—psychological endurance—is legible but abstract, lacking a concrete forfeiture (e.g., lost time, injury, sacrificed tool) that would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reviving communal empathy through art—is signaled early and deepens when Elara shifts from seeking a perpetrator to reconstructing a relationship. The meaningful tightening occurs at the quartz snag: she realizes Isabelle wasn’t pushed but pulled, reframing the act as tragic miscommunication. This deepening is driven by her agency (methodical pacing, sensory unification), not coincidence. Cost is felt in the “terrible silence” she must now voice—a burden of truth without resolution. One pressure point suffices for this length, executed with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—restoring ancestral honor—is signaled early and tightens when Elara learns the sentencing site is submerged, forcing innovation (using deep-sea probes). Her agency drives escalation: questioning Roy, coordinating the dive, presenting evidence. Cost is legible: emotional toll of spongey dread, risk of failure, and the physical retrieval under storm threat. Coincidence (Roy’s sonar match) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her fervor earns his cooperation.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—making meaning from impossible disappearance—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s interpretive acts. The meaningful tightening occurs when he aligns the glass flake with fluttering shadows, transforming cryptic code into revelation. Agency is internal but active: his observation drives the turn, and the cost is conceptual (relinquishing empirical certainty for poetic truth). While pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens, the escalation lacks a tangible consequence—no tool lost, time spent, or social price—keeping cost legible but abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—breaking generational cycles—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Leo uses his father’s markers to dissuade the squatter, foreclosing the train as refuge. This act, driven by protagonist agency, deepens stakes by transforming inherited violence into protective wisdom. Cost is felt in the “fragile freedom” and “hard-won peace,” though the escalation lacks a second pressure point; one tightening suffices at this length, but prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—decoding inscriptions to heal collective suffering—is signaled early and deepens via variable stars’ emotional barometer function. Agency emerges through Elara’s lucid witnessing and vocalization of phrases, narrowing options from passive chronicler to active healer. Cost is felt in solitude and inherited weight, though escalation leans more on revelation than tactical trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—unbending silenced truth—is signaled early and tightens when Elara must risk using a soul-devouring seed to thaw the confession. The meaningful deepening occurs at the roots: merging hunger with rigidity is a high-stakes gamble that could consume her. Cost is visible (the seed’s activation, her vulnerability), and agency drives escalation. However, the “warlike serenity” intensifies abstractly rather than concretely narrowing options—it’s atmospheric pressure, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring the eclipsed covenant—is signaled early and tightens when the portal demands acknowledgment of failure. Elara’s agency drives escalation: tracing patterns with the clipping, pressing it to her scar, stepping forward despite fear. The cost—enduring pain to access memory, risking dissolution of self—is felt throughout. However, the “eclipsed covenant” remains somewhat abstract; its mechanics aren’t dramatized beyond metaphor, slightly blurring the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—patching soul-holes through symbolic control—is signaled early and deepens when the keeper challenges her method, forcing a meaningful turn: surrender replaces domination. Pressure escalates texturally (not causally), consistent with the Accumulative lens, narrowing her options from active “trammeling” to receptive “letting whispers fill her.” Cost is felt in the fragility of her approach and the relinquishment of force, though the stakes remain slightly abstract rather than viscerally urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—finding purpose after public failure—is clear early and tightens when Mara’s knock forces Leo to confront his insulation. His pivot to music memorabilia appraisal constitutes a meaningful deepening that narrows his professional path with opportunity cost (abandoning general antiques). Yet the escalation relies more on internal realization than external pressure; Mara catalyzes but doesn’t complicate, making the turn feel internally earned but externally soft.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—deciphering spiritual transition—is signaled early and deepens via analogical insight, narrowing options from grasping to aligning. Agency lies in Elian’s choice to trust resonance over force, foreclosing brute-force approaches with visible cost: past failures haunt him, but patience yields fruit. Pressure tightens as the seed glows, visions flicker, and the arbor hums—each beat intensifies without coincidence resolving tension. The final act reweights all prior struggle into earned wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving migrating identities from lunar-induced shattering—is signaled early and tightens through two smelting sequences that demonstrate escalating skill and thematic depth. Agency lies in Elian’s method (accepting contradictions), which forecloses erasure as an option. Cost is felt: the labor is eternal, the sun offers no warmth, yet he endures. While pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, the lack of a tangible setback or loss (beyond atmospheric melancholy) slightly softens the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving humanity’s dreams alongside survival—is signaled early via Kaelen’s profession and deepened by the confessions. His agency drives escalation: picking up the shell, reading, placing the pearl. The cost—emotional burden of absorbed hopes—is felt in his tears and reconfigured vocation. Coincidence (finding the shell) complicates but doesn’t resolve; his choice to crown the pearl earns the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled early and tightened through Elara’s methodical search for “map references” in decay. The meaningful deepening occurs when she shifts from seeking external validation (river whispers, medication) to internal reconfiguration via the graffiti’s wisdom. Agency is clear: her choice to play the accordion crystallizes her stance, foreclosing self-punishment with visible cost (the weight of memory remains, but she carries it differently). Coincidence doesn’t resolve; insight emerges from her deliberate, flawed process. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, though the escalation could risk more tangible consequence beyond emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—reaching the Library before the second letter—is signaled early and tightens via shortening propagation delays and cyclical reversals that threaten progress. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she measures echoes, recalibrates after reversals, and trusts her journal. Yet the “key threshold” and final entrance lack concrete consequence; the threat vanishes without loss, making cost feel implied rather than dramatized. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure accumulates texturally, but the climax lacks a decisive trade-off or irreversible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—propagate freedom or control—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Elara plays the second note, triggering seed flight. Agency is clear: her choice forecloses imperial compliance at tangible cost (broken vow, melted artifact). Escalation follows Accumulative logic: plant anxiety intensifies, coffee stains shift, violin’s purpose clarifies—all culminating in a stance crystallization under coherent pressure. The Empire never appears, but its demand looms credibly through Elara’s internalized deadline.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—capturing the spark before oblivion—is signaled early and deepens through the infusion process. Pressure escalates via the narrowing window of fading vitality and the demand for absolute calm. Though no external antagonist exists, the internalized race against entropy tightens credibly. Cost is felt in the solemn weight of legacy, though a more tangible forfeiture (e.g., personal energy, memory) would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—finding contentment after unforgivable betrayal—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s ritual labor. Pressure tightens meaningfully when the hairpin glows, revealing the alcove and forcing a reconceptualization of rebirth. However, escalation leans on symbolic revelation rather than protagonist-driven agency; the glow feels slightly coincidental. Cost is legible conceptually (accepting pain as part of renewal) but lacks a tangible forfeiture or visible price beyond emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—replacing certainty with nuance—is signaled early and deepens via Aris’s tactics (mirror, chimes, cloak). The meaningful tightening occurs when Elara accepts the cloak, foreclosing her rigid narrative with felt cost (shuddering vulnerability). Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural escalation: each object intensifies her internal conflict until the wind’s “affirmation” crystallizes her stance. Coincidence never resolves; agency lies in her choice to peer into the shard and face the sea.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—learning to vanish to appear—is signaled early and deepens via the trance’s intensifying pull. Kael’s agency shines in his surrender (“Do not resist” becomes his choice), narrowing options until self erodes. Cost is felt: dissolution, fear, loss of identity. Escalation follows Accumulative logic—pressure rises through sensory and metaphoric density, not causality, which fits the lens. No false resolutions; the grotto complicates but doesn’t solve.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—learning stillness as navigation—is signaled early and deepens when birds reveal the arrowhead as conduit. Elara’s agency drives escalation: appraising → humming → integrating artifact. Cost is legible: centuries of waiting culminate in irreversible fusion with the arrowhead. Pressure tightens coherently under Accumulative lens, though the birds’ role edges toward coincidence without clearer mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—finding the sacred in the simple—is signaled early and deepens through the keystone’s activation, narrowing Elian’s world to one possibility: the hidden garden. Pressure accumulates texturally rather than causally, consistent with the lens, but the “treacherous” journey lacks concrete obstacles or trade-offs; stakes remain conceptual. Cost is legible at closure (renunciation of old spire, embrace of new purpose), yet no on-page loss (time, tool, stamina) alters tactics mid-beat, softening escalation’s bite.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—discovering the color of sound—is signaled early and deepens when the luminous vows tie directly to Elias’s quest. The meaningful tightening occurs when he inserts the key: a choice that transforms passive searching into active revelation, narrowing his path from curiosity to custodianship. Cost is felt in his silent vow and altered perception—his old life is foreclosed, though the price is more conceptual than visceral. Escalation is driven by agency, not coincidence, and the final image reweights his entire existence under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—finding meaning after universal contraction—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s escalating interpretation of static bursts. The meaningful tightening occurs when she shifts from divination to archival research, narrowing her method and raising emotional stakes. Agency is maintained throughout; coincidence never resolves tension. Cost is legible in her acceptance of eternal solitude as anchor—a conceptual price that reconfigures her role without physical sacrifice, consistent with the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—giving names to nameless fears—is signaled early and deepens through the act of crystallization, which transforms abstract dread into tangible form. The tightening occurs when light makes sacrifice “knowable,” forcing confrontation with specific fears (forgetting, duty, fading love). Agency is clear: the reaper chooses to invoke the method, absorbing cost in emotional vulnerability. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via layered sensory and mnemonic density, not external opposition, which is appropriate for internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (restore cosmic balance via bell) is clear from line one. Pressure escalates through embodied cost: cut finger, fatigue, memory of mockery. The drip-rate method forces patience under duress—a meaningful deepening that narrows options to precise timing. Agency drives escalation (he chooses rhythm over force), though the cosmic scale risks abstraction; saved by tactile focus on bell fragments.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—transforming fragmented memory into shared meaning—is signaled early and deepens when Elias confronts his boyhood guilt. The meaningful tightening occurs at the town hall: choosing to share, not hoard, the artifacts. Cost is felt: he trades private penance for public vulnerability. However, escalation relies on discovery (photograph trail) rather than active resistance or complication; pressure accumulates texturally but lacks a true oppositional force beyond internal hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—harmonizing logic/intuition—is signaled early and tightens when Elara chooses gentle warmth over fire, narrowing her alchemical method. Cost is felt: she abandons control for connection, a trade-off charged by her grandmother’s words. Escalation stems from protagonist agency (observing starlings → altering flame use), though the “final transformation” remains abstract, slightly muting stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving trust through vigilant interpretation—is signaled early and tightens when anomalous data demands protocol revision. The escalation is driven by Elara’s agency: she invents a hybrid algorithm under duress, narrowing options from passive observation to active reinterpretation. Cost is felt (solitude, pressure, near-catastrophe memory) and culminates in a stance crystallization. Yet the “danger” resolves too cleanly into benign discovery, softening the stakes’ edge slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—ownership vs. vivification of identity—is signaled early and tightens when Kael reframes the brain as “complementary opposite,” foreclosing both factions’ binary. His agency drives escalation: listening, then stepping forward with a third path. Cost is legible: Kael risks re-traumatization by reconnecting with his lost self. Under a Hybrid lens, pressure coheres—philosophical clash crystallizes into personal stakes—but the factions’ arguments verge on abstract without deeper tactical friction.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—safeguarding space for innovation—is signaled early and deepened via the seed’s arrival. The corporate buyout memory introduces external pressure, but it’s recounted, not enacted, weakening escalation. Elara’s agency lies in reinterpretation, not renunciation or sacrifice; no tangible price is paid. Under an Accumulative lens, the deepening is sufficient, but the absence of a felt trade-off caps impact.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring laughter by macerating grief—is signaled early and deepens when the paradox emerges: “joy and sorrow were twins.” The Conductor’s agency drives escalation (yanking cords, adjusting angles), culminating in a crescendo that cracks the household’s silence. Cost is felt in the bittersweetness of returned laughter and the Conductor’s dissolution. One tightening suffices at this length, though the absence of a concrete forfeiture (beyond emotional toll) narrowly prevents 9.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reconciling dimensional homesickness with present uncertainty—is signaled early and deepens when the pendant hums, forcing a choice. Escalation occurs through the guardian’s agency: choosing the “between” over return or stasis. Cost is felt (loss of sanctuary/prison duality) but not visibly paid; the price remains conceptual. Under an Accumulative lens, the cadence shift at “It waited no longer” effectively reweights stakes without causal turns.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—interrupting prophesied failure—is signaled early and tightens when Elian must choose between preserving the crozier or destroying it. His agency drives escalation: successive approximation leads to the pivotal decision to embrace total destruction. Cost is felt (“irreversible loss”) and visible in the explosion and suspenseful void before rebirth. While pressure coheres under the Causal lens, the Guild prophecy remains abstract; a concrete consequence of failure (e.g., exile, death) would heighten stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—finding the beginning in every ending—is signaled early and deepens when Elara shifts from seeking signal to listening for silence. The meaningful tightening occurs when she abandons amplification for attenuation, narrowing her method to one counterintuitive act. Agency is clear: her choice to discard assumptions drives the breakthrough. Cost is felt conceptually—the surrender of certainty—but lacks visceral or material consequence beyond warmed/cooled fragments.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—merging timelines to restore the ferry—is signaled early and deepens when Eli realizes the vessel is scattered, not destroyed. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: he interprets patterns, aligns light, and coordinates with other selves. Cost is legible conceptually (permanent transient existence as liminal purgatory) and emotionally (jumbled memories, isolation). However, the tightening lacks a visible trade-off—no tool is lost, no option foreclosed—so the price feels abstract rather than viscerally paid, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—discovering the texture of connection—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes her weaving rewrites history. The eruption serves as the meaningful tightening: it forces her to choose between controlling the chaos or surrendering to transformation. Cost is legible in the altered childhood memory and the unsettling calm of acceptance. However, escalation leans slightly passive; the eruption happens *to* her rather than emerging directly from a flawed choice, softening agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming celestial navigation as cognitive and cultural anchor—is signaled early and deepens when xenocartography integrates alien charts. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she adapts her lesson, reigniting Kael’s curiosity. Cost is felt in the “grief for the simplicity lost” and the weight of obsolete knowledge made vital again. Under the Accumulative lens, this deepening reweights the stake without false resolution or coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—protecting fragile voices—is signaled early and deepens as pulses intensify. Pressure escalates texturally: silence thickens, static yields voice, photograph warms. Elara’s agency lies in attention and assurance, not action; her choice to listen forecloses oblivion at emotional cost. Coincidence doesn’t resolve—Eleanor’s emergence follows pulse logic. However, stakes remain internalized without external complication, slightly limiting tactical evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—returning the codex before tidal seal—is signaled early and tightens via physical danger (phase transitions) and psychological pressure (claustrophobia). Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to place the codex, triggering safe paths, then navigates unstable zones. Cost is felt (panic, risk of entrapment) but remains abstract; a concrete loss (e.g., damaged suit, lost tool) would heighten stakes. Coincidence doesn’t resolve—success stems from her persistence.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—fetching wisdom from failure—is signaled early and tightens when ink patterns force confrontation with her recklessness. Agency drives escalation: she chooses to defragment, sees her error, accepts cost. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; the deepening is internal but visceral. Cost is felt (Kael’s loss, her guilt) though external stakes remain minimal—a slight limitation at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—saving the last traces of a dying language through sonic translation—is signaled early and tightens when the diamond’s curse threatens to shatter both mind and mission. The meaningful deepening occurs when Elara shifts tactics from command to mimicry, narrowing her agency to alignment rather than mastery. Cost is felt: she abandons the dream of perfect transcription for something messier but alive. Escalation is driven by her choices, not coincidence—the birds arrive because she waited correctly, and the tunnel responds to her voice only when she mirrors their flight.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—transforming collective trauma into liberating absurdity—is signaled early and deepens when the confession “The harmony untamed is dying” reframes the mission. Aris’s agency drives escalation: placing the arrowhead, dialing the void, laughing into static. Cost is legible in the spent phone and the changed ones’ irreversible transformation. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; causality flows from Aris’s method and the garden’s rules. One tightening suffices, but the shift lacks a tangible sacrifice beyond emotional labor.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—reawakening beauty against mechanical control—is signaled early and deepens meaningfully when Elara risks everything to play the heartbeat rhythm. The tightening occurs in the central clearing: she must choose between safety and soul-deep vulnerability, with the cost being potential failure or destruction. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves the conflict. However, the mechanical order’s collapse feels slightly frictionless—no resistance beyond initial tracking—softening the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—reconnecting divided families—is signaled early, but escalation is atmospheric, not causal. The drone arrival is a delivery, not a turning point that narrows options or imposes cost. Pressure remains static; coincidence (the drone’s timely arrival) facilitates resolution rather than testing Elian’s agency under rising tension.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming lost wonder through silent creation—is signaled early and deepens when Elias sings, risking emotional exposure. The meaningful tightening occurs when the halo fragment’s gleam intensifies, forcing a choice: remain silent or give voice to memory. His agency drives escalation; coincidence (the wrong turn) complicates but doesn’t resolve. Cost is felt: his voice, rough from disuse, carries the weight of ancestral memory, altering his identity. No off-stage resolution; stakes remain viscerally anchored in wood, brass, and breath.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—finding where stories live—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s use of hyperbolic geometry to activate analog memories. Agency is clear: her precise gestures narrow possibility into manifestation. Cost is visible (loss of the scarf, permanent shift in solitude), though escalation relies more on accumulation than tactical trade-offs. No external opposition dilutes pressure slightly, but internal stakes remain coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—capturing the runaway dream—is signaled early and tightens at sunrise when the dream resists vitalization. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she adjusts exposure, pours in longing, traces form with light-brushes. Cost is felt in the dream’s temporary solidity and subsequent dissolution. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; victory comes through persistent, costly artistry under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—freeing an idea trapped behind fear—is signaled early and deepens when the first star delivers the cryptic directive. Elian’s agency drives the escalation: he traces the ribbon, inserts the hair, endures disorientation, and whispers release. The cost is legible in the inert token and his continued solitude, though it remains conceptual rather than visceral. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens, but the “guardians of fear” are too abstract to exert tangible opposition, weakening the friction that should sharpen the climactic choice.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering stolen memories—is signaled early and tightens when Elara realizes fairies encrypted them via mushrooms. Her agency drives escalation: she maps rings to stars, nudges fungi into alignment. Cost is visible in the “chilling silence” of loss and the physical toll (“hands trembling”). Coincidence doesn’t resolve; victory comes from hands-on method applied under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reversible exile—is signaled early and tightens when Elian must choose between anger and annotation. Pressure escalates through the archivist’s retreats and the swing’s creaks, culminating in Elian’s realization that “exile reverses when you stop fighting yourself.” Cost is felt: he surrenders his shield of anger. The escalation is protagonist-driven under an Accumulative lens—deepening via pattern recognition, not external conflict—and the price (emotional vulnerability) alters his tactics decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder—is signaled early and deepens as gray malaise spreads. Pressure escalates texturally (color loss → seed planting → renewal), but conflict lacks opposition or complication; success arrives without resistance. Agency is present (she chooses to weave), yet no real option is foreclosed, and no price is paid. The “tightening” is atmospheric, not tactical or consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—grounding restless spirits—is signaled early and deepens through the interlaced hush’s resistance, which tightens as knots loosen. Elara’s agency drives escalation: each deliberate pick at a knot invites heavier silence, forcing endurance over avoidance. The cost is felt physically (“hard to breathe”) and existentially (ongoing duty). While pressure coheres well under the Accumulative lens, the opposition lacks adaptive complexity—it resists but doesn’t counter-strategize—limiting the depth of tactical trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—bridging known/unknown—is signaled early and deepens via video comparison revealing the fissure’s change. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her methodical curiosity narrows options until only physical intervention remains. Cost is visible: emotional exposure (“guarded her heart but remained alert”) paid upon entering the chapel. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; decades-long erosion merely enables her earned choice.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding surrender—is signaled early and deepens when Elara connects Earhart’s vanishing to deliberate release. The tightening occurs when she untangles literal threads to access logs, foreclosing her old method of clinging to memory. Cost is visible in her relinquishment of ghosts. Escalation is protagonist-driven under an Accumulative lens, though pressure remains internal rather than externalized.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to the unheard—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s encoding under time pressure. The tightening occurs when the ghost emerges, raising the stakes from personal expression to intersubjective validation. Cost is visible: her silence is exchanged for communal resonance, though the price feels conceptual rather than visceral. Agency is maintained throughout; coincidence (the storm) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the ghost responds only because of her precise, laborious encoding.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding joy beneath anguish—is signaled early and deepens via the diary’s revelations. Each floor narrows Elara’s emotional options, culminating in a stance crystallization at the summit. Agency is expressed through attention and interpretation, not physical action, fitting the Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual (accepting that joy coexists with pain) and felt in her swelling heart, though no tangible loss (time, tool, opportunity) alters tactics mid-ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—proving “empty spaces remember”—is signaled early and deepens through cataloging, but pressure remains internal and abstract. The “quietly explosive” tension never translates into a concrete choice with visible cost; Elias’s work proceeds uninterrupted, unchallenged by environment or limitation. Escalation relies on accumulative intensity rather than agency-driven narrowing of options, which fits the lens but lacks tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—mirroring the sky before demolition—is signaled early and deepens when Elara confronts the core paradox: replication kills the soul of the infinite. Her agency drives escalation (searching, decoding, painting), and the cost—accepting artistic limits—is unmistakable in her retreat. The tightening occurs when the mural’s beauty reveals its lie, narrowing her path to renunciation. Coincidence (warmer book spine) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the lock mechanism is earned through ancestral legacy and tactile skill.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—charting a hidden sky-path—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Elara deciphers the hopscotch grid. Her agency drives escalation: she acts, interprets, verifies. However, pressure lacks visceral consequence; the “cost” remains abstract (loneliness) rather than tangible (e.g., risking ridicule, losing time, damaging equipment). The captain’s immediate compliance softens tension, though his rare shoulder-clap offers minor relational payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—learning the rhythm of repair—is signaled early and deepens when prophecy reframes it as alignment, not force. The tightening occurs at the vial: Elara must choose to uncap, risking exposure to painful memories. Cost is conceptual (confronting loss) but not viscerally felt; escalation relies on revelation over resistance, fitting the Accumulative lens but lacking tangible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—survival through collective faith—is signaled early and tightens when Jax demands they “reexamine” the plan, forcing a crisis of belief. Elara’s choice to persist exacts emotional cost (enduring doubt) and physical toll (weeks of labor). Agency drives escalation: their focused will amplifies the chime, triggering planetary response. Coincidence never resolves; the ghost guides, but humans act. Cost is felt in fatigue and frayed trust, legible in Jax’s dust-kicking frustration.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whispering the lullaby before midnight—is signaled early and tightens as the clock nears its final toll. Elara’s agency drives escalation: placing the puppet head, drawing out the melody, whispering despite cost. The “bruised awe” reflects moral calculus between futility and grace. However, external opposition is abstract (time, entropy), so pressure relies entirely on internal resolve—effective but limiting for causal escalation; fits Accumulative lens well.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—saving travelers before frost—is clear by paragraph two and tightens meaningfully when birds intensify patrols, forcing Elara to time impressions carefully. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses risk over safety, precision over haste. The cost is felt in her pounding heart, warmer device, and ultimate solitude. One tightening suffices for this length, and it narrows live options while raising emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—atonement through meaningful connection—is signaled early and deepens when Aris reinterprets transient bonds as unity, not failure. His agency drives the escalation: tracing foam leads to insight, which crystallizes into lab action. The cost is felt in his enduring grief, now “loosened” but present, and the foreclosed path of self-punishment. Pressure tightens once, sufficiently for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—accessing the source of stories—is signaled early and deepens when Elara shifts from erasure to origin-seeking. The tightening occurs when she uses moonlight to incise absence, narrowing her path from passive waiting to active creation. Cost is visible: spent moonlight, emotional vulnerability (“quantified absence of fear”). Yet escalation leans on lyric accumulation over causal pressure; the arrival of the first patron feels coincidental rather than earned by prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake (transforming collective remorse) is signaled early but never tested under coherent pressure. Kaelen’s method faces no obstacle—remorse yields passively to his touch, removing tension. The “emotionally contagious” attribute introduces potential cost but is never leveraged into a tactical dilemma or sacrifice. Escalation is textural, not causal, and lacks protagonist-driven deepening with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reuniting fractured communities through shared rhythm—is signaled early and deepens via the grain elevator talk. Pressure escalates coherently: Elara’s interspersed languages prime collaboration, culminating in joint repair. The tightening occurs when representatives arrive, narrowing options to collective action or continued silence. Cost is conceptual (lost time, eroded trust) rather than tangible, slightly muting escalation’s visceral impact under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—becoming “archeologist of abandoned dreams”—is signaled early but remains abstract. Pressure accumulates texturally (more memories, deeper reverie) but never forces a trade-off or narrows options. The climax (embracing a child’s dream) lacks resistance; integration appears effortless. No visible loss—time, sanity, identity—is incurred, so cost remains conceptual, not visceral. Coincidence (moon alignment) enables resolution rather than protagonist agency under constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering the forgotten combinations—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s confrontation with prior failure. The inverted-gravity window forces urgency, and threshold effects escalate pressure by warping self-perception. Her agency drives every turn: interpreting the doodle, holding vigilance, choosing reentry. Cost is conceptual but felt: she forfeits her former self, becoming eternal watcher. One tightening—reentering the central vault—narrows all future paths.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring music to a silent world—is signaled immediately and tightens when the hedgehog uncurls, marking the first crack in silence. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she doesn’t wait for sound but deciphers it from fracture patterns, then builds an instrument. Cost is felt in the fragility of the moment—her shallow breath, the grove “holding its breath”—and in the irreversible shift from solitude to shared song. Coincidence (hedgehog) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her interpretive labor.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring the eclipsed covenant before celestial alignment—is signaled early and tightens via protagonist agency: Kael’s method of “translating silence” forces him to correlate magnetic whispers with stone memory, narrowing options to one precise act. The deepening occurs when he realizes the nexus is a focal point “weakened but not dead,” raising cost: failure means permanent eclipse. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of silence intensifies until the final correlation. Cost is unmistakable: redemption is partial (“breathing again,” not restored), and the path remains arduous, foreclosing easy return.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering the diary to preserve empathetic silence—is signaled early and tightens as fireworks approach. The meaningful deepening occurs when external noise threatens her work, forcing intensified focus. Yet the escalation is atmospheric rather than agentic; Elara isn’t forced to sacrifice anything tangible—no tool fails, no memory falters. Cost is conceptual (time, peace) but not dramatized as a trade-off; the fireworks complicate but don’t constrict her actual ability to act. Agency lies in attention, which suffices under an Accumulative lens, but lacks visceral price.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—germinating the seed to access wisdom—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes patience, not force, is required. The tightening occurs when her nose detects the soil’s “hint of activation,” narrowing her options from active intervention to receptive stillness. Cost is felt: she abandons ambition’s “sharp thorn” for serenity, altering her relationship to growth itself. Coincidence (“collective shift in thought”) complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency lies in her interpretive choice to trust the scent.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—discovering the source of resilience—is signaled early and tightens when gravity inverts, creating a one-hour deadline that forces passive drifting over active piloting. Kaelen’s agency is limited but meaningful: he chooses to follow the water, enters the canyon, and steps onto the soil—all narrowing options toward revelation. The cost is conceptual (ephemeral access) and felt in the dispersing echoes, though physical or emotional sacrifice remains absent.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—understanding “singular convergence” to prevent recurrence—is signaled early and deepens via wind data and patch discovery. Pressure tightens when wind shifts “with renewed fury,” forcing adaptation. Yet escalation is observational, not tactical; Elias never faces a live trade-off (e.g., time vs. accuracy, safety vs. evidence). Cost is conceptual (Kael’s death), but no on-page forfeiture alters his method, limiting felt urgency under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—freeing trapped wonder—is signaled early and deepens when auroral alignment and sculptor’s strike converge, narrowing Elara’s window to a singular moment. Agency is clear: her precise bell-ringing initiates release. Cost is conceptual (the inert amber sheet, the altered silence) but felt in the cavern’s transformation. However, escalation leans on external synchronicity; while thematically apt, the pressure doesn’t arise solely from Elara’s choices, slightly softening the tightening under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—harvesting wisdom from failure—is signaled early and deepens through interworld journeys that narrow options (each realm reveals a missed perspective). Protagonist agency drives escalation: arranging markers, choosing which failures to witness. Cost is felt in the citadel’s replayed fall and the irreversible loss of relics. The single meaningful tightening occurs when insight crystallizes into clarity, altering his stance toward silence and duty.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate cleanly under Accumulative pressure: each borrowed personality deepens disorientation until lucid turbulence peaks, then collapses into clarity. Elara’s agency drives every turn—feeding paper, choosing imprints—and the cost is unmistakable: the loss of her method and the identities she consumed. The final renunciation forecloses her old path with quiet finality.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—coaxing wonder from routine—is signaled early and deepens when the pendant extends the encounter, transforming a mundane delivery into mythic labor. The tightening occurs when Kaelen realizes his role as story-bearer, foreclosing passive courierhood. Cost is conceptual: he inherits Elara’s burden of meaning-making. Though the traveler’s arrival feels coincidental, it complicates rather than resolves, and Kaelen’s agency drives the insight. One meaningful deepening suffices, executed with lyrical precision.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—proving objects absorb emotion—is signaled early and tightens when the frost reveals Elara’s own buried guilt, foreclosing her assumption of objectivity. The deepening is protagonist-driven: her methodical communion escalates pressure until the prism reflects her complicity. Cost is unmistakable: loss of intellectual innocence, felt in the prism’s new weight. Under the Accumulative lens, this single intensification suffices, though a second tactical consequence (e.g., abandoning the method) would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—carrying “I remember” across impossible distance—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the sacrifice becomes clear: anchoring the message requires Elara’s essence. This narrowing forecloses survival, forcing renunciation with felt cost. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural escalation: silence “chews at the edges,” vitality drains with each shuttle pass, culminating in bodily dissolution. Agency drives every turn; coincidence never resolves. Cost is unmistakable on the page: “her body dissolving into threads of memory and hope.”

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—coaxing resilience from rubble—is signaled early and deepens when the silk enables alloy-forging. The tightening occurs at the barter: knowledge for transformative fabric. But cost is conceptual (meekness lost) rather than visceral; no tangible sacrifice (tool, time, relationship) alters tactics. Escalation relies on accumulation, not protagonist-driven pressure under the Accumulative lens, weakening agency in key turns.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—discovering the weight of withheld truth—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the shard enables weaving. The meaningful deepening occurs at the rift: Kaelen doesn’t just witness alternate truths but actively stabilizes chaos to extract coherence, narrowing options from infinite branches to one painful clarity. Cost is unmistakable: the truth is love-as-sacrifice, which forecloses any fantasy of simple answers. Agency drives escalation—his will focuses the shard, his dance weaves strands—and the cyclically spontaneous power imposes real pressure (only moments before fade).

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—protecting the channel through restored light—is signaled early and tightens when Cora’s note reveals the haunting’s threat. Elian’s agency drives escalation: he interprets the letter, builds a cairn, confronts the cold, and reignites the lamp. Cost is felt in the “oppressive cold” and lingering ache, though the malevolent presence lacks tangible consequence beyond mood. One meaningful deepening suffices, but the antagonist remains abstract, slightly muting stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—using light to guide transformation through storm—is signaled early and deepens via intensifying visions of renewal. Yet escalation remains atmospheric rather than tactical: Kael’s adjustments feel like repetition (“steered the beam,” “adjusted the lenses”) without meaningful consequence or narrowing of choice. The storm’s arrival increases sensory pressure but doesn’t force a new decision or sacrifice; his role is performative, not reactive. Cost is conceptual (“fraught with loss”) but never dramatized—no tool breaks, no vision demands a painful trade, no option closes. Under an Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices, but the lack of tangible price prevents high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding why stories cling to certain souls—is signaled early and deepens through Kaelen’s ritual with the wing. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: he doesn’t passively receive insight but actively manipulates light, risking misinterpretation. The tightening comes when the wing crumbles, foreclosing further inquiry and forcing acceptance of partial knowledge. Cost is felt: the donor heart’s vitality is both gift and burden, binding him to a web of stories he didn’t choose but must now inhabit.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—deconstructing quantified sorrow—is signaled early and deepens when the pin-drop shifts the tower’s energy, forcing Elara to act. Her agency is clear: she aligns the sextant with dream maps, directing it toward the trees. The escalation is driven by her choices under pressure, culminating in tangible cost: the dissolution of her sorrow requires surrendering its precision for the messy abundance of ordinary joy—a credible trade-off that reweights her worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—rekindling the realm via woven dawns—is signaled early and tightens when Elara sings alone at the brink, narrowing options to one fragile act. The escalation is protagonist-driven: her voice swaddles light, which then draws others, deepening stakes through communal reconnection. Cost is legible: the realm’s near-extinction and her vocal vulnerability. Yet the “bound release” resolution leans slightly coincidental—the communities instantly join without friction, softening the price of isolation overcome.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—transforming guilt into wisdom—is signaled early and tightens at midnight when Elara must choose whether to speak. Her agency is clear: she shares her story, a renunciation of silence with emotional cost. Pressure escalates via internal conflict, not external obstacles, fitting a Situational lens. However, the “ritual” resolution borders on coincidental convenience; the elder appears precisely when needed, reducing the sense of earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory against erasure—is signaled early via the vanished geese and bakery. Pressure tightens when Elara shifts from passive remembrance (placing bread) to active excavation (uncloaking the journal), narrowing her path from observer to inheritor. Cost is felt in the weight of responsibility she now bears; the “slow, indifferent march of time” can no longer be merely witnessed. Coincidence doesn’t resolve—she earns insight through labor.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving meaning before total oblivion—is signaled early and tightens as projections fade. Elian’s agency drives escalation: he samples frequencies, discovers patterns, and quickens pace as the slide dims. The cost is conceptual but undeniable: knowledge lost forever, replaced only by fragile records. Under an Accumulative lens, this single deepening (queen’s vow) suffices to reweight the entire endeavor, though the absence of physical or emotional sacrifice slightly softens the price.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—protecting the moonshine route by exposing Silas’s betrayal—is clear early and tightens as Elara uses false starts to manipulate his sense of security. The escalation is driven by her agency: each feint refines her observation until the climax where greed undoes Silas. Cost is felt conceptually (loss of trust as a tangible sound) and temporally (sunrise deadline). Coincidence doesn’t resolve; Silas’s own flaw does. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—understanding why people carry weather—is signaled early and deepens when the man reveals carriers are “anchors” balancing planetary systems. The forest elections heighten atmospheric energy, escalating pressure and making the phenomenon visible. Elara’s agency drives the encounter; she tastes, interprets, approaches. Cost is felt: she accepts complexity over simplicity, a quiet but resonant trade-off that crystallizes her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clear from the outset: rectify artistic soul by reclaiming creativity. The tightening occurs when Elara deciphers the note’s combination—her mnemonic gift shifts from curse to key—narrowing her path to one decisive act: drawing on the crystal wall. Cost is legible in her “auroral sorrow” and the abandoned lock, symbolizing irreversible commitment. Yet the escalation leans slightly on internal realization over external pressure; the gallery mockery remains off-stage, softening the antagonistic force.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving truth in a world of forgetting—is signaled early and tightens when lies wilt her talismans, forcing tactical shifts (e.g., seeking the child’s candor). The deepening occurs at the archive: conversations aren’t lost but archived, raising the cost of inaction. Agency is clear—Aria pieces the map, journeys, activates the console—but the escalation leans slightly on discovery over decision. Still, the price (toxic world, frayed ecosystem) consistently shapes her path.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder—is signaled early and tightens when Elara observes its dimming at sunset, forcing her to act despite muteness. Her agency drives escalation: fine-tuning the largest bell culminates in the symphony that restores vibrancy. Cost is felt (her voice lost, labor unceasing) and legible in the climax, though the opposition lacks tangible resistance—deception is abstract, not dramatized—which slightly softens pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (silencing inner static) tightens via magnetic shift destabilizing the dome, forcing Kael to act before systems fail. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he chooses miniaturization, then ignition. Cost is felt in fragmented wholeness and burdened freedom. Coincidence (magnetic shift) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the burn succeeds via Kael’s precise preparation, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—unlocking grief through listening—is signaled early and deepens through neighborhood testimony. Yet escalation relies on coincidence (locket falling from truck) and summary (“she learned that the locket contained…”) rather than protagonist-driven pressure. Elara’s agency is passive: she gathers stories but doesn’t confront obstacles or make costly choices. The mailbox’s opening resolves cleanly without tangible trade-off, softening the stakes’ felt weight despite thematic sincerity.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—liberating trapped subjects and herself—is signaled early and deepens as journal entries reveal ethical horrors. Pressure escalates texturally via decoded layers, not causally; each dance intensifies understanding but lacks tactical consequence or narrowing of options. The climax resolves through symbolic alignment (dice + code + dance), not protagonist-driven reversal with visible cost. Stakes remain abstract—no time limit, physical threat, or resource depletion forces hard trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost memory—is signaled early and tightens when gravity fluctuations force clumsy navigation, raising physical cost. The deepening occurs in the chamber: digging becomes arduous due to shifting gravity, making the exhumation feel perilous. Agency drives escalation—Elara chooses to brew coffee, follow the map, dig—never relying on coincidence for resolution. Final cost is felt in the weight of remembered loss, though the whale’s role borders on convenient catalyst without clearer causal linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.3)
    Dominant stake—hushing a coded prophecy—is declared but never tested through opposition or complication. No meaningful deepening occurs; the ritual proceeds smoothly from start to finish. Agency is passive endurance, not decision under pressure, and “cost” is implied rather than felt. Coincidence doesn’t resolve, but neither does struggle—escalation is textual thickening, not consequential narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the city’s hidden language—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist dares to interrogate Finch directly, risking dissolution of their fragile pact. This act of “interrogating silence” escalates from passive listening to active confrontation, narrowing options: truth or continued pretense. Cost is felt in Finch’s fading form and the burden of solitary continuation. Escalation stems from protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, though the meteor shower’s peak feels slightly coincidental rather than causally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—freedom from a quarantined memory—is signaled early and deepens through the ritual. Pressure escalates texturally via rising luminosity and humming stones, culminating in archival. Yet the “resonance structures” operate as magical convenience; their mechanics aren’t tested or shown to impose limits, weakening the cost. The true price—confronting maternal loss—is emotionally legible, but the method dilutes agency by outsourcing transformation to ambient magic.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—forgiving the unfinished—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s confrontation with her forged documents’ lingering harm. The tightening occurs when she draws the thorn across the “invisible seam,” a decisive renunciation that dissolves bonds with visible emotional cost. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, though the conflict is entirely internal with no external opposition or adaptation. Agency is present but narrowly expressed through ritual rather than dynamic choice under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—restoring authentic echoes—is signaled early and deepens via progressive disclosure. Pressure escalates texturally: false echoes thicken, then Kaelen’s song cuts through them. Cost is legible (“sacrifices not in vain,” “weight of sorrow”), but agency leans passive—he perceives and sings, yet doesn’t *choose* between conflicting paths under duress. The shadowy group exerts off-page pressure; the real antagonist is corruption itself, which limits tangible opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—salvaging purity via truth-telling—tightens when Kaelen chooses how to frame Elias’s sacrifice for Anya, narrowing options from raw fact to compassionate narrative. Pressure escalates through dream collection (agency-driven), culminating in the inland visit where emotional risk peaks. Cost is visible: Anya’s tears and Kaelen’s burden of stewardship. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; every turn stems from his method. Minor deduction: stakes remain internalized without external opposition raising tangible peril.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—honoring unseen labor—is signaled early but never pressured; no obstacle tests Kaelen’s resolve. The “tightening” is thematic deepening, not escalation under pressure. Under an Accumulative lens, this suffices, but agency remains passive observation, not decision or renunciation with tangible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. safety—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Kaelen realizes the liquidation was murder, not accident. His agency drives escalation: reassembling letters, intuiting patterns, digging for the gem. The cost is unmistakable: sharing truth risks another liquidation; silence burdens him alone. Pressure coheres under Causal lens, though the “bargain, a life for a life” remains abstract—its mechanics aren’t tested on-page, slightly softening the price.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—uniting fractured factions through prophetic insight—is signaled early and tightens during the council scene where Elara’s interpretation turns debate. Variant allegiance creates friction, but its escalation feels abstract; rivalries shift “like sand in a gale” without concrete betrayals altering tactics. The cost of unity (loneliness, risk of betrayal) is implied but not viscerally paid in-scene. Escalation relies more on lyrical accumulation than protagonist-driven agency narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving lost voices against time’s erosion—is signaled early and tightens through the music box’s fragile tune. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to sweeten with his voice, deepening the capture. Cost is felt (“weight of his quest”) and visible (trembling hands), though the pressure remains internal and accumulative rather than externally contested. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—protecting the key from destabilizing vibrations—is signaled early and tightens as ice thins under sunset’s wane. Escalation occurs via environmental pressure (shifting ice, skewed vibrations), forcing Kaelen to adapt through breath-key synchronization. Yet agency feels limited; success hinges on innate skill, not a costly choice. No live option is foreclosed—failure is implied but never truly at hand, muting felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—liberation from frantic cycles—is signaled early and deepened through Elara’s personal creed and the gathered community’s quiet resolve. Escalation occurs via the moon-path convergence, a protagonist-driven trigger that narrows the window for action to a single, charged moment. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: the surrender of urgency as cultural identity, rendered visible in the collective breath held “by shared purpose.” While pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, the lack of tangible opposition or individual sacrifice slightly softens the stakes’ visceral bite.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. institutional control—is signaled early and tightens when Elara finds the ledger, forcing a binary choice: comply or defy. The meaningful deepening occurs at Thorn’s entrance, raising personal risk. Cost is legible: she risks career, safety, and stability. Escalation is driven by her agency (empirical observation leads to evidence), though the hidden compartment slightly softens causality. Pressure remains coherent under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming apology into action—is signaled early and deepens when the mechanic’s verdict feels like “final judgment.” The tightening occurs when the chaplain shifts from passive bearer to active learner, narrowing his path to hands-on repair. Agency drives escalation: his declaration “I want to learn” alters tactics under the Accumulative lens. Cost is felt in the hours of labor and emotional vulnerability, though the external stakes remain internalized.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to the algorithm’s yearning—is signaled early and tightens when Elara decodes the final sequence, triggering the chime. Escalation is driven by her agency: each kaleidoscope turn deepens understanding, raising emotional stakes. Cost is felt in the algorithm’s silence post-chime and Elara’s isolation (“no one heard it yet”). However, external pressure remains static—the acid sea threatens but never actively impedes, slightly muting tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—uncovering where deleted files go—is signaled early and deepens into exposing corporate sabotage. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elara lies to access the cluster, narrowing her options (risking career) and raising cost (moral complicity). Pressure coheres under Accumulative logic: each recurrence of 11-23-35 intensifies the distress signal’s urgency. Yet the escalation relies more on discovery than active protagonist-driven pressure; the crew’s fate is passively uncovered rather than wrestled from opposition, slightly muting agency at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring balance before the ice crushes villages—is clear early and tightens when Kaelen realizes the orb must be spiritually, not physically, mended. The meaningful deepening occurs in the store: each mirror reveals incremental wholeness, raising urgency as the ice groans louder. Cost is legible: his past failure haunts him, and the spiritual reconstitution demands full empathic alignment. Yet the escalation leans slightly on convenience—the exact right mirrors appear without trial or error, softening the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—learning the sound of endings—is signaled early and deepens through trawling’s meditative repetition. Pressure escalates texturally, not causally: each haul reinforces her shift from self-destruction to witness. The cost is conceptual (abandoning planned death) but felt through embodied stillness. However, escalation lacks a tightening choice; she doesn’t *decide* to live so much as drift into endurance, which slightly softens agency under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—reconciling past love—is signaled early, and the deepening occurs through vineyard parallels. But escalation lacks agency-driven pressure; realizations unfold passively, not through choices that narrow options. The “final bus” sets a timeframe but exerts no active pressure—the sentinel isn’t racing against it. Cost is conceptual (“fragility of connections”) but not viscerally dramatized or paid in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving wisdom before it fades—is signaled early and deepens as Kael consecrates the clearing. Pressure accumulates texturally: whispers gain clarity, the parapet synchronizes, seekers arrive. Yet escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening; the parapet’s rise feels reactive, not earned through struggle. Cost is conceptual (eternal vigilance) but not viscerally felt in choices—Kael faces no tangible trade-off or loss during consecration, softening the stakes’ bite.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—transmuting collective pain into healing through art—is signaled early and deepens as locals engage. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she arranges photos, listens, exhibits. Cost is felt (grief voiced, past unearthed), but pressure remains soft; no live option is foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized. The tightening is emotional (more visitors) rather than consequential under the Accumulative lens, missing a moment where success demands sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—reviving linguistic growth in an age of fixity—is clear early and intensifies through Elara’s solitary labor. The meaningful deepening occurs when fractured echoes coalesce into a heartbeat rhythm, transforming abstract research into urgent revelation. Her decision to testify carries conceptual cost: breaking reticence in a silent world. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, though external opposition is absent, relying entirely on internal and societal inertia.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—capturing the sound of growing older—is signaled early and deepens as the prophet’s tools fail and memory slips. Pressure escalates via his own attribute: precognitive flashes vanish, forcing reliance on fragile driftwood markers. The meaningful tightening occurs when chalk wears to a stub, raising stakes to a final attempt. Cost is legible in the snapped chalk and evaporated purpose, though the resolution leans slightly toward passive acceptance rather than active renunciation under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—capturing the solar flare before it vanishes—is signaled early and tightens when tremors threaten instrument integrity. The meaningful deepening occurs when Elara realizes success requires syncing the camera’s shutter with the flare’s “escape velocity,” forcing her to halt time itself—a trade-off that forecloses temporal continuity for preservation. Agency is clear: her decision to use the leaf-fall recording drives the climax, and the cost (permanent emotional ache) is legible in the ending. While pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, escalation leans slightly more on lyrical intensification than concrete narrowing of options, preventing a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—executing a flawless goodbye—is signaled early and tightens when Elara proposes the recorded message, narrowing options from passive presence to active reconciliation. The escalation is driven by Elara’s agency under an Accumulative lens: each hymn deepens Alistair’s reconnection. Cost is felt in his trembling voice and Lena’s tears. Coincidence (Lena arriving “that evening”) slightly undermines causality but doesn’t resolve core conflict—it merely enables the payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—stabilizing fractured physics by recovering lost knowledge—is signaled early and escalates through Elara’s ritual, which succeeds partially but cracks the key and stirs deeper threats. This tightening forecloses easy resolution and imposes visible cost: the broken tool, the realization this is only the beginning. Agency is clear—every turn stems from her deliberate actions under pressure. The escalation is protagonist-driven, coherent under a Causal lens, and the cost directly shapes the final image of her kneeling, already planning the next step.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reconciling shattered maternal trust—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s shift from yearning to active mending. The tightening occurs when she chooses ritual over despair, narrowing options to one path: bone-setting the world. Cost is felt in the burial and dissolution of the tooth, though the fae-realm connection slightly softens consequence with wonder. Agency remains protagonist-driven; no coincidence resolves core conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—sharing non-violent light—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes villagers “feared the dark.” The meaningful tightening occurs when she decides to leave the grotto, trading safety for vulnerability. Cost is felt (“weighing that decision felt like holding the entire ocean”) but remains conceptual rather than concrete (no lost tool, time, or social consequence shown). Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, though the pressure lacks a tangible obstacle beyond internal hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming public shame into private meaning—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s proactive resolve. The tightening occurs not via external pressure but internal escalation: from fleeing judgment to offering the pendant as seed. Cost is felt in their “shared fatigue” and the weight of exposure, made visible in the quiet pact. Under an Accumulative lens, escalation reads as cadence shift—from observation to action—and the drip pattern becomes a methodology for healing. Agency is clear, though the conflict’s resolution leans slightly on environmental harmony over interpersonal risk.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving ephemeral hopes before narrative closure—is signaled early and tightens as the “whisper of closing pages” grows louder. Elara’s agency lies in attention and solemnization, not physical action, which suits the lens. Yet the cost remains abstract: we’re told hopes vanish, but no tangible loss (e.g., a missed cameo due to fatigue) alters her tactics. The escalation is textual (more cameos, brighter shell), not tactical, limiting felt pressure despite lyrical intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—restoring the arbor through forgotten songs—is signaled early and deepens as the harvest moon’s symbolic alignment approaches. Pressure accumulates texturally rather than causally: each hum intensifies the golden stories until convergence. The protagonist drives escalation through agency (singing, tinkering), but no real obstacle tests her commitment—blight vanishes effortlessly at climax. Cost is conceptual (the burden of memory) but lacks concrete forfeiture, weakening stakes under a strict causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—mapping intangible heartbeats—is signaled early and tightens through each flash-paper ignition, which narrows options by consuming limited starlight. Agency is clear: Elara chooses slowness over haste despite bodily cost. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, though escalation lacks a true reversal; it deepens rather than complicates. Cost is felt (chapped hands, bone-deep cold) but not visibly transformative beyond endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—harvesting echoes before the wounded season ends—is signaled early and deepens as Elian deciphers the timer’s true purpose. His agency drives escalation: each observation refines his reconstruction, narrowing options until the device hums. Cost is legible in the temporal pressure (“days that bled into weeks”) and the irrevocable shift from broken mechanism to functioning bridge between ephemeral and eternal. No false resolutions; all progress stems from his labor.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—transforming intangible burdens into tangible art—is signaled early and deepens through each calcification, with the lamp’s waning fuel adding subtle pressure. The meaningful tightening occurs when fear’s “nebulous mass” threatens overwhelm, forcing Elara to recall whalebone flexibility—a micro-choice that shifts her stance from trapped to free. Cost is legible: stamina, focus, and the lamp’s life are spent; the final burden (love) integrates all others, foreclosing isolation. However, escalation leans textual over causal, limiting tactical evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reconciling “here and gone”—tightens via the carving act, which narrows emotional chaos into tangible form. Agency is clear: she chooses containment over collapse. The kettle’s whistle escalates pressure, forcing final strokes under deadline. Cost is felt: she trades immediacy of mourning for disciplined remembrance, but the escalation lacks a true reversal—only deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—making peace with fractured self—is signaled early and tightens when Elara enters the lagoon, narrowing options to confrontation or surrender. The deepening occurs at the island: the ghost’s silent presence forces Elara to reinterpret negotiation as acceptance, not transaction. Cost is visible in the abandoned camera wheel and transformed ambitions. While pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, escalation leans more on atmospheric intensification than protagonist-driven agency; Elara reacts to whispers rather than actively shaping the encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—transforming systemic failure into symbolic resilience—is signaled early and deepens when Kaelen realizes the terminal’s flaw is “not just structural but systemic.” His agency drives escalation: mapping tunnels, aligning reflectors, reviving the garden. Cost is visible in time, effort, and the irreversible choice to leave the sextant behind. However, external opposition is absent, and pressure remains internalized; the “maze of intentions” complicates but doesn’t actively resist, slightly softening the tightening required for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reconciling abandoned artistry with present vocation—is signaled early and deepens through tactile engagement with the clock and crystals. The meaningful tightening occurs when whispers harmonize with her work, transforming regret into acceptance. Agency is subtle but present: her choice to adjust the gear initiates the closure. Cost is conceptual (lost symphonies) yet legible in the “weight of silenced music”; however, external pressure is minimal, relying entirely on internal resonance under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the truth behind the Sunken Bell legend—is signaled early and deepens into confronting familial betrayal. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elara realizes the sundial points not to treasure but to a hidden flaw (the crack), foreclosing her original goal. Cost is legible: she relinquishes the tangible quest for intangible clarity. Agency drives escalation—her trained instincts lead her to reinterpret, not discover—consistent with the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving ancient knowledge—is signaled early and tightens through the decoding sequence. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her patience enables deciphering, which summons the weavers. Cost is conceptual (eternal responsibility) and felt in her bowed posture and “profound shift.” Yet no tangible loss occurs—no time, tool, or opportunity sacrificed—which slightly softens the pressure. Still, under an Accumulative lens, the deepening of wisdom suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—giving voice to living absences—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s projection, which narrows her emotional options by forcing confrontation with her own losses. The single meaningful intensification occurs when Kael’s presence materializes, raising the cost of her isolation. Agency is maintained through attention and endurance, and the conceptual price (bearing witness without resolution) is unmistakable in the final stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—reawakening beauty—is signaled early and deepens through the prince’s repeated failures and bodily toll (“bedraggled,” “calloused hands”). The meaningful tightening occurs when he abandons pure mechanics for organic elements (moss, dew), narrowing his approach. Cost is visible: years lost, physical degradation, and the bittersweet knowledge the rebirth is transient. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, though escalation relies more on accumulation than a single decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—proving scars can sing—is signaled early and deepens through the grafting ritual. Pressure escalates via Elara’s confrontation with her past (coin, father’s tune) while tending the girl’s wounds. Agency is expressed through endurance and attention, not decision, fitting the Accumulative lens. Cost is felt in emotional exposure (“heart ached”) and the irreversible act of giving away the coin—a tangible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—liberating trapped memories—is signaled early and tightens through the geese’s pause, a live temporal constraint. Elara’s agency drives escalation: each shard collected narrows the path to the Grand Fountain. The cost is felt in physical weight, time pressure, and emotional burden. However, opposition is diffuse (silence, neglect), reducing friction; stakes remain internalized without external complication beyond environment.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving/transmitting the garden’s light—is signaled early and tightens when sonar reveals the fissure. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she inserts the gear, recalculates cycles, then repurposes sonar to encode memory. The cost is felt in irreversible dimming and generational decline. While pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, the “anomaly” discovery feels slightly passive; a more active confrontation with decay would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—discovering grief’s shape—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s retracing, which narrows her understanding from abstract quest to embodied network. Agency is expressed through attention and ritual (matching ribbons to butterflies, trading poems), culminating in a Charged Poise: she chooses to continue carving with renewed meaning. Cost is felt in the grandfather’s fading and the irreversible passage of migration. Escalation is driven by her choices under the Accumulative lens, though external pressure remains gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—restoring shared balance—is signaled early and tightens when the pendulum hitches, forcing Elias to choose between mechanical precision and emotional surrender. His agency drives escalation: he decodes, adjusts, and ultimately forgives himself through action. Cost is felt in decades of isolation and the “screams swallowed by the sea.” Coincidence doesn’t resolve; his diligence does. Slight deduction: stakes remain internalized, with village impact implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the sovereign case’s purpose—is signaled early and tightens when the hidden journal reveals the prior gardener’s unfinished mission. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her decision to untangle threads leads to the compartment, then the map, culminating in her commitment to continue his work. Cost is felt conceptually—the burden of inherited legacy—but lacks visceral immediacy (no time loss, physical toll, or social risk). Under an Accumulative lens, the deepening of thematic stakes suffices, though a sharper trade-off would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—overcoming societal stagnation through constrained innovation—is signaled early and tightens when predictive models reveal risks of monopoly, forcing Kaelen to refine his approach toward collaborative knowledge-sharing. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency (modeling, revising, choosing narrative form), not coincidence. Cost is legible in the relinquishment of direct control and the acceptance that change must be self-sustaining, not authored.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving stories against erasure—is signaled early and tightens when Elara begins embedding codes, raising personal risk. The deepening occurs with the fallen king lyric, which intensifies both narrative weight and danger. Cost is felt (vigilant authorities, fragile hope) but remains largely conceptual; a tangible loss (e.g., a discovered score, physical consequence) would heighten pressure. Escalation stems from protagonist agency, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reconciling the illusion of safety—is signaled early and tightens when Elara chooses to destroy the mask, foreclosing preservation of the fantasy. Agency is clear: she acts despite incomplete knowledge, accepting ambiguity as part of truth-weaving. Cost is felt in the irreversible pulverization and emotional labor of forgiveness. One meaningful deepening suffices, though escalation could be sharper if secrets posed active resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving navigational knowledge against mythic regression—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure escalates texturally through memory of rival factions and Elara’s internal resistance, culminating in her discovery of tidal equations. But the conflict remains intellectual rather than visceral; no on-page consequence arises from her “rebellion,” and the cost (isolation) is asserted, not dramatized through interaction or loss. Agency is passive endurance, which fits Earned Stasis, yet the price lacks concrete manifestation.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reviving vanishing arts through reconciliation—is signaled early and deepens when Elara shifts from seeking an object to enacting a method. The tightening occurs when she chooses to teach “by subtracting noise,” foreclosing didactic instruction in favor of vulnerable silence. Cost is conceptual: harmony requires enduring unresolved tensions (“not perfect, but honest”). Agency is clear, though external pressure remains internalized rather than dramatized through student resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—creating beauty from ruins—is signaled early and deepens via memory integration, but pressure remains internal and static. No meaningful tightening forecloses a live option; the celestial alignment adds urgency but doesn’t alter tactics. Cost (“pruning old sorrows”) is asserted, not dramatized through loss or consequence that reshapes behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—restoring power by preserving wonder—is signaled early and deepens when the riddle reframes technical failure as poetic necessity. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elara declares, “Then we must make the tower weep again,” foreclosing passive waiting. Cost is felt in physical exertion, emotional urgency, and Kael’s exhaustion. Escalation is protagonist-driven, though the resolution leans slightly on intuitive leap rather than rigorous causality, softening the pressure just enough to cap below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—understanding why houses feel alive—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes displacement sanctifies space. The tightening occurs when she places the orris root, narrowing her theory into practice with visible consequence (the house sighs). Cost is conceptual: she accepts ongoing responsibility (“She would continue her work”). Agency drives escalation, though the absence of external opposition softens pressure; stakes remain internal yet coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving truth versus embracing change—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the statue chooses to thread essence through structural weakness, accepting that vulnerability enables growth. Pressure escalates via protagonist-driven telepathic exploration, not coincidence, culminating in shared consciousness with other guardians. Cost is unmistakable: the statue abandons its identity as solitary sentinel, trading certainty for communal responsibility. The deepening from “eternal guardian” to “compassionate curator” narrows its options permanently.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—grasping the “texture of a missed opportunity”—is signaled early and deepens when the rupture reveals it as “resonance in the chaos.” Elara’s agency drives escalation: her proofs force the crack, and her laughter crystallizes stance. Cost is unmistakable: she abandons deterministic capture for acceptance, foreclosing her original path. Coincidence (dice rolls) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the tightening arises from her own balanced daring.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—proving strangers remember kindness—is signaled early and deepens through three escalating daydreams culminating in a modern bus scene. Pressure accumulates texturally, not causally, narrowing focus from ancient fig-gifts to present-day smiles. The cost is subtle: Elara’s insomnia and relentless labor, though not dramatized as sacrifice. Agency is clear (she chooses which memories to rouse), but stakes remain abstract until the final vision crystallizes their universality.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—rescuing a dying art—is signaled immediately and deepens when the beekeeper’s departure removes the assumed solution. Pressure escalates through failed reconstructions and fragmented elder memories, narrowing options until Elara must reinterpret her tools. The turning point is her agency: examining the lens casing, not waiting for external aid. Cost is visible in her hard, unreadable loaf and spiritual freeze, making the eventual warmth feel earned. Coincidence complicates (blight) but doesn’t resolve; the solution emerges from within the community’s existing resources.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—breaking free from predetermined fate—is signaled early and deepened through Elara’s reverse-engineering act. Agency is clear: she initiates, manipulates, and completes the circuit. Pressure escalates via the storm, tidal exposure, and yoyo’s resistance, culminating in a trade-off: infinite possibility for total disorientation. Cost is felt in the “bleak exhilaration” and loss of temporal coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—tricking fear into revealing weakness—is signaled early and tightens when the advisor demands unbosoming the root fear. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she reads her own notes, names the void’s paradox, and throws the clasp. Cost is felt: the clasp is destroyed, the advisor vanishes, and she must face life without cursed aids. Pressure coheres under Causal lens; no coincidences resolve conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming silence into music—is signaled early and tightens when the wave threatens destruction. The prophet’s agency drives escalation: he reads clouds, sketches resonance, dubs strands, then meets the wave with amplified sound. Cost is felt in his panting exhaustion and the “uneasy harmony” that replaces peace. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each sonic layer raises stakes until the wave demands total commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reconnecting with the lost expedition and overcoming isolation—is signaled early and deepens when Kaelen discovers the dissonance in the turtles’ harmonic resonance. His agency drives escalation: correlation, derivation, then performance of the pattern-language melody. The cost is conceptual but palpable: the city must confront its stagnation to earn communication. Though tension peaks cleanly, the watchers’ motives are revealed rather than tested, slightly softening the final trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—rescuing truth from noble lies—is clear early and deepens via the modern parallel. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her method leads directly to the marginal discovery. Cost is conceptual (truth’s pain) but not visceral; no resource is spent, no risk taken. The tightening occurs when “veritas” is found, foreclosing doubt—but the lack of opposition flattens pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rescuing meaning from oblivion—is signaled early and deepens when Elias confronts his own abandoned dream. Pressure escalates texturally: water’s “lethargic pull,” the fish’s disruptive ripple, the drawbridge locking him in. His agency lies in renunciation (burying his confession), which forecloses a path with felt cost. Though coincidence (the fish) complicates, it doesn’t resolve; all escalation stems from Elias’s deliberate acts under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—tracing honest origins—is signaled early and deepens when Elara abandons standard indexing. The meaningful tightening occurs when she adopts the palimpsest hypothesis, narrowing options to tactile verification. Cost is legible: she forfeits archival order for fragmented truth, and her “lighter” stamp implies emotional burden lifted at the price of certainty. Agency drives every escalation; the blackout complicates but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transmuting grief to restore wholeness—is signaled early and tightens through each crane folded and gem polished. The “descending while ascending” paradox creates coherent pressure under the Accumulative lens, narrowing emotional resilience even as skill grows. Cost is unmistakable: agony of transformation, envy of others’ joy, and luminous torment. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves the core conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—finding “unused potential”—is signaled early and deepens when the feedback loop forces confrontation with a different truth. Pressure escalates via the ticking breakers and intensifying data streams, culminating in the blackout that shatters Kaelen’s premise. The cost is conceptual: he must relinquish the hunt, accepting that what he sought was never external. Agency drives escalation—his pulse causes the overload—and the final image bears the weight of that irreversible realization.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—decoding the frequency of belonging—is signaled early and deepens through Kael’s recalibration and widening drone arcs. Pressure escalates texturally: garbled output → wider arc → alignment → resonance. Yet agency is limited; success hinges on external cues (pilgrim’s words, drone highlighting stars) rather than hard-won insight or trade-offs. No visible price is paid—no tool lost, time forfeited, or belief shattered—only emotional fulfillment. The tightening is atmospheric, not tactical, under an Accumulative lens, which suffices for mid-high band but lacks the cost legibility required for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—quelling remorse by confronting a buried truth—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Elara uncovers the carving confirming the brother’s death, foreclosing any return to deception. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (descending, sifting, kneeling) under Accumulative pressure, not coincidence. Cost is unmistakable: irreversible knowledge that she caused a man to die alone. Slight deduction: the “unorthodox method” lacks tactical evolution—it’s a static search, not a narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—forgiveness after apology—is signaled early and deepens when Elara proposes acknowledgments over demands. The meaningful tightening occurs when Kael admits his loss, shifting from transactional exchange to shared grief. Cost is felt: both characters expose vulnerability, risking rejection. Yet escalation leans more on emotional resonance than tactical narrowing; the moon-phase method isn’t leveraged as a constraint under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—aligning heart and action—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the compass breaks, forcing Kael to choose between pride and survival. The escalation hinges on his agency: he chooses utility poles, laughs at loss, and paddles on. Yet the “backlash of regrets” remains thematic rather than tactical—it haunts but doesn’t alter his decisions in concrete ways. Cost is visible (lost tool, damp clothes, emotional ache), but the stakes lack a sharper trade-off that would elevate pressure beyond introspection.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—kindling empathy—is signaled early and tightens through the labyrinth’s demand for compassionate choices over indifference. The meaningful deepening occurs when Leo realizes empathy requires accepting, not erasing, his past—a conceptual shift with emotional cost. However, escalation relies more on environmental metaphor than protagonist-driven pressure; the lake’s changes feel reactive rather than adversarial, slightly muting agency under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reforging a bond beyond death—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Elara must undergo irreversible metamorphosis to cross the bridge. The cost (loss of human form) is felt and visible, altering her identity permanently. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each crushed spice deepens commitment. Yet the shadow beast and phoenix feel like ornamental backstory; external opposition is absent in-scene, making conflict almost purely internal and situational.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming lost time—is signaled early and tightens when the saucer’s crack becomes a gateway. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to reach into the fracture, risking emotional overwhelm. Cost is felt (“choking beauty,” “sharp ache”) and crystallizes in her decision to weave time into cloth rather than hoard it. Coincidence never resolves; all pressure stems from her choices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—opening the locked dimension through nonviolent integration of sorrow—is signaled early and escalates via accumulating tear-shimmer density. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her deliberate stitching forces a trade-off between joy (buoyancy) and focus (gravity), with visible cost (anchoring herself mentally). The deepening occurs when hope lifts her body, requiring active suppression to continue. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the door opens only because her compassion invites it, fulfilling pacifist ethos under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding transformation—is signaled early and deepens when Elara releases the bugs, narrowing her path from possession to surrender. Pressure escalates through environmental cues (volcano rumble, cosmic hush) rather than external opposition, fitting the Accumulative lens. Cost is felt (loss of last treasures), though escalation leans atmospheric over active resistance. Coincidence complicates (landslide detour) but doesn’t resolve—the choice remains hers.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—sparking silent revolution—is signaled early and deepens through the blackout’s window of opportunity. Pressure tightens via time-sensitive distribution under cover of confusion. However, the protagonist faces no meaningful obstacle or trade-off; guards are “confused,” not active threats, and success is frictionless. Cost is conceptual (oppression vs. hope) but not felt in body, time, or consequence on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering sacred patterns to restore balance—is signaled early and tightens when the vision reveals sequence imperfection, forcing a high-stakes correction. Agency is clear: Kaelen’s adjustment and pouring of star dust drive the climax. Cost is felt (years of torment, physical strain) and conceptual (abandoning control for harmony). Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the aurora’s intensity is a pressure multiplier, not a deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—breaking imposed silence—is signaled early and tightens via the timer’s countdown, forcing Elara to rarefy her truth before zero. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency (choosing to write), not coincidence. Cost is felt: years of paused vigil, exile, censored voice. Yet the stranger’s redemption arc resolves external conflict too neatly, softening the price of speaking truth in a repressive regime.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—decoding the overture to define the duel’s terms—is signaled early and tightens when the needle unlocks the scroll. Kaelen’s agency drives escalation: his measurement choice directly enables revelation. The cost is conceptual (abandoning adversarial stance) but legible in the disarming lunge framed as revelation. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens, though the opponent’s arrival lacks tangible resistance beyond posture.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—forging beauty from anarchy—is signaled early and deepens through the act of rebuilding. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elara opens the tin to plant a poem, transforming private art into public seed. Cost is visible: emotional exposure, physical fragility of their project, and the risk of surveillance (“hidden from prying eyes”). Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, though external opposition remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—escaping temporal collapse to rewrite destiny—is signaled early and tightens as horizon bleeds orange. Elian’s agency drives escalation: he doesn’t wait for rescue but activates the film method under duress. Cost is felt in the ticking clock and flaring compasses, which narrow his window. One meaningful deepening occurs when he spots the anomalous door frame, forcing the decisive chord sequence that reweights his options.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—preserving cultural memory—is signaled early but never truly tested; the monsoon poses no actual threat once the fruits are harvested. Escalation is absent: the dream provides a solution, the tree grows instantly, and the storm arrives only after success is complete. No trade-off, loss, or narrowing of options occurs—agency is performative, not consequential. Coincidence (the tree bending “whimsically”) assists rather than complicates, undermining earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—mending silence through unspoken apologies—is signaled early and deepens via the lace instructions and compass use. The meaningful tightening occurs when Kaelen diffuses regret into the environment, altering his internal state and enabling the compass to “align with tides of remembrance.” Agency is quiet but present: walking, holding, tracing, accepting. Cost is felt as emotional recalibration, though external stakes remain abstract.
