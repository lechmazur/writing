  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: making sense of survival (why she lived, what it means). The ledger's pattern-gaps provide the tightening—Elena moves from emotional searching to forensic seeing, which narrows options from abstract meaning to concrete testimony. The frost-as-model deepens her method, showing "what exists in the gaps." Agency manifests in the choice to return and testify, foreclosing the retreat into canyon silence with visible cost (scarred hands, facing investigators). The patron reveal slightly reduces pressure because it externalizes the threat—"wasn't about her at all"—which should feel diminishing but instead "loosened" her, a reversal that works thematically yet softens the escalation slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—translating silence into music—is signaled early and drives Marina's prototype demonstration with Claire. The scene deepens when Marina moves from external validation (Claire's "It's perfect") to self-application, narrowing her stance from proving the system works to claiming it as her own contentment. However, this is more a lyric intensification than a tightening of options; no live opposition or trade-off forecloses a path. The cost (hearing loss as permanent transformation) is established in backstory rather than tested on the page, keeping agency modest within this single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—giving restless drowned souls proper rest—is signaled by the second paragraph's distress signals and tightens when Meridian recognizes her failure ("how many had she failed?"). The escalation under the Accumulative lens is a single decisive deepening: moving from recognition to spatial experiment to threshold occupation, with the cost of permanent isolation legibly paid. Agency drives the turn: she places the fragments, enters the impossible room, and assembles the new lens configuration. One minor gap: the stakes remain largely internal to Meridian; no external pressure tests her commitment during the transformation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preventing community dispersal through anonymous care—is signaled early and coherent throughout. Pressure accumulates as the youngest family announces departure, prompting Mira's public declaration. However, the escalation lacks a meaningful tightening: no live option is foreclosed, no trade-off enacted. The resolution ("no one mentioned leaving") bypasses the test of whether anyone must sacrifice pride, resources, or departure plans on the page. The turn feels asserted rather than earned by agency under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake (where unused love goes) is signaled in paragraph one but resolved through revelation rather than escalation. No meaningful reversal or tightening: the woman arrives needing help, Marina applies her method, the knot dissolves, answer found. Coincidence (the woman "sent for a healer") enables rather than complicates. Agency is observation, not choice—Marina could have refused, probed the woman's resistance, or confronted her own unused love, but instead she enacts a smooth procedure. Cost is absent: no tactical trade-off, no path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering time's texture—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when Miriam enters the maze center with the fragment, and the visions intensify to a crescendo. The final dissolution forecloses the path of continued physical existence with conceptual cost visible in the closing image. Agency reads as attention and endurance under accumulative pressure rather than a decisive reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—protect the seeds before soldiers arrive—tightens from discovery to decoding to vault retrieval under time pressure. The ticking-clock arrival of boots escalates urgency. However, the confrontation deflates: the soldier's immediate cooperation erases the anticipated cost of impeding him. Mira's agency in the puzzle is strong, but the final beat lacks a trade-off or resistance that would test her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—capturing the sound of trust breaking to complete the hearing aid—is signaled early and remains coherent. Mira's forge work accumulates pressure through the layering of absences, and the final hammer strike registers as a tightening under the Accumulative lens. However, the escalation lacks a visible on-page cost that narrows her options or forces a trade-off; the cancer subplot hovers as time pressure but doesn't alter her tactics or demand a sacrifice in the moment. The piece delivers conceptual closure but the felt price at the ending beat is more asserted than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: decode the flower arrangement and understand her role in the larger pattern. The fern frond symbol ("reinterpret everything you know") triggers the key tightening. When Mira sees the portrait of herself holding the jar, the realization that she was photographed by destiny narrows her options and reweights the five years of theft. The moonbeam curtain moment deepens the stake by revealing that the portraits teach witnessing, not possession. Cost is legible in the final act: she releases the portraits as "luminous seeds" rather than hoarding them, foreclosing the thief path. The elderly woman's validation is convenient but does not undercut the prior escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—crafting safe zones for inquiry—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. Pressure accumulates texturally through the thaw metaphor and glass-working details, but no on-page choice narrows options or carries visible cost. The ending gesture of sketching tomorrow's piece is continuation rather than a turn that forecloses a path, leaving escalation under-realized.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming stolen identity and escaping Carson's control—is signaled early. The decryption of the cast cipher and Maya's journey to the library constitute one meaningful tightening. But escalation stalls when Carson arrives: his exposition replaces pressure, and Maya's bluff (prosecutors outside) resolves the threat via off-page setup rather than on-page agency or cost. The final reversal ("She had outwitted him") is told, not shown through a tactical choice that forecloses a path. Under a causal lens, the protagonist's peak decision should narrow options with visible price; here convenience (external officers) provides the win.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—understanding the oracle's final silence to navigate the coming darkness—signals early and tightens through one meaningful deepening: the realization that the hush itself is the map. Agency reads as attention and endurance that forecloses normalcy; Maren's choice to continue the work after the star vanishes commits her to isolation with visible cost. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens as sensory density increases ("anticipation crystallized," "fear made tangible") until the final beat reweights her relationship to darkness from terror to navigation.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (finding where thoughts come from) is signaled in paragraph two and drives all 341 iterations. The tightening arrives when the violin appears—something "different"—and its use amalgamates all prior loops into recognition, narrowing J-7's existential question to an answer. The cost is Earned Stasis: accepting that understanding requires "patient composure" through endless repetition, foreclosing any escape from the loop. Agency manifests as J-7's decision to continue sweeping with new comprehension rather than seeking exit, though a sharper price (what J-7 gives up by staying) would elevate this further.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: institutional truth versus complicit silence, signaled through Mira's months of suspicious inaction. The eavesdropping moment tightens pressure and Viktor's confession forces a decision. Mira's agency—choosing to speak and witness—forecloses her prior passivity with stated cost ("no more silence"). The escalation is meaningful but the final beat leans on collective intention ("together… toward accountability") rather than a single high-cost trade-off dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (proving relationship survives measurement) is signaled early and escalates through Elara's deliberate tanking of metrics, then the overnight bloom response. The tightening is protagonist-driven: her choice to withhold care and resume creates the reversal. Visible cost includes three seasons of decline and dismissal risk. Minor deduction: the Council's capitulation arrives without meaningful resistance or counter-pressure, softening the final victory's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—proving sideways time and overcoming imposter syndrome—is signaled early and tightens when Voss arrives, forcing Renna to choose disclosure. The reversal (fear → validation) is present but arrives without friction: Voss immediately believes and praises her. No tactic shifts, no second complication; the escalation is a single ask-and-receive beat. Cost of revelation is asserted ("I've been afraid") but not dramatized through a forfeited alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—uncovering Magdalena's code—is signaled early and pursued cleanly. One meaningful tightening occurs (discovering the circle marks her exact location), narrowing options and driving the plunge decision. However, the escalation relies on coincidence (the program floats to her, the circle marks where she stands) rather than protagonist tactics under pressure. The cost of embracing silent music is declared but not tested; no live option is foreclosed on the page. The "wordless conversation" completes without friction or trade-off, leaving stakes abstract at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—how to carry guilt and prevent future loss—is signaled early and tightens through the confession and recalibration decision. One meaningful turn: realizing "certainty is what killed her" inverts her professional identity and narrows options to accepting ambiguity or repeating the error. The cost is legible: more false positives, less professional confidence, permanent emotional ballast. Agency is clear (her choice to recalibrate). Does not quite reach 8.5 because the decision, while earned, occurs in summary ("I need to recalibrate") rather than a dramatized beat showing her hands on the instruments or Chen's visible reaction creating friction.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: uncovering the truth behind the ghost-shift calls. The radio confession is the one meaningful tightening, though it arrives as a gift rather than through Mara's escalating pressure. Her decision to photograph and contact authorities forecloses the option of leaving the truth buried, with visible cost to the callers' secret. The confession itself is vivid and consequential, but Mara's agency in the peak beat is passive reception rather than active forcing.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—how to record transformation—is signaled early and the obsidian refuge introduces one meaningful complication. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens remains gentle: the stone folds the swan into new patterns, but this happens *to* her without tactical friction or a choice that narrows options. No reversal tests her devotion to witnessing; the vision of future decay confirms rather than challenges her stance. The cost of incorporating the artifact (weight, forgetting the moment precisely) is told in future-tense summary rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (relational reconnection) is clear early. The eclipse moment provides one tightening—Diane must choose to stay present—but the turn lacks resistance; she shifts from phone to engagement without visible friction or trade-off. The lullaby dissolves distance instantly, with no failed attempt or escalating cost. One meaningful pressure point exists (Diane lowering the phone), but the resolution feels granted rather than earned through protagonist agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: preserving human testimony in the aftermath. The pressure is conceptual and existential rather than immediate—no antagonist, no ticking clock within the scene itself. One meaningful deepening occurs when Caroline's diary reveals the mechanism ("We bent the world too far. The axis doesn't hold"), which reweights the historian's purpose from simple archival to witness of ontological collapse. However, the historian's stance never wavers; no on-page choice narrows options or forecloses a path with visible cost. Under Accumulative lens this suffices but does not reach high-band urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is Margaret's search for transformation through her cryptic writing, signaled early ("transpose her own life into something new"). The man's revelation tightens pressure by showing her words had real-world consequences she never intended, narrowing her understanding of authorship and agency. One meaningful reversal occurs on the page: her "deliberately meaningless" fortunes were accidentally prophetic, forcing a recalibration of her creative purpose. The cost is conceptual and felt—she spent decades seeking mystery for others while unknowingly orchestrating an intelligence network—but her final walk and smile don't dramatize a high-stakes choice or visible forfeiture. The escalation is clean under the Accumulative lens (density increase, pattern break), but the ending leans toward acceptance without a tactical trade-off or renunciation that closes a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single dominant stake: prevent possession completion before it irreversibly takes hold. Pressure escalates through layered rhetorical tactics under a tight clock (dawn breaking, "before the possession could complete itself"). Each philosophical probe narrows the entity's room: silence architecture → breath layering → the fullness paradox. The climax—"You cannot possess what cannot be separated from itself"—is protagonist-driven and forecloses the entity's assumptions with visible cost (both shaking, the seal). Reaches 8+ because escalation is causal and protagonist-agency driven, though the entity's resistance feels more implicit than dramatized, preventing higher.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—completing fortunes before exhaustion claims her—is signaled early and provides a ticking clock. However, the escalation remains ambient rather than dramatized: Maya "writes faster now, racing the exhaustion" but no reversal or complication tests her process. She succeeds at her stated goal without obstacle, rendering the time pressure more atmospheric than consequential. The piece offers one meaningful deepening (the realization that homesickness itself is the instrument), but this insight arrives as epiphany rather than through a choice that narrows options. Agency manifests as completion of routine rather than a decision with visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding the version of herself that makes sense—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when Maya realizes "there was no perfect Maya hidden in the procedural depths," which narrows her options from infinite search to acceptance. The cost is legible: she relinquishes the search and accepts her fractured nature. However, the escalation relies heavily on accumulative exhaustion rather than a sequence of tactical narrowing choices, and the agency at closure (letting herself fall) reads more as surrender than active decision, which fits the lens but limits the pressure band.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness—is signaled early and coherent throughout. However, the escalation is summarized ("spent weeks preparing," "by the time winter truly settled") rather than dramatized through on-page choices that narrow options or raise visible cost. The backward phonograph discovery and student sessions happen in sequence without a meaningful tightening or reversal where Mira must trade off competing goods. The piece tells us the technique "worked its strange alchemy" without showing a moment where success or failure hangs on her decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (protect data integrity without appearing partisan) is signaled early and tightens when the pigeon's message reframes the follower's purpose. Maren's agency is renunciation: she refuses simple refusal and chooses a lateral solution with on-page cost—her records will be accessible to subpoena, and she accepts surveillance. The escalation is modest but present: the message narrows her options, forcing her to "progress laterally" rather than confront directly. The cost is visible in the final image (she continues under watch, committed to "recording the depths"), though the pressure could be more visceral. No antagonist appears on the page; the conflict remains situational and internal, consistent with the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elena's stated stake—understanding "the texture of time"—remains abstract and never forces a concrete trade-off. Marcus's arrival and his suggestion ("show me the deepest layer") don't narrow options or introduce cost; they pivot the conversation toward thematic synthesis without escalation. No reversal or tightening forecloses a live path on the page. The piece accumulates atmosphere but lacks the pressure-driven agency required for higher scores under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: releasing trapped sounds to break the chronic hush. One meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes the sound is "caught in a loop" and understands "what she needed to do"—a turn that narrows options from observation to action. Agency is clear: her decision to play fragmentary melodies rather than complete them, and to leave the bowl as an open question, forecloses the path of traditional resolution with felt cost. The escalation from hearing to matching to releasing builds coherent pressure under the Accumulative lens. Minor gap: the hush "begins to break" through her playing, but the mechanism of how her violin specifically unbinds others' voices could be more causally grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Maren's professional service versus the erosion of her own authenticity—is signaled early and tightens through Thomas's transformation. The piece provides one meaningful deepening: Maren's realization that "each counterfeit emotion she dealt carved away a small piece of her own authenticity" arrives with felt weight. Agency is endurance (Earned Stasis) with visible cost in the final gesture of filing the petal and preparing for the next client. No major reversal occurs; pressure accumulates through texture and the final image reweights the opening claim of professional precision, sufficient under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—Marlena's recognition of invisible labor and decision to act—is signaled early and tightens when Theo appears. The coincidental meeting undercuts agency; Marlena does not pursue or choose Theo, fate delivers him. Her shame and decision to "initiate something" provide one meaningful pressure point, but the resolution depends on convenient alignment rather than obstacle navigation. The partnership forms without testing commitment or revealing trade-offs, leaving the cost abstract rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—belonging through grafting into community—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the sculptor makes her public offer, raising social risk. The search itself generates communal pressure but lacks an on-page reversal or cost that narrows her options; the child's discovery feels coincidental rather than earned by protagonist agency. The final sculpture and realization fulfill the stake, but the path there is smooth rather than tested, and the price (her vulnerability, time, carried materials) remains abstract rather than viscerally felt in a pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—documenting the origin of echoes—is signaled early and tightens when she finds the cages. One clear reversal: the lock is temporal, not mechanical, forcing her to use the pendant and accept a trade (borrowed time for freed sounds). Agency is decision with visible cost: releasing her stockpile forecloses future time-sculpting. The giant's nap imposes a countdown, though its pressure remains background. Escalation is accumulative rather than multi-turn, fitting the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—finding the formula for how love diminishes—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens when Marius plants the eyes and waits, then deepens when the flower blooms and reveals the mathematical proof: love transforms state rather than diminishing linearly. The insight forecloses recovery as an option, a visible cost tied to acceptance. Agency is embodied in the planting ritual and the decision to stay until dawn. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening suffices, and the closure image (honoring the pattern) reweights his mourning with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: Maren's shift from survival to mattering, tested by revealing herself to the boy. The outage provides one meaningful tightening (systems down, opportunity window) and her agency drives the turn. Visible cost: she positions herself "only partially" hidden, risking discovery. The boy's presence and his choice not to run crystallize the stakes. Minor gap: no immediate external pressure (library staff, time limit) to force a harder trade-off in the reveal itself.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Marcus's identity as controller versus allowing natural growth—is signaled early and sustained. The act of cutting the wires provides one concrete tightening moment where he forecloses his old method. However, the escalation is largely iterative rather than pressure-driven: he removes wires, then stakes, then stops pruning in a list-like progression without a moment where the choice truly costs him something irreplaceable on the page. Mrs. Chen's observation and his direct reply hint at change but don't dramatize a trade-off or loss that narrows future options.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake signaled early: to "thresh meaning from experience, to press sense from the sediment of survival." The rain-trail discovery tightens options (convergence as unearthed purpose), the brooch exchange deepens pressure through shared ritual, and the sleep/wake shift narrows her path with visible cost—she commits to painting "the exhausted search for pattern" rather than the ruins themselves. Agency drives escalation: her choice to dig, to exchange, to interpret the convergence, to return. The cost is felt in the redistribution of witnessing and the acceptance of rhythmic drowning as subject.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake signaled early: Vera's role as guide to wonder. The tightening occurs when shadows emerge, escalates as they "feed on the very magic she'd amplified," then deepens when she realizes magic itself has become aware. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through density increase (overlapping shadows, thickening darkness, richer frequencies) and culminates in her acceptance of unknowing. The cost is clear—her clairvoyant certainty is forfeited. One limitation: the escalation is observational rather than driven by Vera's agency; she watches and interprets rather than makes choices that narrow options. The pilgrim's breakthrough happens to her sanctuary rather than through her tactical decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring navigational knowledge to re-empower the fishermen—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Maris connects the valve's three ports to knowledge types, deepening her method. The final escalation (taking the boat out herself) narrows options under accumulative pressure. However, the cost remains abstract; no prior tactic is explicitly abandoned or traded away, and the fishermen's skepticism dissolves too cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—following hidden paths to unspoken truths—is signaled early and tightens when she reaches the fortress and must choose one truth. Her agency (pressing the punch, selecting the grandmother's whisper) drives the peak choice. However, the escalation lacks a visible trade-off or complication; the arrows lead her smoothly to the fortress without reversals, and the choice itself (one truth only) is introduced at the moment of selection rather than built as a constraint she wrestles with. The cost of lifelong teaching is told in summary rather than shown as a forfeiture with immediate consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—Elena seeking "space for reflection after the hospital burned her out"—is signaled early and tightens when the tile visions force her to confront entangled grief. One meaningful deepening occurs (tile memories → understanding Amit's project → her commitment to transcribe), but agency remains observational rather than decisional. The autumn choice to remain is a stance crystallization, yet no visible tradeoff or foreclosed path appears on the page; she gains understanding without losing skepticism's protection or facing a concrete cost that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—discovering the afterlife—is signaled early and remains coherent. The spatial mutiny provides one meaningful tightening: the temporary bridge narrows Vesper's window to "hours," raising urgency. However, no on-page cost or trade-off materializes; she encounters no obstacle, internal doubt, or resource drain that forces tactical adjustment. The escalation relies on declarative intensification ("fragment burned hotter") rather than embodied pressure that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is Mira's ethical inheritance versus survival necessity, braided with Pavel's asylum case. Pressure tightens when Pavel explains the microSD card and cultural prohibition—Mira must choose between passivity (sending him away), complicity (active search that might cross lines), or the third path (professional witness). The 4 AM discovery forces a micro-choice about framing the return; her decision to document truthfully and require Pavel's signature narrows options and forecloses the forgery route with professional and legal risk. Agency is decision with on-page cost: she stays through the night, performs the examination, and stakes her integrity on proper procedure. One clear tightening is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving invented histories—is signaled early but never tested. The stationer's morning work proceeds without obstacle, and her decision to place the history in the maze faces no opposition or cost. The invented girl's story (entering at dawn, emerging aged at dusk) carries escalation that the frame narrative lacks. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows the stationer's options; the lamp's frequency shift modulates her notation but does not force a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—resurrecting buried truths—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Yet no on-page reversal or tightening narrows options: she collects fragments in paragraph two, collects more in paragraphs four through six, and continues collecting at the end. The resolution ("she would continue her work") is stasis without visible cost or trade-off. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift is required; the piece offers thematic accumulation but no pressure escalation that forecloses a path or changes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—decoding the universal riddle—is signaled early and deepens when the seashell reveals memory-voices, forcing Marina to test her skepticism. One meaningful tightening occurs when she plucks the incomplete cello and hears forgotten voices, narrowing her interpretive options. However, the resolution lacks visible tradeoff; her discovery costs nothing on the page beyond a vague "tomorrow" commitment. The riddle's answer is asserted rather than tested through opposing pressure or failed attempts.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (preserve carnival culture vs. inevitable privatization) signals early and tightens through one meaningful turn: the yellow-streak mistake forces Mira to pivot from resistance organizing to cooperative proposal. The cooperative model represents genuine agency with visible cost—neither pure preservation nor erasure. Marcus's warning and the three-month timeline create pressure, though the council vote outcome remains off-page. The escalation from encoded resistance → near-disaster → synthesized solution narrows options under causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving Valentina before destruction—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens through the countdown (three hours, then dawn arrival) and Maya's agency drives the resolution (planting beacons, photographing, departing). The temperature-triggered reactions create one meaningful escalation beat. Cost is legible: she loses the physical crater but gains its documented memory. However, the consortium's bulldozers never materialize on-page; the threat remains abstract, and the final "machines arrived" is told rather than shown, softening the confrontation's visceral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—repairing the drone—is signaled early but remains low-tension throughout. Mara encounters two obstacles (cracked wing, stuttering motor) and solves each methodically without escalation, trade-offs, or visible cost. No reversal narrows her options; competence proceeds unimpeded. The repair's completion does not foreclose a path or alter her stance. Agency is present but never tested by genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—finding the true river source—is signaled early and tightens through the coordinate revelation and condensation-pattern insight. The reversal (rivers return rather than begin) reweights her understanding, but the escalation is primarily cognitive; the external pressure (predecessor's disappearance, "worrying tranquility") remains atmospheric rather than forcing a traded cost on the page. Her resolve to go onto the ice tomorrow is charged but deferred, so the cost at closure is more anticipatory than paid.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake signaled early: prevent the town's collapse. One meaningful deepening occurs when people begin to pause (Marcus, baker's daughter), but these moments are told in quick summary rather than dramatized with trade-offs. The protagonist's agency is present (the walking ritual) but never tested—no setback, no adaptation, no visible friction. The timeframe ("three weeks left") is declared but does not tighten tactics on the page. Escalation under Accumulative lens requires density increase or pattern break; here the ritual simply repeats without complication until success is announced.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—freeing Thalia before the field fails—is signaled early and tightens cleanly when Marina realizes "there were no experts." The key reversal ("This will free you or kill you") narrows options and Marina's choice to trigger the sequence is protagonist-driven with legible risk. The cost is visible in action (helmet cracks, temple collapses, gasped breath) but the preservation field's "hours" deadline never manifests as urgent pressure on the page; the tightening comes from knowledge rather than a live clock forcing errors. One meaningful deepening is present and sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—escaping his father's shadow and finding his own voice—is signaled early and sustained. The approaching low tide creates situational pressure: bodies will surface, questions will come. However, Marcus makes no on-page choice that alters tactics or forecloses an option. His resolve to speak "anyway" is declared but not tested; the story ends before the warden arrives. One tightening (tide dropping, rocks emerging) but no visible price paid or path closed in the present frame.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—"learn to grow miracles" and "repay the debt"—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows Elara's options; the ghost bride's guidance is accepted without friction or visible trade-off. The escalation is told ("The fruits grew more potent") rather than dramatized through a decision that forecloses a path or forces Elara to sacrifice something concrete. The story promises future action ("until the debt is repaid") but the pressure does not cohere or tighten on the page under the Accumulative lens, and no felt cost is visible in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring the labyrinth's purpose against precedent—is signaled early and the sleepwalking discovery creates one meaningful tightening. However, the council's prepared enforcement dissolves off-page without dramatized resistance, and the transformation happens through summary rather than a turn that narrows Mara's options. The walkers' participation and the elder's demonstration are recounted, not shown, so escalation flattens when it should crystallize. No visible price paid for breaking precedent.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (restore lost internal rootedness) is signaled in paragraph five and tightens through the priest's visit, which transforms private rite into communal renewal and reweights the dormant faith. Mira's agency is decision and endurance: she chooses purposeful wandering over direct excavation, commits to rebuilding the sundial without certainty of function, and the final placement among wild trees with the village forecloses her prior diaspora pattern. One meaningful deepening: discovering the sundial script in her grandmother's language narrows her task from fulfilling rites to reconstructing continuity itself. The priest's shift from "superstitions best forgotten" to participating embodies external pressure that Mira's work has made newly legible, though his arc could have been tested by a visible cost to deepen the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving pseudonym creation against the Central Node surveillance—is signaled early and remains coherent. The twenty-minute countdown and the courier's arrival provide situational pressure, and Maya's act of transcribing and delivering the letter narrows options (committing to the handoff). However, the escalation is incremental rather than a meaningful tightening; the story cycles through familiar moves (decode, transcribe, deliver, prepare tomorrow's codes) without a reversal or choice that forecloses a live alternative with visible cost, landing this in the strong-but-limited escalation band.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: prevent the coup by warning the palace guard. Pressure accumulates as separate visits (Admiral four times, General on different days) become a single dangerous pattern under Mira's observation. One meaningful tightening: the "synchronize" word crystallizes convergence and she realizes "before the coup." Agency is decision (she will take cookies and speak in adjacent possibilities). The cost is visible—she moves from safe observer to exposed informant. No requirement for multiple reversals at this length; the single turn from passive listener to activeWarner suffices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—reconciliation with her sister after five years—is signaled early and sustained. The medium's ritual provides one meaningful deepening: the memory-vision shows Isla the "instant before the cruel words" and lets her witness her sister's trembling hope, reweighting her understanding of that pivotal moment. However, the escalation lacks a second tightening or visible trade-off; the sister's letters appear as convenience rather than complication, and Isla's decision to run toward reconciliation incurs no on-page cost (no fear overcome, no alternate path refused, no tactical price paid in the moment).

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is Maya's need to process displacement trauma through translation; secondary accent is the girl's fear of forgetting. The encounter tightens when Maya recognizes "khlong" and her own wound-collection, then deepens when she commits to co-translation, forecloses her drift, and accepts shared labor. Agency is clear: Maya's decision to help is neither luck nor coincidence. The cost is on the page—reopening her own unhealed wounds and binding herself to long collaborative work. One meaningful pressure point with visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—rediscovering joy—is signaled early and tightens when Mira shifts from imposing to amplifying, a choice that narrows her artistic approach and tests her willingness to let go of permanence. The batteries dimming and dawn threatening create time pressure. The knowledge network provides external validation that raises the emotional stakes. Cost is present: she releases the need for lasting murals and accepts erasure, foregrounding connection over permanence. One meaningful deepening occurs when she completes the fresco child's reach, a choice that crystallizes her new stance.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (certainty vs. curiosity about nested awakenings) is signaled early and tightens through three discovery cycles. Marta's agency manifests as renunciation: she chooses to stop seeking objective truth and embrace recursive exploration. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens through repetition with variation—each awakening adds detail and urgency until the nickel's face becomes "urgent" and the garden "bewitches." The escalation is clear, but the final choice lacks a visible price on the page; her smile and the framing as "liberation" soften what should be a costly leap into permanent uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: reclaim private thought from taxation. The greenhouse proposal constitutes one meaningful turn—Malachi offers a tactical solution that reframes resistance as botanical rather than digital. However, the opposition (MindTax auditors) never appears on the page to test the plan; Chen's warning about patrols remains hypothetical. The montage summary ("Over the following weeks") compresses what should be escalating pressure into told success. No on-page reversal forces Malachi or Iris to adjust tactics or pay a visible price. The ending asserts risk (surveillance towers blink) but no specific loss or trade-off materializes to earn the closure's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: transform longing into sustaining beauty. Mira's arrival with the bulb provides one meaningful tightening that shifts the poet from solitary creation to shared planting. The escalation is gentle rather than sharp; the piece accumulates pressure through imagery and tone rather than reversals. Cost is legible—collaborative vulnerability, departure from centuries of habit—but remains understated, which fits the Accumulative lens but caps the intensity band.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserve the orchid collection's emotional signatures—is signaled early and tightens when the chime cracks. One meaningful turn occurs when Miren discovers the cracked tube produces a new frequency "between nostalgia and discovery," reweighting the problem as partial solution. The resolution (fashioning a new chime from a shattered orchid) is earned by her prior choices and carries visible cost: she uses a fragment from an orchid she "had been unable to save." Under the Accumulative lens, the pressure coheres and the cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (trust restoration) is signaled early and tightens when Kael demands "Tell me via interconnected promises" rather than accepting surface apology. Maren's choice to share the method forecloses her option to protect the discovery alone—a visible tradeoff. The "last hour before their paths would diverge permanently" imposes time pressure. Escalation coheres under the causal lens: her explanation of harmonic patterns dissolves his resentment into fascination, agency rests with Maren's decision to reveal rather than withhold.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (resolve upstream flood protection vs. downstream seasonal flow) is signaled early. The hidden valve discovery narrows options and provides a meaningful turn. However, the escalation lacks visible cost: Elena's three-day restoration encounters no setbacks, resource limits, or meaningful opposition. The elders' resistance melts instantly upon demonstration, undercutting the premise that "neither side believed compromise possible."

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—Elena's need to escape her lies versus her desire for connection—is signaled early and tightens when Carmen's recording forces a reckoning. The confession is a clear agency moment with visible cost: she risks Yuki's judgment and pigeon-community rejection. One meaningful deepening occurs when the recording plays and Elena must choose between continued evasion and truth. The ending "see who comes back" makes the relational price undeniable, though a secondary physical or tactical complication during the confession beat could have sharpened escalation further.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (understanding thresholds) is signaled early and tightens when the logbook entry reveals her mother's surrender and Maya recognizes the irreversible nature of her childhood crossing. The grain-reading and code-deciphering constitute accumulative pressure that narrows interpretive options. Agency is present in the final step through the threshold, which forecloses return. Cost is visible (terrace dissolves, logbook left closed). Does not reach 8.5+ because the escalation is primarily cognitive/revelatory rather than featuring a live trade-off or visible price paid during the terrace sequence itself.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—Mara learning the rhythm of belonging—is signaled early and remains consistent. One tightening occurs when she and Chen cross-reference data, finding patterns that "sang with shadowseam wonder." However, the escalation is intellectual discovery rather than a choice under pressure that forecloses an option. The plankton bloom resolves the quest without Mara trading anything away or enduring a visible cost; the ending grants her the answer rather than forcing her to crystallize a stance. No live option is narrowed, no tactical price extracted.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is clear: discover why paths disappear, driven by childhood loss. Pressure accumulates through each transliteration cycle (joy-turning-to-doubt, anticipation-confusion-resignation) and tightens when the crater glass reveals paths need repeated walking to remain real. The final seed and its "hope-choosing-to-return" inscription deepens understanding and narrows her mission from restoration to witness. Agency is primarily observational—Calla responds to what the glass reveals—but her decision to plant seeds and reframe her covenant forecloses the restoration path with conceptual cost visible in her acceptance that "some losses were inevitable."

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—proving chaos can be shepherded—is signaled early and pursued through three escalating interventions (couple, teenagers, elderly man). Each move tightens: dropped ball, scattered cards, glowing bishop. The convergence (photo session with all parties) demonstrates success, and her withdrawal deepens the stakes by reframing her satisfaction as perpetual solitude. However, no live option is foreclosed; she could join the group without consequence, so the cost of her method remains asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving memory against erasure—is signaled early and tightens when Kael achieves perfect stillness and the moonstone speck appears. The accumulative lens governs: practice → observation of gaps → manifestation of dust → realization of purpose → beginning the tattoo work. One meaningful turn occurs when touching the speck anchors her and crystallizes her motivation to create a living archive. The cost is visible in her commitment to permanent bodily marking and future confrontation, though the Empress remains off-page and no immediate antagonistic pressure tests the choice in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: preserve the atrium by proving its value before demolition. Pressure tightens through the ticking-clock frame (one week, "before the property developer demolished") and Samuel's iterative documentation (multiple stone throws, photographs, sketches). The developer's wistful pause provides a micro-reversal of expectation (she might be reached). However, the escalation remains a gathering of evidence rather than a contested choice with immediate cost; Samuel encounters no obstacle, exhaustion, or counter-pressure. The resolution (portfolio compiled, awaiting her response) defers the stakes rather than paying them on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—Marcus seeking to understand his father's sacrifice and his own compulsion toward firefighting—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through reflection rather than reversal, consistent with the accumulative lens. The ridge walk and box-opening deepen understanding, but no live option is tested or narrowed on the page. The final act (placing the box, writing his entry) is a symbolic gesture without visible cost or tactical shift; Marcus walks down "sure," suggesting resolution rather than foreclosure. Escalation reads as density increase in thematic material, meeting the lens minimum, but agency remains passive contemplation rather than a choice that alters stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—revitalizing her collapsed research and proving her theory—is signaled early but never tested with a live trade-off. Maya experiences no reversal: the gauge climbs, she writes, she smiles. The "other Mayas" in parallel timelines synchronize rather than conflict, removing tension. The piece withholds any cost: no material sacrifice, no renunciation of an alternate path, no visible price paid for her breakthrough. The ending declares success ("she had found what she was looking for") without dramatizing what she gave up to earn it.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: confirm architectural consciousness and complete the mapping before the building collapses. The acoustic anomaly narrows interpretation, forcing Mara from data-collector to believer. The discovery of Eleanor's burden deepens the stakes by revealing the social cost of knowing. Agency is present: Mara chooses to gather diaries and finish the work, but the stakes don't narrow options—her mission remains unchanged, only enriched. The closure forecloses the path of ignorance with felt cost (carrying Eleanor's burden forward), though the decision itself is acceptance rather than a trade-off under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—persuading mirrors to show possibilities—is signaled early and drives the extended middle beat of singing coded lullabies. The escalation is primarily Accumulative: density increases as questions deepen from "what color would your room be" to "who would you love," culminating in the smallest mirror's answer. Agency manifests in her choice to return tomorrow with "new questions," though this resolution feels more like continuation than a tightening that forecloses a path. One micro-turn (the vision dissolving) adds pressure but the final stance lacks a visible trade-off or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—ending the forever war through ritual commitment—is signaled early and tightens toward midnight. The reversal (Threll's arrival → grief-driven resistance → her kneeling and sharing her daughter's love of gardening) narrows options and forecloses pure refusal. The agency is shared across three characters; Mirena's role is facilitative, which diffuses some pressure but remains coherent. The planting and promise to return impose a visible cost (continued proximity to enemies, ongoing vulnerability) that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (preserve extinct bird's echo) is signaled early and tightens through one major choice: placing the egg in the device and releasing the call. Agency is clear—Marcus orchestrates the entire event—and the cost is visible (seven countries, four watersheds, walking away as rain erases the map). The release beat narrows options: once broadcast, the song is "locked in digital permanence" and the physical coordinates dissolve. Thunder "drowning the recording" compounds loss. No multiple reversals required at this length; the single tightening forecloses the in-person witness with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Celestine's pursuit of autonomy beyond performance—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation is minimal: she kneels, traces patterns, the sanctuary appears without meaningful resistance, and she gathers echoes that simply "strengthen her resolve." No live option is foreclosed; no tactic shifts under pressure. The Duke's single line of dialogue ("You exist to reflect us") provides context but never tests her choice on the page. The story delivers a change in Celestine's stance, but that change unfolds through uncontested discovery rather than through pressure that forces trade-offs or visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (ethical storytelling validated) is signaled early but remains abstract until the drunk's epiphany provides one meaningful tightening. The pressure comes from the partner's off-stage accusations rather than on-page escalation. The drunk's moment ("I can't remember why I was right") narrows Marcus's understanding, but Marcus himself makes no choice that forecloses a path—he observes transformation rather than driving it. Cost is present but oblique: the partnership conflict remains unresolved with only a plan to call tomorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: to honor the last monarch migration through witness and temporary structure. Pressure is coherent and accumulates under the Accumulative lens: monarchs arrive, Sera builds, they depart. One meaningful tightening occurs when the monarchs cluster around the structure, recognizing "an acknowledgment that endings deserved witness." Cost is conceptual—impermanence is chosen, the work will dissolve—but visible on the page ("three weeks before weather claimed it"). Agency is present in Sera's methodical building and final packing, though the monarchs' departure feels more observed than forced by her action. No sharp reversal or second turn; escalation is steady rather than compressed, placing the score in the solid band.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (preserve forgotten names) is signaled early and tightens through the discovery that punched cards can translate sound into light—a meaningful deepening that changes tactics. Agency is clear: Maren's choice to transcribe and cast narrows her path (years of work ahead). Cost is visible in the commitment and the acknowledgment that she's "only just begun." The aurora-alignment moment provides one decisive intensification that reweights options under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering why paths choose walkers—is signaled early and drives the action. One meaningful tightening occurs when the directive's message forces her into the dream state, narrowing her options from seeking to receiving. The storm provides external pressure but does not escalate internal conflict. Agency is renunciation (stop fighting the path) with conceptual cost (inversion of free will), but the price remains abstract rather than viscerally felt in tactics or relationships.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—decoding the tile to understand its impossible astronomical knowledge—is signaled early and drives each beat of translation. One meaningful deepening: the coordinates reveal a perspective from seventeen light-years away, which should be impossible for Babylonian astronomers, escalating the mystery. The resolution (recognizing a covenant across millennia) is earned by her sustained calculation, though the ending reads more as thematic confirmation than a choice under competing pressure. The looming regime change hovers as external threat but never forces a tactical trade-off or alters her method. Cost is conceptual (acknowledging her place in a chain of stargazers) rather than a visible forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: will Marcus release his resentment or remain calcified? One meaningful deepening occurs when the sanctuary walls show the childhood memory, forcing Marcus to confront pre-betrayal love. Yet escalation relies almost entirely on Elena's unopposed persuasion rather than Marcus testing his anger through resistance or a choice that forecloses a path. His weeping arrival at grace feels more like capitulation to therapeutic argument than a decision with visible cost; we never see him actively defend his resentment or pay a price (social, relational, identity) on the page for letting go. The Accumulative lens supports this, but the lack of protagonist agency in the turn keeps this from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: capture the runaway dream before it tears the district apart. Eliane's agency drives the escalation: she steps into the fog, arranges mirrors, synchronizes her breathing, and actively recreates the dream's structure to trap it. One key reversal: "The dream shuddered, recognizing itself in her recreation"—this tightens options and forces the capture move. The cost is visible on the page: she risks exposure to the dream's sharp edges and commits to burying it at Gregor's grave, foreclosing any alternative use. Under the Causal-Accumulative lens, the pressure coheres and the final act reweights her initial grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—bridging the generational rift—is signaled early and tightens when Lisel's fractured eye becomes both accusation and opportunity. Mara's climb and admission are protagonist-driven agency; the unfinished eye's geometry flaw ("perfection makes them look dead") deepens the thematic pressure. The ribbon-tying forecloses solitary mastery with visible cost: Mara must share control and learn from Lisel's wild methods. One clean reversal when Mara admits fault rather than defending her vows, altering the power dynamic and opening collaboration.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: Mara must understand the archive's nonlinear logic to function as curator and satisfy her drive for forbidden knowledge. Pressure accumulates through examples (pomegranate, fig, then the undocumented tree) until the cameo/tree moment tightens her comprehension and forecloses her prior bewilderment. The escalation is Accumulative rather than Causal—density increases until the pattern snaps into focus. Cost is visible (she must eventually inherit herself backward, foreclosing linear identity), though the final beat asserts this more than it dramatizes a trade-off in present action. One meaningful deepening satisfies the length.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: rescue the trapped students. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira identifies the overlapping seventeen visits as the rift cause, narrows her tactic to the diary's circular-etymology entries, and forges the harmonic bridge. The traveler's contract with forgetting functions as the pressure point that enables resolution. Agency is shared (Mira speaks, traveler reads), and the cost—eternal recurrence for the traveler, another cycle for Mira—is conceptual and felt in the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake—recapture the understanding the twins offered—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. Isla's storytelling produces fog shifts, a modest pressure point, but no tightening that narrows live options or forces a trade-off with felt cost. The garden's arrival feels summoned by atmosphere rather than driven by protagonist agency; Isla walks forward without renouncing an alternative or paying a legible price. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening or cadence shift is present (fog colors bleed through), but escalation lacks visible consequence that alters tactics or forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—merging split timelines to end decades of confusion—is clear and accumulates through discovery beats (seal, letter fragment, rope pattern). The closure tightens when Marin's rebraiding stabilizes flickering documents and completes Chen's failed mission, with conceptual cost (posthumous diplomacy, absence resolving into presence). One meaningful deepening occurs when she grasps the seal's instruction, narrowing her options to a single solution. No live opposition or trade-off in the braiding moment itself; competence proceeds smoothly without friction that would elevate escalation further.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—restoring acoustic balance—is signaled early and tightens in the ice gallery when she threads harmonics through crack-revealed sequences. The bloom's expansion provides one meaningful deepening that narrows options (she must sit in exhaustion, will need to remap). Agency is clear: her humming and pattern-reading conjure the effect. The energy beings' lack of resistance or adaptation slightly weakens escalation, keeping this below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—proving coincidences are meaningful through rekindling the beacon—is signaled early and threads through each discovery beat. However, escalation reads as accumulation (star tracking, shadow observation, shard retrieval) rather than tightening choice or visible trade-off. No live option is foreclosed; Mera encounters no friction, no failure that forces adaptation, and no cost in obtaining the shard or repairing the prism. The piece ends in preparation ("prepared to prove") rather than in a moment where agency closes a path or pays a price.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake is signaled early: documenting unstable memory "with an urgency that bordered on desperation" before the fog changes again. Pressure accumulates through the storm's brief window and Maris's race to capture shadow angles before dawn. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening (the realization that "memory doesn't preserve us. It transforms us"), but the escalation is more textural than agential—no choice narrows options or forecloses a path with on-page cost. The storm passing and fog softening provide a natural closure beat, yet Maris's agency remains observational rather than decisional at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—defying hopelessness—is signaled early and pursued through Mara's mosaic discovery and fireworks display. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as a density increase: from ambient awareness to mosaic interpretation to the climactic light show, pressure tightens through purposeful layering. However, no live opposition or meaningful friction complicates her execution; the commander's arrival is passive, and the fortress yields without resistance. The cost at closure is conceptual (partial change, not transformation), meeting the lens's requirements but lacking sharp on-page trade-offs or visible prices that would elevate the score.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—Mei's resistance to Lin leaving versus understanding her niece's need for transition—is signaled early and tightens through the jade cicada exchange. The hermit crab observation provides one meaningful deepening that shifts Mei's stance from wanting to "hold you here" to recognizing "we're all creatures of the threshold." Agency manifests as Mei's renunciation of control with visible cost (accepting her niece's departure). The escalation operates through accumulative pressure (silence → conversation → shared understanding) rather than confrontation, consistent with the textural lens. Lin's agency is present but secondary; her role is to catalyze Mei's shift.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—capturing the gilded hush—is signaled early and pursued through concrete actions: climbing, securing herself, limiting sensory exposure, extending the doll. The flower's unfurling during inversion provides one meaningful tightening that narrows the window and forces immediate action. Agency is clear: Lina's choice to lean closer and uncork the doll at the precise moment of bloom drives the closure. The cost is opportunity-based and conceptual: she must act during the compressed inversion hour, and the descent back to her father's bunker-world with her "proof" carries implicit relational/philosophical cost. Under the Accumulative lens, the pressure coheres through escalating texture until the gilded hush's appearance decisively reweights her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: Mara's professional task (guiding the man through grief toward intentional quiet) is signaled early and coheres. The man's question "Does it get easier?" and Mara's response constitute the story's one meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens—his breathing slows from 42 to 28 decibels, and the palm-press on the storm glass forecloses his prior shattering with visible, if quiet, cost. No explicit antagonist is required; pressure accumulates through the juxtaposition of the man's posture, the noise levels, and Mara's practiced attention. The stakes remain modest and observational, appropriate to the vignette structure, and the cost is legible in the man's altered state and Mara's ongoing labor.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (find the stairway before sunrise) is signaled early and coheres. The ruby flake warming provides escalation, and peeling paint layers tightens access. Agency at closure is renunciation with stated cost, but the decision not to sit lacks on-page friction—no competing desire or fear tests her commitment. The sunrise deadline is honored structurally but never pressures a tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—Maya's sanctuary versus the "encroachment" of connection—is signaled early. One tightening occurs when Sienna crosses the threshold, narrowing Maya's options from absolute refusal to provisional teaching. However, the escalation lacks a visible cost: Maya's shift from "you can't stay" to "teach me" is accomplished by recognition and empathy rather than a trade-off that forecloses her isolation with on-page consequence. The phone's placement is a promising beat, but the story closes before that choice exacts a price, leaving pressure prospective rather than paid.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (anchor paradoxes to prevent reality collapse) is signaled mid-story and tightens once through Maya's volunteer choice. The escalation reads under a situational lens: mounting pressure from texts → bolt appearance → threshold discovery → decision. However, the resolution relies on a late-breaking rule (the bolt can "hold paradoxes" if she's "strong enough") introduced by the coalesced presence, not earned by prior causality. The cost ("pressure will be immense") is declared but not dramatized with visible forfeiture or altered tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (uncover hidden truth) is signaled early and tightens when the standing waves concentrate near the safe, forcing Mara to act on incomplete knowledge. Agency is present: she chooses to play the recording, approaches the safe under audio guidance, and presses the hidden panel. One meaningful tightening occurs (waves reveal the compartment location), narrowing options from general search to specific action. The cost—learning the fortune never existed—alters her understanding and validates her refusal to continue the dynasty, though the price is conceptual rather than a trade-off between competing live options in the room.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming grief into possibility—signals early and tightens when she enacts the patterns. However, escalation is textural rather than choice-driven; the knight encounters no meaningful resistance or trade-off. The "unsnapping" actions proceed smoothly without visible cost or forfeiture on the page. Agency appears in her oath to possibility, but the resolution arrives through mystical mechanics rather than a decision that narrows options with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: honoring unknown histories versus remaining isolated in grief. The discovery sequence tightens pressure—each file deepens the soldier's sacrifice until the rolled list reveals court-martial and his plea "someone should know they existed." Sarah's agency is decision and endurance: she chooses documentation labor as her response, foreclosing direct grief processing. The final act of lighting another lamp and beginning to write closes a path with visible cost (ongoing displacement, commitment to institutional memory over personal healing). One meaningful deepening via the rolled list is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (spread pre-revision archives before capture) is clear and tightens when three safe houses are raided. The pressure escalates through the discovery sequence and Bureau arrival, creating one meaningful turn. However, agency at closure is undercut: Mira completes her upload before the Bureau arrives, so the escape reads as cleanup rather than a high-cost choice. The transmissions succeed without visible sacrifice—no failed upload, no ally left behind, no information she must destroy to protect others.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is established early: hush the prophecy or let it take root. The whispers pressing against her silence create coherent pressure. One clear tightening: she shifts from fleeing (childhood) to standing firm, then discovers she must play the pauses themselves. Agency is strong—her technique choice (outlining emptiness, making silence musical) forecloses the path of ignorance. The cost is legible: accepting a lifelong custodial role, abandoning her harbor audience.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—decoding the message in falling leaves—is signaled in paragraph three and drives all action. The moonstone discovery provides one meaningful reversal that narrows focus from passive watching to active prodding and monument construction. However, the escalation lacks visible cost or trade-off; Miren's seventeen years of sorting never conflict with her new insight, and the Head Gardener's tolerance means no social or professional price appears. The "understanding bloomed" moment deepens knowledge but does not foreclose a live option or force a sacrifice scaled to the seventeen-year obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding the pattern of broken clocks—is signaled in the opening line and drives every beat. Escalation proceeds through tightening choices: recognizing the pattern, following the clue, excavating the fountain, descending into the cavern. The final decision to leave everything intact forecloses the path of "fixing" and reweights her trade with visible cost (she takes only memory and the compass rose). Under the Causal-Accumulative lens, pressure coheres and deepens. No antagonist is needed; the mystery itself supplies resistance. The piece delivers one meaningful turn (the shift from solver to witness) with legible cost, meeting the 600–800 word escalation standard cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—retrieving Kael—is clear, and Mira's ritual escalates from preparation to invocation to manifestation. Yet the opposition is abstract: no one stops her, the experiment succeeds on first attempt, and the transmutation circle obeys her intent without friction or cost beyond the symbolic wedding ring. The apprentice's vanishing happened off-page, so we never witness the original failure's mechanics or Mira's complicity in real time. The "exploring limits" method is invoked in past-tense summary but not tested during the on-page ritual, which proceeds smoothly to success.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: freeing trapped souls by reintegrating joy with grief. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ghost breaks from her script and remembers laughter, narrowing her options (stay trapped or move on). The protagonist's agency drives the turn through music and the crocodile's tooth. Visible cost is present but muted—the ghost pays by releasing guilt, but Mara's own forfeiture or risk isn't dramatized beyond carrying a damaged harp. Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening suffices, but the lack of personal jeopardy for Mara limits escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: "to find something...the mathematics of mercy." Pressure accumulates through three memory surges, each forcing Kira to process pain while searching for pattern. The tightening occurs when she realizes the forest models transformation—"absorbing her pain. Converting it to something else"—which narrows her approach from abstract equations to a biologically grounded metaphor. Agency is evident: she chooses to let the surge come rather than fight it, carves multiple attempts, works through the night. The cost is legible: she must carry her enhancements back to a world that doesn't glow, "forever changed." Minor gap: the interrogator's hesitation is recounted rather than shown in a discrete beat, reducing its pressure contribution slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: recover the grandmother's erased history and method. One meaningful tightening occurs when the final painting names the grandmother and reveals the scale of erasure, raising the cost from personal vindication to institutional challenge. The presentation to the Guild Council is declared but not dramatized, so the confrontation that would test resolve remains off-page. Mira's agency is consistent—she searches, acquires, decodes—but these are puzzle moves rather than decisions under opposing pressure. No antagonist appears to complicate her research, and coincidence (the merchant's promise) delivers the key artifact without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (uncovering hidden truth) is signaled early and pursued consistently. One meaningful tightening occurs when Marcus finds the photographs and understands the ghost's murder, narrowing options to documentation. However, pressure never escalates—Marcus encounters no obstacles, no competing demands, no cost to his retrieval. The ghost's revelation is cooperative rather than conflicted. Coincidence (the mainspring barrel just happens to be visible, the box perfectly preserved) enables rather than complicates. No agency-driven reversal tests Marcus's commitment; he simply executes a task.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (destabilizing perfection to allow living knowledge) is signaled early. The broadsheet and whisper escalate pressure, but the library's transformation occurs without visible resistance or a second tightening choice. Margritte faces no trade-off or cost when uncorking the whisper; Tessian's shift to wonder is a conceptual deepening, not a narrow-options reversal. The piece relies on Accumulative/Textural pressure but lacks a second beat where protagonist agency forecloses a path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: prove the non-human origin of the baroque asteroid against academic dismissal. Pressure accumulates through the storm sequence—Matthias checks coverings, sees the alien builders again, realizes they also covered mirrors—deepening from professional dispute to existential witness. The final mirror-touch crystallizes his isolation and commitment with felt cost (ongoing bitter dispute, solitary elegies). One meaningful tightening occurs when the storm validates his poetic methods by revealing the builders' identical precautions. Agency is present but muted; Matthias observes and records more than he decides, and no on-page choice visibly forecloses an alternative path during the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (restore stolen melodies) is clear. The accumulative lens allows pressure to build through the seven-box sequence. Yet no single box resists or forces a tactical shift—each restoration follows the same humming-and-tethering method. "Everything hung in the balance" declares jeopardy, but the narrative never dramatizes a near-miss or a thread that scatters. The resolution is smooth and cost-free, weakening the felt escalation required even in accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—finding "fragrances that defied commodification"—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when the lagoon offers a scent that "resisted capture." The compass pull creates spatial pressure; the psychometry reading deepens understanding of her uncle's thirst, raising the question of whether to collect or preserve. The resolution (collecting yet leaving the compass) narrows her options with visible cost: she forgoes synthesis and future visits will be pilgrimage, not extraction. One meaningful turn when she shifts from collector to pilgrim.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—finding the design breakthrough for her commission—is signaled early and narrows through the slide's layered revelations. One meaningful tightening occurs when Iris reimagines the installation as "living architecture" rather than static form, deepening her approach. However, no live option is visibly foreclosed; she gains methodology without evident trade-off. The storm forces the archway encounter but does not resolve the design problem—the slide does—creating slight convenience pressure. Agency is present (she chooses to abandon GPS, read landscape, place driftwood) but the cost of these choices remains conceptual rather than immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding why flowers bloom at night—is signaled early but remains cerebral throughout. Marina's months of failed attempts are summarized rather than dramatized; we never witness her struggle through a single unsuccessful mural in real time. The discovery of the etched glass tightens her understanding but arrives as observation rather than choice under pressure. No visible cost or trade-off accompanies the breakthrough; Marina simply paints through one night and succeeds.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—uncovering encrypted truth—is signaled early and tightens when the diary trap closes around Maya. The retrocognitive imprisonment creates escalating pressure: she cannot escape until dawn, forcing her to witness the fragile 1952 parley with all its tension. The sheriff's conditional alliance ("I can look away") deepens moral complexity without resolving cleanly. Maya's final choice to decode everything and name the protected carries visible cost: loss of archival solemnity, transformation into active channel. The parley itself provides a meaningful turn that reweights the stakes from academic recovery to living testimony.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—transforming the town via the bottle—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when she "pressed the bottle to her forehead" and channels working memory. The bottle's shattering narrows options from passive study to active reimagining. However, the escalation is compressed into one beat; the "three days" of study is summarized without dramatized trial or error. Cost is conceptual (foreclosing restoration in favor of transformation) but lacks visceral immediacy or visible trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—decoding the accidental prophecy to understand why the foghorn's silence matters—is signaled early and drives Miriam's actions (cataloging recordings, climbing to the orchard, speaking both versions of the Etruscan rhyme). The moment when the wax shaving grows warm and she feels the tree's longing is a meaningful tightening that narrows her interpretive options and reweights her life's work. However, pressure remains largely internal and cognitive; there is no external opposition or visible trade-off that tests her commitment. The resolution arrives through mystical insight rather than a choice that forecloses a competing path with on-page cost, which keeps escalation coherent but limits intensity under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—restore the stolen seed collection or begin again—is signaled early and remains coherent. The vortex sequence provides one meaningful tightening: she can reach through to borrow time, discovers the texture "feels wrong," and withdraws with visible cost (the collection remains lost). Agency is clear in the withdrawal, forecloses restoration, and the cost is legible on the page. The piece would benefit from more friction between want (restoration) and fear (entropy debt) within the moment of choice, but the single turn is sufficient for this length under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (save the sanctuary from zero hour) is signaled early and tightens when Mira discovers the inversion arrives "within the hour." Her choice to use the bell instead of the siren is protagonist-driven and forecloses the mechanical option with visible cost—potential panic, defiance of protocol. The storm's arrival and survival constitute one meaningful reversal. Agency is clear: her listening versus noise philosophy drives the turn. The cost (risk of being wrong, institutional defiance) is felt though not ruinous.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—finding meaning in solitary observation after personal loss—is signaled early and tightens through the lantern-glass revelation, which reframes Kael's self-perception from broken to beautifully flawed. One clear deepening occurs when he realizes "cracks let the light through," a micro turn that narrows his self-judgment and opens a path to singing at dawn. Agency is present as endurance and attention (continuing the vigil, teaching himself the meteor language), and the cost is visible in ongoing solitude and the station's marginality. The escalation is modest but sufficient for this length; a second pressure point (a threatened interruption or resource limit) would have lifted the score higher.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding the ghost keeper's purpose and the box's covenant—is signaled early and tightens through observation, failed attempts, and pattern recognition. The escalation is driven by Silas's agency (study, experimentation, rotation sequence) under the Accumulative lens, narrowing from mystery to actionable insight. The resolution costs him continued isolation without purpose, converting it to witness-keeper duty. One minor friction: the ghost's fade feels slightly convenient rather than a consequence Silas must accept as ongoing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding time without numbers—is signaled early but remains abstract. The single turn (urn fragment clicks, projection appears) is coincidental rather than driven by protagonist agency; Marcus inserts the piece without struggle or tradeoff. No escalation narrows options or forces a choice with visible cost. The resolution (Marcus will teach Chen's methods) is future-oriented summary rather than an on-page decision that forecloses a path. Accumulative lens doesn't rescue this: no deepening or cadence shift reweights the stake at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is Maya's ongoing practice of tending incomplete poems; secondary is the young man's blocked writing after loss. Pressure accumulates through the drake's imperfection, Maya's notebook reveal, and the kite's erratic behavior, then tightens when the string snaps—turning apparent failure into release. The young man's agency drives the turn: he tries to "harmonize the tension" and the snap becomes his visible cost (an hour's work lost) that reweights his stance toward brokenness. Escalation is accumulative and clean, with one meaningful reversal that narrows his options (he can no longer write the old way) and opens a new path.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake: restore the failing temple before death. Pressure accumulates through discovery (hairline fractures → pattern revelation → planting solution → mist color shift → renewed vitality). One meaningful tightening: the fractures "stopped spreading" after copper installation, validating her method and narrowing her path to full restoration. Agency is clear: Marina decides to remodel despite terminal diagnosis, choosing legacy over treatment. The cost is legible—she dies having exceeded prognosis but forfeiting mainland care. No antagonist required; the temple's decay and her body's clock supply coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding the visitors' claim about homecoming chemistry—is signaled early and pursued through the staged return. The discovery of footprints provides one meaningful tightening that narrows interpretive options. However, the story lacks a second pressure point or trade-off that would force Kira to risk something tangible. The resolution (recognizing the footprints as quantum-printed by her own return) feels more like intellectual arrival than a choice with visible cost. Escalation operates through discovery and recognition rather than agency under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming the battlefield with growth—is signaled early and pursued methodically. However, no opposition or tightening occurs: Erasmus encounters no resistance, makes no trade-offs, and the birds confirm rather than complicate his plan. The work proceeds as reconnaissance and execution without escalation. One meaningful pressure point (low tide tomorrow prompting a return) appears but adds logistics, not cost.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: whether Finder can cross the distance (literal and emotional) to reconnect with Crow. One clear tightening when the leaf's coordinates point west, narrowing options from passive receipt of the cylinder to active three-day journey. The reunion beat pivots on Crow's test: "I needed to know if you still remembered how to read what others miss"—Finder's skill under pressure earns the closure. The cost is legible: fifteen years of war, scatter, silence, and the implicit vulnerability of hoping again. No antagonist required; the wasteland and emotional distance provide sufficient pressure under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake signaled early: survive isolation by finding purpose. One meaningful tightening: Kira's confusion transforms into a mapping project, which then crystallizes into the realization that "true north was whatever you chose as your reference." Agency is clear—she refuses evacuation, chooses to sketch, redefines orientation—and the cost is legible: permanent temporal exile, family lost to millennia. The escalation under Accumulative lens works via density increase (sketching days/weeks, filling pages, the anniversary date ritual) and a cadence shift at the compass-rose epiphany. No reversal needed; the deepening suffices. The price paid (timeline divergence) alters her final stance from exile to expedition.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: repair the corrupted sky by swapping the right pieces. One meaningful tightening occurs when Seren realizes she might choose wrong, narrowing options with visible risk. Each piece swap escalates through consequence (sky flickers, suns separate). Agency is clear—her decisions drive all major turns. The cost is legible in the final image (she must bury the lies, accept solitary keeper role). However, the swaps proceed too smoothly without tactical adaptation or visible loss, slightly flattening the pressure curve.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving memories of the vanished pawns—is signaled at the chessboard discovery and tightens through Mara's escalating method: from observation to guided walks to forcing repetitions "until the muscle memory emerged pure." Her benevolent ruthlessness forecloses gentler approaches with visible cost ("She was cruel because she was kind"). The interregnum's suspension creates persistent situational pressure (no government to document, nomadic survival), and her choice to continue "one footstep at a time" in the final image crystallizes her renunciation of other roles. Minor cap at 8.3: while pressure is coherent, the colleague's scene slightly softens momentum before the ending rather than tightening further.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding her lost home—is signaled early and sustained through nightly rituals. The feather arrival provides one meaningful complication that tightens the search, and the texture-reading breakthrough narrows options by forcing her to confront the flood of painful memories she'd been substituting. However, escalation is primarily accumulative rather than a sharpening dilemma; there's no moment where she must choose between forgetting (safety) and remembering (pain) with a visible tradeoff on the page. The seed metaphor arrives as insight rather than hard-won choice, which keeps pressure coherent but not knife-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is Elena's need to forgive herself, signaled early through exile backstory and the curse's thematic mirror. Pressure tightens when she decodes the tapestry's final instruction—self-forgiveness without conditions—and must vocalize her failure and growth. The palm-to-labyrinth moment is protagonist-driven agency with visible cost: she speaks her mistake aloud and releases regret, freeing both village and self while remaining in exile. One meaningful escalation under the Causal lens suffices at this length. The ending reweights options clearly: internal freedom versus continued social disgrace.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake signaled early: evade singular judgment by refracting truth. One meaningful tightening occurs when the canyon amplifies rather than scatters, forcing acceptance. The cost is legible on the page: she gathers paints she'll never use, walks toward inevitable judgment. Agency is renunciation with visible forfeit. No antagonist is present, but the ritual looms and the canyon's acoustic properties provide pressure. The turn is protagonist-driven (her all-night effort proves the opposite of her intent).

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: complete the kintsugi repair before the acid wave destroys the workshop. Pressure escalates through the tilting platform, shrieking gears, and the cathedral-tall wave rushing toward her. The reversal—understanding the pockmarks as map rather than damage—narrows options and accelerates action. Agency is strong: Mira's choice to pour her own uncertainty into the throat pockmark completes the pattern and enables the golden fusion. The cost is visible: she must place her most vulnerable essence (her fog-grey doubt) to achieve closure, and the wave strikes immediately after.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—whether Marina will remain "intimately aloof" or risk immersion—is signaled early and tightens through cave discovery. The wrong turn escalates pressure by confronting her avoidance with Thomas's challenge ("you're afraid to live inside them"). One meaningful deepening: sitting in cold water forecloses the observer stance with visible cost (ruined clothes, time spent, vulnerability). The gallery knock extends this with relational cost. No antagonist required; the situational pressure (cave beauty, shell's arrival, memory) coheres. Minor issue: the declaration to the gallery owner tells the shift rather than showing a harder choice in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: reconciling with Vera before Silas dies. The pressure coheres and tightens once through Mara's realization that her shouts carried fury but not truth. The whispered apology narrows options (no grand gesture, vulnerability exposed) and Vera's immediate response confirms the cost. However, the escalation is more internal realization than on-page reversal; Mara's agency at the peak is passive reception of Silas's lesson rather than a difficult choice that forecloses a live defensive path. The final embrace lands with emotional weight but minimal tactical trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is Mara's project of guiding the lost home, with her daughter as motivating shadow. The midnight phone call beats are coherent and patterned, but pressure does not escalate—each call feels iterative rather than narrowing options. The woman's progress ("touch the stone," "another mile north") is resolved off-page without complication or reversal on Mara's side. No on-page tightening or trade-off alters Mara's tactics; the ending restates the work rather than testing it with visible cost. One meaningful deepening is absent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (psychological privacy/coherence) is signaled early via involuntary truthfulness. One clear tightening: the neighbor's question forces Mara to broadcast pain she "couldn't bear everyone feeling," which directly motivates the glass-eye gambit. The eye-press moment narrows options—either fracture further or risk the relic—with legible trade-offs (authority pursuit, possible failure). Closure choice (descending to help others) is driven by protagonist agency and forecloses solitary endurance. The phrase "another fracture, another piece of grace broken off" makes cost visceral before the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—decode the stranger's final gesture—signals early and tightens through the investigation. Margit's choice to release the flower forecloses preservation, with visible cost: the borrowed memories vanish immediately. The pressure is more contemplative than agonistic, fitting the Accumulative lens, and the gaps she observes (birthday ending mid-song, proposal without answer) create meaningful friction. Ernst's weighted pockets and the pinned flower outside establish agency in his final act, and Margit's responsive release carries reciprocal weight.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—honoring the lingering promise—is signaled early and tightens through accumulating signs (ants, creek, midsummer light). Marcus's agency is visible: he follows the ants, pushes aside honeysuckle, approaches the door, and inserts the chip. The tightening is meaningful (each sign narrows his options toward the cavern), and the final act forecloses his "comfortable isolation." However, the cost is declared rather than shown in a concrete forfeiture; stepping through "into his decision" reads as conceptual repricing rather than a dramatized price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding the recurring dreams—is signaled early. The climb provides physical escalation, and the encounter with the old woman offers a knowledge shift. However, the pressure doesn't meaningfully tighten through protagonist agency; the old woman simply shows her the visions and explains their meaning. The queen's agency at closure is to "return" and "rule," but this decision lacks an on-page trade-off or visible cost that forecloses another path.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving what matters before Kael loses his sight—is signaled clearly when he reveals his condition at midpoint, creating urgent pressure. Mira's agency drives escalation: her decision to create memorial pocket-suns (not just commercial ones) and commit to staying represents a meaningful tightening with visible cost (foregoing capital success, reputation, financial security). The six-month timeline creates concrete constraint. Kael's revelation functions as an effective reversal that narrows Mira's options and forces her to choose between paths, with the resolution earned through her specific alchemical capability demonstrated on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is legible early: distill chaos into narrative, find pattern in time's collapse. Pressure accumulates through escalating impossibilities—grave discovery, shuffled days, dream-waking bleed—and the protagonist's agency is continuous documentation despite futility, an Earned Stasis with cost (isolation, fragmentation, "jaded wonder"). One meaningful deepening occurs when the text moves from past scrolls to present writing to the final existential uncertainty about the lamp itself, reweighting all prior attempts. Minor issue: the middle catalog of time distortions feels slightly static before the ending tightens; the escalation reads more as accumulation than a sharp turn narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: Elena's search for purpose after sensory loss, signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mr. Chen's story about his mother mirrors Elena's loss, forcing Elena to reassess her own mourning. The tightening forecloses her old identity ("I thought losing my smell meant losing my purpose") with visible cost—she must accept a transformed practice. Agency is present in her final realization and walk home. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens. The escalation is more conceptual than tactical; no second reversal tests the new understanding, keeping it mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (proving worth through truth-rune) is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful deepening: Kael's realization that crystallization is preservation, not flaw. Agency is decision and renunciation (shedding shame, exposing scars) with visible cost (vulnerability, exposure). The escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: the rune emerges from the pattern of scars, transforming trauma into sigil. Cost is unmistakable: "Each stroke shed another layer of shame." The final acceptance ("scars visible") forecloses the path of hiding with felt emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—Mira's need to apologize before the archive (and chance) is destroyed—is signaled early and tightens when Derrick refuses easy forgiveness, forcing her to endure uncertainty. Agency is clear: Mira chooses to come, abandons her defensive metaphors, and offers the bottle as tangible renunciation of her old armor. The refusal of full reconciliation forecloses the path to restored friendship with visible relational cost. No false reversal; Derrick's "I'm glad you came" deepens pressure rather than deflating it.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—unraveling cosmic illusions—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the walk is linear and the "shift" in the library's silence is declared, not dramatized. The final dissolution ("walls began to thin") is coincidental rather than earned by Kael's agency; he does not make a choice or endure a visible cost. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through pattern break or cadence shift; here the reflections loop without escalation until the summary ending.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: understanding what clocks measure. The piece signals this early and maintains coherent pressure through Maren's ritual protocol and mounting conviction. One tightening occurs when the key fits and the pendulum swings, narrowing her path to the revelation. However, the escalation is largely internal and observational; Maren does not face a live trade-off or visible price until the very end. The cost at closure (stopping counting, renouncing measurement) is conceptual and understated. No antagonist or external complication tests her commitment; the tension remains contemplative rather than pressurized by competing goods or unavoidable harms.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: understanding the father's lucid contradiction and finding a responsible way to teach probability. Pressure tightens once: interpreting the notebooks reveals "Expected Feeling of Aliveness: Incalculable," which narrows Mira's options from theoretical rebellion to accepting the gap between knowledge and behavior. Agency is decision and stance crystallization: drafting the syllabus and choosing to visit with the notebooks. The cost is visible—she foregoes her former theoretical distance and steps into the uncertainty she criticized. No requirement for multiple reversals at this length; the deepening is earned and coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—reconnecting estranged people—is signaled early but never tested on the page. Iris encounters no opposition, resource limit, or moral friction; every intervention succeeds off-stage. The "seventh night" moment summarizes her method rather than dramatizing a live choice with visible cost. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the loop perpetuates without escalation. Agency is present in her system design but not in a peak choice under pressure at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: whether to continue preservation as penance or transform it. The locket's arrival is the reversal that narrows options; Mira's choice to write the card and wear the locket at the jetty tightens pressure under the accumulative lens. The cost—she must now face memory rather than avoid it—is legible in "steep herself in memory rather than hiding from it." One meaningful deepening is sufficient here, though the shift feels more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (Vera's loneliness masked by frantic logistics) is signaled early and tightens when the young man's question forces confrontation. The Budapest-Bratislava supply crisis demonstrates competence but remains a secondary problem that resolves off-page. One meaningful turn occurs: Vera drops the jocular mask and makes calls "without the jokes, without the mask," forecloses her prior coping strategy. Cost is visible (vulnerability, presence) but the young man's patient waiting resolves too easily—no friction between his need and her emotional risk.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—finding the stillpoint to survive grief—is signaled early and tightens through the ring's intensifying pull and accelerating note-trail. One meaningful turn: Mara recognizes her wife's hummed melody, raising emotional cost and forcing her to continue rather than retreat. The final kneeling enacts agency through endurance (Earned Stasis) and forecloses the path of endless mapping with on-page cost: she accepts coexistence rather than resolution. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; each absorbed note deepens investment without requiring multiple causal reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: redeeming her mistranslation and learning to interpret correctly. One meaningful tightening: when she discovers relational chains, her approach shifts from isolated readings to contingent webs, narrowing her method and raising interpretive cost. The settlers' response provides on-page consequence. Agency is decision and endurance—she chooses to send all seven versions rather than hedging. The cost is visible: she forfeits certainty and the comfort of singular truth. No antagonist is required; the anomaly and her own prior failure supply pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—translating silence into music—is signaled early through Celeste's challenge and Marina's fumbling response. Pressure tightens when Marina realizes "I've been trying to remember music...But I should be discovering it," a reversal that narrows her options from nostalgic recovery to present creation. The camera's filmless state becomes a meaningful constraint: she must learn to see without capturing, a renunciation that forecloses her old method with visible cost. The final dance dramatizes agency—she sets down the camera, an active choice that completes the transformation under accumulative pressure. The cost is legible: acceptance that "the world had forgotten her" and she no longer needs external validation.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—rescuing Kiran's legacy from institutional erasure—is signaled early and drives the documentation/upload decision. One meaningful tightening occurs when Marina discovers the vandalized portrait contains coordinates and evidence, narrowing her mission from abstract vindication to concrete exposure. However, the escalation is largely internal and reflective; the archive itself does not resist her, and no external pressure forces a trade-off. The cost (permanent criminality, no return) is declared but not tested by a present dilemma. Agency reads as completion rather than a pressured choice between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—whether the entangled memories can persist and matter—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs when Maya moves from solitary drumming to feeling "them all with her" at the lagoon, then the universe exhales and the moment passes, narrowing her to the knowledge that she must return repeatedly. The cost is legible (bearing thirteen lifetimes, the ache in her fingers, the ephemeral nature of contact), but Maya's agency is more endurance than decision; she doesn't foreclose a live option so much as reaffirm a ritual, which under Accumulative lens is acceptable but trends toward the middle of the band.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Mira gaining access to the name behind container 4472-G—is signaled early and drives the deal. The negotiation is the story's one clear pressure point: Voss needs a guide, Mira wants information, and the exchange narrows options. But the middle "hunt" unfolds without friction: Mira deduces the pattern off-page, leads Voss to the correct container, and the smuggler is arrested without complication. No reversal tests Mira's commitment, and the final cost (trading anonymity for information) is stated rather than felt. The story delivers one meaningful tightening (whisper → deal → payoff) but lacks a second turn or visible price that forces Mira to lose something on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Mara's unspoken guilt and her brother's disappearance. One meaningful tightening occurs when the guardian gestures downstream—forcing her to choose between continued silence and saving her brother. The decision is hers (protagonist agency), and the cost is visible: public confession and the end of her safe secrecy. The guardian's light patterns serve as complication and pressure rather than resolution; Mara's voice becomes the active instrument. No coincidence resolves the problem; her knowledge of the tangled currents is causal.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring children's curiosity and agency against conformity—is signaled early. Escalation is present but gentle: Marina plans, recruits shop owners (off-page), orchestrates the display, and witnesses success. No meaningful reversal or cost tightens the pressure; the rebellion succeeds without resistance or trade-off. Under the Accumulative lens, the synchronized displays constitute a single tightening, but the lack of visible friction or protagonist sacrifice keeps this from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.1)
    One dominant stake is clear: Marina's need to release the grip of her brother's death and the fighter identity. The scrimshaw discovery and whale's call provide one meaningful deepening that narrows her to a binary—hold or release. The Treaty and dampeners create background pressure, though they function more as setup than active complication. Agency is present in the choice to speak aloud and release the bone, foreclosing the protector role with visible cost (the sinking island, the departure of the whale). Escalation is moderate; the piece would score higher if the cost of releasing had immediate tactical consequence rather than solely interior reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—cultivating a bearable form of grief ("remade hush")—is signaled early and tightens through the whittling sequence: "just made the wood smaller" → "nearly translucent" → voice crack → bouquet touch. The act of whittling embodies escalation under the Accumulative lens; each curl is "grief made physical, then dismissed," a compression that narrows Maya's defensive distance. The final move (reaching for the bouquet, stopping narration) is protagonist-driven and forecloses the performed-blankness path with felt cost (disintegration, silence, "permission to feel"). No antagonist required; the turbines and Mandate aftermath supply coherent external pressure. One meaningful deepening is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding and reclaiming forbidden aesthetic philosophy—is signaled early and drives the entire piece. Pressure accumulates through the humming's response, the shift from reading to speaking/paraphrasing, and the physical reactions (lake groaning, quartz warming). One meaningful tightening occurs when Lyren moves from observation to active paraphrase, which triggers the environmental response and her internal certainty. The escalation is modest but coherent under the Accumulative lens. However, the cost remains largely conceptual (refusing council authority) without a visible tradeoff or loss that narrows later options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—awakening Fen to imperfection—is signaled early and coheres. The plant arrangement, reed tongue demonstration, and painting tour form a sequence that deepens rather than reverses pressure. Fen's hidden vase provides one meaningful tightening: he's already made the imperfect work but denied it, so Mira's role shifts from teacher to permission-giver. The barter at closure forecloses Mira's solitary vision (she must now teach) and Fen's perfectionism, but the costs feel more conceptual than viscerally tested. No antagonist or complication resists the awakening; Fen's objection ("I don't understand these games") evaporates without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Karim believes the corrupted data is "worthless" and the project "defunct." The bell ringer's question "What if it was a discovery?" applies immediate pressure, and the demonstration narrows Karim's options from mourning-restoration to accepting-transformation. One clear tightening: Karim's realization that "the real pilgrimage was learning to navigate what remained" forecloses the original therapeutic goal with visible cost (the perfection model abandoned for testimony model). The final choice to rebuild carries felt weight because it commits to a new definition of authenticity. Agency rests with Karim's decision, not luck. Minor gap: the bell ringer's expertise at Karim's equipment ("as though they'd designed it themselves") strains credibility slightly but does not break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—complete the commission and honor the mother's grief—is signaled early and pursued without complication. Mira heats silver, transfers the stencil, mixes ash into resin, and seals the pendant; each step proceeds as planned with no reversal, resource scarcity, or tactical shift. The mention of Vincent's death and the studio loss establishes emotional ground, but those backstory anchors do not introduce live friction in the present scene. No on-page choice narrows options or imposes visible cost scaled to this length.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: understanding how cultural patterns propagate and potentially predicting collapse. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira moves from documentation to confiding her theory that crashes follow predictable patterns. Her agency is primarily observational—she measures, connects threads, theorizes—but the cost of her insight (what she'll do with the pattern) remains prospective rather than paid on the page. Tobias's question "What will you do with it?" opens rather than closes options, satisfying the Charged Poise variant of RR but not fully testing commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—pursuing forbidden knowledge to its revelation—is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when the atoms activate and show the civilization's self-archiving death, narrowing options from "document discovery" to "suppress for humanity's sake." Agency is present in the console interaction and final withdrawal, though the escalation from immersion to renunciation feels abrupt. Cost is visible in "end of innocence" and the choice to "write nothing," but the peak decision lacks on-page friction. No convenience plotting; coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: documenting hope's erosion. The piece presents Lyssa's transformation as evidence but offers no on-page tightening or escalation for Maren herself. Maren's task is "softly deliberate" from start to finish; no reversal or deepening alters her options. The final gesture (stone to glass) registers resignation but does not foreclose a path or force a trade-off. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure accumulates thematically but does not cohere into a visible, felt cost for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (report Adrian vs. protect the animals) is signaled early and braided tightly through the notebook scene. One meaningful tightening occurs as Mara enumerates what she must shed to act (prestige, funding, security). Agency is present in the drafting sequence, though much of the escalation unfolds in reflective decision rather than on-page reversals or external complications. The cost is named but not dramatized through a live friction or trade-off that tests her resolve in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is Maya's broken gift, signaled immediately. Pressure tightens when she reinterprets the coffee-ring gap (her fragmented attention wasn't carelessness but simultaneous care), then escalates to the final beat where she tests her gift on the ivy. The cost is visible: accepting that her healing now "looks different than expected" and that perfection is impossible. Agency is clear—she chooses to channel healing despite uncertainty. One meaningful deepening (the coffee-ring insight) narrows her understanding and enables the final action.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (finding where unused love is stored) and deepens when Marina realizes it's incubating, shifting her goal to release. One meaningful tightening: the forty-seventh night decision to thread all strips and project them narrows options (she becomes the conductor, foreclosing her role as mere searcher). The escalation is driven by her agency under the Accumulative lens (density increase across weeks culminates in projecting). Cost is legible but oblique—she commits to the role of "keeper, translator" with no evident sacrifice of alternatives on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is signaled early and escalates through sensory intensification: whispers become screams, meteors form a map. Yet escalation is delivered through external signs (aurora intensifies, light pours out) rather than Lyra's agency narrowing her options. The astrolabe alignment is a mechanical puzzle, not a forced trade-off. The ending grants universal relief ("Begin again") without showing what Lyra sacrifices or forecloses; her "rest" feels like reward, not cost.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is clearly signaled: cultivate sparks where growth can return. One meaningful tightening occurs when the chess clock ticks and a wave function collapses, narrowing possibility into one branch. Agency is present but operates at a conceptual level—singing, pressing the clock—without visible friction or a trade-off that costs her something immediate and legible. The resolution feels open and ongoing rather than earned through a decisive fork.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding the sixth sense's architecture—is signaled early and tightens when Kael realizes the forest models his own neural pathways. The gear-key application creates one meaningful deepening: dark iron trees shift from threats to recognized defenses, copper joy-maps from distractions to abandoned routes. However, escalation relies on revelation rather than difficult choice. No live option is foreclosed with felt cost; Kael suffers no consequence for unraveling versus leaving, and the "dawn pulling at him" imposes only mild time pressure without altering tactics or forcing trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—retrieving unused courage to chart new paths—is signaled at the trailhead and sustained through the seven stations. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as density increase: each stamp adds weight until the card glows and the brass punch is transferred, reweighting Maya's agency. The guides' persistence and Maya's "eyes burned" / "faltered" steps provide texture, but no on-page reversal or choice forecloses a live option; the journey proceeds without friction or a moment where Maya could refuse. The cost is acknowledged (years, dreams, anger) yet feels catalogued rather than dramatized with a present trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—understanding the cost of safety—is signaled early and tightens when Marta discovers the ash marks, which narrows her question to acknowledgment versus erasure. The tightening is meaningful: her humming becomes active defiance after the discovery, and management's request to stop raises the cost. Agency manifests in her decision to remain and sing despite opposition, forecloses the path of leaving, and the price (endurance, risk, isolation) is visible. One clear deepening drives the escalation under the Accumulative lens, and the final image reweights the stakes with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—unmask Orian before the library dissolves—is signaled early and tightens across beats as walls become translucent and Kael counts down cycles. One meaningful escalation: the final message to Orian (the Chronicle on his desk) raises the gamble from planting doubt in scattered readers to direct confrontation with the pretender himself. Agency is consistent (Kael's inscriptions and her acceptance of dissolution) and the cost is legible: she cannot leave without destroying all proof, so her method forecloses survival. The resolution is driven by her renunciation and tactical ingenuity, not coincidence. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: each inscribed rune accumulates weight until the Chronicle forces recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why migration paths vanish—is signaled early and tightens when Maya realizes they're returning, not disappearing. One meaningful reversal occurs on the page: her interpretive frame shifts from loss to restoration, narrowing options and reweighting her task. Agency is decision-based (assembling data, calling Jin, using pre-industrial models) with a visible intellectual cost: abandoning her initial framework. The escalation is driven by Maya's choices under the Accumulative lens, though the emotional or professional price of this discovery remains muted rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake: discover meaning to reignite rebellion, signaled early. One meaningful deepening: the hum and star-pattern shift her understanding from noise to frequency, narrowing her tactic to ritual assembly. Agency is renunciation of strategy for embodied alignment, with visible cost—she bets credibility on an untestable insight. No explicit antagonist needed; pressure coheres through her internal doubt and the rebellion's dormancy. The escalation fits Accumulative lens: density of sensation (hum, stars, stones) tightens to a crystallized stance.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—whether to unseal an engineered destiny that will reshape her people—is signaled early and escalates through discovery, decoding, and the unsealing act itself. The piece provides one meaningful tightening when the amber shatters, forcing Lira's choice. However, the stakes remain somewhat abstract; we don't see a live cost or tradeoff in the "Yes" moment—no dramatized fear, no path visibly foreclosed. The escalation is causal and coherent but the price at closure is more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: endure the day's triggers (helicopter, incoming children) without breaking. The helicopter beat provides one meaningful tightening—pulse spikes, vision blurs—then the protagonist's agency (walk to glass, count waves) earns the easing with visible cost: "not perfect. Not whole. But enough." The final return to lavender cuttings crystallizes the stance under accumulative pressure. No reversal required; the deepening shows her ritual working with limits acknowledged. Cost is legible: surviving the violence "and also the endless, ordinary after."

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding why her portraits emerge broken—is clear from the opening. The walls contracting provides external escalation that forces faster work. However, the resistance is largely environmental rather than internal; Elena encounters no meaningful temptation to retreat or doubt her new understanding. The resolution feels unearned because we don't see what she's sacrificing: will clients accept fragmented portraits? The cost remains abstract. One clear tightening when she realizes the pattern isn't random, but the final acceptance lacks trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: understanding the crisis-time phenomenon that killed her brother. The spilled ink discovery tightens pressure by revealing the target's escape method, narrowing Kael's options to replication. Agency appears in her decision to hunt for more ink and wait for the next eclipse, foreclosing the path of abandoning the chase. The cost is legible in "She would disappear too, eventually"—a visible price that charges the final image. One meaningful escalation (ink patterns → drone footage → understanding) drives the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to activate the dormant networks and risk her mother's fate—is signaled early and tightens when Kael realizes the letter is from the living, not the past. That reversal narrows her options from passive archiving to active conspiracy. The final transmission is a protagonist-driven decision with stated cost ("no matter the cost," her mother's execution as precedent). However, the escalation compresses: the move from recognition to action occurs within a few paragraphs without an on-page complication or second tightening that would test her resolve under new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (teaching resilience/continuity vs. inherited violence) is signaled early and sustained. The father's hand on his weapon creates immediate pressure; his move to the knife is the key reversal, and his choice to sheathe and ask to learn narrows options with visible cost (identity shift from killer to student). The piece operates under Accumulative pressure, deepening rather than multiplying turns, which fits the length. The cost is felt but not maximally visceral; the final image charges meaning more than it enacts sacrifice, keeping this shy of 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (catch the goddess's laugh to cure daughter's silence) is signaled early and pursued through escalating agency: Mira steers toward disturbance, produces anti-sound, drives the spike, holds firm against resistance. The cost is legible: the laugh tries to scatter her across the garden, and she must risk her own transliteration. One tightening deepens pressure (the echo resisting capture while constellations stumble), sufficient for this length. No reversal needed under the causal lens when the final move forecloses all retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—correcting a historical injustice versus protecting family legacy—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Adelaide's contradiction method forces her to choose truth over mythology. The cost is made explicit: "That will damage your family's credibility." Agency is clear in her decision to publish. However, the escalation is primarily intellectual rather than situationally pressured; Marcus's evidence is persuasive but doesn't force a trade-off with visible on-page consequences beyond the stated reputational damage. The price is told more than felt in action.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—hushing the dissonance of guilt—is signaled early and accumulates through the firmware messages and discovered letters. Pressure tightens when Mira inserts the amber into the device and hears her own infant cry, prompting the tattoo decision. However, the firmware and letters deliver answers rather than complications; Mira's agency is primarily interpretive. The cost at closure (opening the pendant, easing dissonance) is felt but not a visible trade-off that forecloses a tangible path.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering meaning during the unlearning—is signaled early. The arrival of the woman and the placement of the tile flake serve as a tightening, narrowing the protagonist's solitary effort into a shared ritual. Yet the escalation is more atmospheric than tactical: no live option is foreclosed, and the cost of the final stance remains conceptual rather than felt. The synchronized breathing and the mandala's completion reweigh the premise but do not force a trade-off or demonstrate a visible price paid, limiting the score under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to expose Davos or protect survivors' need for heroes—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs: the Council's vote forces the decision to closure. The cost is legible (Vessa carries the truth as weight), though the escalation unfolds mostly through reflection rather than rising external pressure. Agency is clear in the final choice to pocket the tessera, foreclosing revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—luring possibility from despair by performing echoes that will reach the young man tomorrow—is signaled early and pursued without deviation. Pressure accumulates through her song (each note splits, shows futures, intertwines timelines), and the tarot coin's shift from Fool/Star to Star alone marks a tightening. However, the young man's despair and future discovery are narrated as Celeste's synesthetic visions rather than on-page confrontation, so escalation reads as textural intensification without a live trade-off. The resolution is earned by her performance, but no option is foreclosed with visible cost; she remains bound to the building, still seeking applause, and the consequence is deferred to "tomorrow."

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: help Iris access lost telepathic pathways. The static shock provides one meaningful reversal (from passive care to active research), and the discovery that pathways form a language deepens options from "cure" to "illuminate hidden pathways for thousands." Maya's agency drives escalation—she devises the muscovite bridge, photographs sessions, presents to Dr. Chen—with visible cost in the three-week labor and the acceptance that "there was no cure." The final image shows both earned stasis (Iris remains damaged) and forward motion (guiding another survivor), with the cost of fragile hope made undeniable. Pressure coheres under the causal lens throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: documenting the sleeping world's transformation, becoming its voice. Pressure is atmospheric rather than escalating; Mira's actions (floating, diving, speaking) don't narrow options or face a live test. No reversal or tightening choice appears; the narrative moves through deepening description toward a stance already established. The ending restates her purpose ("she would map it all") without a decision or renunciation that forecloses a path with on-page cost. Under an Accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Maren's relationship to the prophecy that has "shaped every choice, every path closed to her"—is signaled early. The tightening occurs when the jar clarifies against the buttons, revealing the scrambled nature of the prophecy. However, the escalation is cognitive rather than pressured: no antagonist resists, no secondary cost complicates her decision to go public, and the "eastern wind" reference at the end feels cosmetic rather than a live test. Agency is present but the cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: complete the mission that killed everyone. Pressure accumulates through Claire's realization that hiding isn't healing, Marcus's snow-messages, and the 80%-complete intelligence package that requires her unique vault access. One meaningful tightening: the "When do we leave?" question forecloses the observer life and commits her to Berlin with visible risk. The escalation is more cumulative (months of misreading → recognition → response) than causally sharp; Marcus's arrival supplies the final piece rather than Claire forcing the encounter. The vault-access detail and the spring-road deadline add tactical constraint, though both appear late and feel convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: the woman must cross before dawn to witness the palimpsest contract. One meaningful tightening occurs when the rain gutters slow and she realizes her focus on "legal words" obscured her mother's actual intent—this narrows her options from legal battle to relational clarity. The coachman's decision to wait until conditions allow crossing provides agency. Cost is legible (she folds away her documents, releases desperation) but the price could be sharper—what specific legal claim or family conflict does she forfeit?

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why places resist entropy—is signaled early and pursued through observation and tending. One meaningful tightening occurs when the potter notices the trees lean toward kindness rather than sun, shifting her tactics from passive observation to active care (clearing debris, speaking to the space, filling the lantern glass). Agency is enacted through attention and ritual rather than confrontation; by the seventh evening the thrumming grows louder, confirming her approach. The cost is conceptual and relational (leaving "something of herself behind—another timeline"), legible in the final image of walking differently and understanding her own craft anew.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Mira's promise to "stop hiding" after the rose dies—is signaled early. The move from private gardening to public lighthouse illumination provides one meaningful deepening, but no on-page reversal or trade-off narrows her options. The children never resist or question; the fisherman's boats are conveniently available; no logistical or emotional friction complicates the plan. Cost is asserted for tomorrow rather than paid in the scene. Under the Accumulative lens, the escalation reads as additive (gather, row, light) without a pressure point that forces Mira to sacrifice or endure.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—translating isolation into independence—is signaled early and remains coherent. The tightening occurs when Kael confronts the cartography wing she'd been avoiding, a reversal of her evasion pattern. However, the escalation lacks concrete cost or trade-off; she stands firm during the tide and places the sundial, but no live option is visibly foreclosed and no tactical price paid. The resolution (choosing to remain and chart territory) feels more like philosophical acceptance than a decision that alters her capabilities or relationships with visible consequence scaled to the scene's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (Mei Lin's impulse to preserve versus release) is signaled early and tightens when she encounters the installation. The act of tying all forty-three letters forecloses her keeper role with visible cost. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds through the storm revelation, Jun's confession, and the village reunion. One friction: the visitors' recognitions feel like a montage that diffuses rather than sharpens individual agency; Mei Lin's own turn carries the weight, but secondary escalation is more atmospheric than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (stop the manipulation before the community fractures further) is signaled early and pressure tightens when chanting resumes outside. The sequence initiation is a clear reversal that narrows options—once she starts, she risks amplifying the tricksters' power. Cost is legible ("won this round" implies ongoing battle and equipment risk was mentioned), but the resolution feels clean rather than forcing a visible trade-off. One meaningful escalation is present and causal.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear and signaled early: recover the hidden key. Pressure tightens when the organ sounds and the corridors contract, forcing Mara to act despite claustrophobia. The climactic moment—tracing the pattern and reaching through—narrows options and delivers the key. However, escalation is largely external (organ, space shifts) rather than driven by protagonist choices; Mara reacts more than she drives turns. The cost at closure (gasping, existing in five corridors at once) is stated but immediately relieved, reducing felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.9)
    One dominant stake is signaled: understanding the killer to prevent future violence. Pressure tightens through the ribbon discovery → workshop connection → motive insight, narrowing Vera's interpretive options. The decision to paint is an act of agency but the cost is conceptual (taking on loneliness) rather than a visible forfeiture. One meaningful deepening occurs, but escalation remains cognitive rather than situational—no live antagonist or external constraint forces the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—vindicating Dr. Voss's predictions and potentially saving routes—is signaled early and persists. The nail's revelation is a meaningful tightening that narrows options (they now have the correction factor), and Mira's counter-proposal (publish through coded stanzas) is a tactical pivot. However, the escalation lacks a felt trade-off: no resource is spent, no relationship strained, no immediate danger confronted; Yoon's hope and Mira's smile are emotional shifts without visible cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—witnessing and recounting the disappeared—is signaled early and Maria's agency (descending, photographing, choosing to add a verse) drives the progression. However, the escalation is more textural than pressured: she encounters no resistance, no cost to her scramble, no trade-off in her choice. The "secret" reveals itself cooperatively once she's in position. The final commitment to bear witness feels significant thematically but lacks a visible sacrifice or foreclosed path—what does she give up or risk by adding this verse tonight?

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake signaled early: Luka seeks to understand "why some paths circle back" and whether he can break the inherited pattern. One meaningful tightening occurs when he realizes the territorial markers are "breadcrumbs leading away from the old pattern" rather than fortifications, narrowing his options to staying versus repeating the flight reflex. The fox encounter deepens pressure by externalizing the question of boundaries and recognition. Resolution is earned by protagonist stance crystallization: he will stay "until he learned to distinguish between returning and repeating." Visible cost: he forfeits the COO escape hatch and any immediate clarity about his next venture. Agency is renunciation with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—decoding the temple inscriptions—is signaled early and tightens when Kove reveals Chen's death and his guilt. The midnight conversation deepens pressure by introducing the shared-burden theme, and the collaborative overlay of star cycles narrows options: decode alone and fail, or witness together and succeed. However, the escalation is more additive than agonistic; no live option is visibly foreclosed with on-page cost. The resolution feels like discovery rather than a choice that trades one path for another.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—breaking the curse by finding its source—is signaled early and pursued through escalating circles. The mid-story reversal (curse punishes interrupted truth, not evil) narrows options and shifts tactics. However, the climax resolution hinges on a tool (the seed) introduced late and wielded without visible cost or trade-off; Kael faces no genuine dilemma in deploying it. The price of "losing herself temporarily" to gain the vision is noted but not felt—no lasting consequence or foreclosed path makes the victory costly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—finding the intersection and understanding the eclipsed covenant—is clear from Mara's opening reflection and sharpens when Chen confirms it. One meaningful tightening occurs when the group gathers and begins constructing the maze, narrowing Mara's solitary search into collective ritual. However, the escalation lacks a visible price: no established option is dramatized as foreclosed, no resource spent, no fear overcome on the page. The resolution ("guide others through it") is declarative rather than dramatized through a choice that alters tactics or costs Mara something she values. Coincidence does not resolve, and the protagonist's agency drives the final stance, but the felt cost required for high-band entry is conceptual rather than legible in action or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will attempt to reverse Kael's trade—is signaled when he asks her to "trade it back." The revelation that Senna was Kael's destined wife tightens the ethical calculus, but the turn lacks on-page cost; Mira's decision to "try" is stated intention rather than a forfeiture or renunciation that forecloses a path. Kael's agency is mostly declarative (he arrived with cards, he asks for the reversal) rather than a choice under pressure. The escalation depends on backstory revelation more than present dramatized pressure, and the cost of attempting the reversal remains off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: discovering purpose after public failure and loss of confidence. Pressure accumulates through the authentication scene where Marcus must balance honesty (risking the woman's disappointment) against his impulse to hide. The tightening occurs when he offers "smaller truth" about her father—a micro-choice that enacts his struggle between facts and faith. The final turn (tacking the cloth, resuming work) deepens rather than reverses: he accepts ongoing uncertainty as method. Cost is visible in his continued isolation and the quarry's unrelenting silence. One meaningful escalation under the Accumulative lens is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (understanding Dalmar's "physics of transition") is signaled early and sustained. The piece offers one meaningful tightening when Asha realizes the arbor itself is the "magnetic gate," which reframes her approach and leads to the eighth planting. However, the fruit's growth and her epiphany arrive without visible cost—no foreclosed alternative, no tactical trade-off, no price paid. The escalation is conceptual rather than pressure-driven, and agency at closure is largely passive reception of knowledge rather than a decision that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder after tomorrow's disappearance—is signaled early and remains coherent. The discovery of the founder's pages and the smelting ritual provide one meaningful tightening that narrows Maren's approach. However, the escalation is more procedural than pressured: she finds what the dream suggested, reads instructions, follows them, and succeeds without visible friction or competing costs. The "wintersun serenity" undercuts urgency. Agency is present (she chooses to smelt the pages), but no live option is foreclosed with felt consequence, capping this in mid-7s under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is Mara's professional duty versus human connection, signaled early through her certification badge and "tomb of panic and pragmatism" frame. One meaningful tightening: the journal entry "we learned it was beginning" reframes her entire cataloguing mission, forcing the preservation/decommissioning choice. Her agency—etching her confession, crowning herself—forecloses the path of bureaucratic detachment with felt cost (professional risk). The escalation operates under the Accumulative lens: each shell adds pressure until the journal crystallizes the pattern, then her recorder moment tests commitment. No explicit antagonist, but the Commission's protocols provide coherent opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled early and tightens through the graffiti encounter and the decision to play. The move from "protective distance of pure documentation" to embodied action narrows options with visible cost (accepting imperfection, ending her flight). Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is present. The price is legible: she must bear raw grief without medication's cushion. Pressure coheres, though the escalation curve is gentle and the final choice feels more like acceptance than a forced trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—finding the unspoken library—is signaled early and sustained, but escalation is minimal. The Librarian tells Elena her Council letter will be denied and his future letter will grant access, collapsing external opposition into exposition. The watch spins "wildly," time thickens "like syrup," but these sensory intensifications don't narrow options or force a trade-off. Elena ascends, touches a book, experiences a cascade, and begins documenting—no reversal, no visible price paid that alters later tactics. The middle is atmospheric accumulation without a pressure point that reweights cost.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: authenticate for Empire favor versus honoring the violin's intended purpose (propagation over possession). One meaningful tightening occurs when Kemble delivers the sunset deadline and "Dream of anything" promise, forcing Iris to weigh futures shown in coffee stains. Agency is clear—she chooses to sketch the blueprint and spread it underground, a renunciation of Empire favor with visible cost (exile, loss of security). The micro-turn when she shifts from backward authentication to forward-looking propagation narrows her options under causal pressure. Coincidence does not resolve; the final act is hers. Price is legible: "exile, maybe, or worse" and the closing "difficult one illuminated" confirm a path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: honor the weaver by capturing her spark before release. Pressure accumulates through the ritual steps (emerald placement, static-pattern finding, beautician work, release) but remains procedural without a tightening or choice that narrows Kael's options. The "transfigured" outcome feels assured from the start; no reversal, obstacle, or cost forces a trade-off. Accumulative deepening is present but escalation with visible price is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake signaled early: Mei's role as caretaker and her search for contentment. The arrival of her daughter's killer creates immediate pressure that tightens her internal conflict. One meaningful turn: confronting the soul forces Mei to test her forgiveness in practice, not theory, narrowing her options (comfort vs. honesty). The resolution is earned by Mei's choice to guide him with truth rather than ease, and the cost is visible (she places the hairpin back, continuing her work with full knowledge of pain). Agency is decision and endurance; coincidence does not resolve. Escalation is clean under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Keegan's need for certainty versus accountability—is signaled early and tightens through the mirror confrontation. One meaningful turn occurs when Mara reframes doubt as "the only honest garment," forcing Keegan to choose transparency over validation. The resolution (writing the failure paper) is earned by Mara's counsel and carries visible cost (public admission, career risk), though the escalation is largely dialogic rather than enacted through conflicting attempts. Agency rests primarily with Mara's insight delivery; Keegan's role is to receive and capitulate, limiting protagonist-driven pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Maia learning to exist between presence and absence—is signaled early and tightens when Keiran reframes her goal from invisibility to understanding the relationship. One meaningful deepening occurs (the shift from watching rings to seeing the gaps), consistent with the Accumulative lens. Agency is attention and receptivity rather than decision; no live option is foreclosed on the page, and no visible price (time, relationship cost, renounced path) accompanies the realization. The resolution is delivered to Maia rather than earned through her struggle, capping this in the upper 6s.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—releasing the trapped hunter's pulse—is signaled clearly when the arrowhead arrives with its "wandering, untethered" consciousness. Pressure tightens through the bird-pattern appraisal, revealing the pulse's origin and frantic loop, then deepens when the skimmer must teach stillness to something defined by motion. The reversal is clean: from chase-obsessed circling to expansive echo-mapping. However, the skimmer's own agency feels understated—she waits, hums, and teaches without visible personal cost or tactical adaptation. The resolution is protagonist-driven but lacks a felt trade-off or foreclosed path for her.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: proving that old magic and "the sacred in simple stone" still matter. The climb provides escalating physical pressure, and the keystone placement is a clear tightening that narrows options (she completes the act or fails). Cost is visible in the physical struggle and the knowledge that automatist mages will come to investigate. The piece leans more toward accumulative pressure than sharp reversals, which fits the inferred lens, but the Academy's looming response after closure adds tangible friction. One micro turn: the keystone fits perfectly, triggering the luminance cascade.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (discovering mother's journals and the color of sound) is signaled early and tightens once: Marcus's dive, discovery, and the wreck's settling groan. The escalation is linear rather than multiple reversals; the single turn (finding the final entry) deepens understanding but doesn't narrow options in a way that forces a trade-off. Agency at closure is renunciation ("mysteries aren't meant to be solved") with conceptual cost, but the cost feels declared rather than viscerally paid—he simply returns to lamps without visible sacrifice of a live alternative pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Kael seeks to align with purpose via backwards prophecy interpretation. Pressure accumulates through repeated coin-casting and frequency adjustments, offering one meaningful deepening when the prophecy reframes decision-making itself. However, no visible trade-off or foreclosed option appears on the page—Kael's choices are iterative refinements without cost. The static bursts complicate her task but do not reverse or narrow her options. The ending articulates her purpose but does not dramatize a price paid or path renounced, leaving escalation legible but not charged with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake clearly signaled: Mara's inability to name souls after her daughter's death. Pressure tightens when she begins naming the atlas monsters, crystallizing grief into portable form—a meaningful deepening that forecloses the path of avoidance. Agency expressed through deliberate naming and blade-work, with visible cost: she must carry the sharp-edged crystals forward. The transformation from "could not remember a single name" to mapping fears for others demonstrates escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (restore the river, cosmic balance) is clear early. One tightening: Maren waits for the precise dripping-rate alignment, then swings the bell. The swing succeeds immediately without complication, adaptation, or visible alternate cost—no failed first attempt, no sacrifice of another resource. Her agency is present (months of prep, the final swing) but the climactic beat lacks friction; the "plausible impossibility" unfolds as stated reward rather than hard-won trade-off. Cost at closure is the perpetual vigilance commitment, which is conceptual and earned by prior setup but not tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether to restrict or memorialize the drowned town—is signaled by midpoint and tightens when the supervisor demands expungement. Mara's agency drives the key turn: her choice to propose a memorial and send copies to external groups forecloses the path of compliance with visible cost (insubordination threat). However, the resolution summarizes the community response in a single paragraph rather than dramatizing a confrontation or second reversal, and the cost remains abstract (threats) rather than a lived consequence on the page. The final image of people arriving and weeping provides emotional closure but lacks a tactical price that alters Mara's situation beyond reputation risk.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—completing her life's work—is signaled early and sustained. The orchard visit provides one meaningful deepening when the starlings reveal "emergent intelligence in chaos," prompting her to act on instinct. However, the pressure is contemplative rather than escalating; no live constraint forces the choice, and the seventeen-year gap collapses in a single decision without visible cost or trade-off on the page. The resolution credits wonder and belief but doesn't dramatize what she risks or forfeits by speaking the forbidden words or dissolving the crystal.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving trust while defending an accurate reading—is signaled early and tightens when the council's contradicting reports arrive. One meaningful reversal: Vera's choice shifts from defending her authority to teaching her method, a tactic change that forecloses the simpler path of pronouncement. Agency is clear (she composes the message, releases the buckle) and the cost is visible: sharing methodology redistributes the burden and risks exposing fallibility. The escalation is driven by protagonist decision under situational pressure. No coincidental resolution; her reading stands because she can demonstrate it.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Kenji's emotional reconnection versus his clone's legal claim—is signaled early and remains coherent. Master Yoon's confrontation applies pressure, and the courtroom scene tightens the choice. However, escalation is thin: Yoon's lesson flows directly to Kenji's epiphany without a middle reversal or forced trade-off that narrows options. The withdrawal of opposition is a meaningful act, but it arrives through insight rather than a decision under fire that forecloses a live path with visible tactical cost. The clone's minimal on-page presence reduces the felt weight of choosing "brothers" over rivalry.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (restore household voice) is clear from the start. Marcus's action—conducting leaf blowers and lullabies—tightens when the sound reaches the family and the brother finally speaks, a meaningful deepening with visible cost (grief acknowledged, no longer frozen). The escalation is gentle but real: silence → strange sound → tears → first words. One hairline slip: no on-page obstacle or resistance tests Marcus's resolve mid-symphony; the pressure accumulates texturally rather than through antagonistic friction, which fits the lens but leaves stakes feeling slightly unopposed.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (understanding and inhabiting her displaced role) is signaled early and tightens when she touches the pendant, forcing a choice about her identity. The piece accumulates pressure through her sustained waiting and physical degradation (forgetting, moving on all fours), then deepens understanding when the mist resolves into frost-books. Agency appears as endurance that forecloses return to ordinary existence—she accepts boundary-guardian status with visible cost (bones creaking, homesickness persisting). One meaningful tightening occurs; the resolution is earned by her practiced acceptance of uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—interrupting the stifling Royal Metallurgist destiny—is signaled early and drives the climactic choice. The piece offers one meaningful deepening: Maren's realization that her failures were "successive approximations" reweights her seventeen-year effort and narrows her path to the nexus plunge. The cost is legible (betrayal, unfilled position, unmapped territories) but arrives through declaration rather than a trade-off forced by on-page opposition. No antagonist appears; pressure is internal and accumulative, fitting the Textural lens, though the lack of external resistance softens urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—finding the true signal beneath the noise—is clear and sustained. Mira's choice to tune differently ("not seeking peaks...but valleys") provides one meaningful tightening that narrows her interpretive method. However, escalation is gentle; no genuine obstacle threatens failure, and the discovery arrives without visible cost or tradeoff. The "shard of hush" blooms without resistance, and her final understanding feels assured rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (rescue the forty-seven passengers) is signaled early and sustained. The grotto discovery at midnight and the broadcasting sequence provide one meaningful tightening: Marcus weaves names in boarding-order pattern, passengers materialize. However, escalation feels more like puzzle-solution than pressure under fire—Marcus's tactic succeeds on first try without visible cost or tactical adjustment. The three-year timeframe implies prior failures, but we don't witness a failed attempt or see a live trade-off that forecloses an option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (understanding connection to reach her brother) is signaled early and tightens through escalating effects: visitor sensations, thread vibration, illusions reorganizing. The final strand at 3 a.m. triggers the manifestation, narrowing options to either accept the illusion or lose him again. However, the escalation feels more atmospheric than agonistic—Marina faces no visible obstacle or trade-off until the pattern completes, and the cost (surrendering to a constructed reality) is conceptual rather than immediately felt.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—reconnecting with ancestral navigation to bridge human and alien understanding—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure deepens through conversation as Yael articulates why starlight matters before "unfolded horizons," creating one meaningful intensification. However, the escalation is contemplative rather than forced by external opposition; Reeves functions as sounding board, not obstacle. Agency is clear (requesting surface assignment) but the cost is conceptual and deferred rather than paid on the page. No reversal narrows options; the path feels open from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (deliver the boy's message to his grieving sister) is signaled early and tightens when Mara discovers Elena is suicidal and missing. The pressure escalates through Mara's agency (her decision to call authorities, to direct them to the carnival). One meaningful reversal occurs when the simple message becomes a life-saving intervention. The cost is visible: Mara's solitary burden, her need to convince skeptics, and the ongoing cycle of vulnerable voices awaiting her.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (retrieve data, honor sister's memory) is signaled early and sustained. The tidal clock provides external pressure and one tightening moment: "Water began seeping under the door. The tide was returning early." But this reversal is brief and resolved by summary ("She emerged as the sea crashed back"). Maya's agency at closure is a vow to return rather than a decision that forecloses a live option with visible cost in this scene. The escalation is more atmospheric accumulation than a choice-driven narrowing of options, placing it at the high end of mid-band under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—finding coherence after a death-certificate error—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure, however, remains largely internal and static: Marcus waits, reflects, pours ink, watches. The ink vision provides a deepening (grandmother's life reweights his own), but it arrives as revelation rather than a choice Marcus makes under opposition. There is no on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options; the protagonist is passive recipient. The cost at closure (letting go of the counting anchor) is present but not tested by prior conflict, so escalation is weak under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake signaled early: preserve Keshrin before it dies with her. One meaningful deepening occurs when she discovers the diamond's scattering pattern via bird observation, enabling her encoding technique—a protagonist-driven turn that narrows method and raises the stakes from theoretical study to active inscription. The final smile crystallizes her acceptance of the cost (isolation, possible madness) with undeniable on-page pressure; the language's survival in encoded form reweights the opening fear of total loss.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Elena seeks answers about the returned. Pressure tightens when she hears Tom's confession, then escalates sharply with her mother's voice, forcing a choice. The phone-as-method enables the revelation but also feels slightly convenient—her mother's message arrives precisely when Elena is present. The final decision to "learn how to metamorphose" forecloses her documentation path with felt cost, but the escalation relies more on revelation than protagonist agency until the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—freeing beauty from mechanical captivity—is signaled early and intensifies when the statues advance. One meaningful tightening occurs: Lira's music shifts from soft resonance to hard/fast playing that actively uproots the trees, forcing the statues to crumble. The cost is visible (statues destroyed, orchard mobilized) and the protagonist's choice drives the turn. The escalation under the Accumulative lens is sufficient, though the opposition (statues) collapses quickly without testing Lira's commitment through a second pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—delivering the thunderstorm bottle across the border—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira explains the wedding context, raising emotional cost. Kael's agency is endurance and continuation (Earned Stasis), not a decision that narrows options within this scene. The drones provide atmospheric pressure but do not force a tactical pivot. Escalation is mild; the piece deepens understanding rather than intensifying external conflict, fitting the Accumulative lens but limiting the score here.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is legible: translate silence into possibility through restoration. One meaningful tightening occurs when the wrong turn delivers the hidden clearing and the halo fragment; the carpenter's work then escalates from mechanical repair to voiced song, a visible shift. The cost is conceptual—foreclosing pure silence—and felt in the breakthrough moment. Agency reads as attention and endurance (she works through the afternoon, polishes, sings) rather than a high-stakes decision with trade-offs. Under the Accumulative lens this is acceptable, but the lack of a competing pull or visible sacrifice keeps the band from reaching higher.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—finding where stories live—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The "voids" discovery is a tightening, yet no live option is foreclosed and no trade-off dramatized. Meridian's agency is observational; she arranges sheets and notices patterns, but pressure does not force a renunciation or choice with visible cost. The piece deepens understanding without escalating tension or narrowing paths.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (decoding Iris's disappearance through sunrise photography) is signaled early and tightens when Marina chooses the nearly empty aureolin pan—Iris's favorite—forcing proximity to loss. The palette-message discovery narrows options: she can no longer search for Iris's return, only for understanding. Agency is present in the choice to photograph the palette itself and the commitment to return tomorrow. Cost is felt in the renunciation of reunion and the acceptance of indefinite vigil. No second reversal required at this length; the single deepening reweights the stake sufficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (unlock the trapped idea to repair estrangement with Clara) is signaled early and remains coherent. The locksmith's requirement ("disorient you, shake foundations") introduces cost, and Mara's mid-beat gasped confession narrows options by stripping the protective lie. The device chimes, walls steady, understanding floods—a meaningful tightening that forecloses the self-deception path. Cost is legible (tears, the daughter's absence persists, longing remains aching) and the protagonist's acceptance of vulnerability drives the turn. One pressure point is sufficient at this length; escalation reads as deepening rather than reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—recover stolen memories—is signaled early and pursued throughout. However, pressure remains static: Mara encounters no obstacles, no failed attempts, no competing costs. The kneeling and palm-touch succeed immediately, and the returned memory arrives as pure revelation without complication. One meaningful deepening occurs (label "fairy rings" reweights into "key"), but escalation driven by protagonist agency under pressure is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (learning to return from exile) signals early and tightens through Miren's annotation ritual. The accumulative lens supports one meaningful deepening: Kael's shift from impatience to mirroring Miren's backward walk. Cost appears in "becoming strange enough to go home" and the gift of shadow-glass as compass. The escalation is modest—no sharp reversal—but the textural density and recursive motif (backward movement, tea geometry) accumulate pressure toward the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving the heirloom tree's wonder across worlds—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the hours-long weaving rather than a causal tightening; the work's difficulty is asserted (cramped hands, aching knees) but no reversal or complication forces Esme to adapt her method or sacrifice an option. She seeks essences, finds them in other gardens, and braids them successfully; the accumulative lens supports this patient gathering, but escalation remains flat. The ending offers continuation ("other seeds to save") rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Agency is present (she performs the essence-capture) but the cost is durational rather than a trade-off with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: freeing the boy versus the cost of her accumulating silence. The boy's revelation ("my brother pushed me") tightens stakes—freedom won't equal peace, and Mara knows it. Her decision to proceed despite understanding the cost is genuine agency with trade-off. The unraveling cascade is irreversible, a visible narrowing. The brother's presence "somewhere in the night" and the heavier silence Mara adds are felt consequences. One meaningful turn with clear price.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—proving structural stability while capturing the henge's "peculiar grace"—is signaled early and coherent throughout. Pressure accumulates through Elena's examination (the identical gesture, the spiral grass, the older foundations), but no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows her options with visible cost. Her recommendation to expose the eastern approach is presented as a realization rather than a trade-off against competing professional or institutional pressures, leaving escalation underplayed for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: whether Captain Marsh received Eleanor's last transmission, which Marina has spent two years lobbying to discover. The tightening occurs when she finds the radio log and realizes Marsh understood what Eleanor couldn't reach—this narrows her options from "solving" grief's physics to accepting witness. The cost is conceptual but legible: she must abandon the framework that justified two years of effort and three near-death accidents. Agency operates through renunciation rather than decisive action; she chooses observation over untangling. The ascent with the snow globe enacts this shift physically. One micro-friction: the coincidence of finding exactly the cylinder she sought slightly softens the earned pressure, though her response to it drives closure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: the balladeer seeks an audience that will remember her art, and the ghost seeks to voice forgotten prayers. One meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes the bolt plates can encode messages, altering her tactic from song to graffiti. The ghost's encouragement and the storm's pressure cohere, and the final circuit-completion is driven by her agency. Cost is present but soft—she abandons pure song for hybrid art—without a visible trade-off or foreclosed path that charges the image. No overt antagonist, which fits the Accumulative lens, but escalation reads as additive (gathering pigments, painting, completing circuit) rather than a narrowing that forces a hard choice. The "frenzied wonder" moment hints at stakes but doesn't dramatize a competing pull.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: to recover the captain's essence and understand what the sickness stole. The goggles' revelation is a meaningful tightening—symbols resolve into words, joy surfaces beneath anguish—that narrows Maren's understanding and deepens her mission. The entries escalate from patient teaching to pressure-sickness dissolution, and Maren's choice to read the rest and preserve the fragments forecloses simple grief with visible cost: she must carry the weight of love against forgetting. No antagonist required; the altitude's theft and Maren's devotion interweave. Agency is endurance and attention with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—proving empty spaces remember—is signaled early and tightens through accumulation: yesterday's storm leaving "remembering violence," the spectrum measurements building an archive. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara realizes "the air holds their shape forever," transforming grief into testable hypothesis. Agency appears in her decision to present findings despite supervisor and colleagues' doubt, forecloses the grief-leave path. Cost is visible in her isolation and colleagues' clinical watching, though the ending's satisfaction softens the price. Escalation operates through density increase (Accumulative lens) rather than reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding what the guild has hidden and why she was summoned—is clear early and tightens when she finds the custodian dead and the journal directing her to the coin. The discovery itself acts as a meaningful deepening: the coin's fractally precise star charts reframe her entire artistic practice as parallel to the monk's impossible ambition. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds through layered recognitions rather than external obstacles. The cost is visible in her acceptance of "sacred, doomed attempt"—she will continue painting faces she cannot see, mirroring infinity through finite tools. Agency is present in her choice to photograph, pocket, and later paint the custodian, though the escalation is more contemplative than driven by urgent trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—escape from stranded luminance—is signaled in the opening and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Maren decodes the phrasebook and reverses the hopscotch sequence, narrowing options to immediate action. The escalation is protagonist-driven: her agency (decision to place the bolt and scrape backward) triggers the physical consequence. Cost is legible on the page: the ship shudders, the glow dissipates, and the crew's three-day imprisonment ends. The captain's mention of thinning morale and fuel adds secondary pressure without diffusion.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—learning "the rhythm of repair"—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is weak: Celeste ascends, searches, finds prophecy scraps, enters the mirror chamber, and receives understanding without facing a meaningful tightening or tradeoff. The liquid starlight uncapping is a pivotal action, but it succeeds immediately without resistance, risk, or visible cost. No live option is foreclosed; the protagonist's agency at closure is passive reception rather than a decision under pressure. The piece accumulates texture and deepens thematically, but pressure does not narrow options or force a sacrifice scaled to the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving collective economy versus individual wealth—is signaled early and tightens through the merchant offer. Mirela's messages provide one meaningful escalation (Kess opening her storehouse), and the community vote is a clear decision point. However, the merchant ship arrives as an external complication rather than arising from protagonist agency, and the unanimous vote deflates rather than sharpens tension—no visible cost or dissenting voice tests the commitment. The story's pressure is coherent under a Causal lens but lacks a trade-off that forecloses a live option with felt consequence. The resolution is asserted (unanimous agreement) rather than earned through Mirela's specific constraint or sacrifice in that moment.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake is clear: vouchsafe a lullaby into the pattern before time ends. Mara's action—humming, adjusting calibrations, planting the melody—deepens through ritual intensity rather than reversal. The piece accumulates pressure via texture and cadence shift, consistent with the Accumulative lens. However, no on-page obstacle tests her commitment; the nested patterns "open to her like flowers to rain" without resistance. The cost (self-dissolution) is felt but not earned by a prior tightening that foreclosed another live path. One meaningful deepening occurs (the lullaby nests "deeper, and deeper still"), sufficient at this length under the Accumulative lens, but agency remains minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake (save hikers before nightfall/feeding) is signaled early and tightens through the hour deadline and encircling mechanical birds. Maren's agency—walking the blueprint's invisible geometry—directly enables the rescue and forecloses her escape. The escalation is causal: discovery → decoding → guiding → acceptance, with visible cost (nut crumbles, knowledge binds her permanently). One micro-turn when she realizes the aunt's intent shifts the emotional register without undercutting the main pressure arc.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (Maya's paralysis vs. continuation of the research) is signaled early through the eighteen-month avoidance. One meaningful tightening occurs when the foam-pattern observation crystallizes the polymer insight, narrowing her options from grief-bound stasis to active return. The final decision to "finish what they'd started" forecloses the path of abandonment with on-page cost: she must accept transformation and the loss of Daniel's physical presence. No antagonist is required under the Accumulative lens; pressure coheres through the accumulation of natural metaphors (foam, chrysalis, water) that force the stance shift. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency (her choice to observe, to translate, to record voice notes) and the cost is unmistakable in the final image of carrying the chrysalis "like a promise."

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—mapping the origin of stories—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure accumulates through the catalog work: each carved word deepens understanding, moving from "quantifying absence" to recognizing patterns ("mother" seventeen times, "home" nearly cracking the glass). One meaningful tightening occurs when the library "wakes" in response to her work, adding urgency before visitors arrive. The noon deadline creates a structural constraint. However, escalation remains more textural than decisional; Mira completes her task rather than making a choice that forecloses a path, and the cost (slipping away) is mild.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Maren came to "sandpaper rough memories" trapped in the fortress, and the stored remorse threatens to "subsume her entirely." The tightening occurs when she touches the coral and the flood of poisonous memories hits; her chef's discipline transforms the work from drowning to sorting, a meaningful deepening that narrows options (she cannot erase, only gentle). The final cost is visible: the pavilion collapses, its purpose served. One micro-turn (from threatened subsumption to disciplined processing) suffices at this length; escalation under the Accumulative lens is coherent. Agency is present but leans descriptive in the middle stretch ("she moved from pool to pool").

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (connecting isolated refugee communities) is signaled early and remains coherent. Mira's decision to speak directly to Elevator Seven in Tigrinya is the lone escalation beat, but it encounters no resistance—Seven responds immediately with a child's song. No reversal tightens options; no trade-off is visible. The spontaneous harmony arrives as reward without cost. Under the Causal lens, pressure should narrow choices or raise cost; here it simply dissolves. One tightening gesture is present but does not foreclose a live option or charge the final image with a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—completing the abandoned Memory Archive Project and redefining its purpose—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through backstory layering (Keiko's horror, volunteers' abandoned dreams) but lacks an on-page reversal or tightening choice that narrows Maya's options. The decision to "return these dreams" is stated as future work ("began, finally, to make it whole") without a dramatized moment where Maya forfeits an alternative or faces a trade-off with felt cost. Escalation remains conceptual rather than action-driven, and closure does not hinge on protagonist agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding the forgotten combination to plant seeds of vigilance—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the inversion reveals the hidden chamber, narrowing her options to this precise moment and place. Agency is present but muted: Celene's discovery and planting feel procedural rather than a trade-off with visible friction. The cost is conceptual (she will leave, the seeds will remain) but lacks a dramatized forfeit or complication that tests her commitment. Escalation reads as revelation rather than pressure that forces a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—proving music can persist in a silent world—is signaled early and sustained. Mara's strumming tightens pressure as the grove responds, culminating in synchronized movement across all living things. The bleeding fingers provide visible cost. However, there is no resistance or failure; every wire placement succeeds, every vibration travels as intended. The escalation reads as intensification of effect rather than narrowing of options or tactical adjustment under opposition, which limits high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—prevent nexus collapse and save half the city—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the beings respond to her chess positions. Escalation is causal and protagonist-driven: Katrin's theory → setup → correlation discovery → covenant terms as chess problem → beings' refinement. The agency is decision and demonstration; the cost is visible (she volunteers despite doubt, and the covenant becomes a living burden requiring her continued teaching). One micro-turn: the beings' blazing response and creation of a new position deepens the stakes from mere translation to ongoing balance.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: recover what Elena locked away. Pressure accumulates through Marcella's attempts at different frequencies (hesitation, protective silence, love) in a tightening pattern that narrows to the precise vibration needed. The clasp opening is a tightening under the Accumulative lens, and the diary's contents reweight Marcella's fear into understanding. However, the resolution feels awarded by metaphor rather than forced by a tangible trade-off; no live option or resource is visibly spent to achieve the unlock, reducing felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—cultivating serenity within assault on her senses—is signaled early and tightens when the bloom arrives. However, the climactic three-day vigil is summarized ("she remained," "stayed present") rather than shown through moment-by-moment reversals or trade-offs. The cost is asserted ("discovered something profound") but not dramatized as a visible forfeiture or tactical shift under pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs (the bloom's arrival) but the escalation relies on narrated endurance rather than protagonist agency that narrows options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering why her family's orchards fail—is signaled in paragraph four and drives all subsequent action. The Turning provides a meaningful time constraint that tightens the discovery sequence, and the grandmother's echo deepens Kael's understanding of the problem's origin. However, escalation is largely environmental (gravity inversion) rather than driven by Kael's choices under pressure; she succeeds at every step without a meaningful on-page reversal or forced trade-off. The final image gestures toward confrontation but stops before any price is paid, leaving the cost implied rather than visible.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: understand the collapse cause and prevent future disasters. Pressure tightens when Mara realizes the collapse was atmospheric and readings show differential "still growing"—the convergence remains active. However, the residents have already evacuated off-page, removing immediate jeopardy. Mara's agency is observational adaptation (shifting report scope, rapid documentation) rather than a decision that forecloses options with visible cost. The escalation is cognitive rather than confrontational, fitting the investigative frame but limiting visceral stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—performing the ritual to unfetter wonder—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure tightens when "the moment approaching like a physical pressure" and the aurora intensifies, then peaks when "chisel met stone" triggers Kael's response. However, the escalation is situational (waiting for the synchronized moment) rather than driven by Kael's agency testing options; he executes a rehearsed plan without a visible trade-off or mid-ritual complication. The "oscillating repose" of sound-and-silence creates rhythmic tension but no reversal that narrows his path or forces a sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (understanding the threshold collapse to reckon with failure) is signaled early and tightens when the shimmer reveals the flute itself was dying, not her vigilance. Agency appears in her choice to play despite fear, then in her pivot from restoration to documentation—a renunciation that forecloses the restoration path with visible cost (she will "harvest moments of near-connection until the flute gives out entirely"). Accumulative lens pressure coheres: markers → testing acoustics → playing → shimmer → acceptance. The cost is legible: she trades hope of repair for the quieter work of witnessing.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—decode emotion's mathematics before stars vanish—is signaled early and tightens throughout. The operator's agency (placing the fragment, pulling the lever, setting new type) drives each beat. The fragment's shattering is a visible, irreversible cost that enables the breakthrough: Mira feels transposed empathy. The final choice to work "with his own uncertain hands" forecloses reliance on borrowed personas, and the time constraint ("Before there's nothing left to feel about") charges the ending with undeniable urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake is Kessa's struggle to find purpose beyond routine delivery, signaled early and deepened through the farmer and herbalist encounters. The pendant extends each encounter just enough for meaning to germinate, creating one meaningful tightening when the herbalist reveals Orin's legacy. The cost is present but quiet: Kessa accepts her nervousness as part of the work. Agency is clear—she chooses to stop, to use the pendant—but the escalation is gentle accumulation rather than a sharp trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: prove objects absorb emotions to honor her mentor's truth. The frost-reading scene provides one meaningful tightening—Mara releases certainty and observes, the prism darkens with absorbed grief. However, escalation is primarily observational; Mara does not face a trade-off or choose between competing goods. The arbor revelation (stones as archive) deepens understanding but does not narrow options or force a visible sacrifice at closure. Cost is conceptual (inheriting a secret legacy) rather than a felt price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (saving daughter's village from sickness) is clear early. The seven-day weaving provides escalation through physical cost (bleeding fingers) and the amber bead's final dimming marks the price paid. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens through the "raveling silence" growing worse around her work. However, the protagonist's agency reads passive—she follows a discovered solution (the puzzle box) rather than making a difficult choice between competing goods; the weaving unfolds without tactical friction or meaningful risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—resurrecting the planet—is signaled early and sustained. The story delivers one meaningful tightening: the ritual's cost escalates from abstract (bartered memories) to visceral (love, cider, father's laugh) as Kael strikes the crystal. The protagonist's deliberate action drives the change, and the cost is unmistakable on the page. No false reversals; the pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—discovering the truth about her mother—is signaled early and pursued actively. One meaningful tightening: the shard heats and the worlds pulse faster, pulling Kaia through the cascade to the nested pocket. Agency is clear in her final choice to learn rather than stay or seal passages, and the trade-off (accepting her mother's exile path, carrying the weight) is legible. Pressure coheres under the Causal lens. Minor limitation: the nested universe appears exactly when needed without prior friction or false lead, so the escalation feels more like revelation than a decision-driven narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—maintaining connection with the unseen keeper—tightens when the lamp dies and the ghost announces departure. Vera's agency is renunciation of silence (her whisper) and commitment (the written vow), foreclosing solitary delivery work for ongoing communion. Pressure accumulates through the letter series, but no on-page reversal tests her resolve: no weather, supply shortage, or bureaucratic order forces her to choose between visits and duty. The emotional cost is felt ("ached… radiant and painful"), but tactical constraints or a visible trade-off would elevate the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.6)
    One dominant stake is signaled early: steering ships to safety. The storm peaks and ships respond, but Mara's agency is passive observation—she adjusts the wick, then watches the beam "somehow pulling, guiding." No on-page tightening forces a trade-off or narrows options; the prophetic asides (salvage captain, fish flying) never escalate into tested choices. The resolution (dawn breaking green) lands without visible cost or renunciation. Coincidence (the storm, the ships) drives outcome more than protagonist decision.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding why strangers magnetize to her with their stories—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the list of confessors (merchant, pilgrim, baker, soldier, widow) and tightens when the proprietor names the previous owner's work, reframing burden as gift. However, escalation is gentle; the dye master faces no active opposition or difficult choice, only a deepening comprehension. The resolution is acceptance rather than a decision that forecloses an option with sharp cost. One clear tightening occurs when she grasps "iridescent caution" as responsibility, but the stakes remain interior and contemplative rather than pressured by external conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding what the labyrinth has missed—is signaled early and tightens once when Kael realizes "the labyrinth had always been incomplete." The sextant reconstruction is a meaningful deepening that reweights the concept of measurement. However, the escalation is conceptual rather than agonistic: no live option is foreclosed, and the visible cost at closure is labor and insight rather than a trade-off that alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake (rekindle the dying realm) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara's scattered nature nearly prevents focus, resolved by remembering the songs—but this is told summary rather than a dramatized reversal with visible alternatives foreclosed. The escalation from humming to louder singing to spreading dawn-threads reads as smooth intensification without a clear narrowing of options or a trade-off that alters tactics. Elara's agency is minimal; she enacts a pre-scripted role. The dissolution carries thematic resonance but lacks the felt cost or protagonist-driven decision that would lift this into high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why the mistake found her—is signaled early but never escalates into a trade-off or dilemma. Eleanor descends, reads one book, hides briefly, then accepts membership without visible cost or renunciation. The hiding moment offers a micro-turn, but it's resolved in two lines by the guide's reassurance. No tightening forecloses a path: she keeps her solitude *and* gains the society with no on-page friction. The final "home in the paradox" is asserted rather than earned through a choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—resistance to erasure through guerrilla gardening—is signaled early and coheres throughout. The bread's arrival constitutes a meaningful pressure point: it proves her gardens uncloak the vanished, raising the stakes from beautification to recovery. The old woman's framing of absolution versus sacredness deepens the moral calculus. Cost is visible in Mira's acceptance of partial success and her commitment to continue despite uncertainty, forecloses retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving knowledge versus accepting transformation—is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful turn: Celeste's realization that "the library could not be saved in its current form" followed by her choice to reweave the vows into transmissible form. The stakes escalate from measurement to transformation to release, each narrowing her options. Agency is clear: her "gently meticulous precision" drives the reweaving, and the final act of releasing the capsule while staying behind imposes visible cost (her life). The "Unless" paragraph marks the pressure point that forecloses preservation-as-is.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—identifying her father's killer—is signaled early and tightens through the false-lead method to the Kern confrontation. The escalation is causal: each false start was designed to flush the informant, and the north-caves detail delivers the proof. Della's choice to stop recording and release Kern is driven by her agency and forecloses vengeance with on-page cost (she climbs away with no justice, only mercy). The moral calculus between father and daughter sharpens the peak choice with competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Kaia seeks empirical understanding of weather-carriers, testing whether "skepticism can survive proximity to wonder." The convergence itself tightens pressure as seventeen weather-carriers arrive, each signature overwhelming her compass. The mist-walker's challenge ("You're testing yourself, not us") and Kaia's resulting choice to remove the ring and ask for teaching constitute a meaningful deepening and renunciation with visible cost. Escalation under the Accumulative lens works through sensory intensification and the protagonist's agency drives the final turn. However, no live obstacle or competing cost complicates the choice—acceptance arrives smoothly once understanding coheres, reducing friction at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (whether to reclaim her artistic calling) is signaled early and tightens when the painting is stolen. The docent's revelation creates a genuine reversal—Maya came to mourn, discovers intrusion, then faces an unexpected gallery offer. Agency is present: Maya must choose whether to accept the space and expose her grief publicly. Visible cost: exhibiting the brother's portrait means ending fifteen years of self-punishment and facing the art students' world she abandoned. The coincidence of the docent finding the cave and arranging space is somewhat convenient, softening pressure slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring honest conversation in a city of necessary deception—is signaled early and tightens when Kade's candor physically strengthens Mira, proving the concept can work. The Archive discovery provides the means, and the decision to return and tell others escalates commitment with visible risk (exposure in a fearful society). However, the opposition remains abstract (the toxic sky, the culture of deception) rather than personified, and no on-page voice or social force actively resists their plan, limiting the felt cost of the final choice. The escalation is one meaningful deepening rather than a reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder through bell-song—is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page obstacle or live choice forces Mara to trade one path for another. The ice melts at its own pace, bells respond autonomously, and the audience gathers without resistance. One tightening occurs as the fragment shrinks and rhythm quickens, but this is environmental rather than protagonist-driven. The piece accumulates texture without a moment where agency forecloses a live option with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—resolving electromagnetic chaos that threatens Unit-47's coherence—is signaled immediately when the poles shift and "static... fragmented every process." Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: the android remembers the child's method, gathers materials, initiates the controlled burn, and actively compresses its consciousness into manageable boxes. The cost is unmistakable on the page: the box and roses are burned, the android becomes "fragmented but functional," and the static doesn't disappear but is contained. The tightening from frozen paralysis to active ritual to renewed function forecloses the path of seeking external resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake: proving that listening (via neighborhood stories) can unlock sealed grief and reintegrate Iris. The mailbox mystery provides a concrete goal, and Maya's method—arriving early, asking neighbors—shapes her approach. Yet there is no genuine obstacle or escalation: every neighbor willingly shares, Maya finds Iris by coincidence ("heard crying"), and Iris accepts the locket without resistance. The scene with the letters and the courtyard gathering unfolds as smooth accumulation rather than a choice that forecloses a path. No visible cost appears on the page—Maya risks nothing, Iris's shift from flight to presence is told rather than tested, and the resolution feels granted rather than earned through protagonist agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Mira's liberation—is signaled early and builds through accumulative pressure (each journal entry, each dance). The lowest tide in seventeen years creates a ticking clock. However, no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options; the plan unfolds as designed without friction. The guards never detect her, the dice never fail, and no micro-choice forces a trade-off. The escalation is declarative rather than dramatized, capping the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—recovering her grandmother's lost memories—is signaled early and tightens through the sequence: first touch → deletion → chamber stabilization → pattern-reading → successful recovery. The pressed-wildflowers match is a meaningful deepening that narrows her method and enables the climax. Agency is clear (Maren's patient observation and requisitioning), and the final recovery forecloses the path of accepting loss. The cost is conceptual ("slow, silent" work) rather than visceral, which holds the score below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—hush the prophecy before alignment—is signaled early and pursued throughout. The summoner's method (tracing embers, offering peace) constitutes a single meaningful tightening as she gathers the prophecy back to its source. Yet there is no reversal, no moment where her plan falters or forces a trade-off; she simply succeeds hour by hour. The spilled-water ending solves the problem without dramatized resistance, and the protagonist's smile suggests satisfaction without visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—learning the language of old buildings, which is also the narrator's desire to pierce the mystery of Dr. Khoury—is signaled early and tightens when the narrator interrogates her on the rooftop. The confrontation ("How old are you really?") is a clear escalation driven by accumulated inconsistencies. The resolution feels slightly convenient: Dr. Khoury's immediate, full confession and the narrator's instant acceptance ("Teach me") sidestep potential resistance or doubt that would have raised the emotional cost and sharpened the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—proving quarantined memories can survive through resonance—is signaled early and tightens when Mara demonstrates the shell-to-flower connection. The discovery narrows options: "Everything we've archived is wrong" forecloses the old preservation method. However, Chen's instant cooperation and Mara's unopposed success reduce friction; no visible price is paid on the page for this paradigm shift, only anticipated trials ahead.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—complete the emperor's decree—is signaled early and held. One tightening: Lien moves from refusal to acceptance, then executes. The completion itself narrows no further options; she works "through the night" without obstacle or cost-imposing choice. Agency is present (she decides, she acts), but the final act of forgery is summarized rather than tested beat-by-beat. No reversal or complication during execution; the council's framing ("calibrated treason") and her master's vision provide rationale, but on-page pressure plateaus once she lifts the brush.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—learning why some people echo—is signaled early but never tested by a competing want or external obstacle that forces a trade-off. Kael's investigation proceeds without visible cost (no professional risk, no relationship friction, no missed opportunity). The "split voice" moment is a deepening revelation, yet it arrives as gift rather than through protagonist agency or sacrifice. The Veshar's shadow network is declared as conspiracy but never applies counter-pressure or catches Kael in her spying.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: ensuring the Katerina's research reaches the world. The pressure tightens once—Maya moves from mapping fragments to identifying the captain and his motive. However, no on-page obstacle tests her; she deduces, promises, and the ghost departs satisfied. The resolution lacks a visible trade-off or complication; coincidence (the dreams arriving, the ghost cooperating) enables rather than complicates. One meaningful deepening is present but not a turn that narrows options with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake: Chen's preparation to teach the mayor's daughter about hidden patterns. The stake is signaled early but never tested on the page; the girl arrives tomorrow, so the entire piece is setup without a present tightening or deepening. No reversal, no narrowed option, no trade-off dramatized now. The whistled exchange and firefly observation accumulate texture but do not escalate pressure or force a choice. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful cadence shift is required; the return to net-mending offers continuity but not a visible reweighting of cost or options within this window.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to reveal or suppress the stillpoint truth—signals clearly in the opening (debunking conspiracy theories) and tightens when Maya pieces together the memos. The reconstruction sequence provides one meaningful escalation: external radiation intensification is the causal price of the preserved orchard. Maya's agency at closure (burning documents) forecloses her excavation mission with legible cost, though the calculus compresses into a single paragraph. The survivors' desire to destroy the diamond adds external pressure but remains off-page; no immediate antagonist tests Maya's choice in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—Vera's role as Prophet mediating between factions—is signaled early and tightens as both camps claim her allegiance. The tightening is meaningful: pilgrims climb, soldiers position, interpretations conflict. Her final choice to continue broadcasting while refusing to interpret beyond her own vision forecloses alignment with either faction, a visible stance crystallization. The cost is understated but present: she remains "understood by no one." Agency is clear; escalation coheres under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: will she remain in isolated collecting or extend the work outward? The music box discovery and composite layering create one meaningful tightening—context alone isn't enough; connection requires risk. The walk toward the community center with "only pennies and purpose" narrows options and implies social exposure, though the cost of leaving the loft's safety could land more sharply. Escalation reads as density increase under the Accumulative lens; agency is present in the composite assembly and the decision to carry it forward.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—protect the artifact versus free the ice's accumulated pain—is signaled early and tightens when Kael's body begins crystallizing. Maren's choice to hum a complementary harmonic rather than oppose or release narrows options and forecloses Kael's path with visible cost (he becomes ice). The escalation is coherent under a causal lens, but the final harmonic solution feels like expertise deployed without a prior failure or trade-off that tests her commitment to the method.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—escape from Directorate confinement—is signaled early and tightens when the magnetic window opens. The piece escalates causally: Kael's mapping → discovery of magnetic windows → timing the full moon and post-rain viaduct convergence → moving the group through the first leg. Agency is clear: Kael's patient preparation and navigation choices drive the outcome. The cost is visible—"days, perhaps" until discovery, ongoing need for restraint, and the explicit trade-off of wild freedom deferred ("But not yet"). One meaningful tightening occurs at the viaduct crossing, and the resolution is earned by Kael's years of preparation.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake (expose Marcus's murder vs. career destruction) is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening: discovering the fabric fibers and water-level contradiction narrows her options to full exposure or complicity. However, Sara never seriously considers signing Chen's report; no on-page moment dramatizes the pull of self-preservation against truth. The cost is declared ("worth the cost") but not shown—no job loss, confrontation scene, or visible forfeiture on the page. Agency is present but the trade-off remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake: Marcus must convert regret into action by delivering the restored heart. The external goal (repair) is clear, but the on-page pressure is low—Mrs. Chen agrees immediately, no obstacle materializes, and the real test (handing it to Sarah) lies off-page. One tightening: seeing Sarah volunteer forces Marcus to act now rather than defer indefinitely. The piece operates in "calm before realization" mode, so urgency is muted by design, but that choice also means escalation is limited to Marcus's internal resolve rather than a choice under opposing forces. Cost (fifteen years of guilt) is declared but not tested in scene; the ending is a commitment, not a sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—mapping yearning itself—is signaled early and coherent. Yet no escalation or tightening occurs under the Accumulative lens: Fennec encounters no obstacle, makes no sacrifice, and faces no choice that narrows options. The patterns she sees (child's hunger, desire for thought-machine dissolution) complicate intellectually but do not generate pressure or force her to forfeit anything. The ending registers continuation, not a meaningful deepening or shift in cost. One light observation ("We're not ready for that conversation") does not constitute a turn.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: find and recover the trapped consciousness backups. Pressure tightens once when Mira discovers the astronauts are contained rather than erased. Her decision to extract them is protagonist-driven but arrives without visible on-page friction—no supervisor confrontation, no system lockout, no immediate cost that alters her tactics. The lie to her supervisor is mentioned but not tested. One meaningful deepening (realization of purgatory state) but the final act lacks the trade-off or obstacle that would charge it further.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—resolving the fishing-rights feud—is signaled early and tightens through Kael's shadow visions and the fragment exchange. The elders' request "Tell us how" is a meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens, forecloses the collision path, and shifts both leaders' stances. Pressure is coherent throughout. Minor gap: the cost of reconciliation (loss of pride, decades of enmity ended) is felt but could be more vividly specified in tactical trade-offs or a concrete forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake signaled early: Vera's relationship with her planned death. One meaningful tightening: the rescue scene forces her to inhabit the liminal space she sought, which reweights the appointment. The grandmother's touch and song deepen the pressure without reversing it. Agency reads as Earned Stasis with a twist—she neither cancels nor proceeds, a renunciation of urgency that forecloses the original timeline with visible cost (summer commitment, appointment still open). Coincidence (the rescue) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Elena's choice between the practical match and the forbidden one—is clear. Marco's persuasion via the grafting parallel provides one meaningful tightening that narrows her options. However, the escalation is delivered almost entirely through dialogue and metaphor rather than embodied trade-offs or visible prices paid in the moment. The final decision to stay reads as inevitable rather than a hard-won reversal with on-page cost, capping the score below 7.0 under Causal escalation standards.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve the echo before it fades—signals early and coheres. One meaningful tightening: the prophet's statement "consecration requires sacrifice" narrows Maya's path, and she accepts the cost on the page. Agency is clear (decision to consecrate with visible cost: partial consciousness embedded). The escalation is gentle under the Accumulative lens; the ritual walk and prophet's witness deepen pressure, but no sharp reversal tests commitment. Cost is legible but could be more viscerally felt in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—transforming collective pain into shared meaning—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through Mira's arrangement and the arrival of townspeople, but the escalation is gentle and conflict-free: no one resists, no tactical choice narrows options, and the resolution (group planning) unfolds as a natural consensus with no visible trade-off. Thomas's tentative crossing into the field hints at internal resistance but dissolves without cost. The piece offers deepening (arcs in photos → mural/garden plans) but lacks a moment where a live option is foreclosed or a price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—proving language still grows—is clear and urgent. The crystal's fractured recordings provide escalating evidence, and her decision to testify narrows options (she will stand before the Council). Deduction: the testimony itself occurs tomorrow, off-page; present pressure builds through preparation rather than a live confrontation with visible cost. The tightening is meaningful but deferred, and agency remains more anticipatory than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—capturing the sound of growing older—is signaled early and pursued through concrete actions. Pressure accumulates through Marcus's precognitive forgetting creating urgency and Sarah's role as external memory. The arch scene delivers one meaningful tightening when Marcus must choose between capturing (killing) and witnessing the sound. The cost is legible: he relinquishes the recording but gains shared witness. Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening reweights prior material and narrows options with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: synchronize the telescope array before the lunar transit by repairing the clock. Mira's agency drives escalation—she diagnoses the problem ("trying to escape"), removes three gears, repositions the hairspring, gives the spinning purpose rather than stopping it. The resolution carries visible cost: the clock now measures instability instead of conventional time, and the observatory must accept what it cannot hold. The piece enters the 8-band because protagonist choice narrows options (restructure vs. force) and the price is legible (conventional chronometry sacrificed for seismic truth). One tightening point is sufficient at this length under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—Richard's "flawless goodbye" before death—is signaled early and drives Maya's escalating efforts (recordings, seventeen calls, the eighteenth honest message). The tightening occurs when Linda finally agrees to come, narrowing options to the single reconciliation window. Yet the reunion itself, the story's natural pressure apex, is compressed into summary ("They talked until sunset"), which flattens the escalation curve precisely where the cost and agency should be most visible. The final image (Richard holding the vinyl, having "executed the flawless goodbye") confirms closure but the summarized climax limits the felt weight of the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—solve the shadow problem and discover her own ontological status—is signaled early and pursued methodically. The key's discovery, the Codex study, and the magnetic mapping cohere into a single investigative pressure. The reveal that Mira is a shadow and the choice to merge or remain incomplete constitute one meaningful tightening with visible cost (losing independent existence vs. remaining translucent and incomplete). The escalation is primarily cognitive rather than externally contested; no antagonist complicates her decision, and the final beat is contemplative rather than forced by immediate danger. Still, agency is clear and the cost legible.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: how to resolve the displacement of both Thomases. The constellation work provides meaningful tightening—Maren and Thomas arrange and rearrange bones, adding memory-objects, until the pattern shows "connection points—places where two worlds touched." Agency is clear: Maren chooses to help despite the chasm in her certainty, and her professional skill (bone-setting) reframes as understanding "how things fit together when they're not supposed to." The cost is visible: Thomas steps into the light and vanishes, Maren walks back "carrying her new certainty," and the implicit loss of the changeling child she's helped creates felt weight. One micro turn—"Not the way you came...But I think we can set this right"—narrows options and drives the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—transforming grief into shared light—is signaled early and coheres. The white-glass piece tightens pressure (her daughter's memory) and the eastern-wall placement deepens commitment. Visible cost: decades of solitary ritual, ongoing loss. No antagonist required under accumulative lens. One friction: the escalation is textural (adding one more piece) rather than a choice that forecloses an alternate path with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether healing is possible between harmer and harmed—is signaled early and pressure tightens through the pendant exchange. Agency is present: Mira's choice to offer the pendant and her explanation alter the woman's state from trembling to steadier. However, the escalation is gentle and the cost, while felt (the woman leaves with only the beginning of a path, not resolution), could be more viscerally anchored in a specific forfeiture. The piece earns its quiet ending but the tightening is modest—one meaningful deepening rather than a high-stakes reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—finding the novel's ending—is signaled early and tightens when the stranger articulates "solemnizing what the search revealed." The protagonist's agency manifests as recognition and the decision to write, foreclosing the path of literal reunion with visible cost (acceptance of fragmentation). One meaningful deepening occurs when the cameo stranger reframes the search itself. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens; the cost is legible in the final act of writing with the seashell pressed to the page.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—restoring sacred practices to heal the land—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the harvest moon starts to fade and Maera sings faster, narrowing the time window. However, escalation is largely temporal (the moon's descent) rather than driven by Maera's agency or a trade-off between competing goods. The resolution lands without visible personal cost: no tool fails, no second attempt is required, and the final image declares success ("the land remembered") without a felt price that alters her later options.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—translating the daughter's heartbeat to follow her—is signaled early and sustained. The ritual sequence tightens pressure through each phase (arranging items, pouring starlight, transferring the pattern). However, the escalation is processual rather than agonistic; no reversal or complication arises, and the alchemist's success is never in doubt. The burning of the flash paper is framed as release, but the story does not dramatize a trade-off or test of commitment. One meaningful deepening occurs when the pattern reveals the pulsar entanglement, but this discovery does not narrow options or force a visible choice with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding the cavern's purpose—is signaled early and accumulates through discovery beats. However, escalation is textural rather than narrowing: each visit adds knowledge without a tightening choice or trade-off that forecloses an option. The decision to seal the cavern is presented as satisfying rather than costly; no live alternative (publish, share, monetize) is dramatized and refused on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs (timer reconstruction unlocks the harvest), but the lack of visible price at closure keeps this in the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—collecting burden-weights—is signaled early but never tightens into a dilemma or trade-off. The weaver encounters a weight "so old it had merged with the bronze itself," which deepens thematic texture but does not escalate pressure or narrow her options. She realizes the weights form "a single vast tapestry," yet this insight prompts no renunciation, endurance with cost, or decision that forecloses a path. The piece accumulates density without a meaningful turn or crystallization of stance under pressure. No visible price alters her tactics or the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: contain what cannot be contained, honor Viktor through carving. The first cut (commitment to subtract) is the key tightening—it narrows options from blank contemplation to active form-making. The cost is visible: time passing (tea cooling, light darkening), solitary repetition ("Tomorrow she would begin another"), and the acceptance that carved gestures replace presence. One point of escalation is sufficient at this length, and the agency is renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—whether Kera can move past paralysis and reclaim agency—is signaled early and tightens when the camera wheel offers a concrete mechanism for progression. The ghost's gesture shifts from silent accusation to invitation, narrowing options toward reconciliation. Visible cost: abandoning the grand vision for "something achievable in the time she had left." The escalation is more contemplative than causal, fitting the accumulative lens, but the final trade-off (ambition for modest action) carries weight.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—adaptive reuse of the terminal—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation occurs off-page: "filed permits, called in favors...recruited volunteers" summarizes what should be pressure-filled complications. No on-page reversal tests Maya's commitment; the solution unfolds as intended without visible trade-offs or foreclosed paths. The autumn-to-winter montage compresses the work into summary, and no antagonistic force (funding, opposition, failure) dramatizes cost. The ending's community flourishing feels like outcome rather than earned closure under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—making peace with the abandoned dream—is signaled early and deepens when she unwraps the violin. The act of playing is the sole tightening: one thin note breaks the silence, then a simple melody replaces the complex piece that defeated her, narrowing options (virtuoso path foreclosed) with visible cost (tears, the dream "truly gone"). No explicit antagonist, but internal resistance and the glacial hush provide coherent pressure. The piece would benefit from a micro-complication mid-scene to raise the cost further; the turn from arrival to playing is smooth but lacks friction.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: understand why the false legend exists. Pressure tightens when Marcus finds the sundial instead of the compass, then escalates in the hold when he discovers the buried maps and grasps the cover-up. Agency is present—his decision to photograph evidence and keep the sundial forecloses his prior legend-chasing with visible cost (the radio's return feels like intrusion on what he now carries). One meaningful tightening suffices, though the escalation reads more as intellectual assembly than high-stakes conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving heritage seed knowledge—is signaled early and remains consistent. No meaningful escalation or tightening occurs: Maren begins decoding the rope and succeeds without complication, reversal, or cost. The fulgurite revelation is pure solution; she faces no resource scarcity, time pressure, or trade-off between competing goods. The piece substitutes atmosphere for pressure. Under any drive lens, at least one on-page narrowing of options or deepening that changes knowledge with visible price is required; here the protagonist encounters only clarity and abundance.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: Marina seeks to understand healing's geography; Thomas faces the gap between former and current self. Pressure accumulates through Marina's catalog of other absences and her pivot from documenting endings to mapping persistence. The pen-to-palm moment and the thread's reweighting (relic → compass) constitute one meaningful deepening that narrows Thomas's options (remain frozen or accept transformation). Cost is conceptually visible—Marina's deliberate isolation, Thomas's acceptance of a new identity—but the escalation is more accretive than causal, and agency tilts toward Marina's articulation rather than Thomas's on-page decision under duress. No overt reversal; the turn is a reframing.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—reawakening beauty through flawed genesis—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the egg's acquisition (trading the ceremonial sword), the pinhole drilling that yields "a single drop of desiccated yolk," synthesis of the embryonic matrix, and the forty-three-day watch, each step narrowing options and raising investment. The creature's emergence provides a decisive tightening: it will "never fly through open skies" yet it "sang," forcing the prince to accept "something flawed" with visible cost (his tears, exhaustion, father's judgment). Agency is clear in every experimental choice. The cost—beauty achieved at the price of incompleteness—is legible on the page and charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—Maya proving scars can sing through therapeutic ritual—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the grafting instruction and coin symbolism but remains largely one-directional; Marcus is receptive rather than resistant. The smile at the end represents a tightening of emotional stakes, yet no on-page reversal forces Maya to alter her approach or confront a meaningful obstacle. The father's imprisonment and the firefighters' suspicion are backdrop rather than live complications that narrow options during this scene.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—liberating trapped memories—is signaled early and tightens when Mara places the shards. One meaningful escalation occurs (box opens, emotions pour out). The ending forecloses Mara's luminous role with visible cost (glow fades, "no longer needed"). Yet the escalation is driven by puzzle-solving rather than protagonist agency under competing pressures; the box's mechanics do the work, and no live choice tests commitment or forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: can the Keeper sustain hope in the face of pattern-proven futility? The calculating machine gear provides one tightening beat (confirms the generational arc), and the seed-release decision follows, but both beats extend rather than narrow options—no trade-off or path foreclosure with on-page cost. The protagonist's agency reads as endurance under pressure rather than a choice that alters tactics. Escalation is present as accumulative deepening (reflection on past failures → gear calculation → hopeful release → resumption of transit) under the Accumulative lens, but the final act feels like ritual continuation rather than a decision with legible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding collective grief to improve her carving—is clear and signals early. Escalation occurs through Elena's nightly returns and progressive lessons, but the tightening is episodic rather than a single on-page pressure point that forces a trade-off. The final decision to "carve differently" is stated, not tested. No visible cost appears on the page; the forfeited approach and the new method remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake: restore shared balance by transferring the drowned names to the pendulum, signaled early via the wrapped rake handle and Mara's role. The piece operates under an accumulative lens; pressure coheres through the ritual's unfolding rather than external opposition. One meaningful deepening occurs when the inscriptions glow and transfer, narrowing options (she cannot undo this inheritance) and charging the final image with the weight of generational grief. The cost is legible: Mara perpetually carries communal loss, and the town's "loosening" is involuntary absolution rather than earned closure. Minor constraint: no antagonist or complicating reversal tests Mara's commitment; the ritual proceeds without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding Castellan's cryptic bequest—is signaled early and drives the scene through cipher-work to discovery. One meaningful tightening occurs when the decoded threads send her to the floorboards. However, the escalation is investigative rather than pressured by competing options or visible cost; Mira faces no trade-off, time limit, or ethical calculus that might alter her tactics or foreclose a path. The resolution (planting a rose, preserving letters) is kind and inevitable, but lacks the friction of a choice between honoring privacy and making the love public with consequences on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—predict futures and recommend innovations within constraints—is clear from the outset. The piece presents three futures with escalating clarity (Fortress, Extraction, Thermal), and the Thermal option introduces a tightening: constraints force "elegant" design. However, the escalation is expository rather than pressurized; Maren never faces a reversal, a failed model, or a choice that costs her something on the page. The "trembling threshold" of possibility is declared but not dramatized. Agency is limited to completion; no path is foreclosed with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear and early: preserve forbidden stories through covert encoding. One tightening occurs when the cultural patrol passes (Maren cloaks the dial, footsteps recede), briefly foreclosing carelessness with felt cost. No second reversal, consistent with Accumulative lens. The irony of embedding sedition in the state orchestra's concerto adds layer but remains offstage anticipation rather than on-page consequence. Maren's agency is embodied in her copying method and ritual vigilance, but the lack of a second pressure point or visible tradeoff (stamina, missed opportunity, social cost) keeps escalation modest. The ending renews her commitment (Earned Stasis) with the conceptual price of perpetual clandestine labor visible.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (preserve Cassius while maintaining the vanishing practice) is signaled early and tightens as his death approaches. The revelation that Mira has been secretly preserving fragments all along is a meaningful deepening that reweights her entire practice. Agency is expressed through the decision to rebuild him, foreclosing the path of honest scattering with visible cost (the gallery's foundational lie is now permanent). The rocking chair's deceleration creates organic escalation. One tightening is sufficient for this length; the cost is unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—preserve truth against the Council's mysticism—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is descriptive rather than decisive: Marcellus excavates, catalogs, hides evidence, ascends. No choice narrows his options or raises immediate cost; patrol boats pass without confrontation, and his final act (sealing notes) mirrors his opening methodology. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is needed; here the sedimentary metaphor intensifies but never forces a trade-off or alters tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake (teaching harmony across division) is signaled early, but escalation occurs off-page in summary ("week after week"). No on-page reversal or tightening choice that narrows options; the "some students stopped coming" is mentioned, not dramatized. The method (subtracting noise) is applied once in the opening and once at closure without visible friction or cost in between. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is required; summary compression prevents it from landing with felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—grow knowledge fruit in defiance—is signaled early and sustained. The celestial alignment imposes a live time constraint, and the pruning sequence narrows options (removing cruelty and ignorance memories) with purpose-driven cuts. The cost is visible in the act of pruning and the risk of Council discovery, but the final beat offers hope and satisfaction without an on-page trade-off or loss that forecloses a path, keeping escalation credible but not high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—restoring pollination through forgotten knowledge—is signaled early and tightens when Mira solves the riddle. Her climb up the tower with the lacquer box represents agency with visible cost (leaving her post, risking rejection). The escalation feels slightly procedural: riddle → insight → delivery, with limited resistance once she understands. The modified drones "finally dancing" provides closure, though the engineer's immediate acceptance reduces friction at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding why houses feel alive—is signaled early and tightens when Maya realizes objects map the house's original arrangement. The orris root placement acts as one meaningful deepening that changes her knowledge and future tactics. However, the escalation relies on discovery rather than protagonist agency forcing a trade-off, and the cost (abandoning her observer role) is conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the woman will accept and share the complicated truth—is signaled early and tightens through Marina's revelations. The woman's choice to open the ampoule is a meaningful tightening that narrows her options (she cannot un-know what she learns). However, the final decision to "tell them the truth" is declared without an on-page test or visible price; we do not see her weigh the social cost or face resistance. The escalation is conceptual (accumulating knowledge) rather than causal, which fits the inferred lens but leaves the stakes abstract at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—proving perpetual motion to understand what she lost—is signaled early and tightens when proof becomes prison. Elena's agency drives the escalation: her choice to obsessively document and prove leads directly to the rupture ("she could never leave because leaving would break the system"). The cost is visible and dual: she's proven herself into eternal imprisonment while simultaneously losing her last hope of escape. The missed Institute position creates secondary pressure that converges with the primary mathematical quest at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—proving that kindness leaves marks and that strangers remember—is signaled early and sustained. Mira's six-month painting project and the mysterious brush establish pressure. However, the story lacks a meaningful tightening or on-page reversal: the daydream vision arrives without resistance, and the resolve to find the brush-giver is stated rather than dramatized as a choice under competing costs. The accumulative design accretes meaning, but no live option is foreclosed with visible consequence. Agency at closure is announced intention, not enacted decision with felt trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—rescuing dying arts from erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the violinist weeps, shifting from abstract preservation to embodied transmission. The tightening is protagonist-driven: Celeste's invitation forecloses her solitary curatorial stance and opens collaborative vulnerability. One meaningful escalation under the Accumulative lens: the violinist's "first spark of purpose" reweights the museum's function from archive to living practice. Cost is legible in Celeste's acceptance that hope requires shared risk, and in the violinist's decision to re-engage despite trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—escaping fate's forward pull—is signaled early and tightens when Silas discovers the yoyo's compressed moments. One meaningful turn occurs when he reassembles the device and throws it, snapping his wrist backward to reverse the pull. Agency is present (decision to activate), but the cost of that reversal remains conceptual and asserted rather than dramatized with visible trade-off or loss on the page, capping the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: Vera must escape the terror of her disappearing face. One meaningful tightening occurs when she faces the mirror instead of recoiling, narrowing her options to acceptance or continued flight. The advisor's whispers complicate rather than resolve, and the dream dictionary provides a tool that Vera must interpret and act on. Cost is felt conceptually—she releases the desire for fixed identity—but the story does not show what she loses in tactical or relational terms at the moment of closure. Agency reads as renunciation with on-page cost (she becomes "more indistinct, more luminous"), satisfying the lens but not fully charging the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake signaled early: orchard survival against a vast tide. The fractal cloud warning initiates pressure, the tide's arrival forces the three-hour resonance performance, and Kael's pattern-matching narrows options to "harmonize or be destroyed." Agency is clear: her striking pattern enables survival. The cost is legible on the page—exhaustion, three hours of physical labor, the translation of desperation into catalogued knowledge. One meaningful tightening (tide arrival) and deepening (resonance discovery) satisfy the scope requirement. Escalation is driven by protagonist action under the Accumulative lens, and the price (fatigue, transformation of threat into symphony) charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—discovering what happened to the lost expedition—is signaled early and tightens when Mira finds evidence of deliberate gate-sealing. Pressure escalates under the Causal lens through her pattern decoding, which reveals the city's captivity and the council's complicity. The final whistle sequence narrows options: asking the question stops the turtles and summons the watchers' attention. Agency is decision-driven (gathering all whistles, playing the pattern) and the cost is visible—she has ended the city's ignorance and brought Chelone within range of its shepherds. One clear turn (expedition silenced) shapes the ending stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—exposing both medieval and modern censorship—is clear from the manuscript discovery forward. One meaningful tightening occurs: Helena recognizes the parallel and commits to publication despite career cost. However, no reversal or complication tests this commitment; the path from discovery to decision is unobstructed. The cost is declared ("Her career at the state archives would end—she was emotionally rational enough to accept that certainty") but remains abstract rather than viscerally felt. Agency is present but unchallenged, trending toward inevitability rather than hard-won choice.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is legible: Garrett's need to preserve vanished meaning against oblivion. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens but escalation is gentle—the story deepens rather than tightens. The act of placing the note is agency (a choice to document and preserve), but no live option is foreclosed with visible cost; he will continue this practice tomorrow at another site. The timeframe (drawbridge risen, isolated until dusk) creates a boundary but does not force a trade-off or narrow tactics. One meaningful deepening occurs in the shift from measurement to elegy, but the stakes remain steady rather than escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the conspiracy behind his grandmother's displacement—is signaled early and tightens when the blackout grants access to the sealed archive. One meaningful reversal: Marcus finds not just corporate documents but his grandmother's Preservation Society stamp, reweighting the discovery from abstract history to personal inheritance. The approaching footsteps force tactical adjustment (faster photography, selective prioritization). However, the escape itself carries no visible cost or complication; Marcus simply slips away "like a ghost through history," and security never catches up. The final cost is more conceptual (burden of truth) than felt in immediate consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: transforming unbearable grief into something sustainable. The piece shows one meaningful deepening when Mira's solitary practice becomes communal teaching, and the thousandth crane with the diamond represents a tightening (hardest gem, most recent dream). However, the escalation is more additive than narrowing—no live option is foreclosed, no tactical cost forces a trade-off. Agency is present (she chooses to craft, to teach) but without on-page friction or reversal that tests commitment under competing pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (finding where potential pools to weaponize it) is signaled early and tightens when the concentration proves critical-mass-scale. The climactic choice—amplifying perturbations toward the pool—is protagonist-driven and forecloses mercy with visible cost: "the world would feel what she'd felt." One gap: the decision to "focus its resonance toward the concentration" feels like crossing a threshold, but no on-page obstacle or trade-off dramatizes the moment of no return; she simply proceeds.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (decoding the chip/finding belonging) is clear, and the drone flight sequence provides one meaningful tightening as coordinates align with constellations. However, escalation is primarily discovery rather than genuine narrowing of options—no resistant obstacle or trade-off forces Mara to sacrifice something concrete. The decision to "send our own signal back" feels inevitable rather than chosen against competing goods, and the pilgrim applies no meaningful counter-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: whether to maintain the protective lie or reveal the full truth. Pressure escalates through Clara's persistence, the physical searching that surfaces the watch hand, and Clara's revelation that reframes the withholding. The tightening is earned by Maren's discovery realization ("She had quelled the wrong thing"), which narrows her options to confession with visible cost: exposing Clara to the ambivalence Iris wanted to prevent. Agency is strong—Maren's choice to confess forecloses her protective stance. The grandfather's redemption attempt adds moral complexity without diffusing focus.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: prevent war through negotiation, complicated by incomplete truths and government pressure. The Chen arrival and mutual revelation ("I didn't know...") creates one meaningful tightening that narrows options—they can no longer negotiate from sanitized narratives. The agreement to bring real histories next moon phase is protagonist-driven with visible cost: Mara must now extract uncomfortable truths from superiors, and both risk their positions. Pressure coheres through the Situational lens, though the escalation is more conceptual than visceral—no urgent deadline forces immediate consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (return to James vs. continued safety/paralysis) signals early and tightens through the voicemail, the attendant's current warning, and Marina's recognition that hesitation will push her back—both literally and metaphorically. The backlash of regrets creates pressure that clarifies rather than crushes, forcing the paddle north. Agency is decision with visible cost: years lost, terror alive, but gravitating homeward. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful turn (the voicemail answer, the launch commitment) suffices and lands with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—Maya seeking a reason to feel—is signaled early but remains abstract. The journey north and descent provide forward motion, but no meaningful reversal or tightening occurs; Marcus delivers the answer rather than Maya earning it through failed attempts or trade-offs. The "choice" at the end is framed as future action, not an on-page decision with visible cost. Pressure is present but does not escalate under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—reforging a bond beyond death—is signaled early and pressure accumulates through Mira's resistance to transformation, which she must overcome to reach her brother. The turning point when she "let[s] go" represents agency (renunciation of her fixed form) with visible cost: bodily dissolution into "moonlight and spice-smoke." Under the Accumulative lens, the conjuring sequence deepens intensity through layered scents that build toward metamorphosis. The cost is legible on the page—she forfeits her human solidity and accepts permanent liminality to bridge the veil. One clear tightening: resistance → surrender → transformation, which narrows her options and delivers the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (to find where lost time accumulates) is signaled early and drives the ascent and ritual. One meaningful deepening occurs when the gap between traced hands shimmers and Nadia sees lost time pooling—this reweights her understanding. However, the escalation relies more on revelation than on protagonist agency under pressure; the glade delivers the answer rather than Nadia wrestling a choice that narrows options with visible cost. The leave-one-card vow is a gesture, but its price (what she forfeits by leaving it) remains implicit rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (reopening the locked dimension to retrieve lost humanity) is signaled early and braided with internal pressure (confronting cowardice, completing shadow work). Escalation proceeds through Accumulative lens: touching one photograph → stitching grief across many → membrane rippling → dimension opening. Agency is clear: Ren's choice to stitch and push, not to fight, drives the turn. The cost is visible and felt: body becomes "nearly translucent," years of solitary witness, and the leap through carries undeniable risk. The jade pendant warming provides a secondary constraint that charges the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding transformation—is signaled early but remains abstract and never tested by a trade-off or forfeited option. The old woman's prophecy introduces external validation rather than opposition, and Maris's act of releasing the lightning bugs carries no visible price or consequence that narrows her later choices. Escalation is structural (volcano rumbling, islanders appearing) rather than driven by protagonist agency, and the ending crystallizes theme without dramatizing a decision that closes off a path.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—sparking revolution via coded communication during the blackout—is signaled early and the prisoner deadline adds urgency. However, the blackout is orchestrated rather than a complication, removing external resistance. Captain Voss passes without detecting her, deflating the tension. The piece shows setup and confident execution but no meaningful tightening or on-page cost that forecloses options; Mira's path from lock sentinel to revolutionary coordinator faces no consequential friction in this window.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: fulfill the sister's promise by decoding patterns. The visions tighten ("came faster now, more insistent"), and the rock sequence triggers a convergence ("futures… narrowing to single points"). Agency appears in the placement and the final realization. Deduction: the escalation is atmospheric (visions accelerate, dust flares) without a mid-story reversal that narrows her options or forces a trade-off. The final insight transforms her stance but does not show what she renounced to reach it; the cost remains conceptual rather than a forfeited path.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: understanding and preserving the cartography of scars against state censorship. The envelope's arrival tightens pressure by revealing mass graves and torture evidence, raising the ante. However, the tightening is delivered rather than earned by the poet's own tactical escalation, and the final choice (develop and descend) feels predetermined rather than a trade-off that narrows live options.

Coincidence (finding the film reel, the arbor's magical accessibility) enables rather than complicates. The piece gestures toward escalation (sunset deadline, the need to play before darkness) but the time pressure never manifests as a tactical constraint or forces a costly choice.

One meaningful deepening is present, but agency at closure is more completion than transformation.

    Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the Accumulative lens, from using spices to letting go, with cost legible in her blurred edges. The dominant stake (reforging the bond) tightens meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven by Nadia's agency in performing the ritual under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in the gap between traced hands and her repentance. The dominant stake of reconciling lost time tightens through a meaningful deepening that changes knowledge. Protagonist alteration is earned with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.5)
    Escalation is driven by Ren's agency in stitching grief, under an accumulative lens; cost is unmistakable in their gravitational lightness and translucent state, foreclosing other paths with visible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, escalation is driven by Maris's agency (releasing bugs) and the prophecy, deepening stakes. Cost is legible in her renunciation and the volcano's imminent eruption. One meaningful tightening reweights the dominant stake of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake of the silent revolution escalates through Mira's agency, with the blackout tightening options and forcing confirmations. Cost is legible in the 72-hour deadline to save prisoners, and escalation under the causal lens is driven by protagonist choices, narrowing paths meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.5)
    Stakes escalate under the causal lens through Kaela's agency, driven by her curse and promise, with cost legible in her near-losses and final realization. The dominant stake of understanding patterns tightens into harnessing transformation, foreclosing paths with visible cost. Pressure coheres and deepens meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.2)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, as opening the envelope deepens stakes with cost legible in her "trembled" response. Dominant stake of understanding scars tightens through her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven by Theodora's agency under the causal lens, moving from physical duel to philosophical debate. The stakes of intellectual freedom tighten meaningfully through the revelation of the sundial code, forcing Venn's stance crystallization. Cost is legible in the risk of the hidden overture and potential council rejection.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with stakes in personal and communal rebuilding tightening through actions like planting seeds and reciting poems. Cost is legible in Solomon's renunciation of identity shedding.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven by Marcus's agency under the causal lens, from entering the arbor to playing his composition, narrowing options toward authenticity.

The dominant stake of self-expression tightens meaningfully, with no coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes around cultural memory erosion escalate through Mira's dream discovery and agency-driven planting; cost is felt in the long wait and doubt, and the causal lens ensures pressure tightens meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake of emotional resolution escalates through Marisol's agency under the Accumulative lens, driven by her interactions with the lace and Takeshi.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.2)
    The conflict is primarily internal—Mara’s need for purified, compressed “essence” versus the greenhouse’s chaotic, generative decay—and the piece leans into accumulative pressure rather than overt confrontation. Escalation arrives via the evolving dust patterns and the impossible-seeming butterfly, which together force her to reconsider her stance. The central stake is her interpretive framework and inherited control impulse, and the renunciation at the end forecloses a prior path of sterile abstraction. The quietness of the conflict is intentional, though a slightly sharper on-page decision point could have heightened the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stakes—Elena’s need to understand the fire’s meaning and decide how to live after it—are clear early and coherently pursued. Pressure escalates internally as she shifts from numb seeking of silence to active pattern-hunting, culminating in the realization that the attack was impersonal and the choice to engage (testify, rebuild) rather than retreat. The external stakes around illegal logging remain backgrounded, so the investigation thread feels more like a vector for her internal turn than a fully pressured subplot. Still, there is a meaningful tightening when she detects the recurring ledger gaps and recalls the man, reweighting her options and self-understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—what Marina can make of a life without hearing and whether her invention truly “translates” emotion—is clear, but conflict is primarily internal and conceptual. The main tightening is the live test with Claire, which yields an emotionally validating composition and demonstrates the system’s power. However, the scene unfolds without real resistance, risk, or moral friction; everything works on the first try and no choice feels dangerous or truly narrowing. The final act of mapping her own face is resonant but not heavily pressured, keeping escalation in the solid but not exceptional range.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the drowned can find proper rest and whether Meridian will change her practice—is clear and escalates as the distress signals intensify and differentiate into “distinct voices.” Her decision to reconfigure the lens and devote the library to souls is an earned resolution that meaningfully changes the situation. Still, conflict is largely internal and conceptual with little on-page resistance or risk; nothing fights back, and there’s no moment where a real option is foreclosed with visible immediate cost. The pressure ramps in image-density rather than in sharp dilemmas, which keeps tension at a quiet but solid level.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stakes—whether this exile community coheres across generations or splinters under sanctions—are clear early and deepened by the young family’s decision to leave. Pressure escalates through Mira’s dwindling resources and the bell’s repeated failure before finally drawing everyone together. The decisive act is her public revelation and reframing of the runs as a communal project, which resolves the immediate threat of dispersal. However, the apparent reversal (“No one mentioned leaving”) arrives a bit too easily, with little visible cost or serious pushback from the young skeptics beyond a single question.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.4)
    The core conflict—can Marina midwife the release of the woman’s unused love and, through that, answer her own question—is coherent and escalates through the breathing exercise and the visual shift from “dark knot” to radiance. Stakes are purely internal/emotional and well signaled, but the process unfolds smoothly, with little resistance or complication once the breathing begins. Marina never faces a genuine risk of failure or ethical dilemma, so cost and narrowing of options feel relatively soft. The result is poignant but not deeply pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central stake—whether Miriam will pursue understanding of time despite the risk of becoming untethered—is established early and escalates as the fragment amplifies her condition and she moves into the maze’s center. Her agency in carrying the fragment into the most intense geometric fold is the key tightening, with the price being her own disintegration. Conflict is primarily internal and metaphysical, but it coheres and deepens rather than remaining static. The absence of a sharper, more embodied counter-pressure (e.g., a strong reason to resist) keeps this from an even higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—preserving and controlling access to the seed vault under regime change—is clear early and escalates effectively with the approaching soldiers and ticking sense of the wall coming down. Mira’s agency drives the main turns (decoding, opening the vault, choosing to reveal it and frame herself as “librarian”). Internal and external conflicts braid nicely in the final exchange, where she risks everything on the soldier’s choice. However, tension diffuses somewhat when the lead soldier’s sympathetic response arrives without much resistance, trimming the edge off the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—capturing the sound of trust breaking before her illness ends her ability to help—is well signaled and coherently threaded. Pressure deepens as she moves from abstract description of absences to using deeply personal losses as ingredients, narrowing her emotional options. However, the escalation is more thematic than decisional: she doesn’t confront a sharply dramatized choice between competing harms; she simply proceeds with her plan. The cost is felt, but a more acute moment of hesitation or risk-taking on the page would sharpen the stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake is Mira’s relationship to destiny and to her work—will she remain a hoarder of miraculous moments or accept a more vulnerable, giving role. Pressure escalates from coded warning (danger/new info/reinterpret) to the shock of her own portrait to the moral choice to release the portraits instead of keeping the power of the jar. The conflict remains largely internal and the price (renouncing the thief identity in favor of a more open, service-oriented stance) is implied rather than dramatized with concrete loss, keeping the stakes strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake is essentially existential/aesthetic: whether she can meaningfully create safe zones for inquiry in a ruined, thawing world. Pressure does not truly escalate; the icicle crash and the ominous “We were wrong about everything” hint at larger stakes but never concretely constrain her options or force a trade-off. Her only “choice” is to keep working and drawing, which reads as a continuation rather than a tested commitment. The conflict remains largely conceptual and could use at least one moment where her project is genuinely threatened or complicated on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stakes—exposure of the Mercado scandal and reclamation of Maya’s stolen self—are evident early and tighten once Carson arrives and reaches toward his jacket. Maya’s agency in pre-arranging the prosecutors (via Sophie’s instructions) and then weaponizing her “adaptation” in a bluff that halts him provides a clear escalation and earned resolution. Internal and external conflicts interweave nicely as she reframes fear in the middle of the standoff. The main limit is that the external danger remains a bit muted (we never see the weapon or a near-miss), making the climax feel controlled rather than harrowingly constrained.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—how to orient in a universe where the stars are dying—is clear, and the pressure of the last fading star gives a mild ticking clock. Escalation is mainly internal: from watching and doubt to experiential recognition of the hush as navigational and a commitment to continue the oracle’s work. There’s a meaningful tightening when the last star flickers and vanishes, forcing her to operate fully without external lights. Still, conflict remains largely unopposed and cerebral; risk and sacrifice are implied more than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether J-7 can move from paralyzing, origin-obsessed thought to a livable understanding of consciousness—remains coherent throughout. Escalation arrives with the new element (the ice violin) and the cumulative harmonies of past and present loops, which meaningfully tighten pressure by forcing J-7 to reinterpret its entire experience. However, the conflict stays almost entirely internal and relatively serene; there’s no moment where a concrete alternative (rejecting the Program, dropping the broom, refusing to play) is seriously considered and foreclosed on the page. The result is thematically rich but somewhat low-tension in dramatic terms.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Viktor’s wrongdoing remains hidden or is brought into the open—is clear and sharpened when Mira chooses to break her silence. Escalation from quiet suspicion to overheard confession to collective decision works, and Viktor’s resignation and restitution carry real cost. Still, pressure is somewhat gentle: there’s no significant pushback, moral bind, or credible alternative path argued on the page, so the conflict feels resolved more smoothly than the setup might allow. Internal and external stakes align but don’t fully grind against one another.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s professional fate and the validity of garden–gardener “recognition” versus algorithmic luck—is clear from early on. Pressure tightens as we learn she’s been deliberately tanking metrics and the Council arrives to formalize her failure, creating a solid situational crucible. However, opposition is relatively soft (the Council is quickly awed rather than antagonistic), and the emotional price of her gambit is underplayed. The escalation feels more cerebral than agonizing, which keeps the conflict strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Renna dares to expose a seemingly impossible discovery—is clear, but the on-page pressure remains fairly gentle. Her obligation to help with repairs delays her experiment, yet never feels like a true threat to her goal; similarly, Voss’s reaction carries almost no risk of rejection or institutional blowback. The escalation from private experiment to shared revelation works conceptually, but the emotional and practical costs are mostly implied rather than felt. As a result, the story reads more as an elegant unveiling than as a scene where options narrow under genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Celeste will answer the ghostly call and accept a radical reorientation of her musical life—is clear and does tighten as she moves from illicit trespass to decoding to literal immersion in the pit. Escalation is present in the sequence of discoveries and in the increasingly explicit sense of a presence guiding her. However, external stakes (condemned building, physical danger) and internal risk (what she might lose by “disrupting everything she thought she knew”) remain underplayed, keeping tension at a quiet simmer rather than a true boil. The resolution is nonetheless earned by her active choice to claim the journal and its implications.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central stake—whether Mira will continue to filter out marginal anomalies or fundamentally change her method—is clear early and tightens as the piece juxtaposes her prior “fault-tolerant” choice with Eva’s death. Pressure remains mostly internal but escalates credibly from recollection to a concrete procedural decision with nontrivial professional costs (“less certain…more false positives”). The Chen exchange provides a small external test of resolve rather than real opposition, keeping the conflict somewhat low-key. The emotional cost of living with more alarms could be sharpened slightly to heighten the sense of trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—uncovering and acting on the truth of the Torres incident—is coherent and present from early on. Pressure escalates mostly through information (the confession) rather than physical danger; the tightening is the moral/psychological weight of what she learns. The conflict remains relatively low-tempo and internal, with limited explicit cost on the page beyond her decision to involve authorities.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake is philosophical and spiritual—how to relate to impermanence—rather than situational, and pressure stays very gentle throughout. The introduction of the obsidian refuge is an opportunity for sharper escalation, but she meets it with calm acceptance rather than a tested choice that forecloses alternatives. The main “tightening” is the stone-induced vision, which deepens understanding rather than raising stakes in a way she must resist or embrace under duress. As a result, tension is present as curiosity and awe, not as genuine conflict with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether an emotionally disconnected daughter can genuinely reconnect with her aging mother—is clear and coherent. Pressure escalates as the eclipse deepens, the lullaby begins, and the keepsake is revealed, culminating in Diane’s emotional break and physical closeness. However, the conflict remains very gentle; Diane encounters little resistance beyond her own inertia, and there’s no real risk she’ll refuse the invitation once she shows up. The result is moving but low-intensity, with cost more reflective than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake is largely conceptual—preserving human resonance in a post-dream world—so tension is mostly atmospheric rather than confrontational. There is no real escalation beyond deepening explanation; the historian is not forced into a trade-off, and no option is visibly foreclosed. Her ongoing work is framed as purpose but not as a choice that costs her something on the page. As a result, conflict feels static even though the premise is rich.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake is Margaret’s understanding of what she’s been doing with her life, with an external accent of how intelligence networks have used her words. Escalation is mostly informational (ignorance → stunned knowledge → reframed acceptance) rather than conflictual; there’s no hard test that forces a painful trade-off. Her micro-choice at the end—whether to change how she writes fortunes—registers, but the “maybe yes, maybe no” undercuts a sense of real foreclosure. The tension is engaging but quiet, keeping stakes more reflective than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are clear early: prevent the possession from completing in a volatile, multidimensional space. Conflict escalates through Micah’s layering of silence, philosophical interrogation, and the palette’s symbolic strike, culminating in the entity’s silent scream and expulsion. The internal and external conflicts braid neatly—logic and ontology become weapons in a spiritual battle. Still, Micah never seems close to losing or forced into a costly trade-off, so the pressure tightens smartly but not brutally.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant pressure—can she extract true-seeming fortunes before dawn and exhaustion close the window—is clear and coherently maintained. There is a discernible tightening as exhaustion “gathers at the edges,” she races the sun, and finally must stop when the mirrored horizon dissolves. However, the conflict remains almost entirely internal and procedural, without a major reversal or wrenching trade-off, so the felt cost of stopping is relatively gentle. It works for a quiet lyric but doesn’t fully exploit the potential for sharper pressure or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Maya can find or become a coherent self via the tablet’s timelines—is clear early and sharpened by the tablet’s merciless procedurality. Pressure escalates internally as she recognizes the cost of endless searching (her darkening hope) and confronts the truth that there is no “center” to conquer. Her final choice to stop using the tablet as a tool of conquest and accept inhabitation is a genuine renunciation that forecloses a long-pursued path. The conflict remains almost entirely interior and contemplative, so while thematically rich, it lacks a harder, scene-level turn or jeopardy that might heighten tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—overcoming deep emotional numbness—is clear and consistent, and the shift from Mira alone to a community of the exhausted gives the conflict some breadth. However, the path from problem to solution is relatively unopposed; once the journals are found, each step (preparing the cavern, playing the records, healing students) proceeds without a genuine risk of failure or sacrifice on the page. The technique works the first time, and there is no moment where Mira must choose between competing goods or endure a visible loss. As a result, tension accumulates more as mood than as sharpened, escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—how her data will be used to justify forced evacuation—is clear and thematically rich, and the pigeon’s warning constitutes a solid pressure uptick. However, the on-page conflict remains mostly anticipatory and internal; the follower and “external authorities” never actively press her into a corner within the scene. Her solution (dual record sets, distribution through the network) is thoughtful but faces no direct on-page resistance beyond the abstract risk of surveillance. The tension is persistent and coherent, but it never tightens to a point where she must sacrifice something tangible in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether understanding the mechanics of his grief via scent will change his relationship to that grief—is clear from early on. Escalation is quiet but real: his choice to subject himself to the reconstructed bloom, the tense three-day wait, and the climactic simultaneous uncorking and blossoming. The cost is emotional rather than situational: he confirms that understanding does not lessen pain, only reframes it, and he must live with that. It’s strong for a meditative piece, though the pressure never sharpens into a moment where any external option truly closes.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—how to relate to a reality where every choice rewrites time’s texture—is clear and thematically rich, and Elena’s fear of “no bottom” provides a credible source of pressure. There is a mild escalation when Marcus asks to see the deepest layer, prompting the vision of infinite branching choices and forcing Elena’s question, “But how do we choose…?” Yet the conflict remains almost entirely cerebral, without a sharp narrowing of options or a tangible price for either character’s stance. The result is thoughtful but relatively low-tension, more philosophical exploration than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—loosening the chronic hush by freeing trapped sounds—is clear, but pressure remains very soft and largely unopposed. Escalation is mostly conceptual (from noticing hums to understanding them as “trapped” and then playing), without a moment where a real option is foreclosed or a meaningful price is paid. Her agency drives the turn, but nothing substantial threatens failure or complicates her attempt once the premise is understood. As a result, the piece reads more as a lyrical ritual than a conflict-driven scene, which limits tension.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—whether Maren will go through with subsuming Thomas’s grief and what that means ethically—is clear and thematically charged. Pressure escalates modestly as she witnesses his pain, initiates the procedure, and feels the frequencies shift, culminating in her private acknowledgment of the cost. However, there’s little on-page resistance or live alternative path; the outcome is never in doubt, which flattens suspense and limits the felt price of her choice. The ethical tension is thoughtful but operates more as steady hum than tightening vise.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes are primarily internal and ethical: will Marlena remain a broker who overlooks invisible workers, or reorient herself toward recognition and compassion. That conflict is coherent but gentle; there’s no real opposing force or meaningful risk beyond mild shame. Escalation is conversational rather than dramatic, with Theo’s story about his father deepening the stakes and nudging her into her decision. Because the turning point comes quickly and with little resistance, the pressure never quite tightens to a high-stakes feel.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—will she succeed in becoming part of this community—is clear and consistently present. Pressure escalates gently through her public offer, the communal search, and the discovered tag, with the key tightening being her commitment to create an artwork that binds her identity to theirs. Still, conflict remains largely low-friction and cooperative; there’s little active resistance, moral tension, or risk of genuine rejection on the page. As a result the emotional cost is real but understated, keeping the piece from a higher conflict band despite its coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—seizing a limited temporal window to free and understand echoes—is clearly established, and pressure does increase as she enters the Throat and begins unlocking cages. The meaningful tightening is the move from observation to active intervention, with the implicit risk of spending her illicitly borrowed time and the giant’s impending wake. However, there is little friction or reversal once she commits; locks crumble on the first tactic, no cages resist, and the giant never quite materializes as active threat. As a result, tension is more conceptual and atmospheric than viscerally escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—can he find a comprehensible law for his wife’s ambiguous loss—is clear from early on and tightens as he commits to the ritual and waits. Escalation is mostly internal and conceptual, but there is a real beat of pressure in the long, silent waiting followed by the impossible growth and the interpretive challenge it poses. His “resolution” is an internal stance shift: abandoning the hope of recovering her in favor of honoring transformation, which forecloses one path in order to accept another. The conflict remains somewhat cerebral; a slightly sharper sense of what he risks emotionally by attempting this (self-delusion vs. shattering grief) could sharpen the stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central conflict—remain safely invisible or risk exposure to matter to someone—is clear and thematically coherent, with the outage providing a natural moment of heightened possibility. Pressure builds through preparation (uncovering caches, arranging supplies, writing the note) toward the reveal. However, the danger dimension (security, eviction, rejection) is underdeveloped, so the stakes feel more emotionally than practically fraught. The final turn is satisfying but gentle rather than sharply pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (Marcus’s identity and vocation as controller vs. partner to living systems) is clear, and the storm provides a meaningful pressure spike that forces reconsideration of his methods. Releasing the linden from its wires and then loosening control across the nursery are credible turns, with some external pressure via customer reaction. Still, the conflict remains relatively low-friction—there’s little real jeopardy to his livelihood or relationships on the page—so escalation and cost feel more contemplative than sharply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—the need to wrest meaning and psychic survivability from a dead world—comes through clearly, with secondary pressure around her inability to sleep. Escalation is subtle: the discovery of the others and the brooch cache is a genuine deepening that changes options, and the ritual exchange narrows her stance toward belief in pattern. The cost is mainly emotional (surrendering solitary witness, accepting a shared ritual) rather than visibly jeopardizing body or livelihood. This quieter, almost purely interior tension is well-executed but lacks one more concrete pressure point that might sharpen the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes—the integrity/safety of Vera’s sanctuary and her grip on foreknowledge—are clear, and the pressure does escalate when the shadows thicken and begin feeding on the awakened magic. The pivotal turn is Vera’s realization that the forces are inhabiting rather than destroying the cave, leading to a shift from fear to captivated acceptance. That said, the conflict remains mostly conceptual; Vera is never truly forced into a hard trade-off or concrete action with visible loss, so the escalation feels measured rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the community can recover a functional, adaptive relationship with the sea—is clear and culminates in Maris’s risky first voyage and the fishermen’s decision to follow. Pressure escalates conceptually (from fear of a “forgetting” sea to the realization that human memory and practice are the problem), but on-page opposition is relatively soft: the fishermen’s skepticism never becomes active resistance, and Maris encounters little serious thwarting. Her weeks of work are diligent but frictionless, muting a sense of real jeopardy or sacrifice. The conflict is thoughtful and coherent, yet emotionally low-temperature for an “immediate publishability” bar.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will follow the arrows into the unknown and what truth she will take—remains coherent throughout. Escalation is present but gentle: physical risk in the abandoned district and uncanny fog gives way to the ethical/emotional risk of choosing a single truth. Her decision to take a small, personal truth over a grand revelation is a meaningful narrowing of options, but the story doesn’t fully press the conflict between tempting “world-shattering” secrets and the personal cost of responsibility. The stakes are conceptually rich yet emotionally under-cranked for a truly high-tension arc.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is Elena’s relationship to her own grief and the risk of re-entering a world of connection versus staying safely numb; this is clearly implied but rarely sharpened into explicit dilemma. Pressure escalates through her contact with the tile and visions of Amit/patients, culminating in her decision to continue and deepen his work. Still, most of the conflict remains conceptual and inward, with limited sense of what she might lose by committing to this role. The result is textured but relatively low-tension for a piece aiming at elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—risking her stable, if stagnant, immortality to pursue an answer about death—is clear, and pressure does tighten as the mutiny proves temporary and the fragment burns hotter. However, opposition is mostly situational and conceptual; nothing actively resists her, and we never feel a concrete price beyond abstract risk. The escalation from observation to stepping through is credible but relatively smooth, with limited on-page friction or sacrificed alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stakes—Pavel’s asylum chances and Mira’s commitment to honesty—are flagged early and remain coherent throughout. Pressure deepens from abstract (“I can’t help you forge”) to concrete when the card is found and Pavel asks, “Is this legal?”, forcing Mira into a morally consequential decision. The cost is subtle but real: she chooses an interpretation of her role that edges closer to her father’s old territory while insisting on truthfulness. Escalation is compelling but restrained; the night’s wait is elided rather than used to introduce additional turns or complications.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is conceptual and inward: whether and how she can give “weight” to events that never happened, using her discipline amid a world that has given up on speech. Pressure accrues via density rather than confrontation, with the lamp’s changing hum and the garden’s transformations deepening the invented history, but there’s little sense that failure or deviation would cost her something concrete. The small escalation—choosing to embody a specific invented child and then physically release that history into the labyrinth—does narrow her stance toward invention-as-archive. Still, the lack of resistance or meaningful risk leaves the conflict more contemplative than tense.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—uncovering a deliberately erased corporate poisoning and, by extension, restoring erased histories—is clear and thematically charged. However, conflict remains largely off-stage and historical: dock workers and ex-employees reminisce, but no one resists her, and no concrete obstacle tests her commitment in the present scene. The pressure does deepen as she descends to older workers and more traumatic memories, yet there’s no real escalation in cost or narrowing of options. The ending is a reaffirmation of an ongoing mission rather than a turn forced by rising stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether any myth is meaningfully “true” and what that would do to Marina’s worldview—is clear but remains mostly internal and contemplative. There is one main tightening when the cello unexpectedly hums back, converting a vague question into an active experiment, but little further escalation or resistance after that. Her agency is present (she chooses to retell, to pluck, to mark the shell), yet these choices don’t foreclose many options or exact an immediate price beyond awe. The result is a beautiful but relatively low-pressure arc.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clearly articulated early (loss of cultural home vs. physical sinking of Flotilla vs. exploitative privatization), and pressure escalates with the graffiti warning and Marcus’s “accelerate the timeline” revelation. The mis-painted yellow streak is a good localized spike of danger and cost, even though it’s quickly corrected. The true turn is Mira’s strategic reframe from sabotage to cooperative reorganization, which tightens the conflict into an ethical trade-off rather than simple resistance. The council vote scene lands as a meaningful narrowing of options, but the outcome feels somewhat smoothed over; sharper resistance or visible sacrifice would heighten the sense of price.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—preserving the last untouched crater’s image before corporate exploitation—appears early and stays coherent through to the end. The ticking clock (three hours until bulldozers, dawn approaching) gives situational pressure, and her choice to plant the grain and walk away from the coming destruction is a meaningful renunciation. However, conflict is mostly one-sided; the consortium remains offstage, and her plan meets no substantive obstacle, so escalation is more atmospheric than confrontational. The cost is emotionally legible but structurally gentle, with no real narrowing of options beyond the initial setup.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Mara’s commitment to repairing the drone well—is clear but small and largely unopposed; nothing meaningful threatens failure beyond routine difficulty. The “tightening” is limited to diagnosing then fixing the motor stutter, which she addresses with untroubled mastery and no real risk or trade-off. Internal and external pressures remain low, so tension never truly escalates even in a quiet-mode frame. As a result, the ending feels serene rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—Mara’s need to locate the true origin/terminus of the rivers—is clear and escalates through information: inscrutable symbols, impossible coordinates, then the unsettling realization that all rivers return here. The main tightening comes when her predecessor’s note reframes the entire project, and she moves from map work to planning a physically risky expedition onto the ice. Pressure remains mostly intellectual and atmospheric rather than visceral; we’re told she’ll go onto the ice, but the danger and trade-offs are more implied than sharply felt. As a result, tension is compelling but not gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Millhaven collapses into a ghost town—is clearly signaled and resolved. Pressure accumulates via the ongoing exodus and the three-day ritual, with a satisfying cadence shift when the bells finally ring true. That said, conflict is almost entirely external and one-sided: no one opposes her, and she never doubts or adapts, so escalation is more a matter of duration than sharpened dilemmas or narrowed options. The low-friction success slightly flattens the sense of risk despite the high-stakes premise.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether Marina can save Thalia before the preservation field fails—is clearly signaled and coherently escalated by the discovery that “the preservation field would fail in hours.” The primary tightening is Marina’s decision not to surface for help but to act now with incomplete knowledge, which appropriately narrows her options. However, once she commits, the process unfolds without reversal or visible cost beyond risk, and the success feels somewhat assured by tone. The lack of a tangible loss or complication during the procedure keeps the pressure a notch below truly gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stakes—whether Marcus will remain trapped in inherited disbelief or claim his own truthful voice—are clearly signaled and thematically rich. Pressure coheres around the impending discovery of bodies and questions from the warden, and there is one meaningful tightening as the tide retreats and Marcus anticipates that reckoning. However, all key confrontations are deferred to “tomorrow or the day after,” so escalation remains largely anticipatory rather than dramatized. The internal resolve is credible but under-tested, keeping tension more contemplative than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara’s isolating, sunless world is a curse or a charged gift—is clear, and the bride’s explanation meaningfully reframes it. However, escalation is primarily informational: we get more lore and a clearer sense of purpose, but Elara is never forced into a hard trade-off or line-crossing choice. The night as “gift” vs possible trap is not seriously contested by Elara, limiting tension. The story resolves into purpose without any option being truly foreclosed beyond her previous ignorance.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether precedent will keep the labyrinth dead or allow it to live as ritual—is clear, and there is some escalation from private sleepwalking to public defiance to council appearance. However, conflict stays soft: Mara faces little on-page resistance, and the council’s willingness to be persuaded blunts the sense of risk. We do not see a concrete consequence she might suffer if she loses, nor a substantive sacrifice she makes to win. As a result, the story feels meaningful but low-tension rather than sharply pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Mira’s desire to complete the rites and reclaim a sense of rooted faith—is clear, but external opposition is mild and the escalation is mostly conceptual. Her wandering and the sundial discovery deepen meaning rather than sharply narrowing options, and the priest’s resistance has already softened by the time he appears. The main tightening comes from revaluing the orchard/catacomb complex and choosing to reinstall the sundial above ground, but this doesn’t feel like a hard trade-off. Conflict is present and coherent, yet it never fully bites; the piece reads more as meditation than test.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—protecting analog, off-grid identities for teens risking erasure from the network—is clear and compelling. The twenty-minute window and the discovery of a cluster of requests do provide a subtle tightening, reframing her work as part of a larger, riskier wave rather than isolated acts. However, there’s no genuine reversal or hard trade-off on the page; Maya’s tactics don’t have to adapt to new pressure and no live option is dramatically foreclosed in-scene. The story feels like a beautifully rendered slice of an ongoing struggle rather than a beat where conflict meaningfully escalates.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will piece together and act on the nascent coup—is legible and escalates as disparate “synchronization” remarks and map fragments cohere into a clear threat. The main tightening comes with her realization and the decision to warn the guard captain, which forecloses the safer path of continued pretense. However, conflict remains primarily cognitive and anticipatory; no counterforce actively pressures her on the page, and the price of action is more inferred than felt. The result is tense and satisfying but not maximally sharp in on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether Isla will stay imprisoned in regret or risk actual reconciliation—is clear early and deepens in the relived kitchen scene. Pressure escalates when she must confront the exact instant before her hurtful words, with the revelation of her sister’s vulnerability functioning as the key tightening. However, the magic largely removes friction from the external conflict: once the vision and sister’s letters appear, Isla’s choice to reconcile feels almost inevitable, with limited sense of risk or alternative. The emotional cost is real but lightly dramatized in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the girl (and by extension Maya) can resist the erasure of a displaced life—emerges clearly once “khlong” triggers shared history. Pressure deepens as the cast is revealed to be a fragmented map of memory and the girl admits, “But I keep forgetting the words,” forcing a response. Maya’s agency in offering the coral and proposing collaborative translation provides a credible, if gentle, escalation and resolution. The conflict remains largely internal and cooperative, with little on-page resistance, so the sense of cost is more implied than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.7)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can recover an authentic sense of joy rather than performative artistry—is clear and binds the beats. Pressure accumulates via her decision not to overwrite the past, the risk of sharing something vulnerable with the network, and the time/battery limit. However, conflict remains largely internal and gentle; there’s little that truly resists her or forces a painful trade-off beyond fatigue and ephemerality. The ending feels earned but relatively low-cost, which keeps the escalation solid rather than searing.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—Marta’s relationship to reality, identity, and certainty—is signaled and then deepened through the repeated “awakenings” and the increasingly awake nickel-face. Pressure escalates as each reset is more vivid and disorienting, forcing her to decide whether to cling to provenance and documentation or accept infinite layered selves. The key turn is her embracing the invitation (“Wake up again”) rather than resisting or trying to restore a stable baseline. The cost—surrendering the comfort of being the “original” Marta and of fixed reality—is conceptually present but could be rendered with slightly sharper, more visceral unease to reach a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—mental autonomy vs. state MindTax—appears early and remains clear, and there is a meaningful deepening as abstract complaint turns into an organized, risky method of dissent. However, most conflict is conceptual or summarized rather than embodied in live scenes; we are told about audits, wipes, and patrols more than we see any direct clash or near-failure. The main tightening is the decision to use community gardens under auditor suspicion, which does narrow options, but the story never forces Malachi into a concrete trade-off moment on the page. As a result, tension is present and intriguing but not maximally taut.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the poet continues in isolated, sleepless creation or risks shared, embodied creation—is clear and thematically strong, but the on-page pressure is gentle rather than acute. Escalation comes mainly from Mira’s proposal to grow cherry blossoms and distribute petals, which deepens the existing mission beyond words and forces the poet to reconsider what she “needs.” The descent to the soil chamber and the act of planting together constitute the main tightening, culminating in her internal decision that this collaboration is a form of rest. However, the conflict never quite sharpens into a felt dilemma; resistance is implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving the integrity of the extinct feelings/orchids—is clearly established early and tied to a concrete problem (the broken chime). There is one meaningful deepening when the song from the archives proves a method to recalibrate and the crack reveals a new emotion, which conceptually raises the stakes. However, Miren never truly risks failure: there’s no serious setback, alternative path, or visible price for success beyond labor and melancholy, so tension remains low. The resolution feels more like an elegant solution than a pressured trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether they can repair trust enough to share and continue the Verdanti method—is clear and present early, and the ticking clock of his impending appointment/her departure adds situational pressure. Their intellectual collaboration re-igniting under emotional strain is a solid internal/external weave. However, once Maren starts to explain, the conflict de-escalates steadily without a real test or reversal; Kael’s forgiveness feels almost inevitable rather than wrestled for, softening the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—balancing flood safety and downstream survival—is clear and inherently tense, and Elena’s discovery of the bypass offers a genuine structural solution. However, the on-page pressure remains mostly intellectual and procedural; there is little escalation in opposition (political, environmental, or mechanical) and no serious risk that her attempt will fail. The three days of repair pass without complication, softening the sense of cost or narrowing options. The final reconciliation scene lands, but without a truly hard trade-off or tested commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.0)
    The core stake—whether Elena will continue to hide behind a fabricated history or risk telling the truth—is clear and scales appropriately for a quiet, interior story. Pressure tightens when Carmen’s package appears and Elena plays the recording, forcing her to confront the cost of her lie; the subsequent confession to Yuki forecloses the “safe” path of erasure. The emotional cost (reopening guilt over Marcus and the fire) is palpable, though the external stakes (what happens to her relationships or work) remain implicit rather than dramatized. The conflict remains mostly internal, with minimal resistance, which keeps it from feeling fully high-stakes even as it’s satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—can Maya reframe the sacredness of thresholds and her parents’ departure in a way that lets her move forward—remains coherent and present. Pressure escalates as she shifts from handling objects to decoding them, culminating in the mother’s final-page admission that “the maze has no solution, only surrender.” The ultimate choice to step through a new threshold instead of remaining on the terrace constitutes a credible Earned Stasis with conceptual cost. Still, the conflict is predominantly reflective; there’s little on-page resistance or risk beyond internal reinterpretation, keeping tension at a quiet simmer rather than a boil.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake is largely internal—whether Mara can reinterpret her role from dubious mystic to someone whose way of seeing belongs in this place—and this is signaled early. Escalation comes via the discovery that migration paths match stellar/ley patterns and then the unexpected appearance of the “extinct” plankton, but these are wonder beats more than genuine tests. No significant option is foreclosed, and there’s little real price for her new stance beyond implied vulnerability. The conflict remains gentle and contemplative rather than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding and preserving disappearing paths “before memory fades”—is clear but plays out almost entirely as intellectual/emotional inquiry rather than conflict under pressure. The main turn is informational: learning that paths die of neglect rather than erasure, followed by a quiet recommitment to witnessing and repetition. There is little on-page opposition, risk, or concrete cost to her choices; urgency is stated rather than dramatized. This keeps tension gentle and thematic rather than sharply escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is essentially whether Marina can engineer meaningful, serendipitous connections within a limited window, and the piece does show a series of successful, increasingly intricate manipulations. Yet escalation is modest: each “miracle” is of similar scale, with no single turn that meaningfully narrows her options or forces a trade-off. Because her tactics work smoothly and no real resistance or cost appears, tension stays gentle and contemplative rather than truly tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—preserving outlawed memory against the Empress’s regime—is clear, and there is one meaningful deepening when the speck appears and Kael realizes the garden’s true function. Her agency in choosing to inscribe her own flesh does narrow her path and implies future danger. However, there is little on-page resistance or escalation beyond the inward, contemplative progression; no present antagonistic force or trade-off pushes harder on her choice. As a result, the tension feels more meditative than pressured, which limits the sense of stakes tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—saving or revaluing the atrium—is clear, but the on-page conflict remains almost entirely internal and preparatory, with the developer’s opposition offstage. The main “escalation” is iterative (more stones, more documentation) rather than a narrowing of options or a costly trade-off, and nothing seriously threatens his project in the moment. The time limit (demolition next week) is mentioned but doesn’t tighten tactics inside the scene. As a result, tension is gentle and contemplative rather than truly pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus will perpetuate or reject his father’s pattern of sacrificial “bargains”—is clear early and tightens as he decodes the entries and reinterprets his father’s death. The main escalation is conceptual: his understanding deepens from vague grief to a hard, specific recognition of burnout and chosen sacrifice. The final act (placing the box, inscribing his own entry, walking back down) crystallizes his stance with a visible cost: he accepts ongoing risk and pain, but without illusion. The conflict remains mostly internal and contemplative, so tension is more steady hum than sharp climb, which keeps it below elite-tier pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—can she justify continuing her work and salvage a meaningful theory of hope—is legible and present early. Pressure escalates via the gauge readings and multiplying timeline views, culminating in a convergence depth of ~3000 “feet” and the synchronized Mayas, which deepens the internal conflict. However, the conflict remains largely conceptual and unopposed; there is no concrete negative consequence if she fails in this experiment beyond abstract despair, so the tightening doesn’t fully feel like a trade-off or loss. The result is intellectually engaging but not sharply fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the building’s “dreams” and Eleanor’s legacy can be understood and honored—is clear but largely internal and conceptual. Pressure does accumulate via the anomaly and the building’s responsive echoes, yet there is no real threat, dilemma, or sacrifice that narrows Mara’s options in a painful way. Her decision to document and archive is consistent but not heavily tested by opposition. The result is thoughtful but relatively low-intensity conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Aina can glimpse meaningful possibilities for Maya and herself without being destroyed by grief—is clear and signaled early. Pressure escalates through the time-bound ritual (the “hush before bells”), the progressive complexity of the coded songs, and the sharpening of visions from a single laughing teenager to the studio and child in the final mirror. Her cost is the exhaustion and emotional exposure required to keep singing under a collapsing window, and the acceptance of possibility instead of certainty. The conflict remains mostly internal and lyrical, but within that mode it tightens once in a satisfying way.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether these enemies can take a first real step toward ending a “forever war” tonight—is clearly signaled and bound to the celestial deadline. Conflict between personal grief and political necessity is present in Threll’s resistance and Kordas’s skepticism, and it tightens into the choice to kneel and plant together. Escalation is more ethical than dramatic; the main turn is their assent to the ritual, which carries emotional risk but encounters limited active resistance. The danger and potential backlash beyond this terrace remain abstract, softening perceived cost.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the enormous ecological and human cost yields a salvaged fragment of beauty—is clear and morally charged. There is some escalation via the approaching thunder and imminent rain, which adds time pressure to getting the call released before the coordinates are washed away. However, conflict is primarily conceptual and retrospective; once he reaches the flat with device and egg, resistance is minimal and his choice is not seriously in doubt. The stakes land, but the on-page pressure never quite tightens into a hard, contested decision.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Celestine’s autonomy against her assigned role—is clear, and her decision to pursue the sanctuary rather than continue safe, sanctioned performances is a meaningful choice. However, opposition and escalation are gentle: the “threads resisted,” but resistance never feels threatening or capable of denying her, and no external pressures intrude. The piece reads more as contemplative initiation than pressured conflict, with minimal sense that a real option might close or a heavy price be paid on the page. As a result, tension is present but muted.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus’s storytelling practice is ethically valid—is clear, and the drunk’s interruption is a meaningful tightening that tests his method under live fire. The escalation is primarily internal and conceptual rather than confrontational: the man’s “half-lit epiphany” and the murmuring audience force Marcus to re-evaluate his premise, but he isn’t made to choose between sharply opposed courses of action on the page. The cost is subtle (accepting uncertainty over the reassurance of clear morals and prestige), which fits the piece but keeps pressure relatively low-key. Still, the situational pressure coheres and grows enough for the final shift to feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—witnessing and honoring the last migration—is clear but remains largely internal and conceptual, with minimal on-page pressure. The piece deepens rather than escalates; Sera’s commitment is never genuinely in doubt, and there’s no meaningful narrowing of options or forced trade-off. The butterflies’ arrival and departure provide a natural cadence shift, but they don’t test her goal. As a result, tension feels low even for a lyric piece, which will limit immediate publishability for some markets.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving the founders’ names and thus transforming her guilt—is clear and consistently pursued, and her decision to devote years to this project is a credible form of Earned Stasis. However, on-page opposition is minimal; the rope’s decay and time pressure are stated rather than dramatized as active threats. The “miraculous” light alignment is a satisfying intensification but arrives without much prior friction testing her resolve. As a result, tension feels meditative rather than pressing, strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether she can uncover why paths choose their walkers and what that implies for agency—is clearly signaled and paid off through the dream sequence. The storm offers situational pressure and a mild ticking clock, but it never escalates to a real threat, so tension is more conceptual than visceral. The main tightening is her choice to lie down under the leaking storm and surrender to the directive’s method, which leads to a deepened understanding rather than a hard reversal. Conflict is thoughtful and coherent but remains relatively low-intensity, with cost felt more philosophically than dramatically.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving and understanding a fragile, subversive knowledge under unstable regimes—is clear, and the discovery that the square maps a seventeen-light-year perspective is a genuine deepening. However, conflict is largely internal and contemplative, with no active opposition or reversal; tension resides in implication rather than acute on-page pressure. Her key “choice” (to carry the tile forward and persist in her work) is meaningful but only lightly contested. As a result, escalation feels more like steady illumination than tightening conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus will relinquish his resentment-based identity—is clear from the outset and steadily tightened as Elena reframes his memories and the sanctuary intensifies its responses. Internal and external conflict are braided: his bodily reactions and the sanctuary’s visions push against his stated certainty. The decisive escalation is when he’s confronted with the visual of his younger self loving his sister, which cracks his defenses and leads to the emotional climax. Still, most of the pressure comes from gentle persuasion rather than a hard trade-off, so the stakes feel quietly high rather than sharply agonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preventing the crystallized dream from tearing the district apart—is clearly signaled and drives Eliane’s plan. There is one meaningful tightening when she begins synchronizing breath with the dream and the boundary between realities erodes. However, the conflict remains relatively smooth; the dream’s cooperation and the lack of serious setbacks or competing demands make the resolution feel more like a skilled procedure than a truly pressured confrontation. The cost remains mostly conceptual, not viscerally dramatized in on-page risk or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.4)
    The core stake—whether Mara can repair her bond with Lisel and pass on her craft outside Guild control—is established and sustained. Tension tightens as Mara physically closes the distance and as Lisel weaponizes her hurt, particularly around the fractured quartz eye. The decisive turn is Mara’s candid admission of failure plus the concrete offer to fix the eye and exchange knowledge. However, there’s limited sense of what either must forfeit right now to make this choice; the reconciliation feels more gentle than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is Mara’s relationship to forbidden knowledge and her own place in a paradoxical inheritance system, with pressure escalating from abstract bewilderment to testing a dangerous, restricted artifact. Her action with the tree meaningfully changes her understanding and forecloses a simpler, linear self-concept. However, the conflict stays largely intellectual; there is no palpable threat of madness, harm, or institutional consequence to sharpen the choice. As a result, tension is steady and interesting but never quite razor-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—rescuing the temporally trapped students—is clear and time-bounded to the rift’s existence, with a quieter thematic stake in the traveler’s curse of forgetting. Pressure escalates somewhat when we learn the students are caught in overlaps from all seventeen visits, but once the mechanism (renegotiating forgetting via the diary) appears, the path to success feels linear and unthreatened. There’s little on-page sacrifice or narrowing of viable options; the conflict is conceptually elegant but dramatically soft. The ending’s emotional “cost” rests largely on the traveler’s ongoing loop, which is observed rather than freshly tested here.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering the twins’ gift of understanding/selfhood before memory erases it—is clear and tight. Pressure escalates via the instability of her recollections and her increasingly deliberate attempts to “weave narrative threads” as a tactic, culminating in the high-stakes choice to step into a place where selfhood dissolves. The cost is conceptual rather than physical, but legible: she forecloses the path of ever returning to a stable, singular self in order to gain release. The conflict remains mostly internal and symbolic, which works, though a marginally sharper sense of immediate risk could raise intensity further.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—resolving the university’s fractured reality—is clear, and the main tightening comes when Marin realizes Chen’s “failure” is actually an encoded method she can execute. Yet the process of rebraiding unfolds almost frictionlessly; there’s no on-page reversal, setback, or credible risk of catastrophic mis-weave. Tension is therefore mostly conceptual rather than visceral, with stakes understood but not strongly felt in the body. This is solid, but it lacks the sharper pressure and visible price that would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.8)
    The core stake—restoring or locating a sustainable quiet within the caves’ new cacophony—is clear from early on, and the attempt to conjure the bloom of hush is a credible tightening beat. Internal and external stakes are aligned (her identity and maps are at risk of obsolescence, the caves’ nature of being overwritten). However, escalation is relatively soft: there’s no concrete failure mode, pushback, or price beyond exhaustion, so the climax reads more as a successful procedure than a contested struggle. The energy beings remain an abstract pressure rather than an actively escalating one.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mera can and will complete the pattern and rekindle the beacon—is clear, but pressure escalates more in concept than in concrete jeopardy. The major tightening is the discovery and fitting of the shard of hush, which closes the practical gap and turns the story toward imminent action. However, she faces little opposition beyond time and solitude, and no real risk or trade-off is tested on the page. As a result, tension remains relatively low-grade despite the beauty of the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—capturing unstable, collectively negotiated memory before conditions shift—is clear and interestingly conceptual. Pressure escalates modestly via the storm’s peak, which sharpens shadows and pushes Maris to work faster, embedding a temporal squeeze into her task. However, there is limited concrete cost or foreclosed option beyond generalized impermanence; no specific risk (a lost memory, a failed inscription) crystallizes as a sharp loss. The conflict remains primarily philosophical and atmospheric rather than dramatically contested.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—can Mara jolt a hopeless community into remembering hope—is clear, but the on-page pressure is gentle and largely unresisted. The commander’s skepticism (“Pretty words”) is a flicker rather than a genuine obstacle, and there’s no real risk, sacrifice, or alternative path contested in scene. Escalation is mostly a steady intensification of spectacle and response rather than a tightening of options; the outcome never feels truly in doubt. As a result, the piece reads more like a graceful ritual than a conflict with teeth.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.3)
    The central conflict—Mei’s resistance to Lin’s departure versus Lin’s need to move on—is coherent and escalates from awkward silence to a thematically pointed negotiation of what “leaving” means. The introduction of the jade cicada meaningfully tightens the emotional stakes and forces Mei to take a stance. The resolution is earned as an internal choice (to reinterpret and to let go while staying present), with a felt cost. Still, the pressure remains purely interior and could be sharpened with one more moment where a worse relational outcome feels genuinely possible.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—experientially finding and capturing the gilded hush, tied to her need for a non-claustrophobic way of being—is clear but faces little resistance. Escalation is mostly conceptual (silences’ qualities → the special hush → the flower opening) rather than pressured; she never seriously risks loss, failure, or harm. The flower’s emergence during inversion is a pleasing tightening, but not truly a hard choice or trade-off. The ending crystallizes a stance but the cost of that stance remains mostly conceptual, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—whether the young man can move from acute grief into a bearable quiet—is clear and thematically potent. Pressure deepens as his arrival tension meets the terrace’s engineered silence, with decibel readings and the train whistle marking a soft progression. Mara’s main “choice” is her calibrated intervention (saying very little, choosing when and how to speak), which feels right but low-intensity. The story never presents a moment where options truly narrow or a path is clearly foreclosed, so conflict remains gentle rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—reaching the unclaimed throne via the hidden stairway—is clear from the outset, and the reveal of the mural/stairway is a genuine tightening of options. However, opposition is light: the paint-peeling puzzle yields quickly, the staircase offers no real danger, and the sunrise deadline never bites, so escalation feels smooth rather than pressured. The internal conflict at the end (to claim or not) is resolved in a single, untroubled gesture. The piece works, but at an elite level one would expect sharper costs or reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central pressure—Maya’s desire to protect her emptiness versus the ethical/empathic pull to help Sienna—remains coherent and escalates modestly as Sienna steps over the boundary and offers up her phone. Stakes are primarily internal and symbolic, but the choice to begin burning Sienna’s life artifacts is a real foreclosing of options. The conflict resolves a bit smoothly; Maya’s reversal from “You can’t stay” to intimate mentorship happens quickly and without a strong on-page test of her resolve. A sharpened moment of refusal or near-refusal would heighten the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preventing reality’s collapse by anchoring quantum promises—is clear and escalates logically from eerie texts to existential threat. The key tightening is the threshold negotiation where the presence articulates the cost and need for an anchor. Yet the pressure remains somewhat abstract, and Maya’s choice feels more like stepping into a fated role than grappling with a live alternative; we rarely see her actively resist or consider not volunteering. As a result, tension is solid but not as sharp or costly as the premise invites.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the truth about the family fortune and thus revaluing the dynasty’s legacy—is clearly signaled and fulfilled. Escalation reads as deepening knowledge: from abstract suspicion to concrete acoustic experiment to the discovery of the hidden compartment and deed. The emotional and conceptual stakes tighten once she realizes the safe is not empty “if searched with sound,” culminating in a redefinition of both her ancestors and herself. The pressure is mostly intellectual and contemplative rather than contested or risky, which slightly tempers the felt cost and urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    The core stake—whether she will remain in stasis with her grief or risk reshaping reality and her relationship to the past—is clearly signaled and escalates via increasingly drastic uses of the patterns. Her agency drives every turn: she chooses to test the program, renew the oath, walk the orchard, and unsnap the final thread. However, the danger of “unsnapping reality” remains mostly implied; we don’t see a concrete threatened loss or near-miss that sharply narrows her options. As a result, tension feels intense but abstractly numinous rather than tightly pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether these children and the nameless soldier will remain erased or be meaningfully recorded—is clear and gains weight once the court-martial revelation appears. The key tightening is the discovery of the list, which reframes the button and forces Sarah into an active ethical choice. The conflict is mostly internal and low-volume, which works, but the sense of what she risks or sacrifices by taking on this task could be sharpened slightly. Even so, tension accumulates and resolves in a way that feels proportionate to the form.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes—whether Mira can broadcast suppressed history before being captured—are clearly established early and remain coherent. Pressure escalates from abstract threat (raided safe houses) to immediate pursuit (boots on stone) with one meaningful tightening: she must complete the upload as the Bureau closes in, then choose flight over defending the archive. The cost of her choice—remaining hunted and dispossessed while the room may be destroyed—is legible if somewhat under-felt viscerally. A touch more on-the-page jeopardy or tactical adaptation under fire would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—preventing the prophecy from taking root—emerges clearly, and pressure escalates from eerie whispers to “agitated” language trying to force its way through her silences. Her agency is central: choosing to stay, then to revise her playing into an architecture of hush, then to accept a lifelong duty. However, the opposition never quite bites back in a concrete way; we’re told the whispers press and fracture, but we never see a near-breach or a specific consequence of failure. The result is strong, coherent tension that stops short of fully visceral stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is Miren’s need to decode the leaves’ message and find meaning in her years of work, but this pressure stays largely internal and relatively low-risk. The moonstone discovery, the escalating moss patterns, and the construction of the “most elaborate monument yet” do provide a clear deepening of the inquiry. However, there is little real resistance or danger, and the story doesn’t force a hard trade-off beyond committing to understanding. The result is resonant but somewhat gentle in terms of conflict and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake is epistemic and ethical—whether to expose and “fix” the temporal anomaly or to preserve it—which is appropriate to the piece’s conceptual drive. Pressure escalates in a clear arc as Ellis moves deeper physically and informationally from workshop pattern to clandestine shrine and logbook revelation. Her final decision to leave the clocks and journals in place is a stance crystallization that closes one path (exploitation, fame, intervention), though the cost remains largely implied. Because no concrete opposition or on-page consequence tests her resolve, the conflict feels quietly resolved rather than acutely pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—redeeming her mistake by bringing Kael back—is clear from early on, and the internal pressure of guilt plus the external failure of the search party provide a solid inciting squeeze. The key tightening is her decision to sacrifice the wedding ring and run a risky, boundary-pushing ritual alone. However, the conflict curve is relatively smooth: once she commits, there’s no substantial on-page setback, resistance, or sense that the attempt might fail or worsen things. The resolution therefore reads earned thematically but somewhat low-friction in terms of dramatic testing of her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—releasing a guilt-bound soul while affirming that joy can coexist with failure—is clear and focused on the one ghost encounter. There is a meaningful deepening when the ghost’s scripted confession breaks and laughter surfaces, reweighting what “healing” entails. However, opposition is relatively soft: the ghost yields quickly once engaged, and Mara’s methods face minimal real risk or pushback. As a result, escalation feels gentle and lyrical rather than sharply tightening, which suits the mode but limits pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Kira can find a way to live with what was done to her and make moral sense of it—sharpens as the forest both hurts and “adjusts” to her. Conflict escalates via increasingly intense surges and the discovery that the forest metabolizes her pain, pushing her from resistance toward a fraught acceptance. Agency appears in her decision not to fight the surges, to carve and revise equations, and finally to stop resisting the strap and her enhanced state. The arc is compelling but largely inward and contemplative, with no sharp external reversal, which keeps the pressure solid rather than fierce.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will uncover and act on the erased histories her grandmother encoded—is clear, and there is a meaningful tightening when the paintings reveal systemic Guild erasure culminating in the grandmother’s and others’ faces. However, conflict stays largely in the realm of discovery rather than resistance: no one opposes her on the page, and she encounters no serious obstacle beyond the interpretive labor itself. Her “presentation to the Guild Council” is posited as a major step but not tested or complicated within the story. As a result, pressure escalates conceptually but not viscerally, keeping the stakes somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the truth so the ghost can rest—is clear and escalates as Marcus moves from noticing anomalies to physically retrieving the hidden box. Pressure does increase as the evidence is revealed and the ghost begins to fade, but Marcus isn’t significantly constrained or endangered, so his choices don’t feel sharply costly. The conflict is more investigative and elegiac than genuinely fraught. It’s strong for a quiet piece, but not fully taut.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stake—whether a perfect predictive system can survive deliberate contradiction—is clear and escalates from minor catalog glitches to a systemic upheaval when the bottled whisper is released. Margritte’s agency drives the turns, and Tessian’s perspective shift provides a soft but real resolution. However, the pressure never fully tightens into a moment where a substantial alternative is meaningfully viable; the conflict resolves without a sharp trade-off or clearly dramatized loss beyond the abstract surrender of perfection. Tension remains more conceptual than visceral, which moderates the score.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake is epistemic and memorial—whether the lost civilization will be acknowledged as non-human and remembered—and the secondary stake is Matthias’s sense of purpose after a failed revolution. Pressure accumulates via the storm, the risk of the mirrors, and the ideological conflict with Keraine, but the latter remains abstract and untested in scene. The main tightening is his realization that the aliens also knew and mitigated temporal storms, which deepens the cost of their erasure and cements his quiet vow to keep asking. The conflict is intentionally low-key and internal; effective for a lyric piece, but it never quite bites into a hard on-page tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    The core stake—reweaving the stolen music and upholding the covenant—is clear and present throughout, with a palpable sense that “one false note” could scatter the work. Escalation is largely accumulative: each silent box reclaimed heightens the sense of responsibility and scale, and the invocation of Pythagorean ratios adds weight. However, Cornelius never actually falters, faces opposition, or pays a visible price beyond fatigue, so the implied danger of doubt or deception never crystallizes into a concrete test. The result is quietly satisfying but a touch friction-light for elite-tier tension.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.4)
    The primary stake is internal—whether Mara will continue to reduce experience to product or accept an uncommodifiable relation to mystery—and that is signaled and resolved clearly. Pressure escalates gently rather than sharply: the compass’s insistence, the tight crack in the cliffs, the cavern’s alien stillness, then the decision to leave the compass and accept pilgrimage. There’s limited overt conflict or reversal; nothing seriously contests her goal beyond the philosophical implications of her choice. The story earns a quiet resolution but could feel sharper with one more concrete test of her old habits.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake is largely internal and artistic—how Iris will understand and execute “complexity scaffolded by simplicity”—with the storm serving as a catalyst rather than sustained external pressure. Escalation comes through the slide’s layering (past builders → Iris visible in the image → embedded coordinates) and her deepening reinterpretation of her work and navigation. Her choice to discard GPS and reconceive the commission is a real stance crystallization, but the narrative never forces a sharp trade-off or visible sacrifice beyond comfort and certainty. As a result, tension feels consistently gentle and reflective rather than truly tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding a truthful way to depict night-blooming flowers and answer the inherited question—is signaled early and returns consistently. Pressure escalates gently rather than sharply: prolonged failure, then the twilight discovery, then the urgent choice to redirect her effort to the pavilion glass. There is one clear deepening when she realizes the flowers “require a different kind of illumination,” which changes her options. Stakes remain largely internal and aesthetic, so the sense of cost and jeopardy never becomes very sharp, but within a quiet mode it holds together.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether dangerous, encrypted testimony stays buried or is brought into the open—is clear and does meaningfully tighten as Maya becomes implicated through Elijah’s memories. The parley scene offers moral and physical stakes (the sheriff’s potential betrayal, the risk to organizers), but the danger remains mostly conceptual rather than felt in the moment, especially since no confrontation breaks out. The retrocognitive trap sets up an existential risk for Maya, yet it resolves passively at dawn rather than through a hard choice that forecloses an option. Her later choice to decode everything does carry ethical cost, but the escalation from curiosity to this decision could be sharpened with one more concrete, risky point of no return.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the town will remain a dead relic or become something new—is clear and consistently held. There is a meaningful tightening when she realizes what the bottle contains and chooses to risk pouring her working memory into it, foreclosing the path of personal escape or stasis. However, the conflict is largely conceptual and internalized; there’s little resistance from the world or from her own doubt once the plan emerges, so escalation feels more like a smooth ramp than a crucible. The cost of her choice (isolation, responsibility, possible self-erasure) is implied rather than dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.8)
    The primary pressure is Miriam’s need to decode the prophecy and reframe her unease at the foghorn’s silence, with a clear tightening when the “accidental” version activates the tree’s emotions. However, there is little sense of what she meaningfully risks beyond misunderstanding, and no strong sense that failure would foreclose a path she values. The turn toward acceptance of “transition” is more contemplative than pressured. As a result, escalation feels gentle and mostly intellectual rather than deeply costly.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central conflict—whether to use the vortex to reverse the theft at great cost or accept loss and rebuild—is clear and thematically rich. Pressure escalates as she opens the vortex, sees the intact past within reach, and then feels the wrong “texture” of borrowed time, tightening her dilemma. Her refusal is a genuine foreclosure of an attractive option with conceptual and emotional cost. However, stakes remain mostly conceptual and interior; the absence of any concrete, immediate consequence beyond future “debt” keeps the tension from reaching maximal sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central conflict—trusting institutional, mechanical systems versus embodied, attentive listening—is clearly framed, with the zero-hour misprediction sharpening stakes. Escalation comes from her discovery that the crisis is imminent and her refusal to use the sanctioned sirens, which narrows options and demands agency. Yet opposition is soft: there’s no on-page resistance, misinterpretation, or near-miss that forces her to adapt tactics under pressure. As a result, the stakes feel high in concept but less tense in execution, with the outcome achieved without visible sacrifice or serious friction.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central conflict—Kael’s internal struggle between self-conceived brokenness/penance and the possibility of meaningful, vulnerable presence—remains clear and builds through the meteor shower and lantern discovery. Escalation is quiet but real: his ritual becomes a kind of dance, the lantern introduces a new pattern, and the insight about flawed glass reweights his exile. The cost is subtle (giving up the safety of defining himself by loss) rather than sharply dramatized. For an elite market, one slightly more concrete or fraught on-page test of this new stance would strengthen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake is conceptual—whether the covenant of remembrance will be honored—and it’s signaled and pursued clearly, with the puzzle of the box as the main pressure. Escalation arrives through Silas’s trial-and-error attempts and the realization that smashing the box would destroy “delicate truth,” narrowing his options to careful, code-like engagement. Still, the conflict remains relatively low-friction; there’s little real risk or pushback beyond the implicit spiritual stakes, and Silas never seriously flirts with refusal. The resolution is earned but gentle, with more deepening than sharp tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Marcus’s need to recover a way to keep time for his community—is clear, and the urn/capsule activation is a meaningful deepening of his options. However, pressure remains largely conceptual; nothing in the scene meaningfully threatens him, the silo, or Chen’s message once the mechanism engages. Conflict is mostly “lost vs. enlightened,” without a credible competing desire or risk that would force a hard trade-off. The ending resolves smoothly without a visible price paid in the moment, which keeps tension competent but not gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the young man will remain paralyzed by loss or find a new way to relate to his broken language—is clear and foregrounded early. Pressure deepens via the feather conversation into the kinetic kite moment, where his attempt to “harmonize” with erratic wind becomes a tangible rehearsal for working with discord in grief and art. The string snap provides a satisfying, if slightly on-the-nose, externalization of release, prompting his conceptual turn. Still, conflict remains very safe: we never feel real risk of refusal, regression, or rupture in the fragile connection between them.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Marina can use her limited remaining time to repair the failing living temple—is clear and scaled appropriately. There is one meaningful tightening when she identifies the three tree-less pillars and chooses to attempt an uncertain, almost mystical intervention with copper and oaks. However, the process unfolds with little resistance or setback; the repair works almost immediately, and her illness never meaningfully interferes with her work on the page. This keeps the conflict from fully sharpening into high-band territory, even though the conceptual stakes and cost (her death) land.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is Kira testing whether the visitors’ theory of homecoming-as-chemistry is real for her; this is stated early and returns at the end. Pressure escalates modestly rather than dramatically: the discovery of footprints mirroring her old path, then their arrangement into a “chemical” pattern, progressively narrows interpretive options until she must accept a new understanding of self and time. The conflict is almost entirely internal and cerebral, with little external obstruction, so the sense of risk or loss is more conceptual than visceral. Still, the final recognition forecloses her old purely skeptical stance in a way that reads as a genuine, if quiet, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are largely conceptual and ecological—whether the drowned battlefield can be reclaimed as living memory through the garden—and they remain coherent throughout. There is a soft escalation via new information (currents, nitrogen pockets, low tide, the owl’s “remembering”), but no strong counterforce or risk that truly narrows Erasmus’s options. Agency is present in his ritual labor and choice to return with bulbs, yet those decisions never feel contested or costly. As conflict, the piece reads more as meditative restoration than pressured struggle, which limits this category.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Finder will remain entombed in her post-war isolation or risk reconnecting with Crow—is clear and thematically apt. There is one meaningful tightening when she recognizes Crow’s voice and the encoded coordinates, which narrows her options from passive listening to a committed journey. However, the middle of the story (the three-day crossing and potential dangers of the wasteland or emotional relapse) is largely summarized, so pressure feels smooth rather than mounting. The reunion and choice to “find the living” resolve the conflict convincingly but without a strongly felt price in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is Kira’s stance toward her isolation and “contaminated” status: whether she is merely abandoned or actively claiming this anomaly as her domain. Pressure escalates texturally rather than through concrete reversals—more pages filled, more cosmic events witnessed, leading to a clarified purpose. However, stakes remain largely conceptual; no new constraint arrives on the page to challenge or sharpen her choice beyond what’s stated at the outset, and there’s no fresh cost introduced midstream. The result is thematically potent but dramatically gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake (restore the world’s truth mechanism or risk permanent cosmic distortion) is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure does tighten as she commits to swapping pieces knowing she might be wrong, and the black queen’s replacement is a clear escalation moment. Still, the conflict is largely one-sided: no active resistance, misstep, or serious complication tests her resolve beyond the initial conceptual risk. The result is satisfying but low-tension, with high declared stakes but a smooth path to success.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the gestures of the “pawns” will vanish or be preserved—is clear and thematically potent, and we see it tighten as Mara becomes “benevolently ruthless” in extracting walks from survivors. Pressure is largely internal and conceptual; the external world (looters, the power vacuum) sets the premise but doesn’t escalate directly against her project on the page. The main deepening comes from the realization that architecture can hold memory, and from the temple-like status the gallery accrues, but we never see a concrete test or threat to that work in-scene. The conflict is resonant but remains relatively low-intensity and one-directional.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Isla can move from self-erasing grief to a living relationship with her past and culture—is clear and emotionally legible. Pressure escalates via the nightly, unsatisfying memory substitutions toward the discovery that the stone encodes her lost home and the subsequent flood of memory. That said, opposition remains soft; there’s little on-page resistance once the feather appears, and the breakthrough reads as a single leap rather than a contested climb. The cultural-stakes dimension (carrying her people’s language forward) is powerful but mostly asserted rather than put under live pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether Elena can forgive herself and thereby release the village—remains coherent, and her choice at the tapestry is a genuine, morally inflected decision with visible consequences. Internal and external conflicts are nicely braided (self-forgiveness vs. collective stasis), but the pressure does not markedly escalate; once she finds the tapestry, each step toward the solution proceeds with little resistance or doubt. As a result, the emotional price is there but feels somewhat under-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can reshape the moral calculus of her act enough to win mercy—is clear from the outset, and the pressure of the impending ritual gives the night’s work urgency. Escalation is mostly internal and accumulative: her poetic efforts grow bolder, the echoes proliferate, and by dawn the canyon is saturated, which sets up the realization that nothing essential has shifted. That turn (from hoped-for refraction to amplification) is strong, but the middle lacks a distinct additional complication or counterforce beyond repetition of the same tactic in varied lines. Still, the final acceptance (“Mira walked toward it”) reads as a real, costly stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—completing an impossible emotional repair before the workshop is destroyed—tightens effectively as the wave builds and time runs out. The interplay of external survival and internal uncertainty culminates in a single, focused choice about where to place her own essence. The price is subtle but clear: she risks exposing and fixing her uncertainty instead of keeping it unexamined.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Marina will continue to live at a safe observational distance or risk immersive, time-bound life—is signaled early and sharpened by the shell’s return and Thomas’s letter. Pressure escalates when the expected burial rite is disrupted by the wrong turn and the discovery of the “temporary eternity” chamber, which forces a live choice: leave the shell and retreat, or surrender to the moment. Her decision to sit in the cold water and then to confront the gallery owner constitutes a clear trade-off, sacrificing her protective aloofness. The conflict is primarily internal and quiet, with limited external obstruction, which keeps it from feeling maximally taut.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes—reconciling with Vera so she can see Silas, and Mara risking vulnerability after years of anger—are clear early. Pressure coherently tightens from anticipation at dawn through the act of uncorking the vial to the boat’s arrival and dockside confrontation. The main cost is internal, and the story earns Mara’s shift, but Vera’s immediate, wholly receptive response slightly mutes potential resistance or complication at the peak. Even so, the quiet whisper versus shout trade-off remains legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stakes—helping callers find their way back, and by extension rehearsing for her daughter—are clear and emotionally credible. However, the in-scene conflict is fairly low-friction: the call presents a riddle (“river…runs backward”), Mara interprets, gives instructions, and the woman is “there” without misstep or cost. The main “tightening” is conceptual (affirming the reverse migration’s success) rather than an escalation that narrows options or forces a trade-off. A slight obstacle, doubt, or failure in the call itself would deepen pressure significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—regaining control over her emotional broadcasts versus remaining exposed in a punitive, hyper-empathic world—is clear and meaningful. Pressure builds primarily internally: her rational risk assessment versus the suffocating memory of being forced to confess loneliness to a neighbor. The decisive act of pressing the eye to her skin is a real commitment with implied legal and social danger, but the conflict could use one more concrete complication (e.g., a closer brush with authorities or failure risk) to feel fully escalated. As is, the escalation is strong but relatively smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Margit will cling to or relinquish the burden of Ernst’s borrowed grief—is signaled early and tightened through each successive memory. Pressure escalates as she uncovers Ernst’s purpose and the origin of the flower, culminating in her choice to drop it. The conflict is mostly internal and quiet but coherent, and the cost (loss of connection and insight) is legible. Some beats of “investigation” feel reflective rather than actively pressured, keeping this just shy of truly intense escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus will finally act and choose, risking the end of his long stasis—is clear and consistent. Pressure escalates moderately as the external omens align (rising creek, ants, midsummer twilight) and lead him into stranger territory, culminating in the door confrontation. However, the internal struggle at the door feels a touch compressed: he weighs options briefly, then opens it without much on-page resistance or real sense of “what if I don’t.” The conflict works but could carry sharper, more felt cost at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether she will succumb to nihilistic disenchantment or reclaim agency in ruling—is clear and sharpened by the physical and psychological cost of the climb and the prophetic dread of the grotto. Pressure escalates from oppressive court dreams to physical danger on the ridge to existential confrontation with multiple futures. However, the conflict at the grotto resolves without a hard on-page dilemma: the old woman guides her toward a relatively unopposed “return and rule” answer, without forcing a visible tradeoff between specific futures. The stakes feel meaningful but could benefit from one sharper, more constrained choice or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—how Mira will use her alchemy in the face of Kael’s impending blindness, and whether she’ll stay—is established early and tightens meaningfully when he reveals “I’m losing the light.” Her response escalates from emotional reaction to a concrete plan (the palette of suns, the decision to document his vision and remain). Internal and relational stakes are clear, but external resistance is minimal, and the trade-off with her capital life and ambitions is more conceptual than scenically pressured. The tension is real but gentle, more contemplative than fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can make sense of her shattered chronology enough to endure—is clear and thematically resonant. Pressure increases via cumulative anomalies (grave, out-of-order days, seeing herself from the ceiling), and her need to theorize becomes more desperate. However, there’s limited on-page confrontation or choice beyond continued documentation; the conflict remains largely internal and static in terms of options. The result is persuasive but relatively low-key in escalation for a “highest echelon” target.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elena’s loss of smell has destroyed her vocation or can be reconfigured—is clear and thematically apt, and Mr. Chen’s story deepens that conflict. However, pressure remains gentle; there is little escalation beyond conversation and recognition of parallels, and no moment where a real option feels foreclosed on the page. The result is a satisfying but low-intensity internal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can produce a true, earned rune and thus pass both exam and internal test—is signaled early and remains clear. Pressure escalates modestly through reflection on the fire and the realization that their quirk and scars must be embraced, not hidden, culminating in the choice to base the rune on their own wounds. The cost (risk of failure, exposure of shame) is legible but the opposition is largely internal and resolves without much resistance once the insight arrives. For a top-tier venue, the conflict could use one more complicating beat or moment of doubt undercutting the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether an overdue apology can meaningfully alter a damaged relationship before the space that held it is destroyed—is clear early and tightens as they move from small talk to blunt confrontation. The key escalation is Mira explicitly owning her motives (“I thought exposing you would reconnect us…”) and Derrick articulating the concrete aftermath, which forces them both into a more honest, costly exchange. The resolution (no forgiveness, but a shift from total estrangement) is earned and carries visible emotional price. Conflict remains primarily internal/interpersonal rather than situational, but it stays live through the final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake is internal—can Kael understand and integrate the nature of cosmic illusion—and it is signaled early. Pressure does build mildly as the library’s organization reveals itself and the silence turns “expectant,” but there is little true resistance or narrowing of options; he is never forced into a hard trade-off. The meaningful turn is his decision to stop treating spiral arbitration as an external process and instead embody it, with the small externalization of leaving the dictionary behind. Still, the escalation remains more meditative than tense, with limited sense of price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Maren will obey protocol or risk a transgressive experiment to reframe time—is clear but remains low-intensity. There is one meaningful tightening when she decides to count backwards and inserts the key, leading to the pendulum’s impossible stillness and revelation. However, there is little sense of concrete risk or consequence for breaking the station’s rules; the action feels almost consequence-free once the insight lands. As a result, conflict is interesting but relatively gentle, with limited felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.4)
    The core conflict—protecting a fragile, high-stakes operation vs. recognizing and aiding another person’s grief—is well articulated and escalates from abstract contamination to a face-to-face moral decision. The early clock (Reeves and investors arriving) provides situational pressure, and Marcus’s trespass raises real consequences. The resolution is earned through Mira’s choice to risk bending protocol, but the cost (to her job, to security) is more implied than felt on the page. A bit more friction or resistance in that final choice would deepen the sense of price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    The conflict is primarily internal: how to live with probability, uncertainty, and her father’s self-destructive contradictions, and what stance she will take as a teacher and daughter. Stakes are emotionally real—her father’s health, the meaning of his life’s work, and her own ethical vocation—but the pressure remains low-key and reflective. The rehab call and his request for the notebooks provide a gentle tightening that nudges her into a choice. Still, there’s little genuine opposition or risk to her decision, so escalation is more deepening than sharpening.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are primarily emotional and societal—estranged relationships versus the possibility of reconnection—and those are clear, but the on-page pressure on Iris herself is minimal. The one key tightening is the shift to her actively altering numbers and messages, yet that escalation is not paired with any tangible risk, dilemma, or visible consequence for her. As a result, tension remains more conceptual than felt; the story tells us she’s careful and that she cultivates estrangement, but she is never truly tested. The ending image is lovely but not the culmination of a sharpened conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will remain entombed in others’ memories or re-engage her own loss—is clear from early on and tightens as the archive shifts from sanctuary to mausoleum on the page. Escalation is quiet but real: the locket forces a confrontation at the precise site and ritual that founded her career, and writing the card constitutes a concrete, costly recommitment. The choice to alter, not abandon, her work is an earned stasis-with-transformation, with the cost (continuing to live with her daughter’s memory) legible. The conflict is almost entirely internal, but avoids stasis or vagueness.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.5)
    The primary conflict is internal: Vera’s reliance on jokey, anarchic competence versus her unacknowledged loneliness, with the young man’s confession forcing a stance. There is one clear escalation beat—his “shouting into a void” line—which tightens pressure by making her coping mechanism legible and untenable. She pays a modest but real price by dropping the mask and allowing genuine connection while still acting to solve his problem. The external stakes (village needs, medical emergency) are credible but mostly serve as backdrop, keeping tension more reflective than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—finding a way to live with grief by reaching the stillpoint—is established early and sharpened when the scattered notes cohere into her wife’s melody. Escalation is mostly internal and textural: more notes, increasing urgency of the ring, and the emotional blow of recognizing the domestic song in this uncanny place. Her key act of agency is to keep following the trail and to accept what the stillpoint reveals rather than seeking more map or solution, which closes off the escape fantasy. What keeps this just short of the higher band is the near-total absence of active resistance or alternative tactics; pressure deepens but doesn’t significantly narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Vera’s need to reconcile her Meridian failure with her ongoing responsibility as an interpreter—is clear, and the discovery/experimentation with the pen meaningfully deepens the situation. However, the pressure never fully tightens into a hard choice, because she’s allowed to send all seven interpretations rather than commit to one at a visible cost. The settlers’ accepting, adaptive response further diffuses potential conflict, so escalation reads more as intellectual deepening than as sharpened stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Marina will remain trapped in nostalgic grief for lost sound or embrace a new way of making music—is clear and present early. Pressure does deepen as she shifts from confusion to the articulation “I’ve been trying to remember music…But I should be discovering it,” and her later vow to “disrupt everything they think music is” marks a real tightening of stance. Yet the conflict never quite bites: there’s little resistance, no meaningful backslide, and Celeste offers near-frictionless support. The emotional price of letting go of her remembered identity is implied more than dramatized under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stakes—rescuing the Tethani’s truth and Kiran’s legacy from erasure—are clear and high, and the narrative tightens as Marina moves from discovery to decoding to committing to a global leak. Internal and external stakes are well intertwined, especially around the vandalized portrait and the decision to go public. However, the on-page conflict is largely procedural and unopposed: she encounters no significant setbacks, time pressure, or true dilemma in the archive, softening the sense of escalation and cost in the scene itself.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—can she meaningfully preserve and “keep with her” the dead she’s entangled with—is signaled early and carried through. Pressure escalates texturally via intensifying drumming and increasingly dense memory cascades, culminating in the sense of being a “symphony of selves” under auroral sorrow. However, there is only one gentle tightening (the impending dawn and loss of access), and no true reversal or hard trade-off beyond enduring the emotional burden. The conflict remains largely internal and contemplative, effective for a lyric mode but shy of maximal sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    External stakes (catching the smuggler without spooking them) and Mira’s personal leverage stake (information on container 4472-G) are clear and braided. Pressure tightens through the negotiation with Voss and the ticking window before the labyrinth reconfigures; the storm-dependent movement pattern is a solid escalation in knowledge. However, the on-page sense of risk—what Mira stands to lose by helping Harbor Authority—remains underplayed, so the price of her choice is more inferred than felt. The arrest itself resolves smoothly, without a hard moral or tactical squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will risk confession to possibly save her brother—is clear early and tightens as the guardian’s patterns force her to confront what silence costs. The key escalation comes when he explicitly redirects her attention to the rescue boats and to her own agency, narrowing her options to speak or continue complicity. Internal and external stakes are well braided, but the conflict resolves somewhat swiftly and cleanly once she runs to the harbor master, with limited sense of residual fallout. The price (exposure, self-condemnation) is present but could be pressed slightly harder on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—resisting dehumanizing conformity in the children’s education—is clear but remains mostly abstract and unopposed on the page. Escalation is gentle: internal recognition of harm → plan → execution → immediate communal response, without a beat where Marina faces resistance, hard choice, or potential punishment. Her agency drives events, but the lack of on-page pushback or concrete risk flattens tension; success at midnight feels almost too smooth. For a quiet story this is functional, yet it stops short of sharper pressure or visible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Marina will remain imprisoned in a protector/weapon identity or surrender it—is clearly signaled and coherently pressed. The discovery of the pirate-marked scrimshaw and the whale’s call are the key deepenings that force a trade-off between clinging to fury and accepting a gentler self-concept. Her choice to drop the scrimshaw forecloses a path (revenge, self-blame) at real emotional cost. The escalation is largely internal and quiet, but it tightens rather than meandering.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Maya can re-enter authentic feeling after state-enforced happiness—is clear early and tightens as her scripted narration starts to fracture. The escalation is quiet but real: from stylized self-narration to flirting with violence, to converting grief into physical reduction, to an un-narrated, irreversible gesture (destroying the bouquet). That final act forecloses a way of “keeping” the Mandate-era compromise and carries a cost in its emptiness. Pressure remains largely internal and atmospheric, so while effective, it never fully sharpens into a stark dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.9)
    The core conflict—Lyren versus inherited prohibitions and internalized limits on beauty—is clear but mostly internal and reflective. The main tightening is when she dares to paraphrase aloud and the humming deepens, which nudges the stakes from contemplative to slightly dangerous/mystical. However, there’s minimal sense that something could genuinely go wrong or that she might back away; once inside, the outcome feels almost guaranteed. Stakes remain largely abstract (spiritual/aesthetic liberation) rather than viscerally tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central conflict—Mira trying to awaken Fen from the cage of perfection into embracing flawed creation—is clear and thematically integrated. There is a single meaningful tightening when Fen produces the twisted “failure” vase and exposes his vulnerability. However, resistance is relatively low; Fen doesn’t meaningfully push back or risk anything concrete beyond pride, so tension remains mild. The stakes feel important but mostly conceptual, which keeps the arc from fully sharpening into high-pressure drama.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the corrupted data is worthless or can become a new form of pilgrimage/testimony—is clear and present early. Pressure escalates from verbal disagreement to a live test in the chamber and culminates in Karim’s choice to reframe and recommit, but resistance softens quickly after she consents to “against her better judgment.” There’s little sense of what she risks beyond pride and sunk effort; no outside constraint (funding, institutional pushback, personal cost) tightens the vise. The conflict is coherent and thematically apt but remains relatively gentle, more contemplative than fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is emotional—whether and how Mira can honor the mother’s plea to “make her bloom again” without betraying the reality of death. Conflict is mostly internal and procedural: this commission is “different,” she works carefully, and reflects on intention and transformation. There is a gentle escalation from receiving instructions to integrating ash and stencil to delivering the piece, but no genuine reversal or on-page dilemma where options narrow or a real path is foreclosed. The result is moving and coherent but relatively low-pressure, more contemplative than conflict-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant pressure is whether Mira will stay private or expose the depth and implications of her work, and she does cross that threshold by confiding in Tobias. Beyond that, the stakes remain largely conceptual—recognizing patterns in cultural manias—without a concrete on-page risk, opposition, or trade-off. There’s one meaningful deepening (tying historical manias to crypto crashes), but no real escalation or narrowing of options. The result feels intellectually charged but dramatically gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Maressa will use or disseminate this dangerous technology/knowledge—is evident early and tightens as she experiences the Keltharan memories. Internal and external conflicts interlock: the lure of unparalleled historical access versus the moral horror of a civilization that “archived itself to death.” Her final refusal to record or remove anything forecloses a major life-path with clear cost. Escalation is largely interior and could use one more concrete on-page test or countertemptation to reach the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is Maren’s stance toward her work and the larger culture’s erosion of hope; that is signaled early and held. Pressure escalates modestly via the juxtaposition of Lyssa’s two recordings and Maren’s increasing recognition of her own complicity. However, the conflict remains largely contemplative; there is no sharp on-page test that forces a costly choice beyond the quiet decision to keep noticing and to mark the glass. The result is thematically rich but tension-light, limiting the score.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes—Mara’s self-respect versus her responsibility to the animals—are clear early and remain coherent. Pressure deepens as she moves from contemplating options to concretely drafting multiple documents that commit her to a costly course. However, the conflict remains largely internal and there is no new external complication or sharp reversal; escalation is more a steady tightening than a distinct turn. The ethical trade-off is nonetheless legible and consequential at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Maya can live with her “failure” and still be a healer—is clear early and deepens as she re-examines the coffee rings and her scar. Pressure is primarily internal but coherent, with the plant voices acting as a constant, low-grade external demand that she has been resisting. The key tightening is the reinterpretation of the central “gap” in her attention, which narrows her options to either sustain self-condemnation or accept a costlier, more complex understanding. Stakes remain intimate rather than harrowing, but they are scaled appropriately to length and land with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—what happens to unused love and whether it can be released—is clearly articulated and deepens as she reads more strips. There is a meaningful tightening when Marina realizes the love is incubating and that she is its conductor, followed by the active choice to thread and run the projector. However, there’s little real opposition or cost: no serious risk, doubt, or alternative path is weighed, so tension remains mostly conceptual rather than visceral. The result is thoughtful and coherent but relatively low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—whether the trapped creativity will remain imprisoned or find release through Lyra—is clear and escalates as the voices go from whisper to “screaming,” culminating in the archway cracking open. Pressure coherently increases via the intensifying sky and mounting influx of potential, and her decisive act is aligning the astrolabe and allowing herself to be the conduit. However, the conflict stays mostly conceptual and internal; there’s little sense of risk if she fails, or of personal jeopardy beyond overwhelm, which keeps tension from fully peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—finding and crystallizing branches where life still grows—is signaled early and carried through. Pressure deepens via her active attempts (singing, pressing the clock) and the partial success of a wave collapse, which grants access to knowledge from another version of herself. However, antagonistic or countervailing forces are mostly implicit (entropy, prior failure) rather than dramatized, so escalation reads as intensification of effort rather than sharpened jeopardy. The resolution feels earned but comparatively low-friction, with limited sense of what she risks beyond continued futility.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can understand and reframe his uncontrolled translocations as meaningful exploration—is present but never faces real resistance. Once he uses the gear on the first tree, the unraveling process is frictionless and essentially guaranteed, with no reversal, cost, or true narrowing of options. This keeps the conflict largely contemplative rather than pressured, and the emotional price of insight (e.g., confronting painful defenses or lost joys) is described but not felt as a hard dilemma. As a result, escalation reads more like steady illumination than tightening stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Maya can reframe her years of caregiving from depletion to stored courage and then claim it—is clear and appropriate to a quiet, internal conflict. Escalation is accumulative: each station names a cost and deepens pressure on her self-concept, with her faltering steps and tears giving it some felt edge. There’s no sharp reversal or agonizing choice on the ridge itself; the primary “decision” is enduring the traversal and accepting the guides’ reframing. This keeps tension modest but coherent for the mode.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant conflict—memory and moral witness versus institutionalized “safety” through forgetting—is clear and sharpened by guests’ complaints, management’s piped music, and the ash-mark discovery. Pressure escalates via pattern: from oppressive quiet, to evidence of deliberate remembrance, to explicit suppression of Marta’s humming, culminating in her quiet act of resistance. Stakes are mostly internal and conceptual, so the felt cost is subtle rather than visceral; there’s little sense of concrete risk beyond disapproval or job loss. For a quiet, thematic piece, the arc still tightens enough to make the final choice land.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—whether truth about succession can escape the collapsing library—is clear and scaled appropriately. Pressure rises via the accelerating collapse and the limited “cycles,” culminating in the high-stakes dispatch of the Chronicle. However, the path contains little genuine resistance or trade-off beyond the inevitable cost of her own dissolution, so escalation feels smooth rather than contested. The conceptual defeat of Orian is powerful but almost too easy, as he “understood that he had already lost” without visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why migration paths are disappearing—arrives early and coherently drives Maya’s investigation. Escalation is primarily cognitive: as she layers data and reinterprets the atlas marks, pressure intensifies through insight rather than opposition, culminating in her reorientation toward the old current models. That’s effective under a largely causal/intellectual lens but remains low-friction, with no real cost beyond abandoning a prior interpretation. The quietness is appropriate for the piece but keeps the conflict from feeling fully sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the rebellion is truly over or in a meaningful pause—is clear and sharpened by the contrast between material ruin and the stones’ patient hum. Escalation is primarily internal: the hum intensifies, the hidden markings and constellation pattern “click,” and she moves from passive seeking to an intention to gather others. The pressure never becomes acute or morally fraught, so cost remains relatively low-key. Still, the shift from private solace to assuming the risk of leadership is an authentic, earned tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—the future of her people and their traditions—is clear early and escalates from resource-scavenging to deciding whether to unleash a designed evolutionary leap. The discovery of the embryo and its non-human nature is a strong tightening that forces her to confront her prior binaries (preserve vs destroy). Her final “yes” is an active choice with real conceptual risk, but the moment of deliberation is relatively brief and mostly intellectual. Slightly more on-page resistance or potential downside would sharpen the sense of cost and raise pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether she can endure triggers without being consumed—appears early and is tested concretely by the incoming school group and the helicopter’s sudden intrusion. Pressure escalates from background description of PTSD responses to a live panic episode that forces her to choose between spiraling and using her practiced grounding method. The cost is ongoing and credible: she does not “get over” anything but recommits to functioning in a world that can still ambush her. It’s a quiet escalation without multiple turns, but for this length and mode the single decisive tightening works.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether she will remain a “broken” artist or find a new way of seeing—emerges early and tightens as the walls contract. Each contraction escalates urgency, and her choice to commit to the thread-work under literal physical pressure is clear agency. However, the risk of bodily harm never quite feels as viscerally present as the metaphysical risk, and once she understands the pattern, the path forward is relatively untroubled. The price paid is mostly conceptual, not dramatized as a sacrifice or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding and eventually reaching the target through the time-ink phenomenon—is clear and sharpens as she uncovers evidence. Escalation is primarily conceptual: the video revelation that the target stepped into the ink patterns and her consequent reinterpretation of her brother’s death. There is little external opposition or concrete risk in the present scene, so tension reads more as simmering investigation than acute crisis. The final decision does foreclose a path (simple revenge) and commit her to a more dangerous, abstract hunt, but the cost remains mostly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—whether Kael will risk unleashing forbidden histories against the Authority—is clear and escalates from private unease to a world-altering decision. Internal conflict (fear of her mother’s fate vs need to honor her) intertwines with external stakes, but there’s limited on-page resistance once the letter appears. The letter functions as a strong tightening beat that collapses her long hesitation into a now-or-never choice. However, opposition is mostly abstract; there’s no concrete pushback or complication in the act of transmitting itself, which slightly softens the felt cost in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central conflict—violence versus cultivated gentleness, and whether the father will remain a hunter or submit to his daughter’s ethos—remains focused throughout. Pressure escalates subtly via his hand on the gun, then the knife, and Mara’s clear rejection of his protection, culminating in his choice to sheathe and kneel. The cost is more internal and identity-based than overtly dramatized, but it’s legible in his rough request to be taught. A slightly sharper on-page sense of external danger could have intensified stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stakes—recovering the daughter’s voice and surviving a destabilized cosmic environment—are signaled early and remain coherent. There is one clear tightening when Mira deploys the paradoxical method of “voicing silence,” which risks being overwritten by divine laughter and scattered across the garden. However, the conflict path is almost entirely one-way: resistance is described (echo twisting, stars dragging), but Mira does not face a true reversal or forced trade-off that narrows her options; she simply persists. As a result, tension is strong but not maximal for this calibre of venue—the outcome feels slightly too assured once the method is named.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—truth versus family legacy and institutional credibility—is clearly signaled and coherently maintained. Pressure deepens via Marcus’s revelation and then his warning about the cost of publishing, leading to her explicit ethical calculus and choice. However, the conflict remains mostly internal and conversational; there’s little concrete resistance beyond the anticipated damage to reputation, which keeps the escalation from feeling truly sharp. The final decision is earned but arrives with relative ease, limiting the sense of real sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—resolving the “dissonance” of inherited guilt and feeling untetherable—is legible early and tightens as the firmware’s phantom message repeats and the letters mount pressure. The time-fold event and emergence of her own baby-cry escalate the internal conflict credibly, forcing her toward the costly choice of sacrificing the pendant and marking herself. Conflict remains primarily internal and contemplative, but it does evolve rather than circle, and the quiet resolution reads as earned stasis/shift. The lack of any opposing on-page agent or real risk of failure keeps the stakes intimate rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—can meaning be reconstituted amidst societal “unlearning,” and what becomes of personal grief in that context—is clear, but more existential than tactical. Escalation arrives via the old woman’s entrance and especially her interjection about her missing daughter, which reweights Isla’s ritual from private inquiry to shared mourning and responsibility. The final stance (“we’re all learning to be daughters and mothers to each other now”) crystallizes a response rather than a choice among sharply competing harms. The conflict is emotionally authentic but remains low-pressure and largely internal, limiting the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant conflict—expose the complicated truth about Davos or let the myth stand for a traumatized society—is sharply framed and escalates through Vessa’s deepening visions of his culpability and sacrifice. Her agency at the climax (prying out the tessera) is clearly the decisive turn that narrows options, with the cost of carrying the unshared truth. The stakes are moral and symbolic rather than physical, but they feel proportionate to the length and world. The pressure could be heightened by a bit more immediate social or interpersonal risk on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Celeste trying to pull the young man back from despair by engineering a future moment of artistic recognition—is established and followed through, and her decision to sing is a clear act of agency. Pressure does deepen as the garden responds and the timelines braid, and the tarot coin heating/spinning functions as a modest escalation indicator. However, the conflict remains largely unilateral and low-friction; nothing meaningfully resists her plan, and her fear of failure or of misusing the garden is never really tested on the page. The result is emotionally affecting but not especially tense.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stakes—Maya trying to mitigate Iris’s irreversible loss by finding a new way to engage the damaged pathways—are clear and emotionally coherent. Escalation is primarily conceptual and procedural (discovering the shock effect, devising the method, gaining Dr. Chen’s recognition, then broader medical impact) rather than confrontational. The lack of a sharp on-page clash or painful trade-off keeps the pressure at a thoughtful, problem-solving level rather than a truly fraught crucible. Still, the ongoing cost (no cure, living with partial, reframed hope) is legible at the ending and gives the quiet conflict weight.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—Mira’s role in witnessing and voicing a transforming world—is clear but faces little genuine resistance or narrowing of options. Discovering nonhuman emotional patterns provides a conceptual deepening rather than an on-page crisis or reversal. Her choice to become “the voice of what humanity had left behind” is framed as an already-accepted trajectory more than a tested commitment. Tension stays mostly atmospheric, so escalation under the accumulative lens is modest rather than compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.8)
    The core stake—whether a life-shaping prophecy is doom or possibility—is potent, and the internal pressure of a woman re-reading her own fate is compelling. There is a clear deepening when the prophecy fractures into many voices and the meaning flips from sealing the canyon to sealing “the wound,” which narrows her ethical options. However, the conflict is largely unopposed; elders and townsfolk offer no resistance on the page, and Maren does not appear to risk tangible social or personal loss by acting. Tension exists but never tightens into a genuinely difficult or contested choice.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Claire will keep hiding or risk herself to complete the compromised mission—is established early and tightened as she realizes “the broken thing wasn’t her life—it was the mission itself.” Pressure escalates from quiet routine to a pivotal choice once Marcus appears with concrete next steps and a time constraint (leave tomorrow while roads are passable). The primary conflict remains internal and anticipatory; external opposition is gestured at rather than dramatized, which limits visceral tension. Still, the final commitment represents a real narrowing of options with implied lethal risk.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—her need to secure and understand the “palimpsest promise” before dawn—is stated clearly, and the opposition (river conditions / coachman’s rule) is conceptually sound. However, escalation is minimal: once she steps out and talks, the only “test” is waiting, and the gutters’ stopping arrives without any choice that truly forecloses another path. Her internal conflict (legalistic focus vs. maternal meaning) resolves relatively smoothly, without a moment that forces a painful trade-off or visible loss. The piece is quietly engaging but never quite tightens the screws.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is epistemic and spiritual—can she understand why this place resists entropy, and what that means for her craft—and it’s signaled early and maintained. Pressure escalates as she discovers more layers (timelines at different hours, trees leaning toward kindness, the growing “thrumming”) leading to her decision to stay three more weeks and consciously add her own layer of care. However, there’s minimal sense of risk or alternative paths; failure or harm never feel like live possibilities, so the cost is more inferred than viscerally felt. The conflict is thus beautifully rendered but low-intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Mira risking exposure to bring light and guidance to vulnerable kids—is clear, but the on-page opposition is mostly internal and implied; no concrete resistance arises in the scene itself. There is one main tightening: deciding to act on the rose-petal promise and create a public beacon that will provoke “questions, maybe consequences.” Pressure accumulates texturally rather than through reversal, so tension remains gentle and contemplative rather than sharp. The cost is felt conceptually but never bites hard enough in-scene to fully test her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael will stay trapped in isolating avoidance or claim an active relationship with this world—is signaled and paid off, with the cartography wing functioning as a concrete test. The tides, potential dissolution, and dangerous fauna give a low-key external pressure that keeps the Library from feeling purely safe. Escalation is present in her moving from avoidance to confrontation of the map that shows both worlds, then committing to charting her own space. Still, tension remains mostly intellectual and thematic; we never feel a moment where a competing path (retreat, denial) almost wins on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stake—whether Mei Lin will continue to hoard others’ confessions or release them into a shared space—is clear and resolved by her active choice to hang the letters. Escalation is present but soft: the addition of villagers and their recognitions deepens the emotional consequences of her decision rather than narrowing options under real pressure. Jun’s desire to write his own letter adds a small, effective personal pressure point. Overall, the conflict functions and resonates but never truly bites; there’s no moment where an alternative path feels dangerously plausible.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—freeing the campus (and perhaps humanity) from manipulative cosmic signals—is clear very early and drives every move. Pressure escalates as campus unrest worsens and then sharply during the live interference attempt, with the tricksters visibly adapting and pushing back in the waveform battle. Mara’s choice to proceed despite catastrophic possible outcomes is a real test of commitment, and her active adjustments during the clash maintain agency. The ease of the aftermath (no visible backlash beyond exhaustion) slightly undercuts the sense of lasting price.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stakes—securing the key versus being psychologically and spatially overwhelmed—are clear and interwoven. Pressure escalates with the organ’s first note and peaks when she exists in all five corridors at once, forcing her to endure intense fear to complete the reach for the key. The cost, however, remains mostly internal and physical (panic, collapse) rather than involving any harder trade-off of options or morals, which keeps the conflict strong but not searing. A sharper sense of potential irretrievable loss in the geometry itself could elevate the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Vera’s desire to reframe the quarry murders as a site of potential mercy and empathy rather than pure monstrosity—is clear, and there is a meaningful deepening once she reinterprets the ribbon and the killer’s role. However, conflict is predominantly internal and fairly gentle; Vera is neither opposed nor time-pressured, and no option is forcefully foreclosed. The deduction and subsequent decision to draw feel more like a smooth ramp than a tightening vise, with little visible price for her chosen stance. The result is elegant but somewhat low in tension for elite-market crime/psychological fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes—whether suppressed climate knowledge can be reclaimed and used—are conceptually high and signaled early. However, on-page conflict is relatively mild: Dr. Yoon voices skepticism about “reversible exile,” then aligns with Mira without much resistance or competing calculus. There’s one main tightening (the discovery that the nail holds the correction factor), but no serious obstacle to their new plan and little sense of immediate cost. The tension operates more as eerie atmosphere than as escalating, choice-driven pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding the hitchhiker’s disappearance and deciding how to respond—is clear but the pressure on it is gentle. Discovery proceeds with little resistance beyond physical scrambling and interpretive work that Maria accomplishes quickly. There is a deepening of stakes when she recognizes the names and conceptualizes “pixelated amnesty,” but no real narrowing of options or visible sacrifice. The final stance crystallization is earned, just low on visceral tension and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes are primarily internal—whether Luka will continue his pattern of predation and flight or confront it in place—and they’re clearly articulated. Pressure escalates through recognition: paralleling his father’s trade, re-evaluating “transcendence,” and reinterpreting his old and new territorial markers. The decisive move is his choice to stay and to recast the markers as commitments rather than fortifications, foreclosing an easy escape route. The conflict remains quiet and reflective, with no external antagonistic force, but within that mode the escalation is sufficient and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central conflict—whether this work will again become a destructive solitary obsession or be reframed as a shared burden—is clear and thematically apt. Pressure tightens once Kove reveals Chen’s fate and his complicity, forcing Mira into the choice to either continue alone or consciously pull him into joint work. The shift to collaboration and the reinterpretation of the inscriptions as inherently communal stakes are meaningful, but the path is relatively smooth, with little real resistance or risk dramatized in the present. As a result, tension is steady and engaging but never quite sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—breaking the curse by uncovering and completing a buried truth—is clear early and remains coherent. Pressure escalates through the structured search (each circle bringing Kael closer), the discovery of the trapped confession, and then the risky deployment of the one-use, flesh-eating seed. The external conflict (dangerous vortex, lethal curse) and internal conflict (having to unguard herself) interweave, though the latter could be pushed harder for more palpable risk. Resolution clearly stems from Kael’s deliberate choices rather than coincidence or off-page intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stakes are declared as enormous—navigating a catastrophically accelerated future—but on the page the pressure is gentle: Mara has already decided to come, Chen is fully aligned, and the group quickly agrees to build the maze. There’s one meaningful tightening when Mara proposes recreating the maze as “the pattern that shows the way,” which reframes their scattered visions into a common task. However, there’s little resistance, sacrifice, or real risk; options don’t feel narrowed so much as illuminated. The result is conceptually charged but dramatically low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—who lives and who dies, and whether stolen years can be surrendered—is established early and sharpened when Kael reveals Senna was meant to be his wife. Pressure escalates from moral discomfort to a direct demand that Mira undo her foundational choice, forcing her to commit to a dangerous attempt. Internal and external conflicts are tightly interwoven. What keeps this under the very top band is that we never see even a small, immediate price of initiating the reversal; all cost is projected into the future.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus can act with integrity and still live with his shame and uncertainty—is clear and introduced early via the PBS debacle. Pressure grows as the woman’s belief in her father intensifies the cost of telling the truth, and his choice to be precise yet gentle is a credible test of his priorities. The internal conflict between self-protection and honesty resolves into a small but meaningful renunciation: he accepts continued obscurity and doubt over false validation. Escalation is more accumulative than dramatic; it’s effective but intentionally low-key, which keeps it just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is Asha’s need to resolve grief by understanding transition and possibly germinate the knowledge fruit; this is signaled early and paid off with the seed’s growth and her new stance toward Dalmar’s “spirit.” Pressure escalates through her interpretive breakthrough about the magnetic gate and the deliberate planting under the concentrated field. However, the external conflict is minimal—no serious doubt or counterforce once she has the idea—so the path from insight to success feels relatively untested. The tension is mostly conceptual and emotional, which works, but keeps the stakes from truly tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—how to preserve or recover the capacity for wonder, and more concretely how to live meaningfully without “tomorrow”—is clear but remains mostly philosophical. The middle turn (discovering the stable pages and realizing they can be “smelted” with contradictions) does escalate conceptually, yet Maren faces no serious resistance or dilemma once the path is revealed. The ritual works on the first attempt; there’s no reversal or cost that forces a trade-off. As a result, pressure feels gentle and meditative rather than tightening in a way that would sustain higher-stakes tension.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will treat this site as a failed bunker or as a sacred communal experiment—is legible and does tighten as she moves from inspection to understanding to participation. Her final decision and self-crowning do foreclose a path (strictly bureaucratic detachment) in favor of a more vulnerable stance. However, the pressure is mostly internal and relatively gentle; there’s little concrete risk or opposition on the page, so escalation feels more like deepening reflection than sharpened conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether she will remain in self-punishing control or risk genuine reckoning and self-forgiveness—is clear early and returns at the end. Pressure builds internally from her long avoidance to the confrontation with graffiti, then to the vulnerable act of playing and re-mapping. The main limitation is that resistance softens quickly once the graffiti appears; the turn to insight and action feels slightly easy given a decade of avoidance. Even so, the choice to stay, play, and mark a new “confluence” forecloses her old avoidance path in a believable way.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—gaining access to forbidden knowledge that may cost her selfhood—is well signaled, but the opposition is soft and largely expository (warnings of danger, “too many scholars lost”). Escalation exists (the Librarian could deny her; the staircase only appears under precise conditions; the watch spins wildly) but never forces a painful trade-off or visible loss on the page. The ending implies a huge lifelong cost (“she would spend the rest of her life…”) without dramatizing a sharp moment of sacrifice or narrowed options. As a result, tension is intriguing rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stake—whether Iris will give the Empire what it wants or protect the violin’s intended purpose—is clear early and sharpened by Kemble’s explicit ultimatum. Escalation is primarily internal but credible: prophetic images of two futures, followed by the discovery of a third path (propagation) that narrows her options and raises personal cost. The moral calculus (dream of favor vs exile and danger in service of wider art) is well-articulated, though on-page opposition is relatively soft and could be tightened with one more concrete threat or constraint. Nonetheless, her tactical pivot to blueprint dissemination is a clear, agency-driven escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—honoring the dead by capturing a final spark—is clear and thematically weighty, but it never feels truly at risk. Conflict is largely situational and internal to the ritual, with no substantive obstacles, missteps, or doubts that could foreclose success. The aurora’s intensification offers a mild deepening of pressure, yet Kael’s composure remains unchallenged. As a result, escalation is present but gentle, more meditative than tense.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central stake—whether Mei can remain true to her role when confronted with the man who killed her daughter—is clear and morally charged. Pressure escalates from recognition to the decision to reveal the hairpin and her identity, which narrows options and forces both to face the harm directly. However, the soul offers little resistance or complexity beyond immediate remorse, so external conflict feels somewhat too easy and largely internal to Mei. The cost is present but muted; a touch more friction would sharpen the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—whether Keegan will confront his ethical failure and accept doubt—is clear and remains under pressure throughout the dialogue. Conflict escalates when Mara names the harm (“people got hurt”) and re-frames his narrative (“Your research failed…because you stopped questioning it”), forcing him into genuine vulnerability. The cost is internal and reputational rather than dramatized in action, so the tension stays relatively quiet, but it’s coherent and deepening rather than static.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—Maia’s relationship to visibility and self-erasure—is clear, but the conflict remains primarily internal and meditative, with relatively low on-page escalation. The main tightening comes as she enters trance and begins to perceive the stillness and gaps, forcing a re-evaluation of her goal to “disappear.” Keiran’s backward-aging condition provides a quiet but effective situational pressure, subtly underscoring that his time to teach her is shrinking. The lack of a sharper on-page test or concrete dilemma keeps the pressure from fully cresting.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.4)
    The primary conflict—restless, trapped motion versus learned stillness—is clear, and the stake for the hunter’s pulse (eternal frantic looping vs. peaceful expansion) carries real spiritual weight. Pressure does build somewhat as the birds arrive and she decodes the pattern, culminating in her matching frequency and offering a new way of being. Still, escalation is gentle and almost entirely internal; the skimmer faces little real risk, and there’s no moment where failure seems palpably possible. The resolution feels earned but low-tension, suited more to a quiet lyric than to high-drama stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—proving a different kind of magic and selfhood in a hostile, optimized world—is clear early and carries through to the end. Pressure escalates modestly from institutional failure to the physical and metaphysical risk of climbing, mist walking, and altering an ancient tower under the Academy’s unseen surveillance. External antagonism is mostly offstage, so conflict reads more as internal conviction vs systemic norms than as a concrete showdown. The cost of her choice is implied rather than dramatized, keeping tension solid but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming his mother’s work and, symbolically, their broken vows—reads clearly early and is carried through to the end. There is one meaningful tightening when he enters the wreck and discovers the labeled cases, which deepens both mystery and emotional stakes. However, external conflict is notably light: no real hazard underwater, no time pressure beyond the implied tide and festival, and no direct challenge to his goal, so tension remains more tonal than visceral. The internal conflict does escalate toward his final uncertainty about what he’s seen, but a concrete price or foreclosed option at the moment of retrieval would sharpen stakes considerably.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can find and accept a meaningful purpose in an unstable universe—is signaled and followed through, with the second casting of lots and new frequency marking a mild escalation. Still, pressure remains low: there’s no tangible downside dramatized if she chooses wrong or walks away, and no genuine reversal that narrows options. The conflict is almost entirely internal and philosophical, which is fine, but it stays relatively comfortable. As a result, the ending feels resonant but not truly hard-earned under real strain.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will remain hollowed-out or find a way to bear grief and do her work differently—is clear and focused. Pressure escalates as she moves from passive remembering to the active, risky act of naming (“Grief. Guilt. Rage. Regret.”) that literally crystallizes and reconfigures her interior state. The cost is emotional rather than situational, but it’s rendered concretely in the accumulating crystals and echoed child-voice. Some readers might wish for one more explicit resistance beat before she commits to speak the names to increase felt tension.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring the river/cosmic cycle—is signaled early and tied to concrete loss (fish, birds, soil, rain). Pressure escalates from observation to theory to the single climactic act of ringing the bell at the precise “dripping rate” moment, with her brittle faith as an internal counterforce. However, there’s no substantial on-page setback or reversal; the ritual works without resistance beyond preparatory labor summarized in retrospect. The result is meaningful but relatively gentle tightening: emotionally resonant, though not harrowed.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central conflict—Mara’s duty to “safety” versus preserving erased histories—is clearly framed and tightens when the county demands a “clean slate.” Her counter-move (the memorial proposal and broad dissemination) is an earned escalation that forecloses compliance. However, the opposing pressure from the county remains mostly offstage and is resolved somewhat easily by communal response, softening the sense of real cost or narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.0)
    The primary conflict is internal—her need to reconcile logic and intuition before attempting the final transformation—and it does intensify as the crystal melts, forcing an instinctive choice. The flock’s appearance is the key deepening, reweighting the stakes from mere ingredient-gathering to a confrontation with emergent order and wonder. However, there is little external resistance or consequence if she fails in this moment, so the pressure feels contemplative rather than truly fraught. The price of acting on belief (or the danger of not doing so) could be sharper to heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—whether to hold to her reading and risk trust or bend to the council—is clear and introduced early. Pressure tightens with the contradictory report and her moment of genuine doubt plus contemplation of escape. The key turn is her decision to respond with transparency and invitation rather than defiance or capitulation, but the external risk (council actually rejecting or punishing her) stays mostly theoretical. Tension is steady and coherent but never quite sharp enough to feel truly dangerous.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—what it means for Kenji to claim a life and self in relation to his clone—is signaled early and tightened as the hearing approaches. Internal and external conflicts intersect effectively: the custody battle gives teeth to his struggle with numbness. However, pressure at the climax is relatively soft: no on-page pushback from the judge, law, or clone tests his stance once he chooses to withdraw. The turn still feels earned, but the path of least resistance slightly blunts tension and the sense of a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Miranda can keep Labyrinth’s End independent—is clearly signaled, and the corporate offers plus financial precarity give a notional layer of pressure. Escalation comes more from accumulating good fortune (the plant’s growth, viral attention, monetization) than from deepening jeopardy or hard trade-offs. We’re told offers increase, but we never see a moment where accepting them feels viscerally tempting or refusing them exacts a concrete price beyond the abstract. As a result, the final refusal reads satisfying but low-friction rather than hard-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—piercing the family’s silence—is clear and emotionally weighty, and the piece does track a meaningful shift when the brother speaks. However, the on-page pressure is fairly low: Marcus’s plan faces no resistance, moral uncertainty, or possibility of backfiring, so escalation is mostly a gradual crescendo of sound rather than tightening options. His agency is strong (he designs and executes the ritual), but he is never truly tested or forced to choose between competing harms. The ending’s cost is felt but gentle, more a soft deepening than hard conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she remains feral and unmoored or reclaims a conscious role and relationship to her homesickness—is clear and resolves meaningfully when she chooses to don the pendant and stand. Pressure is mostly internal and textural, with escalation coming from accumulating disorientation rather than explicit threat, which suits the piece but keeps tension relatively low-key. The final choice forecloses a path (rejecting the garden’s wrongness) but the sense of risk around taking the pendant could be sharpened slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—will she continue along a stifling, prescribed destiny or risk everything on a heretical approach to life-creation—is clear and threads the piece. The main escalation is internal: the revaluation of her failures and the decision to actively betray her master’s teachings by breaking and transforming the crozier. The vivification sequence is tense and well-imaged, but the outcome unfolds with little real jeopardy or complication once she commits; there is no real chance of catastrophic loss beyond what’s implied. As a result, the pressure is strong but not quite harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Mira’s quest to decode the true underlying signal—is clear, but it encounters little resistance. The only real tightening is her decision to invert her method (valleys instead of peaks), which immediately produces success without failure, setback, or meaningful risk. There’s no external antagonist or material jeopardy, and internal doubt barely flares before being resolved. As a result, tension stays relatively flat and the ending reads as an elegant insight more than the culmination of escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—reuniting scattered commuters and restoring a coherent timeline—is clear and emotionally legible, and the story does tighten as Marcus enters the grotto and “gets something” on the radio. However, on-page resistance is minimal: once the crucial insight arrives, the broadcast and subsequent reappearances unfold smoothly without unexpected complications or trade-offs in the scene itself. The cost is mostly historical (three years of failure) rather than actively tested in the present sequence, so tension feels more conceptual than visceral. Marcus’s agency drives the resolution, but his commitment is never seriously challenged or forced into a visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Marina can construct a space where she and her brother can truly “meet” again—is clear, and the escalation from subsonic sensations to full gallery eruption provides a satisfying single tightening. The completion of the final strand and the pattern’s “snap” is an effective hinge. However, Marina is rarely forced into a painful trade-off or moral calculus; she executes a plan more than she wrestles with competing options. The hinted sacrifice in “Marina stayed there with her brother” isn’t sufficiently developed earlier as a live, contested choice, so the felt cost remains somewhat muted.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and why Yael should leave to learn starlight navigation—appears early and remains coherent. There is a meaningful deepening as she reframes her departure not just as career development but as a necessary human foundation for understanding the Visitors. However, opposition is largely hypothetical; Reeves doesn’t significantly resist or complicate her aim, and institutional or personal costs are only implied. As a result, tension is more philosophical than pressured, with limited escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes—delivering a dead boy’s message and preventing his sister’s suicide—are established and escalate credibly as Mara realizes the pulse is a warning, not just a farewell. There is a meaningful tightening when Elena is revealed as missing and suicidal, which reweights the situation from curiosity to urgent intervention. However, conflict feels slightly frictionless: Mara encounters no serious pushback from systems or herself, and her first hypothesis (the carnival) proves immediately correct. The price paid is mostly emotional strain and reputational risk, which are present but underplayed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes—retrieving/affirming erased research and a sister’s existence under lethal time/space constraints—are clearly signaled early. There is one main tightening when the tide returns early and the water seeps in, forcing her to stop annotating and leave, but she encounters no true reversal or close-call that would force a painful trade-off. Internal fear versus duty is present, yet she never seriously wavers or sacrifices a concrete gain on the page. As a result, tension is steady and engaging but not sharply escalated.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus can reconfigure his relationship to his own “death” and heartbeat—is clear and tightened by the ink ritual and the apparition. Escalation is primarily internal but real: from anxious counting to risking destabilization through “chaos magic” to a costly stance shift in relinquishing his counting ritual. The conflict remains low-key and contemplative, so moment-to-moment tension never becomes acute, but the final choice forecloses a path (continuous counting as existential crutch) in a believable way. A slightly sharper sense of risk around the ritual itself could have further intensified pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.2)
    The core stake—whether Keshrin vanishes or survives in transformed form—is meaningful, and the pressure of being the last speaker is clear. Escalation is mostly intellectual and summarized (years of study → bird insight → refined technique) rather than dramatized in live, high-pressure beats, so we rarely feel a risk of failure or concrete loss in the present scene. Her “price” (sleep, sanity, life spent alone) is stated rather than put under fresh test in the climax. The ending crystallizes a stance rather than resolving a live dilemma, which works but keeps the tension curve relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elena treats this as a reportable cryptid event or a personal metamorphic encounter—is clear and crystallizes at the end. Pressure escalates meaningfully when the abstract “harmony” becomes personal through her mother’s call, forcing a high-cost stance. However, most conflict remains internal and contemplative, with little external resistance or trade-off beyond implied professional and epistemic costs. The stakes feel intimate and thematically rich, but not as urgently squeezed as they might in a top-tier piece.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether suppressed, organic beauty can free itself from mechanical control—is clear and present early. Conflict escalates from eerie observation to direct confrontation as statues move in and trees wrench themselves loose in response to Lira’s intensified playing. Yet the opposition never lands a meaningful blow; the statues crumble without exacting a price, so there is little sense that Lira might fail or that she sacrifices something tangible. The resolution is earned but somewhat frictionless, limiting tension.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—delivering contraband emotional cargo across a tense border—is clear, and the drone pass, hush of the closing arcade, and illegal fostering all imply risk. However, on-page pressure remains largely hypothetical: no checkpoint, interruption, or hard choice forces Kael to alter tactics; he completes his task without obstruction. Internal conflict (his nervousness about the storm, his complicity in law-breaking) is gestured at more than escalated. As a result, tension is steady but never meaningfully tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    The primary pressure is internal and situational: will she merely salvage or genuinely awaken something—and in the process break her own silence. There is a clear deepening as work gives way to humming and then full song, and as the carousel moves from ruin to motion, but opposition is very soft; nothing meaningfully resists her beyond time and rust. The decision to sing reads as the major turn, yet it arrives almost as a pleasant inevitability rather than a fraught threshold. As a result, tension remains gentle and steady rather than truly escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether her hyperbolic mapping can truly locate “where stories live”—is established early and deepened by the discovery of the voids. There is one clear escalation when she notices the interference patterns and recognizes they represent something her equations can’t capture. However, there’s little sense of genuine risk or trade-off; if her insight failed, nothing on the page would materially worsen for her beyond disappointment. The conflict remains largely conceptual and serene, which is elegant but keeps pressure moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Marina can transform paralyzing longing into a bearable, meaningful practice—is clear and sustained. Pressure escalates modestly as today’s ritual with the aureolin pan leads to the inscription, which reframes her chase of the “runaway dream” into an understood, if still painful, connection. Conflict is primarily internal and contemplative; there’s little sense that she might choose not to return to the cliff or abandon this pursuit, so options never feel sharply foreclosed. The cost is real but quiet, rooted in ongoing grief rather than a specific on-page sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will unlock and claim her long-suppressed composition, with all the implications for her relationship with Clara—is clear early and tightens through the ritual’s emotional cost. The disorientation sequence credibly escalates pressure, stripping away her rationalizations until she voices her core fear. The resolution does foreclose a path: continuing to hide behind duty is no longer viable without acknowledged harm. However, the locksmith absorbs some of the active role in structuring the ordeal, so Mara’s agency at the peak feels slightly guided rather than fully self-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can recover and bear the stolen memory—comes through clearly, and the return to the greenhouse plus the decision to touch the ring again form a recognizable tightening. The memory-flood is a real turn that forces her to confront the earlier choice and its implications. However, little on the page suggests meaningful risk of harm or failure in the present; it feels almost guaranteed that her method will work, and “cost” is retroactive more than actively contested in-scene. The piece works as an internal-quest story, but the conflict stays comfortably managed rather than bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    The primary stake—whether Kael can genuinely prepare herself to return from exile—is present from the first exchange and coherently pressured by Miren’s uncompromising method. The conflict tightens via Miren’s tea-leaf diagnosis, the revelation of her double exile, and Kael’s reluctant participation, culminating in Kael adopting Miren’s own nervous tell and leaving with a shadow-glass. The cost is psychological and attitudinal rather than situational, which fits the piece but keeps tension more contemplative than gripping. A slightly sharper on-page test of Kael’s resistance/commitment would lift escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving the lost tree’s “color of wonder”—is stated early and pursued throughout, but pressure is low and largely uncontested. The main escalation is temporal and effort-based (hours of delicate work; aching knees, cramped hands), rather than a real narrowing of options or a risk that the attempt might fail or corrupt the seed. Esme never seems in danger of making a wrong choice or losing the seed, so the internal and external conflicts never fully bite. The ending is satisfying conceptually but feels more like the completion of a planned ritual than a hard-won turn.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to free the boy, thereby exposing him (and his brother) to painful truth instead of muted suspension—is present early and tightens through his confession. Pressure rises credibly as Mara recognizes both the danger (truth may not equal peace) and the boy’s insistence that he is “tired of silence,” culminating in her decisive plunge of the needle into the net’s heart. Internal and external conflicts interweave cleanly: her own burden of accumulated silences makes the choice costlier. The only constraint is that the implied secondary threat (“something older, colder”) never materializes into on-page pressure, so escalation centers almost entirely on the boy’s revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are quiet but coherent: institutional safety/proof versus preserving the site’s elusive grace and ethical engagement with mystery. The main tightening comes with the discovery of the older foundations and the spiral growth, which reframes what “reopening” should mean and prompts her unexpected recommendation. However, tension remains largely intellectual; there’s little palpable risk, opposition, or felt sacrifice on the page. The conflict deepens more than it escalates, keeping it in the strong-but-not-searing band.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Marina can reframe inherited grief and the physics-of-letting-go question—is clear, and it tightens as she moves from abstract motivation to the concrete shock of the log entry. The main escalation is conceptual: Marsh’s note and Eleanor’s equations collide with Marina’s lived relationship to death, forcing a new stance rather than a solved mystery. The cost is the quiet relinquishing of her drive to “solve” the past in favor of witness, which reads as an earned stasis. External or situational pressure is minimal, so tension stays largely internal and meditative.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.6)
    The stakes—giving voice to forgotten prayers and finally being heard—are conceptually strong and signaled early, and her encoding work is a clear response. However, the conflict is almost entirely frictionless: once she understands the ghost, nothing really endangers the project, tests her resolve, or forces trade-offs. The storm, mechanisms, and time all feel like allies rather than pressures, so tension remains low even as activity increases. The result is moving but closer to a lyrical vignette than a strongly escalated scene.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Maren will find meaning/connection in the captain’s encrypted diary rather than only loss—is clear and tightens as entries move from joy to the encroaching sickness. The main escalation is tonal: the shift from early lighthearted recollections to the darker, time-running-out entries, culminating in Thessaly’s explicit fear of dissolution and her motive for encryption. Maren’s agency is quieter and mostly attentional (choosing to read, choosing how to hold her grief), but it does crystallize in her decision to see the diary as “what remains.” Because the external situation never presses a hard choice or visible sacrifice in the moment, the pressure feels modest rather than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—Mara’s need to validate her hypothesis (and thus Victor’s legacy and her sanity) versus institutional doubt—is clear but rarely pressed. Most of the story is contemplative observation rather than choice under tightening pressure. The main “turn” is her resolved intention to present her findings tomorrow, which feels like a continuation of an existing plan rather than a new, costly decision. As a result, tension never meaningfully escalates even though the thematic stakes are high.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stakes are largely conceptual: whether and how she will take up the guild’s charged legacy, and what the demolition means for the project of containing knowledge. The external clock of the impending tree fall provides some situational pressure that escalates from eerie stillness to wrecking ball swing. Her choice to keep the coin and to continue painting in the spirit of “noble futility” constitutes an earned stance crystallization, but the cost is mostly implied rather than sharply dramatized. As a result, tension feels quietly persistent rather than truly tightening into a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—freeing the airship before supplies and morale run too low—is clear and grounded. There is one meaningful tightening when Maren chooses to enact an untested reversal that could affect the entire vessel. However, the escalation is gentle: no failed attempts, no visible consequences for risk, and no secondary pressure in the moment of action, so the conflict feels more like an elegant puzzle than a genuine crucible. The resolution is earned but largely uncostly, which keeps tension in the mid-range.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Celeste will move beyond being merely an opener to understanding repair—is clear, but the on-page pressure is gentle and largely contemplative. The main tightening comes when she enters the mirror hall and uncaps the vial, but these do not feel risky; nothing resists her, and failure has no articulated consequence. Internal tension (habit as locksmith vs. desire to be a clockmaker) is mostly asserted rather than meaningfully tested by a dilemma. The result is a graceful escalation in imagery and insight without much sense of jeopardy or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether this refugee community will uphold a collective ethic or slide back into extractive individualism—is clearly signaled and tightened by the arrival of the merchant ship. Mirela’s shift from logistical messages (“pruning,” “share the bells”) to the moral crux (“I DIED SO YOU COULD LIVE DIFFERENTLY”) effectively escalates the conflict into a value decision. The unanimous vote reads a bit too easy; we don’t see a truly contested or costly debate, so the ethical conflict resolves without much on-page resistance. Still, there is a meaningful narrowing of options and a real, if somewhat idealized, trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can embed an act of care into the fabric of ending reality—is clear and tightens as she begins the hum and manipulates the nested patterns. Escalation is subtle but present: once she starts, there’s a sense of irreversibility culminating in the puppet’s disintegration and her own surrender to the pattern. Internal and external stakes interweave well, though the pressure could be heightened slightly with more explicit risk of failure or corruption of the lullaby. Cost is legible in her renunciation of separate existence and in the sacrifice of the last physical relic of her daughter.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.9)
    The core stakes—strangers’ lives against a ticking curse and Maren’s ongoing entrapment—are clear and emotionally legible. Pressure escalates through the time limit and the emergence of the hikers as fresh “victims,” forcing her into active, risky guidance using newly learned rules. External conflict (saving them) and internal conflict (resentment vs responsibility) interlock, but the on-page danger feels relatively smooth, with few genuine near-failures or reversals. The final price—renewed commitment to her role—is clear but could be felt more viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Maya will remain paralyzed by grief and guilt or re-engage with their unfinished research—is clear early. Pressure accumulates through her physical return to the ravine, the re-encounter with the accident site, and the discovery of the chrysalis, which together force a stance on what “atonement” should mean. The key tightening is her realization that the divergent research paths can converge, which reframes inaction as the greater betrayal. The piece remains mostly internal and contemplative, so tension is more atmospheric than edge-of-seat, keeping escalation effective but relatively subdued.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is conceptual—Mira’s quest to locate where stories begin and to refine her practice of “clean slates.” Pressure does increase slightly as patterns in the incisions emerge and the library “wakes,” culminating in the hidden catalog beneath the visitors’ feet. However, there’s no real reversal or hard trade-off; nothing concretely threatens her, her work, or the library, and she faces no ethical decision that costs her something on the page. The result is a beautifully textured meditation with modest escalation rather than a fully pressurized conflict arc.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Maren can withstand and transform the fortress’s collected remorse without being “subsumed”—is clear and directly engaged in the tasting sequence. Escalation is accumulative: each memory adds weight, and the text names the risk of being overwhelmed. However, the conflict resolves rather smoothly once we’re told she trained for this; there’s little sense of near-loss or trade-off beyond exhaustion. The cost is more conceptual (labor of grief processing, dissolution of the dream-pavilion) than felt as a hard-won personal risk on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether isolated, traumatized groups will risk opening to one another—is established early and sharpened by Elevator Seven’s silence. Escalation is credible: Mira moves from gentle, universal singing to a more targeted, ethically fraught maneuver of asking other communities to speak directly to Seven. The emotional and moral risk is clear, but the sense of possible failure or backlash remains somewhat muted; there’s little impression that anything worse than disappointment could happen. As a result, tension is steady and sincere rather than grippingly high-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—how to use dangerous memory technology and what it does to Maya’s own mind—is clearly signaled. There is some tightening when the entangled memories flood her and she confronts both Keiko’s horror and the volunteers’ abandoned dreams, which reframes the moral calculus. Still, conflict remains largely uncontested: no serious alternative path or opposing pressure challenges her decision to “return these dreams,” so the choice doesn’t feel tested. The result is a thoughtful but relatively low-pressure escalation curve.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Celene can correctly execute the time/location/intention combination to seed a new guardian consciousness—is clear and logically escalates once inversion begins. There is one solid tightening at the discovery of the hidden opening that appears only under inversion, which justifies her entire quest. However, the journey through the grotto presents little meaningful resistance: no real risk of failure, injury, or moral trade-off surfaces on the page. As a result, tension remains more conceptual than visceral, keeping the conflict just below truly gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—can Mara conjure a form of music that survives the Silence—is clear and tightened as she wires the grove and plays harder, to the point of bleeding. Pressure escalates texturally: more complex wiring, faster strumming, the entire grove pulsing in response. However, opposition is minimal; there’s little sense of real failure risk or an alternative path foreclosed beyond her own physical limits, so tension stays contemplative rather than gripping. The cost is there but relatively gentle, keeping conflict effective but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake (re-establishing the covenant to prevent catastrophic collapse) is declared early and Katrin’s internal stake (proving beauty-in-difficulty) interweaves nicely. There is one meaningful tightening when the beings begin reacting to the board and she starts correlating patterns, leading toward a make-or-break communicative gambit. Yet the conflict remains relatively smooth: once she tries chess, the beings respond positively without misinterpretation, rejection, or true risk of failure dramatized. The lack of a sharp reversal or visible price keeps tension from fully matching the story’s stated scale.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—recovering Elena’s inner world and legacy—is clear and carries emotional weight, and the pressure does deepen as Marcella tunes through different silences that map to Elena’s motives. The internal conflict between preserving imagined protection and risking painful truth is effective, and her explicit renunciation (“empathy doesn’t require protection… It requires witness”) feels like a genuine turn. However, the external obstacle (the clasp) yields relatively quickly once the right frequency is found, so escalation never tightens into a truly fraught test of her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lirien can remain internally still while confronting a smell that assaults her greatest vulnerability—is clearly established. Pressure escalates appropriately: years of pursuit → planting → bud → full bloom and three-day ordeal, with her body “screaming to flee.” Her choice to stay and keep witnessing under worsening conditions is an earned act of agency that forecloses the easier path of avoidance. The conflict could be sharpened by one concrete near-failure or alternative temptation, as her victory feels largely uncontested once the bloom begins.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes (recovering her family’s stolen resilience and surviving a dangerous Turning flight) are clear and interwoven via the ticking-hour constraint. Escalation is present—entering the maze at peak inversion, then the time-limited dash to the First Orchard as gravity reasserts—but Kael rarely appears genuinely imperiled or forced into a difficult trade-off, so tension feels controlled rather than harrowing. The main turn is informational (grandmother’s revelation) rather than a high-cost moral or tactical choice. The commitment to confront the council is a meaningful narrowing of options, but we don’t yet see the counter-pressure it will provoke.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.0)
    There is coherent pressure—the mystery of the silence, the need to determine if the collapse is ongoing, and the threat that other container cities might suffer the same fate. The main tightening is Mara’s realization that the phenomenon is atmospheric and still active (the labyrinth “breathing”), which raises stakes beyond a forensic postmortem. However, Mara is not forced into a difficult choice; once she understands, her path (document, warn others) is straightforward and largely uncontested. Conflict stays mostly conceptual, with limited felt risk or sacrifice in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring the world’s capacity for wonder—is clear and scaled to the ritual. There is a credible uptick in pressure around timing the ritual to the sculptor’s first strike, and the “anti-performance” choice creates a nice conceptual inversion. However, events unfold almost frictionlessly once the moment arrives: no option seriously threatens failure, and Kael is never forced into a trade-off or visible sacrifice. As a result, tension feels contemplative rather than escalating, limiting the category’s ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding the loss and her culpability—is clear early and deepens as she moves deeper into the canyon and finally plays the flute. The main tightening is the shimmer: a partial success that forces a new, more painful knowledge about entropy and irreversibility. The cost is conceptual and emotional rather than decisional; she isn’t driven into a hard binary choice so much as into accepting a truth she cannot alter. This works for a quiet, lyric piece, but the absence of a sharper on-page trade-off keeps the pressure short of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—decode emotion’s structure before the cosmos simplifies into nothing—emerges early and is coherently pressured by the vanishing stars and by Mira’s interpersonal challenge. Escalation arrives through his risky decision to crush the unique halo fragment, trading a singular resource for knowledge, and through the immediate proof that the method works as Mira experiences his loneliness. Internal and external conflicts braid nicely: fear of his own incompleteness collides with the urgency of the cosmic deadline. The main limitation is that the conflict remains mostly intellectual and emotional, not forcing many tactical adaptations or clear foreclosed alternatives beyond the spent fragment.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—will Kessa succumb to hollowing routine or embrace her role as bearer of “wonder”?—is clear and paid off in her changed stance. Pressure escalates modestly through the farmer encounter (first deliberate pendant use) and the herbalist’s memory of Orin, which forces Kessa to confront his ongoing legacy. Cost and risk are fairly soft: the physical dangers of the ridgeway and any consequence for failed deliveries are mostly implied rather than dramatized. The story’s conflict works but never quite tightens to a point of sharp necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the world truly records emotion and whether she’ll accept that—appears early and escalates through the prism’s increasingly impossible behavior. The pressure is primarily internal, and while it coherently deepens, there’s limited sense of risk beyond her belief system and legacy; no alternate path has much pull once the magic manifests. The beat where the prism darkens and threads of “captured smoke” appear is a solid tightening that forces her conclusion. Still, the conflict remains relatively low-friction, with little serious doubt or counter-force after that turn.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—saving the daughter’s village at the cost of the mother’s life-force—is clear and present early. Escalation is modest but real: from despairing inability to act, to experimental hope with the puzzle edges, to physical toll and metaphysical sacrifice as the weave completes. Agency is focused in her recommencing the pattern and choosing to embed the bead, accepting the implied price. The pressure could be sharpened with more on-page friction or alternatives, but what’s here remains coherent and affecting.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—reviving the planet at the price of Kael’s self—is clearly signaled and escalates as each hammer blow trades another layer of memory for more planetary awakening. Pressure builds via his progressive disorientation and physical exhaustion, culminating in his collapse once the work is done. The conflict is mostly one-way (he never seriously considers stopping), so there’s limited on-page vacillation or reversal, but the tightening cost curve provides real tension under a causal lens. Resolution is credibly earned by his committed endurance rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—discovering what really happened to her mother and deciding where she belongs—is clear early and tightens as the shard pulls her into increasingly intense crossings. The encounter in the pocket universe effectively escalates conflict from abstract longing to an on-page choice between staying, returning, or learning to weave. The cost of each option is gestured at but not deeply dramatized; the story opts for a clean “choose growth” moment without a sharp sense of what she must forgo immediately. Still, the progression from negative-space absence to charged reunion is coherent and emotionally engaging.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.4)
    The conflict is primarily internal and philosophical—how to respond to unseen, exhausted guardians and the loneliness of watch-keeping—so the stakes are emotional and ethical rather than survivalist. There is a clear escalation when the lamp goes out and the final letter announces the ghost’s impending departure, narrowing Vera’s options to silence or a committed reply. However, opposition is soft; nothing really pushes back against her choice once she decides to answer, so the tension curve is more deepening than sharply tightening. The cost is present (ongoing duty and emotional vulnerability) but understated on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.2)
    The external stake—guiding ships safely through a storm—is clear but never feels in jeopardy; there is no real sense that Mara might fail or be forced into a trade-off. The prophetic trait and the hinted disaster with the salvage captain are mentioned but not brought into active conflict or decision on the page. Internally, Mara’s unease about her predictions never compels a new stance or sacrifice, so pressure remains largely static. The storm peaks in spectacle, not in moral or practical difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will see her new “magnetism” as curse or chosen responsibility—is clear but stays largely internal and contemplative. Pressure escalates mildly as she moves from private wondering to being confronted with the donor’s history and an implicit invitation to “continue the work.” There is one meaningful tightening when the proprietor reveals his link to the previous owner, but no real sense that any path is sharply foreclosed or that a painful trade-off is made. The piece succeeds as a quiet, reflective conflict, but at a top-tier level the stakes feel under-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—what the labyrinth measures and what might be missing—is clear early, and pressure accumulates as Kael uncovers the astronomer’s work and retools the sextant. However, conflict is almost entirely one-sided discovery; there is no active resistance, counterforce, or wrenching trade-off. The main “tightening” is conceptual (from quantified sorrow to a fuller spectrum of human experience), which works under an accumulative lens but never truly narrows her options. The result is satisfying but low-tension, more visionary than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—rekindling a dying realm at the cost of Elara’s existence—is clear and escalates from localized greenhouse to global communities. Pressure rises texturally (more songs, more dawns, larger scale) rather than through sharp reversals, and Elara’s agency is consistent but rarely contested; once she remembers the songs, nothing effectively resists her choice. The cost of dissolution is present but underleveraged as a live dilemma, so tension is more elegiac than gripping. Still, the story earns a meaningful tightening when dawns must leave the safety of trees to engage people.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Eleanor can find a way to remain compassionate without being destroyed by empathy—is clear and present early. Pressure tightens modestly as she descends, explores the library, and faces others arriving, with a small but meaningful pivot when she instinctively tries to hide. However, resistance is low: she encounters almost no real friction or cost beyond brief hesitation, and acceptance comes quickly once she’s told she belongs. The internal conflict could benefit from one sharper test or risk before she commits.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—resisting erasure versus drifting into complicity/forgetting—is clear but stays subtle and mostly interior. Discovery of the bread and the revelation of Demyan’s role deepen pressure conceptually, recontextualizing Mira’s own past “explanations” for disappearances, but she is never forced into a visibly difficult trade-off on the page. Her choice to continue planting with a revised understanding is meaningful yet not sharply contested by a concrete alternative or risk in the moment. Tension is present but quiet, more contemplative than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the library’s meaning can survive its physical collapse—is legible early and tightens as readings confirm imminent failure and Celeste shifts from preservation to transformation. Her decision to reweave the vows and send them down is an earned escalation that forecloses the option of trying to save the existing structure. However, conflict is mostly against entropy and time, with little friction, complication, or reversal; the story leans on conceptual pressure more than dramatized struggle, which keeps tension slightly muted.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.0)
    The primary stake (unmask and capture the betrayer’s confession) is signaled clearly and escalates into a sharper ethical conflict once Kern’s motive surfaces. The key tightening comes when Della explicitly links the caves-at-dawn lead to Kern, narrowing options to confrontation and forcing his hand toward his belt. The moral calculus—one father traded for another’s daughter—gives the ending weight, and Della’s choice to erase the recording is a genuine renunciation. Escalation is efficient but relatively linear, with only one main turn.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Kaia will cling to skepticism or open herself to this emergent, quasi-mystical reality—is clear and present early. There is a meaningful tightening when the carriers converge and the mist-walker calls out her motives, forcing a stance decision that culminates in surrendering the ring and inviting the weather. However, external pressure is mild; there’s no significant consequence to refusal dramatized on the page, so the sense of real cost or narrowed options is muted. The conflict operates more as contemplative friction than as escalating tension.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stake—whether Maya continues to suffocate her art/guilt or risks exposure and grief—is clear early and threaded through. Tension escalates from private ritual to violation (painting gone) to direct confrontation and a concrete offer of gallery space. Internal and external conflicts interweave well, but Maya’s resistance melts somewhat easily; there’s little moment where accepting feels truly dangerous beyond stated feelings of drowning. The cost is implied and real (reopening grief, risking failure), yet the pressure could tighten further on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether honest conversation (and thus Mira’s own vitality) can reclaim space in a survivalist, dishonest society—is clear and consistent. There is a solid deepening when Kade first speaks hollowly, then returns in fear and honesty, and again when they discover and choose to contribute to the Archive. However, external conflict is minimal: their journey is essentially unopposed, and the price of their honesty is mostly implied rather than tested in a hard moment. As a result, escalation feels more like steady unfolding than true tightening under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.5)
    The piece largely eschews conflict in favor of meditation; Mara’s goal to enact her symphony of truth faces no opposition, risk, or alternative path. The closest thing to escalation is the tempo shift as the ice shrinks, which deepens mood but doesn’t meaningfully narrow options or force a trade-off. As a result, tension never truly spikes, and no choice with visible cost is required at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Unit-47 can survive/function meaningfully amid catastrophic disorientation—is clear and escalates sharply once the magnetic shift freezes it mid-row. The major tightening beat is the choice to initiate a literal controlled burn of its environment to manage internal chaos, trading its long-tended roses and the box for possible psychic survival. Conflict is mostly internal, but the external disaster (pole shift) and destruction of the farm keep the pressure tangible. The cost is visible, though the ethical or emotional tension around burning everything could be made even more acute on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes—whether Iris will remain locked in flight and silence or begin to face her grief in community—are clear and appropriate to the story’s scale. Escalation is modest but present: from the intriguing locket to the eerie locked mailbox, to growing knowledge about Iris, to her raw breakdown and the mailbox opening, which forces direct confrontation with accumulated support and loss. The cost—facing the letters and re-entering a space she once inhabited alone—is real but underplayed, keeping the conflict from feeling fully sharp. Still, the emotional pressure coheres and deepens enough to justify the quiet resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Mira’s liberation—is clearly established and advanced, with a meaningful tightening in the “tonight the moon would be dark” paragraph marking a one-night-only window. Her strategy (calm defiance and encoded dance) pays off causally and thematically. However, escalation is mostly conceptual and internal; there’s little sense that anything could go wrong once she starts the final dance, and no on-page response from guards, environment, or system that forces her to adapt. As a result, tension feels more like an inevitability reaching its scheduled culmination than a contested turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming what dementia erased—is clear and affecting, and it does tighten once Maren discovers a way to make memories stay. Still, the conflict remains mostly internal and procedural, with little resistance beyond time and deciphering the system; the “scientists” never exert real antagonistic pressure. The key turn (matching the pressed flowers to a gravitational pattern) is satisfying but relatively frictionless. Without a stronger sense of risk—personal, ethical, or practical—the stakes feel poignant but low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—preventing an apocalyptic alignment by erasing a prophecy’s spread—is clearly signaled and intellectually strong. Yet the on-page conflict remains almost frictionless: she locates holders, they forget “willingly,” the apprentice’s journal is altered by a thought, and nothing meaningfully pushes back. There’s no ethical or magical cost tested in the moment beyond time passing. As a result, tension plateaus quickly and the resolution, while logical, feels too easy for the declared scale.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—the narrator’s desire to know who/what Dr. Khoury really is and whether to cross into her world—is legible and culminates in the rooftop interrogation. There is a clear tightening when the narrator abandons their “agreed upon lies” and forces the issue, leading to a relational reconfiguration. However, the pressure never quite feels dangerous or sharply costly; Dr. Khoury yields the truth without much resistance, so the conflict is more unveiling than contest. A touch more friction—fear of losing her, disbelief that risks the bond—would deepen stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—finding a way for quarantined memories (especially Anya’s) to live rather than die—is well signaled. However, conflict is remarkably low-resistance: Chen is quickly persuaded, the experiment with the flower succeeds immediately, and there is no tangible risk or opposition on the page. As a result, escalation feels more like an unveiling than a hard-won turn, with little sense of what might be lost if this attempt fails. The final decision to begin trials has weight conceptually but not much dramatized price.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.9)
    The central stake—whether she will commit “calibrated treason” by finishing the decree—is clear early, and the eventual choice is decisive and ethically fraught. Pressure escalates more through deepening contemplation and environmental resonance than through new obstacles or reversals, but it does tighten toward her commitment to finish and then to leave the thorn behind. The price—the moral compromise in service of her people and her master’s vision—is conceptually strong though mostly carried in reflection rather than dramatized conflict. This keeps the tension elegant but relatively low-temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—understanding what echo people are and what Kael’s own echoing means—develops from curiosity to belonging in a coherent way. Yet there is almost no resistance or jeopardy: the “webs of intrigue” and shadowy network never actively threaten her, and revealing the secret to allies is entirely conflict-free in summary. The revelation that echo people are guardians, not conspirators, functions as a reframe rather than a hard-earned victory. As a result, escalation is more informational than truly tense, with limited sense of risk or sacrifice at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the Katerina’s buried climate truth can be recovered and its ghost appeased—is clear, but the on-page pressure remains mostly conceptual. There is one real tightening when Maya assembles the disparate dreams into a coherent account and commits to contacting the archives. However, there’s minimal resistance or cost; no one opposes her, and nothing on the page threatens her ability to act beyond the inherent difficulty of interpretation. The result is thematically weighty but dramatically gentle, limiting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.5)
    Conflict is predominantly internal and philosophical, with low overt pressure: there is no on-page confrontation, and tomorrow’s lesson with the girl remains anticipatory. The dominant stake—whether her way of seeing hidden effort can be passed on and valued—does organically surface, and there is a mild tightening as she formulates the test with the whisk. Her renunciation of public glory in favor of quiet, continuous labor provides a real if understated cost. However, escalation is more tonal than decisional, keeping stakes contemplative rather than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—truth versus the survival of the last pure place—is established early and sharpened as Maya realizes the “curse” is a desperate act of preservation that worsened the outside world. Escalation comes via knowledge rather than action: each reconstructed document deepens the moral stakes until the choice to burn them forecloses a path. Internal and external conflicts interweave well, but since the antagonistic force (the survivors’ desire to destroy the diamond) never appears in person, the pressure remains slightly abstract. The ethical calculus is compelling, though a more tangible sense of looming outside threat could intensify the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—how Vera will handle the prophetic messages amid competing claims on her allegiance—is clear but rarely put under acute on-page pressure. Factions, soldiers, and pilgrims are reported rather than dramatized in a scene where she must choose among live, costly options. The main tightening is internal (her changing sense of purpose) rather than situational, and her decisive act at the end (switching off the transmitter) doesn’t obviously close or endanger any external path. As a result, tension accumulates conceptually but lacks a strong, felt escalation or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Maren will remain a private hoarder of moments or step into a public, bridging role—is clear and does tighten as she tests the composite of jars. Escalation is modest but present: the sense of incompleteness, then the experiment of opening multiple jars, then the crystallizing realization and the concrete plan to share at the community center. There’s little external resistance or explicit price beyond emotional exposure and leaving her safe loft, which keeps tension from reaching a higher band. Still, the internal conflict between isolation and service is credibly resolved through her final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central conflict—release all frozen suffering at the price of physical destruction versus reconfiguring that suffering into a sustained memorial—is clear and engaging. Escalation arrives through Kael’s proposal and the revelation of his partial transformation, narrowing options and clarifying the ethical cost. Maren’s tactical turn to harmonics is agency-driven and thematically apt, but the climactic beat resolves quickly and without much on-page struggle or uncertainty, which softens tension. The cost is mostly offloaded onto Kael, leaving Maren’s sacrifice more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—escaping the Directorate’s confinement—is clear and serious, and the story consistently frames choices under that pressure. However, escalation is modest: once the plan is in motion, nothing truly goes wrong or tightens the screws on the page, and the Directorate’s threat remains conceptual. Kael’s agency is strong in planning and guiding but is never tested by an on-page reversal or hard trade-off mid-escape. As a result, the piece feels more like a beautifully rendered exfiltration vignette than a fully pressurized crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stakes—exposing a preventable death vs yielding to institutional pressure—are clearly articulated early and stay coherent. Escalation comes mainly from accumulating incriminating details (fibers, water marks, camera angle) that deepen the implication of murder and Chen’s complicity. Sara’s agency is present in her choice to keep working and to emerge prepared to challenge the report, but the path there is relatively smooth, with little active resistance or concrete cost beyond implied risk. The tension is more conceptual than visceral, so the pressure never quite tightens to a sharp on-page pinch point.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus will finally act on his responsibility to Sarah—is signaled early and paid off in his commitment to return Thursday. Internal conflict (guilt vs. avoidance) is present but largely resolved without much resistance once he’s in the shop; Mrs. Chen offers no real obstacle and immediately agrees to help. There is one meaningful deepening when the song and Sarah’s childhood ritual are named, reweighting what’s at stake. Overall, tension is quiet and steady rather than meaningfully tightened by a hard trade-off or concrete risk in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are largely conceptual—understanding and predicting human yearning—and are stated rather than actively tested. The pressure does not really escalate: Fennec’s work proceeds without opposition, time limit, or moral or practical dilemma, and no new constraint emerges from the patterns she reads. Her reactions (a laugh, a quip about “we’re not ready for that conversation”) are interesting but low-cost. As a result, conflict feels static and the story lacks a genuine tightening or trade-off, even under an accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—rescuing or at least acknowledging trapped consciousnesses, including her brother’s—is clear and potent in concept. There is one meaningful deepening when Mira discovers the backups aren’t deleted but contained, which reframes the threat as cruel stasis rather than loss. However, antagonistic pressure is soft: corporate or technical danger never sharpens into a concrete obstacle or forced trade-off on the page, so her final act reads more as a determined step than a hard choice under fire. The stakes feel high intellectually but not fully embodied or escalated in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether these clans will remain locked in feud or risk a new form of cooperation—is clear and anchored early in the dispute over fishing rights. Pressure deepens as Kael chooses to reveal painful shared histories, then forces the leaders to feel them via the shard, narrowing their emotional options before they answer. Escalation is primarily internal/ethical rather than plot-driven, but the moment they ask, “Tell us how,” reflects a real shift under that pressure. The conflict remains quiet and assured rather than razor-edged, which slightly mutes urgency despite the strong conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Vera moves toward her planned death—is clear and present early, and the rescue mission provides a modest external pressure point. The key tightening comes when she confronts the appointment confirmation and chooses neither cancellation nor blind continuation but a costly suspension coupled with a concrete commitment to stay through summer. Internal and external conflicts interweave (saving a family, hearing their laughter, the grandmother’s comment) to reweight her stance. Escalation remains more atmospheric than acute, which is fitting but keeps the sense of risk and irreversibility just below truly bracing levels.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—Elena’s path between Dimitri/familial approval and Marco/forbidden mutuality—is clear from early on. Pressure coheres around whether she will honor the “practical choice” or act on what she’s been burying, with the burned letter and missed bus serving as concrete inflection points. Escalation is modest and entirely conversational; there’s little sense that she might still credibly choose Dimitri by the midpoint, which undercuts tension. Her final choice to stay the night is meaningful but arrives with relatively little resistance or visible price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the desert’s wisdom will be preserved at the cost of Maya’s partial selfhood—is clear. Pressure tightens as the prophet explicitly names sacrifice and Maya begins the “final sequence of steps,” but there’s little sense of competing options or serious doubt. Conflict is primarily internal and largely resolved before the scene starts (“I need to preserve it”), so escalation reads more as ritual completion than a true test of resolve. The cost is legible but not sharply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether private pain can become shared, transformative art—is clear, but the on-page pressure is very gentle. Escalation comes via accumulation (more townspeople, more conversation, then decisions), yet there is almost no resistance, doubt, or real risk to their participation. The “turn” from pain to possibility is somewhat assumed once the images are laid out, and costs (shame, anger, distrust) are implied rather than dramatized. This softness keeps the conflict from fully earning its thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Maren can challenge the Council’s claim that knowledge is complete—is clear but mostly abstract and deferred to “tomorrow.” On the page, conflict remains largely internal and anticipatory; pressure does not significantly tighten beyond her initial fear/resolve. There is no true reversal or forced trade-off within the scene—no new obstacle that complicates her plan. As a result, tension is steady but relatively flat, more contemplative than escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus can meaningfully “capture” the sound of aging—is clear early and tightened as the hum becomes literal and the moral/philosophical price of recording it comes into focus. The driftwood trail and Marcus’s amnesia generate a low-key but coherent pressure to find the location before his purpose disappears. The core escalation is internal: recognition that recording would kill the living quality of the sound, forcing a choice between possession and presence. The conflict remains mostly contemplative; a bit more on-page friction or risk in reaching the arch could push the stakes from strong to gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—getting the clock functional before the transit—is clearly signaled, and the increasing tremors provide tangible external pressure. The act of restructuring the mechanism is a meaningful tightening that fuses external and internal stakes. However, the repair faces no real resistance or risk of failure, and the thematic reorientation (“accepting” instability) is granted without a hard on-page test or sacrifice, keeping the sense of cost relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—reconciliation before death—is clear early, and the three-to-four-week prognosis plus Maya’s repeated, escalating calls to Linda provide a credible tightening. The decisive turn is Linda’s “I’ll come tomorrow,” followed by the on-page confrontation; that’s a genuine narrowing of options. However, Linda’s resistance happens mostly off-page, and the reunion itself proceeds with relatively little friction or backsliding, keeping the conflict slightly idealized. Costs (years of estrangement, emotional vulnerability, imminent death) are implicit but not heavily tested in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—remain an incomplete shadow-self or risk merging with the original at noon—is clear and meaningful, with the sealed awakenings turning her intellectual question about shadows into an existential conflict. The major tightening arrives when she recognizes herself and Kelm in stasis, which redefines the cost of doing nothing. However, the pressure remains largely contemplative; the “hours to decide” and lack of on-page testing of either option keep tension from fully sharpening into a felt crunch. Still, the final poise before dawn effectively narrows her emotional options and signals a real trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—can the wrong child be sent home and the real Thomas returned—is legible early once the changeling explains the displacement. Pressure escalates from unsettling discovery to the explicit question “Can I go home?” and the risk of attempting to rewrite reality, but the conflict remains relatively smooth, with little resistance or visible potential for failure once Maren agrees. Maren’s agency is central: choosing to believe, to use her bone-setting skills in a new register, and to let this child go. The lack of obstacles or trade-offs during the ritual keeps this at strong-but-not-searing tension.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Mara can live with and transform her grief—is legible and consistent. Pressure “escalates” mainly through deepening: from generic painful memories to the specific recalling of her daughter’s laughter tied to the new clear shard. There is one meaningful choice beat (declaring the shard ready and placing it in a privileged position), but alternatives and risks are implied rather than sharply dramatized. The lack of sharper trade-offs or visible loss keeps tension relatively gentle throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central tension—whether Mira will respond with hatred or a transformed form of witness to the woman who helped destroy her life—is clear and quietly present from the executive’s first line. Pressure escalates through the pendant gesture and culminates in the direct question, “How do you not hate me?”, which crisply surfaces the moral conflict. The resolution (Mira’s articulated stance and continued tending of the garden) feels earned, but the conflict remains mostly internal and conversational, with limited on-page friction or risk beyond discomfort. A slightly sharper moment of potential rupture (e.g., Mira nearly withdrawing the pendant or voicing anger) would heighten the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether and how she can “end” the story and her grief—is clear from the opening and tightens when a living swimmer appears, forcing her to confront the river as present danger instead of abstract symbol. The conversation with the swimmer constitutes the main turn, reframing the ending from discovery to solemnization, and it leads directly to the decisive act of starting the final chapter. Stakes remain primarily internal and quiet, with limited on-page friction beyond that encounter, which keeps the pressure just below peak literary-competition intensity. Nonetheless, the emotional trade-off—no miracle recovery, only a charged way forward—is legible and affecting.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Maera can re-open the channel between land and people during this last aligned dawn—is clear, and there is some temporal pressure as the harvest moon fades. Conflict is largely situational and internal; there is no active antagonist or substantive obstacle beyond time and the difficulty of recovering forgotten songs. Escalation is modest: the songs come easier and the humming deepens, but she never seriously risks failure or faces a painful trade-off. The resolution is therefore satisfying but low in felt cost or tension.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—can she meaningfully reconnect with or “follow” her daughter’s extinguished heartbeat—is present and coherent throughout. Pressure escalates as the pattern reveals the pulsar entanglement and the map’s existence, culminating in the choice to burn the only physical guide and rely on memory. However, the conflict remains mostly internal and contemplative, with relatively little sense of risk of failure or opposition beyond the inherent fragility of the ritual. The emotional stakes are strong, but the escalation feels like a smooth ramp rather than a sharply narrowing corridor.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central pressure is gentle and largely intellectual: understanding the cavern and then deciding what to do with that knowledge. There is a credible tightening—from initial curiosity to the moment the cavern sings, to the choice to seal it again—but little resistance, danger, or real-world consequence. The final renunciation (no publication, resealing the doors) does foreclose a path, yet the cost is mostly conceptual and underplayed. At a high-literary bar, the lack of sharper opposition or trade-off keeps escalation from fully satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—her relationship to an endless, trapping vocation—is clear, and pressure deepens as she moves from a single familial burden to the grotto-spanning tapestry that makes quitting existentially dangerous. Escalation is conceptual rather than dramatic, culminating in the realization that collecting all weights would unweave existence, which reweights her task. Still, conflict remains mostly inward and meditative; there’s little sense of competing options tested on the page beyond continue vs unmake the world. The cost of her choice is implied more than viscerally dramatized, keeping tension strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—how Mira will live with Viktor’s absence—is clear, and the story deepens that question through the decision to carve laughter rather than a safer or flatter moment. Pressure is internal and low-key, accumulating rather than spiking; the main tightening is the movement from intention (“the blank before her now would become his laugh”) to the finished figure joining the “gallery of gestures.” The cost is the ongoing demand of love “even after death” and the acceptance that she must keep carving rather than retreating into static mourning. It’s strong quiet conflict, though escalation is more steady accretion than a sharply felt turn.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant conflict—Kera’s avoidance of her own abandoned ambitions versus the pain of re-engaging them—is clear and builds toward the contact with her ghost and the decision to attempt smaller gardens. The appearance of the camera wheel and the ghost’s subtle shift from accusation to invitation serve as the main tightening/deepening. Stakes remain mostly internal, but the text does a good job making that feel consequential (“what we lost,” “time she had left”). Escalation is more a deepening of emotional pressure than a sharp narrowing of options, which slightly blunts intensity at an elite-venue bar.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether this dead terminal can be transformed into a sustaining community space—is clear and coherently pursued. Pressure does deepen as Maya moves from solitary exploration to collective resurrection, with permits and logistics implied as hurdles. However, conflict remains mostly offstage and gentle; there are no sharp reversals, hard trade-offs, or concrete losses on the page. The resolution feels earned but low-intensity, keeping escalation in the solid rather than standout range.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Maren will reopen and redefine her relationship with music—is legible and present from early on. The main tightening occurs when she actually lifts the violin and plays, confronting the fear that drove her away; the cost is the acceptance that the old virtuoso dream is gone. However, there’s little in-scene friction once she commits; no fresh obstacle or reversal challenges that decision beyond remembered shame. As a result, the piece reads as a steady deepening rather than a sharply escalating conflict, effective but not maximally pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus will keep chasing seductive legend or confront uncomfortable truth—is clear and does escalate as he uncovers Dessen’s tragedy and the buried maps. The key tightening is his choice to descend into the hold and document evidence, foreclosing the path of simply walking away from a debunked myth. However, conflict is mostly investigative and internal; there is little direct, on-page resistance or concrete risk beyond implication. As a result, the pressure feels steady and meaningful but never truly sharp or dangerous.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—recovering a lost germination method to preserve ancient seeds—is clear and meaningful, but the on-page conflict is almost entirely frictionless. Maren faces no real opposition: the rope yields its secret, the fulgurite is already in her pocket, and no clock or antagonist presses her. The one tightening beat is the translation of the knot sequence into a concrete method, which deepens the situation but doesn’t narrow her options or force a trade-off. As a result, tension is gentle and steady rather than escalating; this works for a lyric piece but doesn’t meet high-conflict standards for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    The primary conflict is internal and relational: Thomas’s identification with loss versus Marina’s insistence on what remains. Pressure escalates through Marina’s increasingly specific reframing—moving from generalized stories of others to intimate, embodied descriptions of Thomas’s own hands. The decisive change (thread as compass, not relic) is clear, but the sense of jeopardy or risk remains relatively gentle; there’s little resistance or complication once she begins her method. The stakes are emotionally real yet never feel in danger of failing, which slightly blunts tension.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—recovering some form of living beauty in a mechanized, sterile world—is clear early and coherently tightened by the forbidden nature of the prince’s science and his sacrifice of status. Escalation is primarily accumulative (weeks of obsessive work, deepening commitment, physical neglect) rather than built around explicit reversals or external obstacles. The final conflict beat with the father provides a satisfying, quiet crystallization rather than a clash, with the prince choosing to name his creation “something flawed” yet defending its dreaming as value. Stakes feel intimate and real, though an added tangible risk (political or personal) on the page could have raised the pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Maya can transform inherited destruction into compassionate healing, here focused on Marcus—is clear but plays out in a low-pressure, almost serenely assured way. The main deepening comes when Marcus admits remembering his mother “hurts” and Maya reframes his scars and coin as a graft; his subsequent smile is the emotional mini-climax. There’s little real resistance or doubt on the page, so options don’t substantially narrow and no hard trade-off is forced. The result feels more like an elegant meditation than a scene of escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—restoring the city’s severed emotions—is established early and paid off with the box’s opening and the fountains’ revival. Escalation is mostly accumulative rather than adversarial: shard by shard, fountain by fountain, culminating in the Sidereal Patience key and time-lock release. The cost—Mara’s glow and role ending—is present but quiet; she doesn’t face much resistance or a hard trade-off on the page, which slightly softens pressure. Still, her deliberate, patience-requiring work to bridge a frozen instant reads as genuine agency driving resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the Keeper continues to offer a gift that history says will be misused—is clear, but conflict is mostly philosophical and low-torque. The gear’s calculations and the selection of six civilizations form a mild tightening, yet there is no true reversal or raised cost in this particular cycle. The Keeper’s stance (continue despite inevitable disappointment) appears largely pre-decided, so the escalation reads as reiteration rather than a fresh test of resolve. Tension exists, but it never fully sharpens into a pressured dilemma on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elena will remain a carver of isolated monuments or evolve into a maker of connective markers—is clear and thematically coherent. Pressure escalates in a quiet, internal way: her dissatisfaction, Thomas’s critique, and the mental retracing of past work gradually force her to adopt a new practice. However, the conflict remains largely contemplative, with little on-page friction or hard trade-offs beyond the conceptual cost of admitting past inadequacy, so the sense of risk and sacrifice stays relatively gentle. The final commitment to “carve differently now” is earned but not heavily contested.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.8)
    The core stake—whether Mara will continue to bear and transform communal grief—is present, but pressure remains low and largely unchallenged. There is one deepening when the ritual’s history and purpose (“incremental absolution”) are revealed, but no meaningful reversal or forced trade-off in the present; she never appears at risk of refusing or failing. The future burning of the handle is a quiet renunciation with conceptual cost, yet it isn’t dramatized as a difficult choice. As a result, tension feels more like sustained mood than escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Castellan’s cryptic bequest will yield meaningful, legible truth—is clear, and the decoding of the tapestry provides a concrete investigative task. There is one meaningful escalation as the apparent “fraying” is revealed as code leading to a literal hidden cache. However, the tension remains quiet and largely intellectual; Mira is never really cornered or forced into a difficult trade-off, and there’s little sense of time, social, or emotional risk pressing on her choices in the moment. The result is elegant but low-pressure conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.5)
    The declared stakes—colony survival under dwindling resources—are high, and the three futures are structurally framed as divergent paths with differing costs. However, the conflict remains largely abstract: there is no serious on-page doubt, pushback, or error on Maren’s part; each option is laid out almost smoothly, with little sense that she’s at risk of choosing badly or being unable to see a path. The key tightening (discovering/designing the Thermal Tapestry) is intellectually elegant but doesn’t feel wrestled from resistance or sacrifice, so tension never quite sharpens into felt pressure. The resolution is earned conceptually but not dramatically.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Maren can continue smuggling stories under an oppressive regime—appears early and stays coherent, with the patrol’s approach offering a satisfying mid-scene tightening. The moment of boots on cobblestones, the leaking glow under her palm, and the uncertainty as the patrol passes all work as genuine pressure rather than decorative tension. However, after that reversal, the conflict returns to a relatively stable pattern of quiet defiance; no new price or narrowed option emerges at the end beyond reaffirmation of her ongoing risk. The result is strong but somewhat under-escalated for top-tier conflict scores.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central pressure—Cassius dying as Mira races to complete and then destroy/recreate his portrait—is coherent and escalates via the slowing chair and dimming light. Internal stakes (truth vs omission, impermanence vs preservation) mesh credibly with the situational clock. Her agency at the end (to continue the lie and build his mask) is consistent and carries a felt moral cost. The conflict remains mostly interior and could be sharpened by a more explicit moment where she nearly confesses or considers abandoning the hidden gallery, but as-is it still reads as meaningfully tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—truth preservation versus sanctioned forgetting—is signaled early and paid off in his decision to hide evidence for future readers. The patrol’s pass overhead provides a modest but real tightening of external pressure, and his choice to risk long-term subversion over compliance crystallizes his stance. However, the conflict remains largely conceptual; no significant option is forcibly closed on the page, and the personal cost of his choice, while implied, is not strongly dramatized in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.8)
    The primary stake—whether these divided youths can begin to unlearn inherited hatred through shared music—is clear, but conflict is gentle and often handled in summary. The notable tightening beats (Thomas joining Aisha’s melody; some students quitting; others bringing siblings) register more as milestones than as pressured choices with felt on-page risk. Mira’s method is never seriously challenged in scene, and we don’t witness a concrete rupture or confrontation that forces adaptation. As a result, tension accumulates thematically rather than viscerally, limiting escalation under a demanding standard.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—defying an oppressive Council by regrowing forbidden knowledge—is clear, and the once-in-a-lifetime alignment provides a natural clock. Escalation is present but modest: the primary “tightening” is the moons approaching and then reaching their apex, catalyzing accelerated growth. Internal and external conflicts (danger vs. hope, pruning cruel memories vs. nurturing resilient ones) are conceptually rich but not strongly dramatized as real-time dilemma; Mara rarely appears at risk of backing down, and no concrete obstacle pushes back.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether pollination (and by implication, agriculture) can be restored—is clear, and the blackout plus failed drones create a credible, if mostly off-stage, pressure. On the page, conflict feels relatively low-friction: the beekeeper offers the riddle without resistance, Mira solves it without real failure, and the engineer accepts and acts on her insight immediately. There is one meaningful tightening when Mira chooses to close the toll gate and climb the tower, but no opposing force or sacrifice that genuinely narrows her options. The result is a thoughtful but gentle arc in which stakes are more told than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.4)
    The central stake is largely conceptual: Maya’s desire to understand the house’s aliveness and the meaning of the displacements. There is some escalation (from eerie observations to entering the house to decoding the pattern and intervening), but little real pressure or opposition; nothing seriously resists her or makes her choice costly. The story reads more as a contemplative revelation than a conflict that tightens and forecloses options. As a result, while the piece is satisfying, the pressure curve is relatively flat.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central conflict—whether the woman will accept and bear witness to a morally fraught truth—is clearly established and deepens as she learns the drowning was deliberate and partially voluntary. Stakes (family legacy, cultural memory, the ethics of sacrifice) are significant, if mostly conceptual. Escalation comes through successive revelations (plague, evacuation, volunteering, statue-transformation) culminating in her opening the ampoule and deciding to tell. The conflict stays largely internal and is resolved without visible sacrifice beyond discomfort, which softens the felt price of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—proving the staircase as perpetual motion to redeem a missed intellectual/life opportunity—is signaled clearly and deepens into the realization that she herself is the system’s circulating energy. The main tightening is the “rupture” moment when her accumulated proofs flip from potential escape plan to proof of perfect imprisonment. However, conflict remains primarily conceptual and internal; there’s minimal escalation in concrete risk or viable alternative paths closed off on the page. The final choice to keep climbing is resonant but could land harder if a more active counter-impulse (despair, sabotage, stillness) were dramatized and then renounced.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—can she make the case, to herself, that small urban kindnesses are real and preservable—is clear but remains largely internal and low-conflict. Escalation occurs when the moonlit brush induces the visionary sequence, deepening her commitment and leading to the completion of the painting and the plan to seek the anonymous benefactor. There is cost (sleep deprivation, isolation, emotional vulnerability), yet no sharp dilemma or external pressure forcing trade-offs in the moment. For a quiet, lyric piece, the pressure is coherent, but a slightly more acute on-page test of her belief would sharpen stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether culture and meaning can persist after catastrophic displacement—is clear, but on the page the conflict is mostly atmospheric rather than sharply dramatized. The main tightening comes when the violinist’s grief “thaws” and Celeste seizes the chance to enlist her in teaching, shifting her from passive refugee to active custodian. That’s a meaningful emotional turn but not a high-pressure choice with palpable alternatives or cost. The piece functions more as an elegiac tableau of endurance than as a scene of escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Silas will risk activating a device that can reconfigure fate—is clear, but on-page opposition is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized. His work on the yoyo proceeds with little resistance or setback; the pressure doesn’t meaningfully tighten until the balcony throw, and even there, doubt or fear is only briefly gestured at. The final choice to snap his wrist back and accept his life’s unmaking is potent but would carry more weight if an alternate path (safety, refusal) were more palpably alive. Escalation is present but relatively smooth and low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.4)
    The core stake—whether Vera will continue to fear her erasure or embrace dissolution as transformation—is clear early and revisited consistently. Pressure does tighten via the advisor’s prompting, the dream dictionary’s paradox, and her decision to “unbosom” herself to the mirrors, which culminates in a reconfigured self-concept. However, resistance is relatively low: once the new framing is presented, she moves toward acceptance with little relapse or competing goal. The conflict remains mostly interior and meditative, effective but not maximally tense.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stake—whether Kael can prevent the massive, rule-breaking tide from destroying the orchard—is clear and present early. Pressure escalates from uncanny clouds to the audible approach of the tide to three hours of continuous, high-risk performance where failure would be catastrophic. Her agency is direct and sustained, but there’s no true reversal or moment where an option closes and another is painfully chosen; the conflict is essentially a single extended test of endurance and skill. The cost is credible (exhaustion, ongoing vigilance) but remains relatively soft for an otherwise high-stakes scenario.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—uncovering what happened to the expedition and what the watchers intend for Chelone—is legible early and does deepen as Mira discovers the city is livestock. Escalation is mostly conceptual: each new pattern revelation raises the implied cost of ignorance and complicity. However, on-page resistance is minimal: no environmental hazard, no confrontation with the council, and no real risk that she will fail to reach the depths or return. The final act of playing the whistles is a meaningful choice, but the costs and alternatives are not sharply dramatized, so pressure never quite tightens to the level the premise invites.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.2)
    The main conflict—truth versus institutional suppression—is clear, and the stakes (her career versus exposing the pattern of noble lies) are legible. There is a meaningful tightening when she recognizes the parallel with her own censorship and moves from observation to a costly decision. However, the pressure is mostly internal and conceptual; there’s little sense of imminent danger or counterforce in the present scene, which softens escalation. The trade-off is real but dramatized more as a foregone acceptance than an agonized choice tested in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Garrett can meaningfully push back against oblivion by embedding memory in the repairs—is clear but remains mostly internal and low-intensity. Pressure accumulates more via lyrical deepening than through explicit obstacles or narrowed options. There’s one primary tightening when he finds a fissure suitable for his offering and commits his personal history to the note, but nothing on the page seriously threatens his ability to act. As a result, tension is gentle and steady rather than escalating in a way that would fully charge the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—exposing the truth behind the city’s sinking—is signaled early and coheres throughout, with a clear deepening when Marcus finds the portfolio and the Preservation Society stamp. The blackout and approaching footsteps provide one credible escalation that forces him to photograph selectively and move stealthily. However, antagonistic pressure (security, institutional consequences) remains abstract and never forces a painful trade-off beyond triaging which pages to shoot, so the cost of his commitment is mostly deferred. The result is tense and engaging, but not yet braced against a hard on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—how to survive the loss of her daughter’s shadow/body—is clearly established and coherently pursued through craft. Pressure escalates texturally as the number and emotional range of recorded dreams increase, culminating in the high-cost choice to embed her most exposing dream in the diamond crane. The final stance (to live among transformed grief rather than seeking erasure) is an earned renunciation of any fantasy of cure. What keeps this just below the very top is the relatively gentle, non-reversing escalation; the pressure deepens but never sharply constricts options.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Amal will trigger or ride out a catastrophic “awakening” of killed futures—is clear and thematically potent, and pressure does increase as she identifies a massive concentration and runs critical-mass calculations. Her decision to proceed despite warnings about paradox gives the piece its main tightening beat. However, there is little countervailing force beyond her own abstraction-level caution; no external obstacle or concrete alternative path is tested on the page. The result is a rich conceptual tension with somewhat soft dramatic escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake is largely internal and existential—whether Mara can locate a sense of belonging or meaning in her current work—and that stake is clearly signaled. Pressure does deepen as the chip is revealed to hold coordinates and then a “harmonic signature,” but the escalation is more contemplative than fraught; there’s no serious risk that she’ll refuse or fail, which keeps tension modest. The main turn is the recognition that this is a network and an invitation, leading to the decision to send a return signal. That’s satisfying but low in visible price, so the conflict reads as quiet rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stake—whether Maren will continue the lie or face the damage of telling the truth—is legible and present early. Pressure deepens as she decodes the carvings and grasps the grandfather’s remorse, forcing a reinterpretation of Iris’s choice and her own complicity. The final turn (“Tell me everything”) is a genuine narrowing of options and Maren’s acceptance has clear emotional cost. However, the conflict plays out in relatively calm tones; the escalation is more intellectual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes—war vs. reconciliation and the negotiators’ professional survival—are clearly established and emotionally grounded. Pressure escalates when the governments demand terms “tonight,” and tightens further with the revelation of mutual incomplete truths. The key turn is their joint decision to delay appeasing their governments in favor of synchronizing hidden histories, foreclosing the path of quick, face-saving agreement. The stakes remain mostly conceptual rather than viscerally embodied, which keeps the tension just shy of maximal impact.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether she’ll remain in self-protective stasis or risk aligning with her true desire by going to James—is clear early and coherently developed. Pressure escalates via the voicemail reply, the attendant’s warning about the current, and the internal “backlash of regrets,” culminating in her decision to launch and commit. The cost is emotional and life-directional rather than physically perilous but feels scaled appropriately for the length. The path to her choice is a bit smooth; we don’t see much last-minute wobble, which keeps the tension just shy of truly gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Maya will persist in numb self-erasure or choose the harder route toward earned empathy and restitution—is clear and escalates from curiosity to a morally freighted decision at the lake. The journey and encounter with Marcus meaningfully narrow her options by revealing a future path and its dependence on present choice. However, tension is more contemplative than gripping; the opposition is essentially her own resistance, and the risk of refusing the call is told through Marcus’s exposition rather than dramatized pressure. The conflict works, but feels slightly cushioned for such dark material.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central conflict—Mira’s desire to reach her brother versus her resistance to metamorphosis—is clear and escalates as her body begins to blur. Her decision to “let go” is an earned peak choice that forecloses staying fully human-only. The emotional and existential stakes are strong, though the path to success feels somewhat uncontested, with little sense that the attempt might fail or exact a sharper immediate price.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—reconciling motherhood with the time she’s sacrificed—is clear and sharpened by concrete images like the cracked saucer and the hand-gap. Pressure escalates as the ritual assembles and culminates in the vision of pooled time, forcing Nadia to accept that recovery is impossible and redirect toward future birthdays. However, the conflict remains largely internal and somewhat pre-resolved (she already regrets and has left her child to come here), so we never see her confronted with a truly wrenching new trade-off on the page. The cost is conceptual and emotional rather than dramatized through a contested choice.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether compassion and shadow work can unlock the sealed dimension and reclaim humanity—remains coherent and sharp. Pressure escalates through Ren’s decision to start stitching, the rippling photographs, and the moment of resistance at the membrane. However, the opposition (the dimension’s “good reason” for being locked) is more stated than felt, and the final acceptance (“The lock recognized them”) arrives with limited on-page testing of Ren’s resolve. The ethical tension around possibly undoing a necessary seal could be pressed harder to elevate the sense of risk and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.3)
    The central stake—whether Maris will accept a new understanding of transformation and her own role in it—is clear but emotionally low-pressure. The main escalation comes from the prophecy being named and the alignment reaching its apex, pushing her toward releasing the bugs and reinterpreting her losses. However, she faces little real resistance or dilemma; once the role is suggested, her shift feels almost frictionless. This keeps the conflict interesting but not gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stakes—preventing the Council from sealing the lower levels and entrenching a revolution—are strong in concept, and the blackout is a promising inciting escalation. Yet conflict on the page is surprisingly low: Captain Voss’s brief pass is the only direct threat, easily evaded, and Mira never has to adapt tactics under real duress. The piece feels like a calm status update on a successful conspiracy night rather than a scene where pressure materially tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.6)
    The primary conflict—decoding the patterns in time to honor her promise and avert/prepare for an implied global fate—is clear and threads through the scene. Pressure escalates via the curse’s increasingly chaotic futures and the risk of losing the rocks, culminating in the pattern’s activation and the revelation that the real task is harnessing what comes next. The cost is more conceptual than visceral: she inherits a large responsibility but pays little immediate, concrete price in the scene beyond continued isolation and urgency. A more sharply dramatized on-page risk or sacrifice in the climax would deepen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central pressure—whether she will take on the lethal truth contained in the envelope and how she’ll respond to systemic censorship—is clear and builds. The envelope’s delayed opening is a genuine tightening, and the revelation of “scars they will kill to keep hidden” escalates the stakes conceptually. Her choice to proceed (“She would develop every negative, write every poem, map every scar”) crystallizes her stance, but the price remains largely projected into the future rather than felt in the scene. As a result, tension is strong but quiet, with more thematic than visceral bite.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    The core conflict—intellectual freedom versus enforced order—is clearly articulated and embodied in the duel and negotiation. There is one main escalation when Theodora reveals the scope and mechanism of the underground scholarium, forcing Venn to reconsider pure suppression. However, the physical danger of the duel feels muted and the political stakes, while declared as high, never face a concrete on-page test or visible price beyond debate. The resolution is earned but relatively low-sweat for the level of stakes invoked.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes are quiet—Will Solomon keep moving or root himself? Can these two men coax new life from a dead institution?—but they are present and thematically integrated. Escalation is mostly accumulative: work through the night, then the charged act of emptying the tin and deciding not to shed his name. There’s limited overt resistance or reversal; nothing on the page significantly threatens failure, so pressure never quite tightens to a sharp edge. The cost of his choice is implied rather than deeply dramatized, keeping this in the strong-but-not-riveting band.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus remains an invisible background musician or claims authorship of his own life and art—is clear early and coherently tightened by the discovery of the reel and the time-bounded refuge. The horizon-to-night constraint and the synchronized islands provide one meaningful escalation, forcing him to fully commit to his own composition. However, the conflict remains largely internal and relatively unresisted; there’s little pushback or real temptation to remain in refuge or revert that would heighten visible cost. The result is emotionally effective but somewhat gentle in pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving the specificity of cultural memory—is clear early and tracks to the end, and the gray mist consuming details provides a credible antagonistic force. Escalation comes mainly through knowledge deepening (seeing exactly how memories are being flattened) rather than through new obstacles or reversals. Mira’s central act (planting the seed) is necessary but not genuinely contested on the page; doubt is emotional rather than strategic, so no option is meaningfully foreclosed. As a result, tension is steady and thoughtful rather than grippingly sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Marisol will stay locked in grievance or move toward a costly acceptance—is legible from early on. Pressure deepens as she decodes the lace and reinterprets the memory of turning away, and the final forgiveness does foreclose a prior, easier stance. Still, the conflict unfolds smoothly once the lace appears; resistance and competing impulses in the late beat feel underplayed, softening escalation. The stakes remain intimate and mostly internal, appropriate to length but short of truly sharp tension.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are internal but deeply felt; the tension between the "skeletal" greenhouse and the memory of her mother's control creates a clear pressure cooker. Escalation is subtle and textural, tracking the shift from destruction to unexpected ecology. The cost—the loss of her orderly worldview—is palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.9)
    Pressure escalates cleanly from an abstract search for peace to a concrete realization of criminal intent. The stakes heighten effectively from personal healing to legal justice, and the cost—losing the illusion of special providence for the hard truth of being "infrastructure"—is palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story lacks significant tension or a meaningful tightening of stakes. The test proceeds without obstacle or risk of failure, and the emotional payoff ("It's perfect") arrives without a visible cost paid by the protagonist in the scene. The conflict is purely retrospective rather than active.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clear and escalation (intensifying signals) works well to force the decision. The protagonist's agency drives the outcome, though the obstacle of the "maddening" geometry dissolves a bit too easily into understanding, slightly softening the felt cost at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake (community dispersal) dissolves too easily upon Mira's revelation. The conflict lacks a "felt cost" in the climax; the opposition (young Sasha) folds immediately, removing the tension necessary for a compelling resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.8)
    Dramatic tension is minimal; the central problem is identified and resolved in minutes with only a token moment of difficulty ("failing at first") that is instantly overcome. The stakes remain theoretical, as there is no credible risk of failure or negative consequence on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    Escalation is present—the condition worsens, the fragment amplifies it—but the conflict is almost entirely internal and intellectual. Because Miriam moves willingly toward her dissolution without encountering external obstacles or significant internal doubt, the narrative tension relies heavily on the concept rather than dramatic friction.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.0)
    Tension escalates effectively with the approaching boots, but the climax dissolves rather than peaks; the protagonist’s high-stakes gamble (revealing the seeds) meets no resistance, resulting in a resolution that feels unearned by immediate struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are clearly articulated through the specific difficulty of the "trust breaking" sound, though the escalation is largely internal and artistic rather than external. The physical cost of the climax—imprinting her thumb into hot silver—effectively dramatizes the sacrifice required to solve the puzzle.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.5)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no external opposition, and the "danger" signal in the flowers acts as a loose thread rather than a source of pressure. The resolution comes as a gift of knowledge rather than a hard-won victory born from high-stakes agency.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.9)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the environment startles Mira but does not threaten her work, and the "we were wrong" note is dismissed immediately without struggle. The story lacks a meaningful tightening of stakes; the internal and external pressures remain static, resulting in a low-tension atmospheric piece rather than a dramatic narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.9)
    Tension builds effectively with Carson's entrance but collapses when the protagonist reveals safety is already assured ("They're outside now"). The stakes are declared but not tested in the scene; the conflict is resolved by external forces rather than a high-cost trade-off by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story lacks active conflict or escalation; the dominant stake (understanding the silence) faces no opposition other than the passage of time. Maren encounters no obstacles that force a change in tactics or a sacrifice of resources; she merely waits and records, making the climax feel like a foregone conclusion rather than a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under the Accumulative lens, pressure is handled well through the intensification of the routine (the violin's appearance). While the stakes are purely internal/existential, the "terrible loop" provides sufficient pressure to make the resolution feel earned. The cost is subtle—the eternal endurance of the loop—but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.3)
    The stakes are declared, but the conflict suffers from low resistance; the antagonist (Viktor) has already capitulated before the protagonist intervenes. This removes the pressure of a difficult choice or trade-off for Mira, resulting in a resolution that feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.8)
    The protagonist achieves total vindication without paying a visible on-page cost; the sacrifice of her reputation occurred in backstory. The lack of a difficult trade-off or lasting consequence at the climax significantly lowers the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=3.8)
    Pressure is introduced when Voss enters ("What are you doing?"), but it evaporates instantly when he smiles and accepts the coffee; there is no sustained opposition. The stakes are theoretical (physics) rather than dramatic; Renna faces no risk of failure, punishment, or ridicule in the scene. The "impossible" discovery is validated without a test of the protagonist's commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=3.0)
    Stakes are virtually non-existent; Celeste faces no external physical threat (the building is condemned but stable) and no internal dilemma. The narrative is a linear scavenger hunt where the puzzle solves itself without pressure or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    The stakes are clear: accuracy and professional reputation are wagered against the need to capture the "marginal" truth that killed Eva. The interaction with Chen sharpens this trade-off ("More false positives"), confirming Mira accepts the price of her new agency.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.2)
    Escalation is low; the protagonist observes the climax rather than precipitating it. The resolution is delivered to her via the radio transmission, meaning she faces no active opposition or dilemma that forces a high-stakes trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.4)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the protagonist encounters no obstacles, opposition, or difficult trade-offs. The "tightening" is merely a vision that confirms what she already believes, and her acceptance of it comes without visible struggle or cost, resulting in a narrative with negligible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=3.9)
    The story lacks genuine escalation; the obstacle (Diane's distance) is established but never tested against the protagonist's tactics, as Diane succumbs to the moment almost immediately. There is no active opposition or rising pressure that forces Maya to adapt or risk failure, resulting in a low-stakes progression.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.2)
    Active conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no opposition, time pressure, or resource scarcity in the present moment. The "tightening" is purely intellectual, lacking the visceral stakes or narrowing of options required for higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes are primarily retrospective and conceptual; while the deepening of understanding is clear, the scene lacks immediate pressure or a forced tactical choice. The antagonist acts more as a messenger than a source of active resistance, resulting in a low-voltage conflict that informs rather than tests the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the stakes are high (a soul), the conflict is largely unilateral; the entity is passive, serving merely as a recipient for Micah's rhetoric. The escalation is linear and controlled by the protagonist, lacking a moment where his plan faces genuine risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.1)
    Pressure is consistent under the Situational lens; the "racing the sun" constraint provides a clear ticking clock that escalates the pacing. The stakes remain relatively low and internal—a procedural struggle against fatigue rather than a jeopardy of consequence—but the tightening is legible and functional for the scope.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are clear (loss of self/hope), but the escalation is largely summary of past timelines rather than immediate pressure in the scene. The conflict resolves too neatly when the tablet confirms her epiphany, dampening the felt cost of the renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=4.5)
    There is little to no escalation or active resistance; Mira attempts a solution found in journals, and it works immediately on the first try without complication or cost. The conflict is resolved linearly, lacking the push-pull of genuine dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.7)
    The conflict is clear and the stakes (evacuation of the zone) are significant. The "lateral" move is a satisfying intellectual resolution, though the cost remains largely abstract/potential (future labor and risk) rather than immediately paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are primarily internal but effectively pressured by the external "ticking clock" of the bloom. The climax—comparing the scents—forces a clear crystallization of stance, though the external conflict is quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.7)
    The stakes are high conceptually (the nature of reality) but low in immediate dramatic tension; the conflict is resolved through agreement rather than struggle. The pressure is coherent, but the "impossible choice" is discussed as a theoretical construct rather than a forced trade-off with visible, painful costs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.2)
    Pressure is low throughout; the "chronic hush" serves as a passive condition rather than an active opposing force. The protagonist faces no obstacles, risks, or setbacks during the ritual, resulting in a climax that feels like a foregone conclusion rather than a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are clear and the cost—authenticity for comfort—is legible throughout. The ending deepens the stakes by revealing Maren's personal price (the "carving away"), elevating the interaction beyond a simple transaction and satisfying the accumulation of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.2)
    Escalation is virtually absent; the protagonist encounters no opposition, pays no felt cost, and faces no difficult trade-offs. The arc is a flat line of agreement that mistakes a shared sentiment for dramatic conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is minimal as the community offers no resistance to the outsider's proposal, and the "desperate hope" resolves without a moment where failure seems possible. The stakes of belonging are declared but never tested by a significant reversal, antagonist, or threatened loss.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.9)
    The stakes are clear and the ticking clock of the giant's nap provides effective structural pressure. The escalation to the climax is logical, requiring a resource trade-off (borrowed seconds for freed sounds). However, the cost of this trade feels somewhat low-pain; because she planned to return the seconds anyway, spending them freely feels like a "fair exchange" rather than a painful sacrifice, capping the emotional resonance of the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.9)
    Conflict is negligible; there is no opposition to Marius's goal, and the stakes remain abstractly philosophical without a visceral on-page cost or risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clear: the safety of invisibility versus the risk of connection. The cost is acknowledged—Maren loses her sanctuary to be seen—but the ease with which she abandons her eleven-month survival strategy lowers the felt pressure slightly. The external chaos provides a functional backdrop for the internal decision.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.7)
    The central stake (control vs. nature) is clear, but the antagonist—his own obsession—capitulates too easily without a desperate counter-move. The "cost" of his transformation is relegated to summary ("felt like falling") rather than being tested in a high-pressure scene beat.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are primarily internal (sanity, meaning) but are effectively externalized through the encroaching tide and the physical labor of the dig. The "meaning" stakes are resolved through the exchange, while the physical threat of the tide adds necessary urgency to the final beat, preventing the story from becoming too static.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.8)
    Pressure escalates clearly as the shadows defy physics, but the resolution dissolves tension rather than paying it off with a visible cost. The protagonist's surrender to the phenomenon is relatively painless, reducing the narrative weight of the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=4.2)
    Tension is low because the obstacles—the town's despair and the fishermen's skepticism—are overcome through summarized competence rather than active confrontation. There is no moment where the protagonist's goal is genuinely at risk; her success feels inevitable from the moment she finds the trumpet valve. The stakes, while declared (the town's survival), are not viscerally felt because the cost of failure is never proximate.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.4)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the environment yields to Mara's presence rather than resisting it. The stake—finding the truth—is never in jeopardy, and the climax involves simply picking up an object without a difficult trade-off or opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—Elena’s need for peace versus the intrusion of the past—is clear, and the atmospheric pressure escalates well. However, the conflict is largely internal and resolved by the magical reveal; the story lacks a beat where Elena’s agency forces a difficult trade-off before the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are high (eternal ignorance vs. ultimate truth) and the ticking clock of the solar storm adds effective pressure. The conflict is primarily internal and environmental; active external opposition is minimal but sufficient for this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.3)
    The stakes for Pavel are high and palpable, and the pressure of the vigil is maintained well. The resolution—that the honest path is also the legal/safe one—feels slightly convenient, deflating the potential cost of the decision, but it fits the thematic arc perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.4)
    Conflict is the primary weakness; the stakes are abstract and aesthetic (preserving texture) rather than visceral. While the sunrise provides a micro-clock, there is minimal pressure or risk of failure. The "cost" is philosophical—isolation and silence—but since the protagonist desires these things, the tension remains low.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=4.8)
    There is almost no active opposition or pressure in the present moment; the protagonist collects information without facing the risk of discovery or a dilemma that forces a trade-off. The conflict is retrospective (what the plant did) rather than immediate, leaving the narrative without urgent narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes remain largely abstract, and the scene lacks immediate pressure or opposition. The "puzzle" of the observatory solves itself on the first attempt without forcing a difficult trade-off or escalation. While the conceptual cost (admitting she was wrong) is stated, the lack of an on-page struggle to achieve the result lowers the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.8)
    High stakes are established but resolved through a low-cost intellectual compromise ("cooperative shares") that bypasses genuine sacrifice. The antagonist agrees too easily, reducing the climax to a polite conversation rather than a pressure-cooker confrontation that forces a painful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.1)
    The external pressure (bulldozers) and internal pressure (legacy) create a cohesive drive. The stakes are felt, and the choice to spend the final moments creating art rather than fighting a legal battle is a meaningful exercise of agency.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are low and purely external (fixing a toy); while the repair process has steps, there is no escalation of pressure or risk of failure. The background departure of the *Mercantile* offers textural contrast but does not force a decision or impose a time cost on the primary action.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes remain largely intellectual/academic throughout. While the mystery deepens, the "worrying tranquility" remains an abstract atmospheric label rather than a source of active pressure or risk that forces a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.2)
    Narrative pressure is minimal as the protagonist encounters no obstacles, setbacks, or time crunches; the "collapse" stakes are declared but never test the character's agency or force a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.7)
    The ticking clock ("fail in hours") creates functional urgency, but the climax proceeds without complication; the calculated risk succeeds immediately. The "cost" is entirely external (the temple's destruction), leaving Marina personally unscathed and the stakes feeling somewhat low.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake (integrity of truth vs. the futility of his name) is signaled early and escalated by the physical inevitability of the surfacing bodies. The conflict is largely internal, but the external pressure of the "teeth" of the rocks emerging ensures the pacing remains taut. The cost—risking his carefully cultivated silence to be potentially ignored—is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; there is no antagonist, internal resistance, or environmental obstacle that Elara must actively overcome. The "debt" and "plagues of disconnection" are abstract stakes stated in dialogue, never manifesting as immediate threats or costs in the greenhouse. The story lacks a moment where Elara must trade one value for another; she simply inherits a role.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes dissolve at the moment of confrontation; the opposing force (the Council) offers no genuine resistance, resulting in a victory without trade-offs. The lack of a felt price or "earned stasis" makes the resolution feel like a fable's convenience rather than a hard-won change.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes remain largely internal and reflective; while the "hollowed" feeling provides motivation, there is little active opposition or risk of failure. The priest serves as a compliant foil rather than a source of genuine friction, resulting in a low-pressure narrative where success feels inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the declared stakes of a "digital suicide pact" are high, the on-page conflict is minimal; Maya faces no immediate threat, antagonist, or difficult trade-off (e.g., resource scarcity) during the scene. The courier’s arrival establishes a clock, but the execution of the task is smooth and unimpeded, leaving the tension largely atmospheric rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from professional curiosity to national crisis. The realization of the coup provides a sharp meaningful deepening, though the specific solution (guard captain) relies slightly on off-page relationships.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes are established early, but the tension evaporates prematurely when the medium reveals the sister’s reciprocal regret. By confirming the sister’s forgiveness before Isla makes the journey home, the story removes the risk of rejection, lowering the cost of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.6)
    The conflict is quiet and internal, centered on the struggle against forgetting. The tightening occurs effectively when the girl admits her failure to remember, prompting Maya's intervention. While the pressure is legible, the stakes remain relatively low-key, resolved through a gentle agreement rather than a high-pressure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are primarily internal and low-pressure. While the micro-choice to "amplify" rather than "impose" is meaningful, the immediate success on the knowledge network removes potential friction or isolation too easily. The conflict resolves through affirmation rather than a difficult trade-off or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation is distinct and pressure builds effectively as the "waking" cycles intensify. The cost is felt tangibly through the thinning of memories, grounding the metaphysical stakes in a specific personal loss.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict remains largely abstract; the antagonist (MindTax) is discussed but never confronts the characters in scene. The plan succeeds linearly without a moment of near-failure or a forced trade-off, resulting in low narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are internal and emotional but clearly defined: the risk of hope versus the safety of despair. The "blossom armistice" concept sharpens the conflict, making the planting of the bulb a meaningful act of defiance with felt cost (the potential for loss). Pressure escalates naturally through the dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clear and pressure is maintained through the dissonance threat. The escalation is linear but effective; however, the resolution—where the broken element perfectly solves the problem—lowers the tension too swiftly. A more jagged, difficult trade-off would have heightened the dramatic impact.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are established (imminent departure, broken trust), but the conflict is resolved too easily. Kael’s immediate acceptance of Maren’s explanation bypasses the potential for higher tension or a difficult trade-off, making the reconciliation feel inevitable rather than fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the stakes (flood vs. drought) are nominally high, the on-page tension is low because the antagonist is merely a puzzle to be solved. The conflict between the villages is resolved by a magic-bullet solution that requires no sacrifice or compromise from any party. The ending feels unearned because the protagonist faces no real opposition or dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure escalates cleanly from the arrival of the package to the listening of the recording. The stakes—maintaining a safe lie versus the pain of truth—are personal and high, though the external antagonist (Yuki) serves more as a catalyst than a source of active opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.1)
    The stakes are conceptual but felt—the need to understand a childhood trauma versus the safety of the "fractured hush." The escalation moves cleanly from assembly to analysis to decision. The cost is the permanent loss of the reconstructed safe space (the terrace dissolving), satisfying the requirement for an irreversible change.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is negligible; the "hard scientists" are absent strawmen, and the discovery process encounters no resistance or risk. The stakes of belonging are resolved by external validation rather than a protagonist's costly action or endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.9)
    The deepening from seeking restoration to accepting the role of witness creates a solid internal arc with felt conceptual cost. The stakes are clear, though the external pressure is low; the conflict remains largely contemplative until the final reframing.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.0)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the protagonist faces no active opposition, and her "variables" (people) behave exactly as predicted. The tide acts as a predictable clock rather than a source of escalating pressure. The outcome is never in doubt, resulting in a flat dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes are high conceptually (erasure of history), but the immediate on-page pressure is low as the garden offers a safe harbor without active opposition. The escalation is internal and accumulative, succeeding as a deepening of purpose rather than a confrontation with external force.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.8)
    Narrative tension is low as the antagonist (the developer) and the threat (demolition) remain abstract and off-page. Samuel encounters no resistance—physical, environmental, or internal—while gathering his evidence, resulting in a scene that feels more like a contemplative exercise than a conflict with visible stakes or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.1)
    Pressure is low; the stakes remain abstract and philosophical throughout. There is no external antagonist or time constraint forcing the protagonist's realization; the conflict is resolved through passive contemplation rather than a decisive, pressurized choice.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no active opposition from the setting, the timeline reflections, or her own limitations during the scene. The "gauge climbing" mimics tension, but without a risk of failure, meaningful setback, or a price paid for success, the stakes remain theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is minimal; there is no antagonist or significant obstacle opposing Mara's goal. She enters, observes, finds evidence, and understands, with the environment welcoming rather than resisting her. The "burden" is accepted without a moment of doubt or a visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    Escalation is handled well through the increasing complexity of the coded songs, raising the emotional stakes. The climax focuses on a successful connection, which works for the ritualistic lens, though a sharper moment of resistance or near-failure would have heightened the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are clearly established and personal. The escalation is functional, though the opposition collapses somewhat softly in the face of the symbolic gesture; a fiercer resistance from Kordas might have heightened the earned cost of the final agreement.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.4)
    Tension functions well under the Accumulative lens, with the approaching storm providing a ticking clock that pressures the release of the recording. However, the scene lacks immediate active opposition; the protagonist is executing a completed plan rather than navigating a developing crisis, which limits the dynamism of the escalation. The cost is high but largely retrospective ("four years," "seven countries").

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.8)
    Pressure is low; the "threads resisted" briefly, but the protagonist overcomes obstacles without a significant tactical shift or visible cost, making the outcome feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.4)
    The central conflict is resolved by a convenient external interruption (the drunk) rather than the protagonist's active struggle or choice. The tension dissolves instantly upon the stranger's epiphany, making the resolution feel too easy.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.1)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story succeeds in building density and emotional weight, though it lacks acute active conflict. The "tightening" is purely atmospheric—the arrival and inevitable departure of the monarchs—rather than a test of the protagonist's capacity. While the emotional cost of extinction is felt, the personal cost to Sera is minimal, keeping the stakes largely conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.0)
    While the stakes of preserving memory are high in concept, the on-page tension is low. The process proceeds without error or external threat, and the cost is primarily abstract (time/years) rather than a felt, immediate price paid in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=4.1)
    Escalation is negligible; the dominant stake (understanding destiny) faces no active opposition. The storm functions as a false stake—it threatens urgency but results in no trade-off, endurance, or loss, as the character simply waits it out.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.9)
    The central conflict is intellectual and internal, escalating through the decoding process rather than external opposition. While the political threat provides background tension, the on-page pressure is somewhat low-stakes until the realization hits. The "cost" is largely conceptual—the burden of secret knowledge—rather than a visceral price paid in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.4)
    Conflict is low-pressure; Elena dominates the encounter, and Marcus’s defenses are dismantled without significant escalation or risk of failure. The scene functions as a linear progression toward a foregone conclusion rather than a dynamic struggle between opposing forces.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.7)
    The stakes are clearly established (destruction of the district), but the antagonist (the dream) remains largely passive during the confrontation, "shuddering" and complying rather than actively resisting. The tension relies more on the technical risk of the ritual than on direct opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake (relationship repair) is clear, but the escalation is purely conversational and low-friction. The conflict resolves through mutual agreement almost immediately after the inciting confrontation; the "cost" is an emotional admission that lacks a tangible price or difficult trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.2)
    The stakes remain purely intellectual; there is no antagonist, ticking clock, or distinct consequence for failure beyond continued confusion. The resolution comes without a visible sacrifice or trade-off; Mara simply accepts the loop without any struggle or friction, flattening the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.5)
    Pressure is negligible; the rescue is accomplished without a moment of doubt, trade-off, or risk of failure. The antagonist force (the time rift) yields instantly to Mira's first attempt, resulting in a lack of dramatic tension despite the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are high and clearly defined: the preservation of memory against the "alterations" of the fog. The pressure escalates coherently as her mental grasp slips, forcing the desperate improvisation of the narrative threads. The cost is conceptual yet felt—the surrender of her singular selfhood.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story lacks significant tension or felt cost; the protagonist faces a puzzle rather than a conflict. There is no active opposition, time pressure is nominal (the deadline is met easily), and the resolution requires no sacrifice—underscored by the tea remaining warm. Success feels inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.7)
    The stakes are clear, but the escalation is minimal; the protagonist overcomes the antagonist (the noise) through pure competence without a significant tactical shift or risk of failure. The cost of "exhaustion" is somatic rather than a difficult trade-off, leaving the victory feeling somewhat inevitable and low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.9)
    The stakes are high (restoring meaning), but the immediate dramatic pressure is low because the protagonist already possesses the solution (the shard) when the scene begins. The conflict is primarily past-tense endurance rather than an active on-page struggle against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are clear but primarily philosophical; the urgency is stated ("desperation") rather than forced by immediate external consequence. While the internal shift is decisive, the lack of a tangible trade-off or active opposition limits the tension to the conceptual realm.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=4.1)
    Conflict is negligible; the guards ignore her, and the commander's resistance is limited to a single line of skepticism that is immediately overcome. The antagonist is an abstract concept (hopelessness) that surrenders without a fight, resulting in a narrative with almost no pressure or escalation. There is no point where the outcome feels in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are intimate and legible, focusing on a relational transition. While the pressure is gentle, the emotional cost—accepting the necessity of departure—is felt on the page, though the conflict resolution feels slightly smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.6)
    While the ticking clock of the gravity inversion provides functional pressure, the conflict is relatively low-stakes; the obstacle is primarily patience rather than active opposition. The narrative relies on a quiet, accumulative build rather than a sharp escalation of risk or visible cost to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.8)
    Pressure is low throughout; the conflict is internal to the passenger and is soothed rather than tested. The "cost" of the transition is theoretical, and the interaction lacks a moment where the system or Mara's resolve is genuinely threatened, resulting in a safe, linear emotional trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are declared but felt pressure remains low; the sunrise deadline lacks on-page urgency. The central obstacle (the hidden door) is resolved by serendipity rather than a high-stakes trade-off or ingenuity, and the final refusal of power comes too easily to generate tension.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.3)
    Escalation is dampened by Sienna’s near-instant submission to Maya's extreme philosophy. The "cost" is articulated in dialogue ("Everything you were") rather than dramatized through a struggle that forces a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes escalate well from the personal pressure of debt to the cosmic collapse of reality, and the cost of the final choice—eternal vigilance—is palpable. The conflict resolution relies somewhat on the convenient appearance of the "Presence" to define the terms, but the pressure of the bolt itself is well-rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.5)
    The scene lacks active opposition or escalating pressure; the protagonist faces no risk or obstacle in playing the record and opening the safe, leaving the stakes theoretical rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.5)
    Escalation is linear and lacks significant opposition; the protagonist tries the patterns, and they work immediately without generating new problems or demanding a painful trade-off. While the stakes are high in concept (altering reality), the absence of friction or failure makes the victory feel inevitable rather than hard-won. The cost is largely abstract (commitment) rather than a visceral loss or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clearly internalized, focusing on the preservation of memory against erasure. While the soldier's reported cost is high, the on-page pressure for Sarah is low; the conflict remains quiet and contemplative rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.8)
    Escalation is purely external (approaching boots) and does not force the protagonist to choose between competing values or wants. The climax lacks a true turning point where failure is a credible risk; the victory comes without a specific price paid in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes are clear—prophecy versus silence—and the pressure escalates as the whispers grow agitated against the silence. The conflict is resolved through a specific, technical choice (playing negative space), though the antagonist (the whispers) remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.7)
    Conflict is virtually absent; Miren encounters an anomaly, tests it without interference or risk, and immediately succeeds. There is no antagonist, no ticking clock (despite the "hush"), and no possibility of failure, resulting in low narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes remain abstract and low-pressure throughout; Ellis faces no antagonist, time limit, or physical danger, and her "improvisation" with the crowbar resolves the only physical barrier without cost. The conflict is purely intellectual (curiosity vs. mystery), and because she finds the answers easily via the journal, the ending lacks the "felt cost" required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.0)
    While the stakes (life/death) are high, the on-page pressure is low; the protagonist executes a plan that works exactly as intended. The cost (wedding ring) is paid as an entry fee rather than an escalation forced by the scene's resistance, reducing tension.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.4)
    Pressure is low; the ghost is a puzzle box that unlocks immediately upon receiving the correct item, offering no genuine opposition or threat to Mara. There is no moment where Mara must trade one value for another or risk failure; the stake (the soul's release) is achieved through a linear application of skills without escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are internal but sharply defined; the escalation moves from physical stumbling to intellectual frustration to emotional breakthrough. The cost is visible in the physical toll of the surges and the permanent scarring of the trees.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are declared (erasure of history) but never tested; the protagonist faces no concrete opposition, risk, or hard choice. The narrative progresses linearly from acquisition to solution without the tightening of options or the payment of a price required for genuine dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes and pressure are minimal; there is no antagonist, active opposition, or meaningful risk to the protagonist. The resolution comes without struggle or escalation, making the victory feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.7)
    The conflict remains abstract and low-stakes; the antagonist, Tessian, capitulates almost immediately upon the whisper’s release, removing any genuine tension or cost from the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving the truth of the alien civilization—is clear, and the storm provides a functional pressure cooker. However, the physical danger feels somewhat managed by Matthias's expertise, lowering the immediate tension. The stakes are high intellectually but the visceral cost on the page is subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are declared ("everything hung in the balance") but not dramatized through active opposition or the risk of failure. The protagonist overcomes the abstract antagonist ("midnight") through competence alone, resulting in a flat tension curve with no sacrifices.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.2)
    The drive is primarily contemplative, fitting the accumulative lens, but the external pressure is low; the "crack... barely wide enough" offers only minor physical resistance. The stakes remain largely philosophical until the final sacrifice of the compass, which provides a necessary, if symbolic, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake (artistic blockage) is established but resolved too easily by the external intervention of the magic slide. The narrative lacks a moment of high-pressure choice where the protagonist must sacrifice something significant; consequently, the conflict dissolves rather than escalating to a peak.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.7)
    Stakes remain low and internal (artistic dissatisfaction) without external pressure or a "ticking clock" consequence. The conflict is resolved by a sudden realization rather than an escalation of pressure, and the protagonist faces no meaningful opposition or sacrifice to achieve her goal.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes in the flashback are visceral and high, but Maya's present-tense stakes remain largely internal and thematic. The pressure on Maya is felt, but the cost of her transformation is less tangible than Elijah's physical danger.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.3)
    External pressure is low; the protagonist studies the bottle for three days without active opposition or a ticking clock. The conflict is primarily philosophical, and the "cost" of staying is established in backstory rather than paid through a difficult on-page trade-off or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes are primarily internal and conceptual—understanding the silence—which fits the quiet tone but lacks visceral external pressure. The escalation is functional (trying the correct translation vs. the accidental one), though the obstacle is overcome relatively easily through the sudden arrival of the specific memory.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are sharply defined: the loss of a legacy versus the corruption of the future. The escalation through the sensory experience of the vortex makes the final choice to accept the loss feel costly and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stakes are established early and escalate clearly toward "zero hour." The central renunciation—choosing the bell over the switch—is a strong dramatic beat, though the immediate and perfect success of this choice lowers the felt cost at the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes are purely internal and low-pressure; the environment offers no resistance, and the task is voluntary. The escalation is reflective rather than dramatic, and the ending lacks a "felt cost"—the protagonist gains wisdom without paying a price in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes remain largely quiet and thematic; the conflict is an intellectual puzzle rather than a high-pressure crisis. While the internal shift is meaningful, the external obstacles (opening a box) lack visceral urgency or rising danger, keeping the tension at a simmer.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake (community survival/planting) is established but lacks immediate on-page pressure or opposition; the obstacle is merely a lack of information. The resolution comes too easily—a key fits a lock, and a speech solves the problem—without escalating tension or forcing a difficult decision.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.0)
    The stakes remain low-intensity and cerebral; the central conflict is resolved through acceptance of an accident rather than a difficult active choice. The "cost" of the broken kite is immediately reframed as a gain, removing the sting of loss required for high-band tension.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; Marina identifies a problem and immediately implements a solution that works without complication or cost. The potential tension between her failing health and the temple's needs is stated but not dramatized, resulting in a flat trajectory where the antagonist (entropy/death) offers no meaningful pushback.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story relies on an Accumulative/Situational drive where pressure comes from the mystery of the footprints and the weight of the alien artifact. While external opposition is minimal, the internal deepening—from confusion to hypothesis to radical acceptance—creates sufficient narrative momentum. The "cost" is a conceptual shedding of linear time paradigms.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.8)
    Pressure is atmospheric rather than conflicting; while the accumulation of seeds and the encroaching darkness provide momentum, the lack of active resistance or obstacles limits the tension. The stakes remain abstract—remembrance versus oblivion—without a moment where failure feels like a genuine possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.2)
    Pressure is minimal; the protagonist faces a puzzle she solves instantly and a journey that is summarized rather than dramatized. There is no on-page opponent or obstacle that forces a hard trade-off, leaving the stakes purely theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.6)
    The "anniversary" beat successfully escalates the stakes by making the temporal cost personal and irreversible. While the internal conflict is resolved, the external pressure (entropy/time) is passive, leading to a resolution that feels more like acceptance than a hard-won victory against opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the cosmic stakes are high (world unmaking), the on-page conflict is negligible because the sundial acts as an infallible guide, removing the risk of "choosing wrong." There is no antagonist, time pressure is static, and the protagonist faces no trade-offs between competing goods or evils. The escalation is mechanical (swap piece, see result) rather than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.4)
    The internal conflict (memory vs. oblivion) is powerful and drives the narrative method. The external conflict serves largely as a frame, until the colleague challenges her definition of performance. While the confrontation is brief, it effectively forces Mara to explicitly reject her old identity and embrace the cost of the new one.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.4)
    The central tension—the pain of the past versus the need to remember—dissolves instantly upon the magical realization, lacking a sense of escalation or trade-off. The transition from trauma to "precious" memory happens without a visible on-page cost, rendering the stakes surprisingly low at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is internal but low-resistance; the antagonist is a static puzzle that yields immediately to the protagonist's specific skill set. The escalation is absent because the tapestry provides the solution before the protagonist is forced to confront her limits or pay a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stakes are high (judgment/soul), and the conflict escalates as Mira’s poetic attempts turn from defiance to a horrifying reinforcement of her guilt. The pressure is coherent, though the climax relies on an internal realization triggered by the environment rather than a direct confrontation with another character.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rising acid wave provides a clear, escalating external threat that enforces a ticking clock. While the stakes are high and legible, the resolution—a magical shield effect—slightly dampens the pressure by resolving the physical threat with a thematic epiphany rather than a tangible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are primarily internal—artistic integrity and emotional openness—but they are made legible through the physical journey into the cave. The "cost" is felt in the ruin of her clothes and the surrender of her protective distance. While the external pressure is low-key, the internal escalation holds tension under a consistent Situational drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=4.2)
    The central stake—seven years of estrangement—dissolves instantly upon contact without testing the protagonist's resolve. Vera’s immediate acceptance ("I heard you") removes the necessary interpersonal tension, rendering the climax devoid of visible on-page cost or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.8)
    Escalation is mild. The protagonist faces no immediate obstacle in the scene; the caller connects instantly, follows instructions easily, and succeeds without complication. The "weak signal" constraint functions as background texture rather than active pressure, leaving the victory unearned by immediate struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are clear and the storm adds atmospheric pressure, but the antagonist forces are largely static (the past virus, the weather). The climax resolves with relatively low resistance (pressing the object), lacking a moment where the outcome is truly in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    The internal stakes (burden of memory) are established well, but the external conflict is resolved too smoothly via the memory projection. The escalation is quiet and internal; while fitting for the tone, the lack of a harder obstacle or price paid before the final realization limits the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes are clear (risk vs. safety), but the opposition is weak. The grandfather’s hesitation serves as a warning, but Marcus overcomes the internal barrier with relatively little on-page friction or deepening of the dilemma before acting.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are clear (sanity vs. duty), and the climb provides physical pressure. The conflict resolves somewhat conveniently through the guide's revelation, missing a moment where the queen must pay a higher personal price for her renewed purpose beyond the hike itself.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.0)
    While the stakes (blindness, loss of connection) are high, the protagonist pays no visible on-page cost to resolve them. Because the solution was crafted off-stage during her journey, the transaction lacks the friction of sacrifice or difficult ingenuity in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are existential but clearly defined: the struggle to maintain narrative coherence against a dissolving reality. The escalation works well, moving from reading the scroll to the realization of the "eternal present tense" burial. The cost is felt in the "particular exhaustion" and the loss of linear hope, creating a strong sense of pressure without needing an external antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.4)
    The stakes are internal and clear, but the escalation is mild; the protagonist accepts the antagonist's (Mr. Chen's) wisdom immediately without testing or resistance. The lack of friction or hard choices makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than forged under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes are personal and clear, with the cost being the potential exposure of shame and failure. Escalation occurs internally as Kael confronts the quill and the scars. The conflict is resolved through agency, though the lack of external resistance during the act itself makes the victory feel slightly safe.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are intimate but felt; Derrick's refusal to grant full forgiveness provides a necessary cost, preventing a cheap reconciliation. The pressure of the imminent demolition works well to force the confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.0)
    Escalation follows a Conceptual lens, deepening understanding rather than raising stakes. While coherent, the conflict is abstract; the absence of active opposition or immediate pressure makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.1)
    The internal stakes are clear—understanding vs. procedure—but the external pressure is low, lacking an antagonist or time constraint beyond the self-imposed hour. The escalation is cerebral, leading to a satisfying conceptual shift, though the lack of resistance makes the victory feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes are clearly established (Dr. Reeves' arrival, the farm's fragility), but the tension dissipates rapidly upon recognition. The conflict resolution feels soft; Mira effectively waves away the threat without a significant on-page test of her loyalty or a confrontation that forces a harder trade-off. The pressure does not sufficiently escalate before the release.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.9)
    The stakes are clearly defined: the reconciliation of a father’s legacy and the utility of probability itself. The tension between the "brilliant mind" and "damaged circuits" provides a ticking clock of sorts, though the conflict remains largely internal and reflective.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is no meaningful escalation or obstacle; every caller opens up immediately, and every intervention works without a hitch. The stakes belong entirely to the secondary characters, leaving the protagonist in a safety zone where no choice carries risk or price.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.5)
    Escalation is minimal; the protagonist arrives, writes, and leaves without encountering obstacles or new complications. The tension is retrospective, resolving a thirty-year habit through a realization that feels pre-digested rather than forged in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.0)
    The conflict escalates legibly from logistical hurdles to an interpersonal confrontation, successfully shifting stakes from medical supplies to emotional connection. However, the resolution relies on the visitor delivering a perfect thematic key that instantly unlocks the protagonist, lacking the messy friction or resistance that characterizes high-stakes human change.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes are clear (finding peace), but the conflict is low-friction; the ring simply pulls harder and she follows. There is no moment where the protagonist must overcome a significant snag, make a hard sacrifice, or adapt her tactics against active opposition, making the escalation feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the initial stakes are high (2,000 lives), the conflict deflates rather than escalates. The resolution—where settlers are simply happy with "simultaneous futures"—removes the pressure of their physical reality, solving a survival crisis with a philosophical abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.5)
    Pressure is low throughout; the conflict is internal but resolved through external guidance rather than a forcing choice or unavoidable trade-off. The stakes (identity/music) are declared but the immediate scene lacks a sense of risk; the transition from grief to dancing feels safe and therapeutic rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.0)
    The deepening is effective: finding the *defaced* portrait shifts the stakes from mere neglect to active, malicious erasure. However, the conflict remains largely retrospective and internal; the scene lacks immediate, active pressure or resistance, as the archive itself is passive and the "corporate interests" are abstract off-page threats.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.8)
    Pressure is coherent but low-voltage; the "hush of the universe" acts as a timer rather than an antagonist. While the internal weight of memories provides textural density, the absence of external friction (guards, failing tech, physical toll beyond "aching fingers") limits the escalation to a linear increase in intensity rather than a complex trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.3)
    The stakes are clear, but the interpersonal conflict lacks visceral pressure; Mira dominates the negotiation with Voss too easily. The tension relies heavily on the environmental clock rather than a difficult tradeoff or genuine risk of failure from the antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.3)
    The stakes are life-and-death, but the protagonist's agency is limited to a single speech act facilitated by an omniscient observer. The tension is diffused by the guardian's immediate provision of the solution once the moral threshold is crossed, lowering the felt cost of the rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.5)
    The conflict is entirely abstract (Marina vs. off-screen "policies") and lacks an on-page antagonist to create resistance. The rebellion proceeds with perfect consensus, devoid of the friction or risk necessary to generate genuine narrative tension or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.3)
    The stakes are clear, but the escalation relies on a rapid internal pivot ("understood suddenly") rather than a ratchet of pressure that eliminates options. The cost is visible (losing the bone), but the choice to release it feels inevitable rather than agonizingly weighed, reducing the dramatic tension at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clearly established: the safety of the void versus the danger of authentic grief. The escalation is subtle but distinct, moving from the safe proxy of driftwood to the emotionally charged bouquet. The cost is felt—the loss of the brother's last tangible trace creates an irreversible change.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are theoretical rather than visceral. With the ban lifted and the environment cooperative, there is no antagonist or pressure forcing a difficult trade-off. The climax—paraphrasing a text—feels like a victory lap rather than a test of agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes remain largely philosophical; Fen’s resistance is polite and brief ("I don't understand"), resolving quickly after a short lecture. The conflict lacks visceral heat or the threat of failure; Mira succeeds without facing a significant obstacle or cost to herself.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.9)
    Conflict is negligible; Karim's objection ("The data's worthless") is overcome immediately by the stranger’s demonstration. There is no escalation of pressure or genuine risk; the solution is handed to the protagonist rather than earned through a high-stakes choice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story lacks significant on-page conflict or escalation; the commission is executed smoothly without technical failure, emotional resistance, or external opposition. While there is thematic density, the stakes remain abstract and the narrative lacks a meaningful tightening or "pattern break" that would force Mira to reweight her values or take a risk.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes are largely theoretical and abstract. While the internal pressure to confide is stated, the external conflict is minimal; Tobias accepts the revelation immediately, meaning the "cost" of breaking her silence is not tested or dramatized against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.9)
    The stakes are high—forbidden knowledge vs. the danger of that knowledge—and the conflict resolves through a decisive internal choice. The cost is felt: walking away empty-handed after seventeen years of searching constitutes a significant sacrifice. The struggle is brief; a moment of stronger temptation before the rejection would have deepened the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes remain largely abstract and intellectual; the conflict is Maren's internal disapproval of a societal trend she cannot influence. The escalation is observational (watching the second video) rather than a rising pressure that forces a difficult trade-off or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are high and personal, balancing career ruin against moral compromise. The pressure deepens effectively through the interaction with Prism, leading to a justified choice, though the external opposition is strictly backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.1)
    Pressure is coherent; the ivy's broadcasted distress provides immediate external urgency that forces Maya to confront her internal block. The stakes escalate from passive observation to active engagement, resulting in a meaningful reconfiguration of her self-perception.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.0)
    Conflict is primarily thematic; while the realization that the love is "incubating" raises the stakes from observation to action, there is minimal active opposition or internal reluctance. The final release involves a conceptual cost—surrendering the privacy of the "vigil"—but the lack of a visible trade-off or risk keeps the dramatic tension low.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.9)
    While the stakes are high (release of global creativity), the on-page conflict is largely atmospheric pressure rather than active opposition. Lyra encounters no failure, mechanical malfunction, or error during the ritual; the tension relies entirely on the pre-existing condition of the "screaming" words rather than escalating obstacles within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the stakes (restoring a burned world) are high, the immediate scene pressure is low voltage; the protagonist encounters no active resistance from the archive or environment that forces a change in tactics. The progression is smooth—she sings, the clock warms, the wave collapses—resulting in a ritual success rather than a conflict-driven escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain abstract; there is no immediate threat to Kael's safety or sanity within the scene, only a curiosity to explore. The climax lacks pressure—the forest yields its secrets to the gear without resistance—resulting in an escalation curve that feels flat and devoid of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are low in the present timeline as the guides ensure success and no obstacle threatens failure. The true conflict resides in the backstory (the 17-year vigil), leaving the on-page journey feeling like a victory lap rather than a struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central conflict—silence versus remembrance—is clearly staged and escalates through specific micro-choices, such as humming in the corridors despite management's warnings. The pressure is coherent, and the stakes rise from personal sensation to a broader act of defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake (truth vs. lies) is clear, but the antagonist is distant and abstract, reducing the on-page conflict to a race against the environment. The escalation is linear; Kael faces no unexpected complications or tactical reversals, only the inevitable collapse she already anticipates.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are primarily epistemic but feel urgent due to the "vigil" context; the tension between the data (emptiness) and the intuition (return) drives the scene. The escalation focuses on the interpretation of data, which fits the hard sci-fi tone, though the interpersonal friction with Jin is functional rather than deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are theoretical (the future of the rebellion) rather than immediate; there is no antagonist or active pressure in the scene. The escalation is purely internal, moving from doubt to certainty without external resistance or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.5)
    The conceptual stakes—the future evolution of a people—are high and clear. Yet, the lack of external opposition or on-page complications during the unsealing reduces the felt pressure; the victory feels inevitable rather than fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    The conflict is internal but legible: the struggle to maintain presence against a PTSD trigger. The escalation (helicopter) is immediate and forces a decisive reaction, though the stakes remain relatively low-key and the resolution feels somewhat expected.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.0)
    The stakes are high (crushing death), but the escalation is resolved too easily by the protagonist's sudden understanding. The tension dissipates through a magical fix rather than a desperate, costly action, reducing the impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure is maintained through the fading evidence, forcing the protagonist to act before the trail vanishes. The stakes deepen from a simple capture to a metaphysical quest, though the external conflict is deferred rather than resolved. The cost is time and endurance—she must wait for the next crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.7)
    While the abstract stakes are high (execution, truth), the on-page pressure is low; the protagonist faces no immediate antagonist or physical obstacle, only her own hesitation which resolves quickly. The "bravely conflicted" state is stated rather than felt as a tug-of-war between safety and duty. The escalation is internal but lacks the friction of a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.8)
    The conflict dissolves rather than snaps; the father offers minimal resistance to Mara's worldview, turning the climax into a capitulation. While the knife moment introduces a beat of tension, the lack of sustained opposition lowers the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes are high (daughter's recovery) and established early. Escalation occurs through the chaotic movement of the stars and the need to use a dangerous method (voicing silence). While the protagonist succeeds with relative efficiency, the physical cost (damaging the skiff with the spike, physical pain) is visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clear and high—personal legacy versus historical truth. The escalation is handled well through the forensic examination of the photos, raising the pressure until the final choice. The cost is not just theoretical but explicitly acknowledged as the destruction of her grandfather's reputation.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clear and the cost is visible and felt—the destruction of the cherished amber pendant to create the ink. The escalation of the firmware's haunting builds coherent pressure, though the resolution leans slightly on a sudden internal pivot rather than an external forcing move.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes of losing meaning are felt, and the pressure leads to a clear choice to abandon perfection for integration. However, the resolution relies heavily on the serendipitous arrival of the woman with the perfect object, reducing protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes escalate clearly from a historical curiosity to a present-day ethical crisis involving the city's identity. The internal pressure is coherent and tightens effectively, forcing a trade-off between righteousness and mercy that feels significant on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the antagonist (the young man's despair) is passive and off-screen, offering no resistance to Celeste's magic. The protagonist encounters no obstacles in the garden or her performance, resulting in a flat escalation curve where success is immediate and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.7)
    While the stakes are conceptually high (lost consciousness), the narrative lacks sufficient escalating pressure; Maya encounters an obstacle, immediately intuits a solution, and succeeds without significant setbacks or trade-offs. The protagonist faces no meaningful opposition from the environment, the materials, or the medical establishment, flattening the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes are primarily conceptual; while the shift in purpose is intelligible, the pressure driving it is low. The discovery of the "anomaly" is a convenient catalyst that meets little resistance, resulting in a shift that feels inevitable rather than hard-won against opposition or limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=3.9)
    There is a distinct lack of opposition. Maren faces no external antagonist, no time pressure (despite the hourglass), and no internal resistance to the new truth. The town accepts the revelation immediately, and the "eastern wind" shifts on cue. Without an escalating counter-force or the risk of failure, the stakes remain theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are well-defined (survival vs. duty) and the cost of the final choice—giving up safety—is felt on the page. The conflict resolution is somewhat linear, lacking a moment where the antagonist or the environment truly threatens to derail the decision.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is low-pressure, consisting primarily of a waiting game rather than active antagonism or difficult trade-offs. The resolution arrives via a shared realization that feels overly tidy, lacking a visceral cost or a choice that forecloses other options.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are low and primarily intellectual; the protagonist faces no active opposition or meaningful danger from the wasteland or the anomaly. While she invests time (three weeks), there is no agonizing trade-off or risk that forces a difficult choice. The conflict is resolved through observation and mild effort rather than a test of will or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is minimal; the excursion faces no obstacles from weather, authorities, or the children themselves. The stakes are theoretical ("questions, maybe consequences") rather than paid on the page, resulting in a smooth execution that lacks narrative tension or escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.9)
    The stakes are clear but the tension remains low; the external threat (the tide) is a known schedule, and the internal conflict (fear of the map) resolves quickly with a single look. The escalation lacks a moment of genuine doubt or high-risk failure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.1)
    The stakes feel low because the protagonist accepts the cost of releasing her secrets immediately and without visible hardship. The conflict is resolved through gentle realization rather than pressure, resulting in a low-tension narrative where the outcome never feels in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are established early (campus division, shattered telescope) but the climax resolves them through a technobabble fix rather than character struggle. The "battle" is abstract—fought on an oscilloscope—and the opposition capitulates immediately, deflating the tension built by the chanting mob.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.9)
    Tension is primarily environmental; while the walls pressing in escalates the physical threat, the lack of a difficult trade-off or significant personal cost keeps the stakes relatively low. The resolution comes from enduring the environment and seizing a fleeting opportunity rather than a decisive, costly moral or tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.6)
    The scene lacks immediate external pressure or an active antagonist, leaving the stakes purely intellectual. The resolution comes without a visible cost or trade-off; Vera simply enacts her plan without facing resistance or risking failure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.8)
    The conflict de-escalates too quickly; the antagonist (the government/exile board) is abstract, and Yoon offers minimal resistance. The stakes are global, but the immediate on-page pressure is low because the solution is accepted without a felt cost or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows an accumulative lens where pressure comes from curiosity, but the stakes remain abstract and low. There is no significant obstacle opposing Maria's discovery, and the final decision to "bear witness" entails no visible sacrifice or risk on the page. The narrative lacks a moment of "felt cost" where the protagonist must trade something of value to gain the truth.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are high conceptually (redemption vs. predation) but low dramatically; the conflict remains entirely internal without external friction to test the protagonist's resolve. The "meaningful tightening" is a quiet mental shift rather than a forced trade-off, making the victory feel relatively cheap.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is low-pressure; the antagonist is an abstract puzzle that yields without resistance once the characters decide to talk. The stakes are theoretically high (death/madness), but the on-page resolution lacks a visible price or trade-off; success feels inevitable rather than fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are established immediately through the charlatan's failure, and the internal cost of "unbending" defenses provides genuine agency and risk. The conflict is layered well between the external curse and internal vulnerability. The tension resolves clearly, though the convenience of the seed slightly dampens the tactical difficulty of the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; characters assemble, agree on their purpose, and succeed in their ritual without external opposition or internal doubt. The stakes are declared in high-concept terms ("future screaming toward them") but are never tested by a concrete risk of failure within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.2)
    The conflict deepens effectively when Kael reveals Senna was his soulmate, raising the stakes from a generic ethical error to a specific, tragic debt. The pressure coheres well, forcing Mira's hand in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are clearly braided: the professional risk of authentication connects directly to the personal risk of confronting his recent humiliation. The pressure escalates naturally through the client's pushback ("My father never lied"), forcing a turn that carries emotional cost—abandoning his defensive cynicism.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes remain largely internal and intellectual, lacking urgent external pressure or a "ticking clock" to heighten the attempt. While the "physics of transition" is a compelling abstract stake, the escalation is mild—planting a seed—and the resolution comes without significant sacrifice or trade-off, keeping the tension in the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.2)
    Pressure is low throughout; the protagonist executes a recipe for resolution without facing an antagonist, time limit, or the risk of failure. The stakes remain abstract ("preserving wonder") and the lack of a "no" or complication flattens the dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.4)
    The conflict (duty vs. sentiment) is present but low-stakes; the opposition from protocol dissolves almost instantly. The "hesitation" is stated rather than felt as a high-pressure trade-off with visible risks.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.0)
    The internal stakes are high and the tightening—moving from observation to participation—is felt. The escalation is primarily internal, but the cost of "making noise" and losing the "protective distance" of medication is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clearly defined: the risk of rejection by the Council versus the dangerous allure of the library. The escalation is cerebral but intense, moving from observation to physical ascension and the heavy burden of the "unspoken" books. The pressure tightens effectively when the Librarian reveals the circular nature of the permission.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    The conflict is sharply defined: a binary choice between serving the Empire (reward/safety) and serving the art (integrity/danger). Director Kemble effectively personifies the opposition, raising the stakes with the "dream vs. empire" line. The cost of the final choice—exile and loss of status—is clearly established on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the "static" yields immediately to Kael's expertise without struggle or adaptation. The stakes are abstract (oblivion) and are resolved through routine competence, missing the opportunity for a moment where the ritual might fail or demand a higher price.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—confronting the murderer—is undercut because Mei forgave him "decades ago." There is no active on-page wrestling with the decision; the pressure is retrospective rather than immediate, reducing the climax to a procedural interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.3)
    The stakes are clear (integrity vs. reputation), but the opposition folds somewhat easily; Keegan accepts Mara's verdict after a single speech and a look in the mirror. The conflict is resolved more by the protagonist's assertion than by a protracted struggle of values.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes remain largely philosophical and internal; while the intellectual conflict is clear, the scene lacks urgent external pressure or a concrete cost of failure. The tightening comes from the lesson's progression rather than a forced choice.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no opposition, time pressure, or risk of failure. The escalation is linear—problem presented, waiting, solution arrives—lacking the tightening of options or rising stakes required for high dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are conceptually clear but lack immediate pressure; the antagonist (the Academy) is remote, and the environmental obstacle (the mist) "accepts" her rather than forcing a hard tactical trade-off. The primary cost is physical exertion ("muscles burning"), which feels low-stakes compared to the thematic weight suggested.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are clear—physical danger vs. emotional closure—and the tension escalates appropriately during the dive. The groaning of the ship provides a necessary physical pressure point at the climax. However, the external obstacle (the dive mechanics) feels somewhat routine compared to the high-concept internal journey; a sharper trade-off or cost during the ascent would elevate this.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are theoretical rather than felt; while the cosmic context is vast, the immediate scene lacks urgency or risk. The protagonist's internal struggle is resolved by external validation (the prophecy message) rather than a difficult active choice, resulting in a lack of escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    The stakes are clear and personal, escalating from a passive inability to work to an active, painful confrontation with grief. The daughter's voice serves as an effective pressure mechanism, forcing Mara to act. The cost is legible—reopening the wound to heal it—though the resolution feels slightly swift for the depth of the trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.6)
    While the stakes are high (survival), the on-page pressure is largely static; Maren waits and rings without active opposition or a complication that forces a tactical shift in the moment. The "tightening" is a matter of timing rather than a hard choice between competing values.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.5)
    The conflict with the supervisor provides a clear inciting incident and pressure. However, the cost of Mara's defiance is muted by the rapid jump to a successful resolution where the community validates her choice, removing the risk of the threatened "expunging."

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is primarily internal and abstract, lacking external pressure or genuine obstacles beyond "cold." The protagonist encounters no significant setbacks; the stakes of her "life's work" remain theoretical, and the resolution comes without a meaningful sacrifice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are high and clearly defined (survival of the valley vs. Vera's reputation), and the pressure escalates appropriately with the council's doubt. The resolution—deciding to teach rather than flee—is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, though the ease with which she sheds her panic dampens the felt cost of the final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are high (identity and legal personhood), and the pressure of the impending hearing drives the scene. The resolution—withdrawing the opposition—is a valid character choice, though the lack of resistance or interaction from the clone makes the external conflict feel slightly low-friction in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the stakes of corporate buyout are clear, the conflict is conveyed through summary ("buyers called again") rather than immediate scenes with rising pressure. The resolution feels inevitable due to the "magical" success of the flower, rather than being earned through a difficult, on-page decision by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is virtually absent; there is no antagonist, no risk of failure, and no moment where the plan threatens to go wrong. The protagonist pays no visible price for his success, turning the story into a procedural vignette rather than a narrative with escalating stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.3)
    The stakes are existential and well-defined, pitting identity against the eroding force of the "wrong" dimension. The escalation is internal but visible, moving from passive waiting to the active reclamation of her role. The cost is legible: she does not return to a pristine state but must carry the "dimensional homesickness" as a permanent burden.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stakes are clear—a stifling destiny versus a dangerous ambition. The pressure escalates appropriately as Maren risks the unique artifact (the crozier) in the fire. The cost is primarily conceptual (breaking tradition/order), which fits the length well.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces a technical task rather than active opposition or a dilemma. The escalation is a smooth gradient of success—she tunes the dial and receives the signal—without a moment where failure seems plausible or a sacrifice is demanded to proceed.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative lacks escalation; Marcus identifies a solution and executes it without facing new complications, setbacks, or opposing wills. The climax is linear and low-friction, missing the tightening of options or rising stakes required for higher tension.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation works through atmospheric density (walls breathing, shadows appearing), but the protagonist faces no active opposition or hard choices; the path to the climax is linear execution rather than a struggle against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes are intellectual but clearly felt—relevance versus obsolescence. The cost of a six-month surface deployment is concrete, though the conflict remains relatively quiet and internal rather than sharply escalated by external opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist faces zero opposition; access to restricted records is effortless, and police accept her paranormal tip without skepticism. Without obstacles to force a hard choice or a trade-off, there is no genuine escalation or cost, rendering the "incidental heroism" flat and procedural.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.9)
    The ticking clock of the tide creates effective, coherent pressure that forces the protagonist’s movement. The stakes are clear, though the climax (downloading data) lacks a final complication or twist to test Maya's resolve beyond the established environmental time limit.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.5)
    The pressure builds effectively through the rhythmic counting and the waiting, creating a quiet but palpable tension. The stakes are internal—sanity and wholeness—and the cost is clear: Marcus must surrender the defensive anchor (the numbers) that has sustained him since his trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes are high conceptually (extinction of a language), but the conflict is largely internal and intellectual. The escalation moves through successful experiments rather than forced trade-offs or rising opposition. The stated cost of "sanity" is not visibly paid on the page, resulting in a lower sense of immediate peril.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from professional curiosity to profound personal upheaval. The pressure points—Magda’s challenge, Tom’s testimony, the mother’s call—cohere well. The final choice to abandon the report for "metamorphosis" represents a paid cost, foreclosing her previous life.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.1)
    The conflict is nominal; the opposition (statues) warns and approaches but is defeated the moment Lira decides to play harder. There is no point where the outcome is in doubt, no trade-off forced upon the protagonist, and no "visible or felt cost" paid to achieve the goal.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes are clear but the on-page pressure is low; the drone encounter is a minor beat that resolves without significant cost or tactical shift. The conflict remains largely atmospheric and thematic rather than urgent or transformative for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.8)
    External opposition is virtually absent; the machinery offers only a token "resist and then surrender," and the restoration proceeds without setbacks. The stakes of the silence are declared but not tested by pressure, resulting in a low-tension arc where the solution (fixing the ride) immediately solves the internal problem (voice).

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are purely intellectual and abstract; there is no penalty for failure and no external pressure forcing a decision. The conflict is a mild puzzle (a gap in the map) that resolves smoothly into an epiphany, lacking the friction or risk required for higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.5)
    The stakes are purely internal and low-pressure; there is no escalating external force or ticking clock, only a routine followed by a discovery. The conflict is resolved by receiving permission/validation from the absent character rather than the protagonist forcing a new reality through agency or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.0)
    The central conflict is internal, but the escalation is driven by the locksmith's exposition rather than rising narrative pressure or difficult choices. The resolution comes too easily—a moment of disorientation followed immediately by clarity—lacking a visible, paid cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are clearly defined (personal wholeness), but the on-page pressure is low; success feels inevitable once Mara enters the water. The external obstacles are static (tide, darkness), and the internal barrier (fear) is overcome in the first paragraph, reducing tension in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.0)
    The conflict is verbal and low-stakes on the page; Kael's resistance dissolves quickly without forcing Miren to adapt her tactics significantly. The resolution relies on the passage of time (the montage) rather than a decisive, high-pressure choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.9)
    Conflict is virtually absent; there is no antagonist, time pressure, or risk of failure shown on the page. The "struggle" is elided via summary ("hours" of work), and the stakes remain abstract ("wonder") rather than personal or immediate, resulting in zero effective escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    The escalation is driven by the shift from a physical puzzle (knots) to a moral one (the burden of the secret). While the resolution relies on an off-stage consequence (the brother on the cliff), the immediate pressure on Mara to inflict "truth" rather than peace creates sufficient on-page stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.5)
    The conflict is primarily interpretive—understanding the site versus documenting stability—which keeps the stakes low and cerebral. While the pattern-break (the head tilt, the spiral) provides a necessary turning point, the lack of external pressure or an antagonist results in a quiet, low-tension arc.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    While external physical obstacles are minimal, the intellectual and emotional deepening is substantial and creates a felt cost. The log's content exerts coherent pressure that forces the protagonist to abandon her initial goal of "solving" in favor of understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes are thematic rather than dramatic; there is no antagonist or visible cost to the protagonist's success. She faces no trade-off or risk during the storm, turning the climax into a sequence of unopposed actions rather than a test of agency.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clear and escalate emotionally as the diary entries shift from joy to disintegration. While the external pressure is low, the internal deepening is effective; the elevator creates a functional constraint on the reading time.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stakes are clear: professional reputation versus personal truth. The escalation occurs through the recontextualization of the "singing" from a symptom of hypoxia to valid data. While primarily internal, the pressure of the "careful, clinical eyes" of her peers provides sufficient antagonism.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.0)
    While the ticking clock of the demolition provides pressure, the protagonist faces no active opposition or difficult choices; she arrives, retrieves the object, and leaves. The conflict is entirely internal/thematic. The stakes feel intellectual rather than visceral, as the "secret" is handed to her via a journal entry rather than earned through struggle or deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are declared ("provisions for another week") rather than felt through immediate pressure. The conflict is low-voltage because the solution meets no resistance; Maren identifies the pattern and executes the fix in one smooth motion without a try-fail cycle or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pressure is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no opposition, time crunch, or risk of failure. The "soft hush" atmosphere pervades the conflict, resulting in a procedural sequence of tasks rather than a high-stakes test.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.5)
    Escalation suffers significantly from the "unanimous vote" resolution, which deflates the tension of the merchant ship's arrival immediately. The conflict between greed and community is stated rather than dramatized through genuine struggle or costly trade-offs. The ease with which the community rejects wealth for idealism reads as false complexity without on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are conceptually high (humanity's legacy), but the lack of active opposition or difficult choices creates a sense of inevitability. The narrative pressure is steady rather than escalating, resulting in a smooth but low-tension arc.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    The "night frost" establishes a tangible ticking clock that successfully pressurizes the rescue operation. The stakes are clear, though the mechanical birds function more as environmental pressure than an evolving tactical opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central conflict (divergent research paths) serves as the dominant stake, but the resolution offers "symmetric satisfaction"—Maya realizes she can do both. This "have your cake and eat it too" ending removes the necessity of choice, neutralizing the pressure rather than escalating it to a decision with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dramatic tension is low. While the concept is engaging, the story lacks a distinct antagonist or a tightening of stakes; Mira faces no risk of failure and pays no immediate personal price. The "lull" timeframe removes urgency rather than adding it, resulting in a contemplative vignette rather than a conflict-driven narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.9)
    The stakes are clear (being "subsumed" by remorse), but the escalation is somewhat linear; Maren encounters the threat and overcomes it with professional competence ("Chef's discipline") rather than a desperate improvisation or sacrifice. While the pressure is felt, the resolution comes relatively smoothly, lacking a moment where the outcome feels genuinely in doubt or where she must pay a steeper price.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the stakes of refugee isolation are conceptually high, the on-page pressure is low; the central conflict (Seven's silence) is overcome immediately with a simple prompt. The lack of escalation or setbacks prevents the tension from reaching a palpable peak.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.2)
    Escalation is low-friction; the danger of "recursive loops" is stated as a condition but does not actively jeopardize the outcome in the scene. The conflict resolves through an intellectual epiphany rather than a pressure-tested choice involving sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clearly established (the dying archive), but the conflict remains largely external and environmental. The &quot;sixty minutes&quot; constraint is stated but does not exert visceral ticking-clock pressure on the prose, and Celene overcomes the obstacles with a smoothness that lowers the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes remain abstract and the pressure is low; there is no active opposition or dilemma forcing a trade-off. The escalation relies solely on physical exertion ("strummed faster," "fingers bleeding"), which feels like a performance of stakes rather than narrative necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the external stakes are high (city destruction), the on-page escalation is weak because the protagonist meets no meaningful resistance. The magnetic beings cooperate instantly with her first attempt, removing the potential for escalating pressure or the necessity of a desperate, higher-cost choice.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    Internal stakes are high and clearly defined: the need to understand the sister's legacy. The fireworks act as a ticking clock and thematic counterpoint, though the external pressure is atmospheric rather than forcing a direct change in tactics. The cost paid is the emotional burden of "bearing witness," which is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.9)
    The central conflict is well-defined, but the escalation is passive; the protagonist waits for the flower to bloom rather than driving the action. The climax is endured in summary ("For three days and nights"), which distances the reader from the visceral cost of the stench and the effort of the resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.0)
    The time limit of the Turning creates effective situational pressure that tightens as gravity returns. While physical stakes are clear, the antagonism remains abstract until the final reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes remain intellectual rather than visceral; while the atmospheric pressure creates conceptual danger, Mara herself never faces a moment where she might fail or lose something of value. The resolution—that everyone is already safe—retroactively lowers the stakes, removing the urgency from her survey.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.6)
    While the global stakes (restoring wonder) are high, the immediate conflict is low-pressure; Kael faces no opposition or complication other than executing a task he is fully prepared for. The cost of &quot;dampening the voice&quot; is conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    Pressure accumulates coherently as Mira moves deeper into the silence, raising the stakes of what she might find. The conflict is primarily internal (guilt) externalized through the test of the flute. The resolution reconfigures the stakes—from a fixable failure to an inevitable ending—without deflating the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stakes are clear and escalate appropriately as the vanishing stars force a timeline on the protagonist's research. However, the interpersonal conflict resolves a bit too smoothly through dialogue, reducing the potential for a sharper emotional collision.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    The internal stakes are clear, but the external pressure is gentle; the conflict is man vs. self (anxiety) rather than high-stakes external opposition. While the "cost" of stopping is established (dusk coming early), the tension remains low-key. The escalation is thematic rather than dramatic, fitting the tone but limiting the intensity of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—validating her mentor’s secret legacy vs. maintaining rational safety—is clear. However, the escalation is relatively low-resistance; the magic affirms her desire immediately without forcing a difficult trade-off or failure first, reducing the felt pressure of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are high (life and death), and the cost is paid on the page, satisfying the closure requirement. However, the conflict lacks escalation; the protagonist faces endurance (bleeding fingers) but no active opposition or tactical dilemmas, resulting in a flat narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are handled excellently; the trade-off between the planet's life and Kael's identity is visceral and paid on the page in real-time. The cost is not theoretical but demonstrated through the specific erasure of memories (mother, cider, father's laugh) as the climax builds, charging the final image with earned tragedy.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes are clear—finding the lost mother versus the dangers of the rift—but the external pressure dissolves upon arrival. The conflict relies heavily on the internal weight of truth, which is compelling but resolved with a conversation rather than a forced trade-off or difficult action. The ending lands a felt cost (the weight of the task), but the path there lacks significant obstacles once the journey begins.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.3)
    The conflict is primarily internal and atmospheric, with the external pressure (the broken light) sidelined for the epistolary relationship. The escalation is gentle, moving from the lamp failure to the final letter, but lacks a sharp moment of risk or trade-off; the "cost" is purely emotional and stated rather than felt through a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.1)
    External pressure (the storm) is "greeted like an old friend" rather than battled, draining tension. The protagonist succeeds too easily with no visible personal cost or sacrifice on the page; the stakes for the salvage captain remain off-screen and abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are low and internal; the conflict is merely curiosity resolved by a convenient explanation. There is no moment of pressure where the protagonist must choose between conflicting values or face a cost for her acceptance. The resolution comes too easily, lacking a "tightening" beat.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.2)
    Conflict remains primarily thematic—measurement versus witness—without significant external opposition or internal doubt. Kael faces no tangible obstacles in reconfiguring the ancient machine; the storm adds atmospheric pressure but does not force a difficult tactical trade-off or cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes are high and the cost (Elara's existence) is clearly paid on the page. The conflict is primarily against entropy, lacking a sharp moment of doubt or active opposition; the solution (singing) works a bit too smoothly to generate peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=4.5)
    Tension is minimal throughout; the guardian figure is immediately "gentle" and protective, removing any potential antagonistic friction. The climax involves reading a text that explicitly explains the solution, bypassing the need for the protagonist to navigate a dilemma or make a risky decision under urgent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.1)
    The stakes are clear and well-escalated—memory versus oblivion—and the cost is felt in the bread, which becomes a relic of a lost reality. The conflict is quiet but persistent, resolving in a stance of endurance ("holy persistence") that fits the story's scale.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clearly established as the total loss of history, and the pressure of the falling library is constant. The escalation works well conceptually, though the summary of the rewriting process reduces the on-page conflict between Celeste’s skill and the failing machinery, missing a chance for a final tactical obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are immediate and high, balancing physical danger with emotional weight. The confrontation escalates logically, and the cost of the final decision—forgoing vengeance—is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.8)
    The pressure is primarily atmospheric rather than interpersonal or internal; the "mist-walker" offers only mild pushback. The protagonist’s surrender to the phenomenon lacks a moment of "tightening" where her skepticism forces a difficult trade-off; the cost of losing her old worldview is accepted too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=4.6)
    Tension evaporates immediately upon the antagonist's appearance, as the "thief" reveals herself to be a benevolent mentor. There is no escalation of pressure; the stakes are declared (a career, a soul) but never tested against a genuine obstacle or a hard tradeoff in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.4)
    Pressure is low; the antagonist (societal dishonesty) is abstract and offers no active resistance to the protagonist's journey. The resolution relies on a shared emotional realization without forcing a difficult trade-off, creating a low-stakes "tour" dynamic rather than a conflict-driven narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the stated stake ("something was being lost") meets no resistance on the page. The audience arrives, listens, and immediately receives the exact epiphany Mara intended, creating a "symmetric satisfaction" anti-pattern where success is guaranteed. There is no moment where the outcome is in doubt, nor any price paid for the transmission of this truth.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure is immediate and physical (paralysis), escalating clearly as navigation systems fail. The resolution requires a tangible trade-off—sacrificing the sentimental tether to regain function—which satisfies the requirement for on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are low for the POV character; Maya facilitates healing without facing any risk, trade-off, or loss, leaving the story without a "tightening" beat where options narrow. The conflict is primarily atmospheric, and the resolution comes without a felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pressure is low because the opposition is passive and unaware; the guards offer no active resistance, and the locks yield without a fight. The stakes are theoretically high, but without a moment where failure seems possible, the tension remains flat.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.3)
    The stakes are intensely personal rather than externally urgent, creating a quiet but deepening pressure centered on the fear of permanent loss. While the external conflict is low-key, the internal escalation—from witnessing loss to actively fighting entropy—creates a coherent emotional drive.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.6)
    While the stakes are globally high (apocalypse), the immediate dramatic pressure is low; the protagonist faces no active opposition, resource scarcity, or risk of failure. The escalation is procedural—finding the source—rather than a rise in tension or difficulty, leading to a flat narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are clear—truth versus comfortable pretense—but the conflict resolves with minimal resistance. The narrator's "interrogation" meets immediate compliance rather than evasion, reducing the potential tension of the climax. The cost of the revelation is intellectual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.6)
    Escalation is weak; Director Chen represents the status quo but offers almost no resistance, shifting from caution to full support within a few lines. The central conflict is theoretical rather than dramatic; the protagonist faces no genuine risk of failure, neutralizing the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are high in concept (treason, kingdom's freedom) but low in the scene itself, as Lien faces no external resistance or internal doubt during the act. The accumulation of pressure is textural rather than conflict-driven; she works with "certainty," removing the possibility of failure or cost from the reader's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes remain low as the investigation encounters no active opposition; the "webs of intrigue" never threaten Kael. The conflict is purely epistemic—she doesn't know, then she knows—and the resolution arrives as a gift of understanding rather than a hard-won victory requiring trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.8)
    Pressure is low; the investigation proceeds linearly without active opposition or time constraints, and the climax is a quiet realization rather than a high-stakes confrontation or trade-off that forces a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.2)
    Pressure is mild; the story operates as a vignette where the primary conflict (teaching the student) is anticipatory rather than immediate. While the decision to use the whisk as a test forecloses a path, the lack of immediate opposition or felt cost keeps the narrative tension in the lower bands.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are high (survival of the orchard), but the conflict is primarily intellectual and resolved through a montage rather than active struggle. The antagonist pressure from the survivors remains off-page and abstract, reducing the immediate dramatic heat of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.0)
    Conflict is distant and summarized; the factions and threats exist "below" and do not exert immediate pressure on Vera. There is no on-page escalation that forces a trade-off or tests her resolve; the stakes remain theoretical rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.0)
    The conflict is low-stakes and purely internal; with no external resistance or risk of failure, the resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are clearly defined: the destruction of the marina versus the "absolution" of the ice. The conflict between preservation and release drives the scene, though the physical confrontation is resolved somewhat quickly via the "humming" mechanic. The cost—Kael's freezing—is visible and permanent.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.9)
    Tension is low because the protagonist’s plan encounters no active resistance; the "Directorate" remains an abstract threat. There is no escalation of stakes—no near-miss, equipment failure, or personnel issue forces a trade-off or raises the cost of success.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes (career vs. truth) are established early, and the pressure escalates with the discovery of evidence. However, the cost of the final choice is intellectualized rather than felt; the ending asserts victory over Director Chen prematurely, dampening the sense of risk essential to the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are declared but not tested; the environment offers no resistance to Marcus's goal, and the coincidence involving the box dissolves tension immediately. The "second opinion" concept is introduced as dialogue but does not shape the strategic landscape or escalate the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation is primarily intellectual—moving from predicting simple desires to the "dissolution of boundaries"—which fits the meditative tone but lacks urgent, immediate stakes. The pressure remains internal and abstract, absent a concrete antagonist or ticking clock that would force a sharper tactical trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from a technical puzzle to a personal crisis involving a lost sibling and potential treason. The "lie" to the supervisor serves as a functional test of commitment, raising the immediate tension. The final choice to initiate extraction forecloses the path of safety, establishing a clear cost to the protagonist's career and freedom.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.0)
    There is virtually no escalation or genuine opposition; the leaders enter with a feud but offer no meaningful resistance to Kael's intervention. The "weighted breath" suggests tension that never materializes on the page, as the conflict evaporates the moment the magical object is introduced.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are existential and immediate, balancing the physical survival of the family with Vera's metaphysical struggle with endings. The escalation on the ice floe forces Vera to confront life's persistence, challenging her scripted exit. The resolution doesn't solve the problem of death but reframes the waiting, successfully tightening the narrative focus.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear (personal desire vs. family/social expectation), and the conversation effectively escalates the intimacy. However, the conflict resolves somewhat easily through the metaphor, lacking a moment of sharp, visceral resistance before the agreement.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the conceptual stakes (loss of wisdom) are high, the dramatic pressure within the scene is low. The Prophet offers no resistance, and the ritual proceeds without error; the cost is intellectualized rather than felt as an agonizing trade-off in the moment of action.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are declared but never tested; the protagonist faces no opposition from Thomas or the townspeople, who accept the intervention immediately. The absence of friction or the risk of failure means there is no escalation, leaving the emotional payoff unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake is high in concept but low in on-page friction; the antagonist (the Council) is entirely off-stage. Escalation is internal and anticipatory, lacking a moment of active external resistance or a difficult choice beyond the resolve to speak.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes are quiet and philosophical, fitting the genre, but the tension remains low throughout; success feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle against the condition. The conflict is internal and atmospheric, lacking a sharp moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.5)
    The external stakes (tremors vs. transit) escalate well, but the interpersonal conflict dissolves too easily. Director Chen accepts Mira's unorthodox solution immediately ("It's measuring the tremors," he breathed), removing potential friction or cost from the climax. The resolution feels earned intellectually but lacks interpersonal or professional fallout.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=3.5)
    The central conflict dissolves without visible cost or struggle; Linda's fifteen-year estrangement melts away instantly upon a single phone notification ("I'll come tomorrow"), rendering the stakes toothless. There is no moment of difficult choice or sacrifice for any character; the reconciliation is granted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.8)
    The approaching noon acts as a definitive ticking clock that escalates pressure naturally. The stakes shift seamlessly from intellectual curiosity to existential survival, forcing a stance crystallization that carries immense felt cost (dissolution vs. incompleteness).

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story lacks significant escalation or opposition. Maren arrives, understands the problem immediately, and fixes it on the first attempt without setbacks or deepening complications. The absence of a tangible antagonist or a moment of failure lowers the stakes to a puzzle-solving exercise.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.5)
    The stakes are primarily internal and retrospective, centered on managing grief through ritual. While the specific memory of the daughter provides a moment of deepening, the conflict is low-voltage; the ritual easily overcomes the resistance of the memories. The "struggle" feels largely resolved before the scene begins, reducing the immediate dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    The emotional stakes are high, but the conflict resolves with relatively low friction; the antagonist (the executive) yields to Mira’s wisdom without significant resistance. The tension dissipates through dialogue rather than a costly trade-off or difficult action.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (resolving the book/grief) is clear, but the escalation relies on a single chance encounter. While the internal cost of accepting the "fragmented" nature of grief is legible, the external pressure is brief and the resolution arrives somewhat easily via the stranger's advice.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is the story's weakest element; the obstacle is passive (erosion of time) and the resolution requires only effort, not sacrifice or trade-off. The escalation—singing faster as the sun rises—lacks the distinct pressure needed to force a character-revealing choice.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are clearly signaled (connection vs. loss) and escalate from local grief to cosmic entanglement. The pressure is largely internal and environmental (the "held breath"), which works well, though the lack of active opposition limits the dynamic range slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes remain low and intellectual; the protagonist faces a puzzle she is perfectly equipped to solve without opposition, time pressure, or the risk of failure to tighten the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are abstract; while the tension between finite collection and infinite existence is legible, the external pressure is low. The resolution arrives through observation rather than a costly struggle, making the "trap" feel more like a premise condition than an active antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (managing grief) is clear, but the conflict is largely retrospective and internal. The protagonist has already mastered her method, meaning there is little active resistance or risk of failure in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.5)
    Coherent pressure centers on the conflict between past ambition and present inertia. The cost is legible—accepting "small gardens" over the promised city—though the ghost remains somewhat passive, limiting the dynamic range of the negotiation.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is virtually no active conflict; entropy is overcome via a montage of smooth logistics (filing permits, recruiting volunteers). The protagonist faces no opposition from the building, the bureaucracy, or the community, resulting in a flat trajectory with no escalation or stakes testing her commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are clearly defined but remain low-pressure and entirely internal. The escalation tracks the physical act of playing, but the lack of external friction or harder trade-offs limits the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes shift meaningfully from a treasure hunt to a quest for historical truth, with a tangible sense of loss regarding the "magic." The conflict is internal and atmospheric; while the external pressure is low, the conceptual tightening works.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is minimal; the primary obstacle is the intellectual task of decoding, which Maren overcomes easily via established expertise. The stakes (the widow's garden) are external and abstract, and the solution requires no difficult trade-off or price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes are clear but purely internal, and the resolution comes too smoothly; Marina faces no risk of failure, and Thomas's resistance yields to a single speech. The absence of external pressure or a cost paid within the scene keeps the tension relatively low.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are clearly signaled early and escalate through the risks of the forbidden experiment. While the internal struggle is strong, the external antagonism (the father) is resolved with low friction, lacking a pivotal moment where the prince is forced to make a harder trade-off to protect his creation.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.6)
    Pressure is low; the stakes are emotional but treated with a gentle, therapeutic touch that avoids risk. Maya encounters no significant obstacle in reaching Marcus, and his acceptance comes without a visible price or struggle, flattening the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.6)
    Tension is dampened by the fact that the clues &quot;wanted to be followed&quot; and the box &quot;wanted&quot; to open. There is no active antagonist or significant environmental pressure forcing Mara to make difficult trade-offs; the hurdle of the box being &quot;outside time&quot; is solved almost immediately by her inherent attributes. The stakes are high in concept (city's memory) but low in immediate narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are conceptually high (civilizational survival) and the internal cost of endurance is felt. However, the pressure is largely retrospective; the antagonist is the pattern of history rather than an immediate, active force, which softens the scene's urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.1)
    There is virtually no conflict; the protagonist wants knowledge and the antagonist (if the ghost can be called that) immediately provides it without asking a price. The lack of obstacles or opposing forces results in a flat trajectory where "escalation" is merely the passage of time and the accumulation of information.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes are high in concept (souls, grief), but the scene lacks immediate friction or opposition; the ritual proceeds perfectly without a hitch or moment of doubt. While the deepening of the burden is felt, the absence of an active obstacle limits the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative lacks a dominant stake or opposing pressure; Mira faces a puzzle, not a conflict. The process of decoding is a matter of time ("Hours passed") rather than risk, cost, or difficult trade-offs, resulting in a cozy mystery feel that lacks literary tension.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story lacks on-page tension; the "impossible task" is resolved through summary competence without obstacles or failure. The line "The quill never faltered" explicitly removes the possibility of struggle, rendering the stakes theoretical rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are clear, but the central test (the patrol) is passed too easily via a simple hiding action; the lack of a forced trade-off or lasting cost limits the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are high and intimate: the mentor's dying wish versus the protagonist's emotional need to preserve. The tension escalates through the slowing chair, culminating in a choice that satisfies the mentor but burdens the protagonist with a permanent, reconstructed secret.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are conceptually high (truth vs. erasure) and the cost (irrelevance/isolation) is felt. However, the escalation is mild; the patrol boat represents a threat, but Marcellus evades it with static silence rather than a forced choice or sacrifice. The conflict remains largely external and atmospheric rather than driving urgent on-page agency.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is abstract and resolved via summary narration; there is no specific, high-pressure moment where the outcome is in doubt. The friction between "inherited loyalties" and "exhausted hearts" is smoothed over by the narrator without a visible price paid by the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story lacks immediate on-page pressure or resistance. The antagonist (the Council) is absent, and the primary action (pruning) presents no difficult trade-offs; removing "cruelty" and "ignorance" to save the tree is an obvious, safe choice. Without a moment where Mara must sacrifice something valuable or risk failure, the stakes remain theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist meets no resistance from the stranger, the riddle, or the engineer. The global stakes (food supply) are declared, but the on-page execution lacks tension, as the solution faces no testing or skepticism.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes remain low and abstract throughout; the "tension" is purely atmospheric ("house held its breath") with no visible cost or risk to the protagonist. The resolution comes without a demand for sacrifice or significant trade-off, limiting the dramatic impact.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central conflict (certainty vs. nuance) is clear but resolved largely through exposition rather than a battle of wills. The woman accepts the radical rewriting of her history with surprisingly little resistance, lowering the felt stakes of the climax. The pressure is intellectual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    The conflict escalates cleanly from a struggle against the environment to a struggle against the implications of her own data. The cost is visceral—the loss of the hope for a simple exit—and the "terrible clarity" of the climax reweights the stakes effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.4)
    Conflict is conceptual and low-stakes; the opposing force (city indifference) creates no active resistance in the scene. The "struggle" to paint is immediately resolved by the magic brush, leaving the protagonist with no difficult trade-offs or tangible costs to pay.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes (cultural erasure vs. persistence) are clear and felt. While the conflict is resolved somewhat easily with a single invitation, the move represents a significant shift in stance for Celeste—from curator of the dead to facilitator of the living. The "cost" is subtle—the shedding of her professional mask—but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes are high (survival vs. unmaking), and the realization regarding the ancient people's fate adds a necessary tightening of the screw. Yet, the protagonist faces no true external opposition or failure during the repair process, making his success feel inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.1)
    The stakes are existential and clear, centering on the terror of erasure, but the escalation is diffused by the advisor's immediate provision of the answer. The conflict shifts from a visceral struggle against the curse to a philosophical acceptance too smoothly, lacking the friction of a genuine dilemma or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the external threat is massive, the climax is delivered via summary ("For three hours she played...") rather than a dramatized scene with specific, hard choices. This distance reduces the visceral pressure, making the victory feel inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the global stakes are high (the fate of the city), the immediate scene pressure is low. Mira encounters no active opposition from the Council or the environment; her descent and investigation proceed linearly without a moment where she must risk something personal or overcome a direct threat to succeed.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake (truth vs. career) is signaled early and resolved on page. The pressure is coherent, though the antagonist (The Council) remains abstract, making the conflict feel more intellectual than visceral until the final cost is accepted.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; there is no external opposition, and the internal struggle is recounted as backstory rather than dramatized in the moment. The stakes, while thematic (memory vs. oblivion), are not tested by immediate pressure or risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clear, and the blackout raises the immediate physical pressure. The "footsteps" beat provides a necessary escalation, though it is a fairly standard thriller trope. The cost is primarily the risk taken rather than a price paid on the page, but the final stance of resistance feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.7)
    Escalation is linear and handled primarily through summary; there is no distinct on-page obstacle or reversal that forces a difficult tactical shift. The arrival of the community diffuses tension rather than sharpening the specific pressure on Mira to confront her own grief.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.0)
    The stakes escalate cleanly from personal obsession to existential threat, with the physical cost (altitude dropping) mirroring the moral threshold. The final choice forecloses the safety of the status quo with undeniable impact.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.4)
    External pressure is minimal; the discovery process faces no technical or environmental obstacles. The stakes are purely internal and resolved instantly by the drone's success, lacking a moment where failure was a genuine risk.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes escalate from a professional dispute to a complex ethical dilemma. The "deepening" occurs not through external action but through the recontextualization of the antagonist's (the grandfather's) legacy, forcing Maren to trade her protective lie for a more difficult truth.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure is coherent, escalating from the external demand for terms to the immediate risk of exposing state secrets. The exchange of vulnerabilities (coordinates vs. court-martial) creates a meaningful deepening of the bond.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.1)
    While the stakes of safety vs. fulfillment are clear, the on-page conflict is low; the protagonist’s decision meets little resistance once the external invitation arrives. The "backlash of regrets" functions more as a summary of feeling than an active pressure cooker, making the final choice feel inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.1)
    While the stakes (redemption, the return of feeling) are high, the protagonist faces minimal active opposition; she finds the clues, drives to the location, and receives the answer without significant struggle or reversal. The cost of her transformation is stated abstractly as a future commitment rather than paid visibly in the scene through a painful sacrifice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake is clear, but the cost of the transformation is mitigated by the ending, which implies Mira can now shift between worlds at will. This resolution reads more like a gain of power than a "reluctant endurance" with lasting sacrifice, lowering the felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—recovering time—is tested and ultimately reconfigured through the ritual. While the antagonist is abstract (time/guilt), the pressure is sustained, and the cost of the realization is felt in the final acceptance of the "gap."

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stakes are clear and the pressure escalates coherently through the stitching process. The cost of the resolution is stated ("painfully completed") rather than dramatized as a distinct sacrifice or trade-off, which softens the impact of the final victory.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no opposition, obstacles, or hard trade-offs. The narrative relies on the external spectacle of the celestial alignment and volcano rather than generating tension between the character's wants, fears, or limitations.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes are stated (prisoners, revolution) but the on-page pressure is low because the antagonist, Captain Voss, is dismissed as incompetent. The climax relies on his lack of imagination rather than Mira's tactical ingenuity under genuine duress, mitigating the sense of danger.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are clearly defined (survival vs. unraveling), and the "curse" adds effective time pressure to the scene. While the escalation is solid, the resolution dissolves the conflict through realization rather than a costly trade-off or sacrifice, softening the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.8)
    The shift from developing personal artistic scars to evidence of war crimes provides a meaningful deepening of stakes. The danger is clearly signaled ("kill to keep hidden"), creating a felt cost for the final choice. The pressure remains largely internal/potential until the envelope is opened, but the escalation works well.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are clear—the survival of the intellectual underground—and the duel provides a tangible physical metaphor for the ideological conflict. The decision to reveal the sundial code introduces a genuine risk (cost) of exposing the network, which effectively heightens the pressure of the negotiation.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are internal and clear, but the external pressure is low; the project succeeds without resistance, and the conflict is resolved primarily through affirmation rather than forced trade-offs. The lack of an antagonist or environmental pushback makes the victory feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.5)
    The conflict is primarily internal (erasure vs. expression) and resolves without significant external opposition or cost. The protagonist enters the refuge and achieves validation smoothly; the "time was limited" constraint adds minor pressure but does not force a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.6)
    The stakes are high (cultural erasure), but the pressure on the protagonist is low; she faces no active antagonist or difficult trade-off, merely a task to complete. The "doubt" mentioned is not dramatized as a force that actually impedes her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.4)
    The stakes are clear, but the escalation encounters little resistance; Marisol accepts the new interpretation of her mother's actions immediately upon hearing it. The forgiveness feels granted by the plot device rather than paid for with a difficult emotional trade-off or renunciation.

Cost is visible: the woman’s tears and steady exhalation. Agency is shared; Marina’s instruction and the woman’s compliance narrow options together. Escalation is modest but coherent under Accumulative lens; no reversal, only deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—save the seed vault from both incoming regimes—signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened when boots approach; options narrow to “impede them, buy minutes.” One meaningful escalation: her decision to stand, raise chained hands, and lie “I’m the librarian” trades personal safety for seed survival with on-page cost (possible execution). Agency is decision, not force; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. The price—loss of anonymity and potential death—charges the final image under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—capture the exact frequency of trust fracturing—stays singular and escalates by density, not twist. Each collected absence thickens the acoustic slurry until substitution itself becomes irreversible; the tightening is the deepening. Protagonist agency is absolute: she selects whose hollow to sample, sacrifices her own future silence, decides the final alloy. Price is legible: her thumb on warm silver fuses living tissue to device—future clients hear through her dying.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“see versus possess illuminated moments”—is signaled early and tightened when the self-portrait threatens her self-concept. The reversal (she must give, not take) carries felt price: she scatters her life’s work. Agency is high; coincidence is decorative, not decisive. The escalation is single-tier; no secondary obstacle arises after the moon-curtain, keeping pressure just under the 8-band ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can art hold fragility without demanding answers—tightens once when she suspends shards inside the sphere, paying visible labor/time. No external antagonist, but spring’s slow violence complicates; price is 18-hour anneal wait and the elegiac soundscape. Escalation is accumulative: each icicle drip thickens atmosphere until final gutter-crack; agency remains her decision to keep sketching.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is identity survival: “entire constructed life had been someone else’s design.” Tightening occurs when Carson appears wearing the missing shell half, upgrading threat from abstract to embodied. Escalation is causal: each decryption act (cast, shell) forecloses ignorance and tightens physical space—officers now surround. Cost is visible: Maya trades the safety of denial for the danger of testimony; vulnerability chosen over faked courage is the price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake = learn to navigate the coming dark. Escalation is textural: each vanished star layers Silence-density until the hush becomes navigable medium; final pulse of the last star is the tightening beat. No reversible antagonist, but that fits Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—loss of entire sky—so price is legible but not corporeal, holding the score under 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: “find where thoughts come from” signaled line 1; escalation is density-driven, not causal-chain. Violin appearance supplies single meaningful deepening that reweights knowledge; cost is legible—acceptance of perpetual loop forecloses escape. No reversal or antagonist required under Accumulative lens; pressure coheres through pattern intensification.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from recursive janitorial motion transmuted into metaphysics; no explicit thesis stated. Final image of sweeping ice patterns that “freeze again by the next loop” offers non-literal answer—consciousness is the pattern of its own repetition. Resists moralizing; ambiguity lingers about whether synthesis is transcendence or trap. Violin as crystallized thought is fresh emblem that reprises at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—will institutional silence survive?—tightens once: Mira’s eavesdrop makes shared confession irreversible, narrowing Viktor’s exit strategies. Cost is visible (public exposure, job loss) yet understated; no bodily or material price is dramatized, holding the score below 8. Pressure is coherent under Causal lens; coincidence never rescues. Agency is joint, but protagonist-driven; Mira’s decision to speak triggers the collective stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—prove gardens remember—signals early and tightens when she stakes her career on overnight resurrection. One meaningful reversal: deliberate decline → explosive regrowth, triggered by her resumption of care. Cost is legible—public humiliation risk, garden death risk, her last professional breath. Coincidence absent; algorithmic “luck” is undercut, not relied on.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—prove time moves sideways—is signaled early and tightens when she must decide whether to expose her forbidden data. One meaningful turn: Voss’s arrival forces disclosure, narrowing options from secrecy to shared revelation. Cost is intellectual jeopardy (loss of anonymity) rather than tangible forfeiture; stakes would sharpen if career or relationship penalty were made vivid. Escalation remains causal and coherent under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.2)
    Primary stake—recover lost music/true art form—emerges the moment she lifts the bloated program; pressure tightens when the map shows she stands on the hiding spot, leaving no option but to submerge her arms for the prize. Physical stakes (condemned building, murky water) run parallel but never overshadow the creative quest, keeping tension coherent. One escalation beat suffices and is delivered; cost is felt in her soaked skin and the implicit vow to “disrupt everything she thought she knew.” The lanterns’ calm after the plunge signals acceptance of that cost.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—how to live with the margin that killed Eva—tightens when the smudge literalizes error. One meaningful deepening: “certainty is what killed her” re-prices the cost of false positives. Agency is renunciation of the old threshold; pressure coheres under Causal lens. Cost is legible: professional credibility will suffer, but Mira accepts that price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. self-protection—is signaled early via callers’ guilt. Pressure tightens when the radio confession airs live in the tunnel, narrowing Mara’s options to “photograph everything” and escalate to authorities. Cost is visible: she accepts the moral burden of exposing thirty-year-old murders, forfeiting neutrality. Because the price is moral rather than physical, and the men’s stakes overshadow hers, the escalation peaks at 7.6 rather than 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—witness without judgment—tightens once: the stone offers deeper witness, she accepts, and the price is future oblivion. Escalation is textural density, not causal reversal; the library’s slow collapse is the pressure. Cost is conceptual (loss of precise recall) rather than visceral, adequate at this length but not punishing enough for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake is the mother-daughter emotional gulf; eclipse + curl act as intensifiers that force a public, vulnerable moment. One meaningful tightening: Diane’s phone lowers, knees touch ground—option to stay distracted is foreclosed by the uncanny dark and the exposed keepsake. Cost is emotional, not tactical: decades of polite distance collapse into sobbing contact. Agency is mostly Diane’s; Maya facilitates without hazard, so pressure plateaus rather than escalates for the therapist-protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving human resonance—arrives early but stays abstract; pressure accumulates through density of artifacts rather than narrowing options. The tightening is lyrical, not tactical: the historian never faces a fork where preservation costs her safety, time, or hope. Escalation is atmospheric; cost is cosmic, not personal, keeping the score just below the 7.0 threshold for visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—authorship vs. consequence—tightens when the stranger reveals the espionage chain; options narrow to own or deny the flow. Escalation driven by Margaret’s stunned recognition, not coincidence; final choice to keep writing forecloses the “innocent” path. Cost is existential: she must live with accidental geopolitical weight. One deepening suffices; no repeated reversals needed.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—prevent full possession—signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens through each philosophical “plumb”; agency is Micah’s escalating questions that corner the entity into self-contradiction. The felt price (his shaking hands, Elena’s gasp) is visible, satisfying the 8.8+ cost gate. Escalation is steady but single-track; no secondary obstacle or timing reversal, keeping it just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can she mine enough authentic memory before exhaustion shatters the mirror-world. Pressure escalates via accretion of fortunes and ticking dawn; each slip tightens the remaining window. No external antagonist needed—exodus of light is the irreversible opponent. Cost is visible: the final sentence concedes her body to rest, foreclosing further creation today.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—find the perfect self or accept fragmentation—tightens via procedural overload: each new timeline consumed corrodes hope, a visible price paid in the viaduct’s perceived dimming. One meaningful intensification occurs when she reads the new rune sentence; it forecloses the conquering path and reframes her only option as endurance. Agency remains hers—she chooses to fall, to inhabit, to walk home. Cost is legible but not viscerally physical; the loss is conceptual, sufficient under an Accumulative lens yet just shy of the 8.8 gate that demands a more acute felt wound.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—defeat emotional numbness—is signaled in para 2. Escalation is textural: each backward track adds weight to the “filament” until the students’ tear-stained faces make the cost visible. No single reversal, but the deepening pattern tightens the noose of feeling until silence itself becomes unbearably loud. Price paid: Mira’s private hollow is invaded by the world she sought to heal.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—protecting truth without becoming partisan—tightens when message reveals data can be “weaponized.” Single meaningful turn: she decides to create an unweaponizable archive; this narrows her future options and increases personal risk. Pressure stays coherent under Causal lens; no off-stage rescue. Cost is conceptual (perpetual vulnerability) rather than visceral, keeping it just shy of the 8.5 band.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will scent reactivate grief?—tightens once: the moment new petals release fragrance alongside old vial. Agency is Dalton’s decision to keep the empty vial, trading future comfort for authentic memory. Cost is legible: he accepts permanent sorrow. No coincidence; escalation is purely because/therefore under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“what kind of reality to inhabit”—is signaled early and tightens when the liquid layer reveals infinite branches, forcing stance crystallization. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; the rope’s ghost-memory supplies visible price. No reversal is needed under the Accumulative lens; pattern density itself escalates cost.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are atmospheric: will the chronic hush keep suffocating life? The tightening is the gradual layering of released fragments; options narrow to: finish songs (false cure) or let them stay unfinished (true release). No external antagonist, but the pressure coheres under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible—she forfeits closure for the world, accepting perpetual incompletion.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake: will Thomas keep or lose the authentic pain of his daughter’s memory? Tightening occurs when Maren presses the petal—this single action irreversibly replaces jagged purple lightning with regulated amber. Agency is shared: Thomas consents, Maren executes, both pay—he loses raw grief, she loses another layer of integrity. Escalation is causal and irreversible; no coincidence intervenes, and the cost is felt on the page in the wrist-blotter beat.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—recognition for invisible labor—is signaled early and escalates once: from private guilt to public commitment. The tightening beat is her on-page proposal to Theo, which forecloses her former neutrality and risks reputation and resources. Cost is legible: she leaves the safety of anonymity to champion night crews. No secondary reversal is needed at this length; pressure coheres under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—belonging—signals early (“her art might mean belonging”) and tightens through each nightly walk: every shared story exchanges outsider knowledge for insider credit. Mid-point deepening occurs when she pledges the sculpture, converting passive hope into accountable gift that forecloses retreat. Cost is visible: sleep-forfeiting nights, reed stores consumed, outsider status finally abandoned. Agency stays hers throughout; the community never hands her belonging—she builds it, literally and figuratively.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—recover the birth-moment of echoes—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when each cage opened releases a sound that retroactively completes its own cadence, deepening rather than widening stakes. Agency is continuous: every theft of seconds visibly drains the pendant, altering tactics (accelerated bubble, lock-aging touch). Cost is on-page: “the borrowed time she carried flowed out freely” and the pendant ends “cool and quiet,” a tangible forfeiture. Meets the 8.8+ gate: visible price that charges the final image under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—find the formula for forgetting—tightens when the flower’s dew displays numbers, forcing Marius to confront that love changes state rather than vanishes. The Fibonacci spiral is the single decisive intensification: it converts abstract grief into visual proof, narrowing options from “recover her” to “honor the pattern.” Cost is legible: the glass eyes dissolve, leaving him with an irreversible new geometry. Pressure remains accumulative; no coincidence resolves the conflict—only the internal shift from measurement to acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—visibility versus extinction—tightens once when the tape smell converts hiding into active outreach. Agency is renunciation: Maren surrenders perfect invisibility, paying the price of possible discovery. Escalation is a single deepening, not multiple reversals, sufficient for 800-word scope. Cost is legible: the grate left ajar, the boy’s eyes locking on her, irrevocable.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—thresh meaning from survival—tightens when the convergence basin offers a concrete pattern (buried brooches). The exchange ritual is the single meaningful turn that narrows options: participation commits her to shared witness, enabling the first sleep and the final choice to keep painting. Pressure is textural, not causal-oppositional, but remains coherent under the Accumulative lens. Cost is visible: the still-wet canvas risks destruction during the wade back, stakes literalized in salt water.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—preservation of sanctuary versus evolution of magic—tightens when shadows feed on the awakened pearl, foreclosing Vera’s control. One meaningful deepening: the forces she cultivated now inhabit the space, narrowing her options to acceptance. Cost is visible in her admission “I don’t know,” a forfeiture of clairvoyant identity.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stake—“fishermen won’t go out”—is signaled early and tightens once when Maris re-maps routes. Cost is legible: she stakes her life on untested charts. No secondary reversal, but single meaningful turn is sufficient under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“can she read and survive the hidden map?”—is signaled at word 40. Escalation is accretive: each arrow raises the impossibility density, forcing her forward. The fortress gate renunciation (she may take only one truth) forges a visible trade-off. Cost is present but abstract (lifetime mission) rather than bodily or immediate; that softness caps the score below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: can she bear to keep feeling others’ pain? Escalation occurs when the tile’s shift forces her to relive her own failures; the tightening is the realization that the library is endless and her transcription will never finish. The price—staying—lands on the page. One meaningful deepening is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—what lies after goodbye—arrives early; spatial mutiny supplies escalating pressure via corridor-opening and fragment-burn. One meaningful tightening: the staircase appears with a visible “hours” countdown, narrowing options. Cost is conceptual rather than tangible, adequate for length, though tension peaks in image, not visceral risk.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—truth versus survival—tightens when Pavel reveals the swallowed SD; the night-long vigil becomes the only permissible “breach.” Escalation is accumulative: each hour of waiting enlarges the cost of honesty. The final documentation act forecloses Mira’s latent temptation to forge, trading her father’s criminal toolkit for a single lawful signature—price paid on the page.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as testamentary arithmetic: stories > forgeries. No moralizing; the final line (“testimony as currency”) is spoken by Mira to Pavel, not authorial assertion. Subtext pulses in silent gestures—Pavel clutching the rinsed capsule to his chest while Mira re-caps her father’s pot. The indigo stain recurs as charged object, reweighted from instrument of lies to witness of truth.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve invented histories against oblivion—tightens once: from private data (notepad) to public artifact (hidden page). Escalation is textural, not causal: accumulation of gold-leafed sheets raises implicit risk of discovery or erasure, cost felt when she surrenders the sheet to weather. Agency remains continuous (chart, seal, walk, deposit) so pressure coheres; silence of town externalizes stakes without competing antagonist. Could use one sharper material risk (moisture, intrusion) to push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: resurrect the buried toxic history before memory fully rots. Escalation is textural—each overheard fragment tightens the noose of proof, culminating in the generational mutation anecdote that makes the cost bodily. Agency is observational but not passive; she risks exposure every time she climbs, and her final stance to “continue across the rhythm of tides” forecloses re-entry into legal life. One tightening beat suffices; cost is embodied in her permanent exile.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“what if one legend were true?”—tightens across three iterative listenings until the cello forces a public-private renunciation of her life’s work. Agency is continuous: she climbs, listens, speaks, paints. The escalation is accumulative: each hum thickens the acoustic texture and narrows her options. Cost is legible—her professional identity is surrendered—but the external world offers no pushback, so pressure is largely internal.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—preserve carnival agency inside privatization—is signaled early and tightens when water-rights graffiti accelerates the council vote. Mira’s agency is decisive: she pivots from sabotage to cooperative shares, foreclosing pure resistance. Cost is visible: the yellow star slip shows mis-coding can evacuate her own side. Pressure escalates along one clean curve; no false cliffhangers.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—“restore this drone to wholeness”—is signaled early and deepened through micro-obstacles (wing crack, motor stutter), but pressure stays technical, never personal or urgent. No visible price is paid: time, money, reputation, or physical risk never tilt. The Mercantile’s departure offers a tonal contrast, not a complication. Escalation is present but gentle; the final hum feels like expected success, not narrowed options.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—prove the lake is rivers’ origin/terminus—remains coherent; escalation is intellectual, not lethal yet: each decoded symbol narrows her epistemic options until the reversal hypothesis forecloses standard hydrology. Price is conceptual (career credibility, possible death off-page) rather than visceral today; one explicit tangible loss (rusted window frame) signals environment’s quiet corrosion, but the tightening would hit harder if an immediate on-page forfeiture accompanied the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—town extinction—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened by the three-week clock. Escalation is textural: each circuit layers frequency until the pattern break (true bells) reweights absence into presence. No antagonist is needed; the fracture itself is the pressure. Cost is conceptual—the tuner’s perpetual exile—but still legible on the page, meeting the 8-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—save Thalia before field collapses—signaled by line 4 and tightens through live countdown (“field would fail in hours”). Marina’s agency drives every escalation: she descends, touches, calculates, triggers; no coincidence resolves. The price is legible—temple destroyed, path foreclosed, knowledge lost except the vial—meeting the 8.8+ cost gate. Only one tightening cycle fits the length, satisfying the single-deepening allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can Marcus speak and be believed?—is signaled in paragraph two. Pressure tightens once: the falling tide literally bares the consequence of his silence, forcing the final stance. Protagonist agency drives every beat; even inaction (watching swimmers die) is a conscious tactic toward “hush.” The price paid—complicity in three deaths—alters the moral geometry and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—harvest soul-medicine for a disconnected world—arrives late but is back-illuminated by the ghost’s revelation that “the world beyond these fields suffers plagues of disconnection.” Escalation is accumulative: each cameo intensifies fruit potency and Elara’s sense of destiny rather than narrowing tactical options. The visible price is lifelong night and solitude; it is declared, not dramatized in a single beat, but the final bead-placement ritualizes that cost on-page. Agency is acceptance rather than overt struggle, fitting the lyric-situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.5)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restitch severed continuity—tightens when each skeletal chamber confronts Mira with ancestral time. Agency is present in every descent/ascent and in the choice to rebuild the sundial; the felt price is the certainty of future departure. Escalation is single-curve (density, not reversal) yet sufficient under accretive lens. No swappable loss or tool breakage visible on-page holds it from 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving analog identity channels—tightens once: from decoding chalk to committing new names before courier arrival. Agency is renunciation: Maya smears the code, accepts perpetuation of erasure. Cost is visible: the chalk’s destruction + her graphite traces that will fade. Under Accumulative lens, the deepening pattern (each analog artifact is more fragile) reweights the stake; no reversal is needed. The climb toward 8.8 is barred because the cost, while felt, is not yet personal—Maya risks no imminent capture or loss in this beat.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preventing the coup—emerges gradually but legibly; each cartographic tidbit tightens the noose around the capital. One meaningful deepening occurs when candle-backlight flips the stitched map, turning decor into intelligence and forcing Mira’s hand. Cost is palpable: she forfeits her protective invisibility the instant she decides to “giggle” her warning to the guard captain. Agency is accumulative rather than explosive, fitting the lens, but the shift from passive to active is unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will she reclaim the unspoken apology?—is signaled in paragraph 1. Pressure tightens once: the shard’s moon-lit memory forces a re-seeing that collapses her old self-justification. Cost is visible—she runs, letters in both hands, toward an uncertain living encounter—but the tightening is single, not iterative, so escalation is modest but sufficient. Under Accumulative lens, the cadence shift from spectral stasis to forward motion re-weights the stake cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving disappearing stories—signals early with the coral fragment; meaningful tightening occurs when Maya decides to co-author the cast, trading solitary memory-keeping for joint testimony, foreclosing her exit strategy. Escalation is textural: each illegible line on the cast increases readerly and character anxiety until decryption becomes urgent; cost is the emotional labor and time they now must spend. Agency is renunciation plus attention: she gives up exclusive ownership of grief to assume shared custodianship. No coincidence; all pressure stems from language loss and material decay.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“can joy still be made here?”—is signaled by the cryptic coordinates and tightened when the fresco forces Mira to abandon her habitual imposition for amplification. Agency is present: she risks batteries and reputation on a livestream that could fail; the orchard’s fog accepts or erases her light, a natural antagonist that cannot be negotiated with. Cost is visible—battery gauge dimming, thinning fog revealing too much—altering tactics (she quits at dawn instead of pushing gear to death). The tightening is single but sufficient for the word count; no reversal beyond the switch from new mural to old amplification, which still forecloses her prior practice.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“can imagination stay private?”—is signaled in para 2 and tightened when the garden-code becomes the last free conduit. Agency is collective rather than individual; Malachi’s persuasive pitch is the trigger, but no single on-page decision escalates inside the scene. The price is prospective (audit, memory wipe) rather than dramatized loss. Escalation is conceptual: each new garden planted enlarges the hidden network, reweighting risk. Sufficient for short-form, but absence of a paid cost in real time keeps it below top band.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: can beauty still be cultivated after centuries of global death? Pressure tightens once—postcard constellation → living gardener with real cherry bulb—moving from received beauty to co-created act. The poet’s agency is reactive (accepts bulb, agrees to plant) rather than a decisive gamble with visible loss; the tightening feels lyrical, not tactical. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: shared future vs. solitary past, but no concrete resource or body-risk is hazarded on-page, keeping the score sub-8.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve the orchids’ emotional frequencies—signals in paragraph 2 and tightens when the cracked tube threatens total dissonance. The meaningful deepening occurs when Miren realizes the fracture has birthed an unnamed emotion; this reweights the stakes from salvage to creation. Agency is her systematic sonic mapping and glass-chime forge; price is the admission that some feelings are now hers alone to host. Escalation is textural rather than causal, but the final cadence shift lands with undeniable cost under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure escalates through the revealed method itself: each disclosed layer of harmonic grammar narrows the emotional option of permanent rupture, forcing Kael’s either/or—trust her again or lose the discovery—and the price (tomorrow’s geographic split) is fixed on-page, meeting the lens requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—balance flood protection with irrigation—locks in early and tightens through each beat. Turning the hidden valve narrows options from “either/or” to an enforced “both,” with visible price measured in sweat, time, and ancestral risk. Pressure never spikes dramatically, yet the single tightening choice is irrevocable and scales to village survival.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether Elena will keep lying to protect her invented self—tightens when the package arrives and again when the recorder plays: the damaged choir voices make her past irrefutable, foreclosing the comfort of erasure. Agency is accumulative: she does not act until the voices fill the attic, then she speaks truth, a renunciation with felt social cost. No external antagonist needed; internal guilt and Yuki’s patient presence supply coherent pressure. The price is legible—her hands shake, her ritual naming of dust patterns stalls—though not as viscerally persistent as required for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—why some thresholds feel sacred—tightens when the grain-reading reveals that her parents’ entire marriage was an attempt to meter “necessary distances.” The deepening occurs at the logbook page: “Some distances aren’t navigable…only surrender.” This forecloses the possibility of familial reconciliation and reframes the maze trauma as an irreversible crossing. Cost is visible: the terrace’s dissolution literalizes the price of irreversibility. Agency is interior—renunciation rather than confrontation—but still active, as she chooses forward motion instead of lingering among the fragments.</answer>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
    <comment>Theme emerges from the accumulation of spatial metaphors: maze, flight paths, grain, prism—each redefining “distance” as emotional survival. The final image reweights the concept: sacred threshold = irreversible crossing. No moral is stated; instead, the dissolved light-beams perform the repricing. Subtext sits in the unopened logbook: renunciation is louder than revelation. The emotional aftereffect—loss as geometry—lingers without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.5)
    Single dominant stake—belonging—signaled in paragraph 1; tightens once when plankton bloom offers “recognition” rather than data proof. Agency is attention/renunciation of outsider stance; cost is conceptual, not tactical. No visible resource lost; hence stays below 8-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preventing final erasure of forgotten paths—signaled early and tightened once: realization that repetition, not catastrophe, decides existence. Agency is attention/renunciation rather than reversal; cost is existential (she must shoulder infinite paths). Swallow complicates but does not resolve; no fake antagonist. Escalation is single deepening, sufficient for lyric-accumulative lens, though price could be sharper on page.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—prove chaos can be shepherded—tightens through three visible beats: couple’s menu, teens’ photo, elder’s memory; each success narrows her remaining time, raising logistical cost. Escalation is accumulative: density of orchestrated encounters increases while tidal countdown subtracts minutes; no artificial reversal, only rising tempo. Agency stays hers; luck complicates (plankton glow) but does not resolve. Price is opportunity cost—she forfeits recognition—felt on final line.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve memory against erasure—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the speck offers the only means of permanent record. Escalation is textural: each dance gap yields more dust, more skin, more irrevocable ink; options narrow until her body is the last page left. Cost is visible—constellations settling into flesh—but the beat that shows pain or exhaustion is implied rather than felt, keeping this just below 8.8+ threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—save the atrium—signals in paragraph four. Pressure escalates through each stone-drop: every new pattern is evidence that must outshine profit rhetoric. The meaningful tightening occurs when Samuel realizes the patterns “never repeated exactly,” forcing him to compile rather than replace. Cost is legible: he trades paid labor time for unbillable research, staking reputation on optics rather than invoices.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“will Marcus repeat or repossess the bargain?”—is signaled by the first paragraph’s celestial clock. Tightening occurs when he traces the porcelain words and realizes the cyclical price; option space narrows to conscious continuation or paternal burnout. Cost is visible: the scarred hand that will keep taking burns. Agency drives the turn; no coincidence rescues him.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—prove effort ripples across timelines—signals early and escalates via each decorative trial balloon; the gauge climb is the visible tightening. No antagonist is needed: the pressure is probabilistic erosion versus human persistence. The silver-glass beat narrows options by committing the last resonance slot, foreclosing further tinkering today. Cost is conceptual but legible: the 2-foot drop implies probability layers have locked, exhausting the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve architectural consciousness—tightens when the corridor’s breathing pulse is detected, foreclosing disbelief. Escalation is accretive: ivy response → diary fragments → anomalies → pulse → custodial vow. Cost is conceptual (lifelong burden) rather than tangible, limiting upper-band entry but satisfying accretive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—seeing Maya again—tightens from encoded songs to the single mirror’s vision; option space collapses when only the smallest mirror answers. Escalation is textural: color ribbons, heartbeat pulse, and bell hush intensify until the vision offers one fragile possibility. Cost is legible in knees on wet stone and tomorrow’s promised return. Agency is present—she angles each mirror and chooses to wrap and return—but coincidence (only one mirror replies) slightly blunts full 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—end the forever war—tightens through ritual deadline: moons align once at midnight, so refusal tonight wastes the next seventeen years.  The planting is not symbolic window-dressing; it is the only on-page tactic that makes tomorrow’s coexistence unavoidable because living trees will require shared tending.  Pressure escalates when Threll names her dead gardener daughter within arm’s reach of the bomber-general, forcing the group to decide whether memory will be compost or poison.  Cost is legible: they kneel, mix enemy dirt, and verbally commit to return, foreclosing the option of perpetual boycott.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve the echo—tightens once: the release forecloses the option to keep the egg intact. Visible price is dramatized: four murdered watersheds, seven bought countries, egg abandoned to rain. Escalation is accretive rather than multi-turn, sufficient for 700-word scope. Cost is unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—self-authorship vs. court’s mirror-role—signaled in paragraph 1. Tightening occurs when the threads of expectation physically resist her hands, translating social pressure into tactile friction; cost is the loss of protective anonymity (guards recoil). Agency is continuous: she chooses kneel, trace, pull, gather, walk out. One meaningful intensification suffices; no reversal needed under Accumulative lens. Escalation is density-driven, not causal-turn, and remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether subversive puppet ethics legitimately create moral space—arrives early but stays abstract until the drunk’s half-remembered anger tightens it into a live test. The only escalation is the stick’s unexpected migration; this is coincidence, not agency, so pressure grows via accumulative embarrassment rather than Marcus’s choice. Cost is present but diffuse: the partner’s absence and the suspended ending foreclose tidy moral victory, yet no concrete loss (tool, social credit) alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—witness versus rescue of the final migration—is signaled early and tightens once: Sera’s choice to build, not breed, forecloses intervention. Agency is durational (knotting, enduring stillness) rather than reversals; cost is the irreversible surrender of scientific intervention. Escalation is textural: each knotted wing adds weight of extinct histories until the spiral becomes unbearable testament. The price is legible; a second option was never entertained, so the single tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve 200 names before rope frays—tightens via material arithmetic: each name requires one wax tablet, one bronze pour, one card scrap; seven completed by dawn shows the scale of years ahead. Agency is continual micro-choices under accumulative lens: unweave, punch, pour, cool—each irreversible and visibly costly (frost-numb fingers, consumed aurora time). No coincidence; the aurora brightening is read as witness, not rescue, keeping pressure coherent. The meaningful deepening is the shift from “forgive by forgetting” to “forgive by transforming,” paid in sweat droplets that freeze on the wax before bronze hits.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—why paths pick walkers—arrives early and tightens once: storm clock + fading directive create a now-or-never pressure. Protagonist’s agency is largely receptive (dream delivers answer), so the visible price is conceptual rather than a forfeited option. Escalation is atmospheric, not tactical; nevertheless the storm’s arrival coincides with seal-break, linking time to knowledge gain. Sufficient for 600-word lyric mode but lacks a mid-story pivot that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—possession of forbidden knowledge—is signaled by line 3; pressure escalates via each schematic page consuming an irreplaceable resource. One meaningful tightening: realization the square encodes an off-world sky forces the choice to smuggle/continue, not surrender. Cost is visible: candle stub snuffed, paper supply dwindling, dawn bringing unknown enforcers. Agency is interior (endurance) under Accumulative lens; externally she is passive, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is Marcus’s need to keep anger as identity versus Elena’s pressure to relinquish it. One meaningful tightening occurs when the sanctuary walls show the two children laughing, forcing Marcus’s body to contradict his narrative. The cost is the grief he finally releases; the price is the collapse of the self-definition he has “carefully tended” for years. Escalation is accumulative—each remembered sensation layers density until stance crystallization in the sob.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent district collapse—tightens when dream grows solid and cuts geometry into mist. One meaningful deepening: Eliane sees stars inside fog, foreclosing the “erase boundaries” option and forcing containment instead. Cost paid on-page: she forever inherits the watching role, mirrored in the burial act.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—repairing the granddaughter’s eye and the relationship—tightens when Mara must admit fault while thirty feet above ground, foreclosing retreat. One meaningful reversal: Lisel shifts from rejection to collaboration the instant she sees the flawed orb meant for her; the cost is her damaged eye still unhealed and the Guild fees permanently forsworn. Agency is dual: Mara climbs; Lisel chooses to stay and stretch the ribbon. The price (shared exile from Guild approval) is legible in the closing vow neither permanent nor thoughtless.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—understand the archive before it unmakes her—tightens when undocumented tree and cameo force a single fusion act. Escalation is accumulative: each tree bears paradoxes that narrow her options to participatory inscription. Cost is conceptual but legible: she accepts being “simply a page.” No external antagonist needed; pressure is ontological and coherent under lyric lens.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“repair the traveler’s temporal tear before students are lost forever”—is signaled by paragraph 3. Pressure tightens once: Mira shifts from observation to linguistic intervention, foreclosing the option to simply contain the rift. Cost is legible: traveler forgets again, students return disoriented, Mira resumes endless vigil. No visible resource loss alters later tactics, keeping it below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—recovering the twins’ teaching before memory erases it—is signaled early and tightens as each retelling fails. Escalation is textural: fog thickens, twins age/regress, card glows brighter, foreclosing the option to leave. No visible price is paid (no injury, forfeited tool, or social loss), so the climb into 8-band is blocked, but the accrual of ontological pressure is legible and protagonist-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—heal the university’s ontological split—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates as Marin learns Chen didn’t fail but encoded instructions in absence itself. One tightening: realizing the seal pattern equals rope braids forces the final reconfiguration; refusal is impossible without erasing Chen again. Cost is conceptual but undeniable—her own timeline identity is overwritten, shown by alien notebook entries. Pressure stays causal and coherent; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—“find the quiet in the storm”—is clear early; pressure is situational, tightening as she descends toward the ice gallery. Agency is real but gentle: humming, tracing, adjusting pitch; the turning point is aesthetic rather than perilous, limiting cost visibility. Escalation is accretive (pattern accumulation, not risk), fitting Accumulative/Textural lens but capping tension at mid-range. No option is foreclosed; instead, a new equilibrium is added, so the tightening feels observational rather than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—capture truth before fog/memory liquefy—tightens with each lightning beat that shortens measurable shadow time. No external antagonist is needed; the fog’s phase-change and memory’s mutability supply coherent pressure. Escalation is textural: every inscription she copies is already overwritten by the next donor whisper, making her labor costlier. Final stance crystallization—keep transcribing despite inevitable loss—pays the price on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—reignite hope—is signaled early and deepens through one meaningful tightening: starless sky removes the usual witness, forcing Mara to become the witness. The reversal is her decision to launch, not merely perform; cost is the spent kerosene and the irreversible departure at dawn. Coincidence is absent; escalation is linear but sufficient for micro-form. Could enter 8-band if a sharper resource loss (copper gone, satchel lighter) had altered tactics mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—Mei’s urge to freeze Lin in the tidal moment—tightens once when she concedes “time moves like tides.” Price is conceptual but legible: Mei forfeits the chronographer’s illusion of capture. Agency sits in attention and renunciation; escalation is modest, fitting accumulative design. Would edge higher if Lin’s departure risk carried an on-page obstacle Mei must overtly release.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—capture the gilded hush—signals early and tightens once when the gravity flip starts the flower. Escalation is situational: external pressure (inversion) forces stance crystallization rather than because/therefore turns. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; hence entry-high but not apex.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: can Mara usher this stranger’s grief into usable quiet without fracturing her own composure? Tightening occurs when the crystals signal “difficult passages,” forcing her to silent intervention; the man’s exhalation drop marks visible price. No external antagonist—pressure is atmospheric and ethical. Escalation is modest but coherent under Accumulative lens; the hush vaults, options reconfigured.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—reach the throne before sunrise—tightens exactly once: the mural-stair reveal forecloses abandonment and forces the ascent. Cost is visible: each peeled paint layer warms the flake, literalizing the price of history. Agency is hers—she chooses to peel, to climb, to refuse the seat. Under an accumulative lens the escalation is modest but sufficient; a second compression or external obstacle would have pushed it into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—disappearing versus being found—tightens once when Sienna crosses, but escalation is atmospheric, not tactical; the phone burn is the first visible price and arrives at the final beat, so earlier pressure feels abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—keep reality from folding—emerges at midpoint and tightens once: volunteer or fold. Escalation is a single crescendo rather than successive reversals, but agency is clear; she steps forward, shoulders infinite promises, and is pinned by the bolt. Cost is both visceral (implanted metal) and existential (eternal sentinel). Because escalation is one-shot, it doesn't enter the 8.8 band, but remains coherent and sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will Mara find proof that the dynasty was already bankrupt—tightens when the standing waves reveal the safe seam, foreclosing the option to keep blaming herself. Pressure escalates via density, not violence: each sustained tone adds visible mass to the air, making the hidden document feel inevitable. The cost is conceptual rather than corporeal, but the family’s century of litigation is rendered moot on the page, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.2)
    One dominant stake—possibility versus isolation—tightens through each unsnap; the orchard’s expansion visibly raises cost. Agency is interior but legible; the final apple-pluck crystallizes the trade-off under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—magnifying erased kindness—signals early. Pressure escalates texturally: each new document (James→Ruth→list) thickens the moral density until Sarah’s only route is to sacrifice evening/rest and author the counter-file. Cost is visible: she lights a second lamp, accepts open-ended workload, pins the button—an implicit promise that her nights will now be spent in unpaid historiography. Coincidence (finding the list inside the second folder) complicates rather than rescues, forcing the climactic choice.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—“decode the message in falling leaves”—tightens when the moonstone proves the method itself is wrong. One meaningful deepening occurs: realization that transformation IS the message narrows her interpretive options to zero, forcing a stance shift. Cost is legible on-page: seventeen years of methodical sorting are retroactively invalidated, paid in lost time and identity capital. Agency is intellectual rather than causal; the tightening still charges the final image under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—will Ellis keep trying to solve or learn to witness?—is signaled at “when coincidence becomes pattern.” Escalation is causal: each recovered clock tightens the puzzle until the shrine forces the stance crystallization. The tightening is singular but sufficient for 700 words; options narrow from “fix” to “preserve.” Price is legible (soot, renunciation), yet the off-page admiral absorbs some cost, keeping it just below 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—recover Kael while redeeming her failure—is signaled in para 2. Tightening occurs when she trades her wedding ring for gold powder, narrowing options: she can’t undo the sacrifice. Escalation is causal under lens: each measured zodiac angle raises spiritual cost until the spin consumes her last named metal. Visible price—loss of ring, permanent golden scars on Kael—alters tactics and charges final image.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—free one ghost to prove grief/joy coexist—tightens the moment Mara chooses to interrogate the script (“did you ever laugh together?”), narrowing the ghost’s options from endless confession to released memory. Protagonist agency drives escalation: every deeper note, every question increases the risk the confession-loop could swallow her too. Cost is visible: the gorge relinquishes a voice, the harp stays warped, and dawn’s advance signals she must repeat the labour for the rest—no all-cure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—find a mercy algorithm or drown in perpetual hyper-awareness—is signaled early. Escalation occurs through sensory surges that tighten options: each violet pulse threatens collapse, forcing her to metabolize rather than flee. The forest’s reactive dimming offers the first visible price: her pain becomes consumable fuel, narrowing escape to transformation. Closure converts survival into ongoing penance, foreclosing easy cure.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
    <comment>Theme emerges without sermon: mercy is not zero-cruelty but a biochemical re-channeling of suffering. The equations carved into bark remain incomplete, refusing moral arithmetic. Subtext lives in gesture—strap-touch replaces verbal thesis. Final image reweights earlier ultraviolet motif: cruelty’s glow can be metabolized, not erased, making the concept resonate beyond the page.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are signaled early—recover a deleted history—and tighten when the lens reveals the hidden layer of translators; the cost is the danger of exposing Guild lies. The escalation is single-track but sufficient: each painting strips away another layer of sanctioned truth, foreclosing the option to remain comfortably ignorant.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—uncover buried truth—tightens once: ceiling fracture map read → box retrieved → insurance-fraud photos exposed. Escalation is causal, not repeated; each new discovery forecloses retreat. Ghost’s urgency supplies external pressure; Marcus’s professionalism supplies agency. Cost is legible: he alone will carry seventy-year guilt into daylight, a visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single dominant stake is immediate: preserve predictive perfection vs. allow living uncertainty. Pressure ratchets through accumulative image density—books invert, fruits ripen in impossible colors—but the tightening is delivered via exposition (“the perfect system buckled”) rather than an irreversible on-page choice that forecloses an option for Margritte or Tessian. No tangible resource is spent, lost, or risked in the final third. Escalation is aesthetic, not tactical; cost is observed, not paid by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—whose narrative will own the asteroid’s past—is signaled early and tightened when the shard’s remembered light refutes Keraine’s Terran thesis. The temporal storm functions as coherent pressure, not coincidence, forcing the mirror ritual and the visionary beat. Cost is conceptual: scholarly certainty dissolved into elegiac ambiguity. A second, sharper tightening—perhaps a direct confrontation or forfeiture of reputation—would push this into the 8.5+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—answer grandmother’s question or fail the residency—signaled early. Tightening occurs at twilight when hidden etchings flip her premise: flowers don’t await darkness from weakness but from preference. This narrows her options to painting for slanted light only, a visible trade-off. Cost is the forfeiture of mass daylight visibility—felt on page. Agency is contemplative (tracing, painting) rather than explosive, fitting Accumulative lens; one meaningful deepening suffices for 800-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—truth versus erasure—tightens once: the decryption that was meant to preserve evidence turns into lived endangerment when Elijah’s consciousness hijacks Maya. That tightening is visible, felt, and irreversible; it forces her stance crystallization from observer to witness. Agency is present, cost is on-page, so escalation meets the lens under the 8.0 band even without multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can the town’s genius be reborn without cheap wish-fulfillment?—is signaled early and escalates through one meaningful tightening: the sealed bottle forces her to sacrifice her private memory archive. The price is visible—she empties her mind’s crucible into the glass, risking self-erasure. Escalation is causal, not iterative; one decisive intensification suffices at this length. The 0.1 dock is for the off-stage djinn who never re-applies pressure; the conflict is largely internal, but agency remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: can Miriam decode the accidental prophecy before the silence severs the orchard’s memory? Pressure sharpens once the bark pulses—her scholarly distance is foreclosed. Agency is attention & renunciation rather than external action, fitting the accumulative lens. Cost is legible: she forfeits ownership of the fragment and embraces custodianship of an open-ended, ever-growing archive.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—guardianship of genetic possibility—tightens when every jar is stolen except the acorn cap. Escalation is textural: empty tables → fractal light → vortex yawning → renunciation. No external antagonist; pressure is the temptation to reverse theft via time-debt. Cost is legible: she accepts slower, mortal renewal rather than entropy-cheat—options narrow to the one seed.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“will the sanctuary survive zero hour?”—is signaled on first page and tightens when Mira discovers the inversion is <1 hour away. One meaningful turn: she abandons the siren switch for the rope, trading institutional authority for embodied knowledge; the price is immediate (she becomes the warning, no anonymity). Cost is visible—her voice, her body, her future status—but could be sharper if we sensed exile or punishment looming.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—whether Kael can convert isolation into meaning—tightens when the lantern’s refraction offers a live trade-off: keep watching alone or rejoin the loud world below. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; the pressure is situational but coherent. The cost is the continued nightly climb itself, now chosen with full knowledge of its solitude. Slight reserve: the external world never actively intrudes, so the narrowing of options is felt more than forced.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: can silence honor the dead without shattering what it preserves? Escalation is accretive—each failed opening method thickens the cost of keeping the box intact. The ghost keeper’s gaze turns observation into obligation, foreclosing the option to smash-and-discard. Price is felt: lifelong stewardship of unspoken names, sealing him inside the oasis he once used to hide.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—time measurement without numbers—tightens once: the click of the urn shard forecloses futile equations and forces adoption of Chen’s sensory clock. Price legible: Marcus forfeits analytical certainty for embodied duty (“weight of responsibility” now literally in his coat). No antagonist needed; pressure is epistemic. Escalation is single but sufficient for 700-word arc.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: can meaning survive fragmentation? Pressure tightens when the young man labels his writing “broken”; Maya’s reply invites shared risk, narrowing her solitude. One meaningful deepening: the kite string snaps, trading control for errant flight—visible price paid, tactics altered (he laughs, accepts loss). Escalation is textural/accumulative under the inferred lens; no causal reversals needed.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring the temple before death—tightens once when copper graft stops the cracks; cost is the labor/stamina she pays with her dwindling time. Agency stays on-page: every drill hole and wiring act narrows options under her “nothing to lose” stance. No reversal beyond that single intensification, but at this length one is sufficient and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—can alien science decode her own exile?—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the footprints emerge as empirical evidence she must parse. Escalation is textural: each new environmental layer (rain, dust, formula) reweights the same stake rather than pivoting plot. The tightening beat is the footprint discovery: it collapses observer/subject distance, forcing her to become the data point. Cost is legible but soft: intellectual surrender rather than concrete loss; this keeps it just below 8.8+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—transform battlefield into living memorial—is clear early; pressure tightens as birds reveal low-tide opportunity, foreclosing delay. Cost is conceptual (future exposure of garden to salt/death) rather than viscerally felt on-page, capping intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—whether connection across elapsed war-years is still possible—signals early via Crow’s voice on cylinder. Middle escalation occurs when leaf-veins reveal coordinates, forcing the trek; this is the single meaningful tightening. Cost is visible in Finder’s returned war-skill gait and the years already lost, but the trek itself is summarized, muting visceral price. Still, agency remains hers throughout; coincidence only complicates arrival, not resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—map or surrender to madness—signals early; pressure escalates via temporal compression: minutes = centuries, so every sketch stroke costs irreversible exile. One meaningful tightening: realizing the compass rose is a time-anchor, she recommits to mapping amid accelerated star-death. Cost is legible: she forfeits reunion with a future that will never arrive. No external reversals, but accumulative deepening suffices under chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—restore the sky or be unmade—is signaled in the bruise-colored opening. Escalation is accumulative: each swapped piece tightens the visual field (two suns → one) and raises the psychic cost of error. No antagonist needed; the corrupted board itself applies coherent pressure. Final swap of the white pawn is the visible price moment that forecloses retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“will the small gestures vanish?”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when Mara forces survivors to repeat walks until “paths branded themselves into the gallery's acoustic memory.” Each iteration costs stamina and emotional safety, foreclosing the option to forget. No external antagonist is needed; the pressure of erasure is coherent and cumulative. The final stance crystallizes with visible price: her continued solitude and the building’s irreversible transformation into archive.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can Isla bear the cost of remembering?—tightens when tactile reading forces the choice: keep amnesia’s comfort or reclaim exile’s pain. Agency drives escalation: her decision to trace the stone via feather ignites memories that narrow options; retreat is impossible once drought images return. Visible price paid: the thunder-grief that had been “constant” audibly quiets, proving the emotional tax. Coincidence (falling feather) complicates but does not resolve; resolution comes from her stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—“can she restart time by forgiving herself?”—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the final thread sequence demands unconditional self-forgiveness, foreclosing her former self-image. The cost is conceptual (permanent exile) rather than viscerally dramatized; agency is intellectual, not tested by external opposition. Escalation is single-step but coherent under the allegorical lens; still, the lack of live antagonistic pressure keeps tension moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will she keep living at spectral distance?—tightens once: the wrongly-turned cave forces an immediacy test. Agency is renunciation plus endurance: she forfeits dry safety and the detached stance, paying with soaked clothes and the first non-observational memory. Cost is visible and felt; no coincidence resolves the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: can Mara abandon the shout-stance and risk being unheard? Pressure tightens once: scent strips armor → apology becomes inevitable. Cost is emotional visibility—Mara trades righteous anger for naked vulnerability. Agency is hers alone; no coincidence resolves the rift.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—guiding the scattered home while searching for her own child—tightens via each midnight call; the moon-phase constraint forecloses easy success. No external antagonist is needed; pressure is the cumulative drain of perpetual vigil and the unclosed absence of her daughter. The penultimate paragraph’s count of “forty-seven people” marks visible progress yet underscores personal stasis, a meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can she reclaim a private self—signals early and tightens once: the neighbor’s weeping broadcast proves the cost of continued exposure. The meaningful deepening occurs when she registers the “door closing softly”; options narrow from forced broadcast to chosen silence. No reversals are needed; the pressure is situational and accumulative, culminating in the crystallized stance on the bridge. Cost is visible: she forfeits communal empathy forever, accepting perpetual solitude as the price of coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—decode Ernst’s gesture—signaled early. Pressure escalates through discovery of Anna’s identity, tightening the ethical cost of carrying borrowed grief. Agency is Margit’s decision to release the flower, foreclosing the path of perpetual curation. Coincidence is absent; escalation remains coherent under Causal lens with visible price in the relinquished memories.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single dominant stake: will Marcus keep evading life or step through? Pressure mounts in three tightenings—ants ignore crumbs, creek soaks shoes, chip warms in palm—each an irreversible tick forward. The door’s appearance is the meaningful deepening that forecloses retreat. Cost is visible: the shop lights disappear behind him as he crosses; the price is the life unlived if he stayed, now paid.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—escape the maddening dreams—tightens when a third messenger collapses, making the climb an on-page necessity. Pressure escalates via altitude: thinning air, raw hands, vanishing world below. The grotto vision is the single meaningful deepening that swaps passivity for choice. Cost is visible in “hands scraped raw” and the intangible forfeiture of “golden certainties,” but no concrete tactical loss (time, tool, social credit) alters later moves, keeping it just shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserve Kael’s sight-experience—signaled early; escalation is emotional deepening rather than external reversals: blindness secret → gift of memory-suns → joint alchemy pact. Each beat tightens cost: Mira forfeits commercial path; Kael accepts dependency. Agency is shared consent to bottle light; no coincidence resolves. Could wish for one sharper external obstacle, but pressure stays coherent under Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can she still heal without smell—tightens when the screw’s origin forces a visible analogy between repurposed tools and repurposed perception. Single meaningful escalation: recognition of screw ⇒ acknowledgment of transformed function ⇒ decision to adopt same logic for herself. Cost is perceptual and social: she must abandon the identity of “disabled” in front of Chen, a witness. Agency remains internal/attentional; that suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—“prove worthy of the scholar’s seal”—is signaled in paragraph two and deepened when the only allowed ink source is personal pain. The meaningful tightening occurs the instant Kael redirects frost from shame to stylus: that single stroke forecloses anonymity forever. Escalation is causal, not loud; options narrow from “hide or fail” to “expose or be exiled.” Price is the permanent publicity of disfigurement, paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—genuine apology before demolition—tightens once when Derrick withholds forgiveness, foreclosing easy absolution; cost is Mira’s public relinquishing of the bottle/identity. Escalation is textural: each reprise of metaphor or orchard image accretes pressure until confession and refusal crystallize stance. Coincidence absent; agency resides in Mira’s decision to stay and speak, plus Derrick’s counter-decision to accept presence but not absolve.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will she break the measurement paradigm—signaled early. Tightening occurs when the key reveals the hidden pendulum, forcing a now-or-never test of her theory. Escalation is intellectual but irreversible: once she speaks “zero,” the old calibration collapses. Agency drives every beat; no coincidence resolves anything.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—protect the farm from contamination—faces a meaningful tightening when the intruder turns out to be a grieving father replicating her own past need. Escalation is situational: each new physical fact (gap, Marcus, his motive) narrows Mira’s moral options rather than multiplying plot events. Cost is visible: she trades airtight security for compassionate permeability, foreshadowing a future risk (investors, Dr. Reeves) that remains legible at exit. Agency is hers; coincidence complicates rather than rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to repeat or break the father’s contradiction—tightens once: decoding shifts her from observer to participant. The syllabus draft is the irreversible choice that forecloses pure critique; visiting him will expose her to the same stochastic abyss. Pressure is internal yet coherent and cumulative under the Accumulative/Textural lens. No external antagonist needed; the “conditional probability” of recovery supplies sufficient jeopardy. Cost is felt: she shoulders the burden of proof—literally carrying the notebooks—accepting potential failure.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can distance be converted into reunion—signals early and tightens as Iris collects names, then spends them. Escalation is accumulative: each wrong number adds one more entry to her covert phonebook, narrowing her own options (she must stay underground to deliver). The price is opportunity cost: she never emerges, never calls her own estranged person. One hairline slip: the brother’s misdirected voicemail is recounted, not dramatized, muting the felt cost a notch.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve vs. confront personal memory—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once the locket re-weights every prior archival act; the ink inscription is the visible, irreversible trade-off that forecloses pure detachment. Escalation is accumulative: density of sensory detail and emotional charge intensify toward twilight rather than via external reversals. Cost is legible on-page (she writes the card, dons the locket), though second-party opposition is absent, keeping the score just below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—maintain control via rumor-chain logistics while staying humanly unseen—tightens when the stranger converts abstract debt into face-to-face need. The meaningful turn is her renunciation of jocularity: she forfeits her shield (cost felt immediately in the tonal hush). Escalation is causal under the lens; no coincidence resolves anything. Could use one visible resource loss (phone battery, missed flight) to hit 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—find stillpoint inside grief—signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is accretive: each musical note tightens the emotional coil until silence becomes the irreversible stance. No external antagonist; pressure is internal and atmospheric. Cost is legible: the melody completes, ending her cartographic quest—she forfeits the map for presence.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—can she still be useful after a catastrophic misreading—tightens when the pen reveals her error was only one branch of truth. Agency drives the escalation: she chooses to propagate seven histories instead of hiding behind a single corrected version, narrowing her future to perpetual contingency. The price is dramatized: settlers’ polite gratitude becomes the mirror that forces her to own uncertainty. One meaningful deepening suffices; no external coincidence resolves the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—Can Marina re-enter music without sound?—tightens when the filmless camera forces her to externalize rhythm through motion rather than memory. Escalation is textural: each harbor pulse (lap, gust, glint) adds a layer of证明 that silence is full, culminating in the dance that forecloses the piano forever. The visible price is the camera abandoned on the pier—an object whose purpose has been metabolized into muscle memory. Agency is present; no coincidences intrude.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—rescue Kiran’s erased truth—tightens when Marina deciphers the vandalized portrait’s border codes, trading anonymity for global broadcast. Cost is legible: she climbs toward daylight knowing she’s trading exile for vindication, a price she accepts on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake: can Maya keep the 13 entangled souls alive inside her without shattering herself? Pressure escalates through density—each paragraph adds another voice until "the weight of it bore down with auroral sorrow." The tightening is her sore fingers, the dawn deadline, and the vow to return; no external antagonist, but the internal load visibly costs. Agency stays internal and accumulative, matching the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prove whisper-power while tracing her father’s container—signals early and tightens when she refuses map handover, risking Voss’s armed raid. Mid-story “key = time” revelation escalates under storm-surge pressure, foreclosing electronic tracking and forcing analog cunning. Cost is felt: she trades leverage for the confidential name, paying with future vulnerability. Agency drives each beat; coincidence (storm) complicates but does not resolve. One meaningful turn suffices; escalation is legible and persistent.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will Mara break silence before darkness drowns her—is signaled in paragraph 3. Escalation is textural: each mirrored pattern thickens communal witness, tightening her throat-stone until speech is the only remaining option. The final tightening (her sprint to the harbor master) is driven by guardian gesture, not her own prior plan—slight agency dip yet cost remains visible as she volunteers coordinates that could indict her. Mirror-to-mirror inheritance at end reweights stakes from rescue to perpetual stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: rescue children’s swallowed voices. Escalation is the density of silence → one synchronized strangeness → audible questions; the tightening forces the town to renegotiate meaning. Cost is legible: the safe invisibility of “hollow quiet” is forfeited; future uncertainty now speaks aloud. Agency stays with Marina’s organizing and the children’s lantern placement; coincidence is decorative, not resolving.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: can Marina lay down the protector identity she never truly owned? Pressure tightens once: the early-surfacing island offers the scrimshaw, forcing a public-private choice under whale-witness. Escalation is accumulative-textural: tide, bone, and song layer until the only remaining tactic is release. Cost is visible—she forfeits the last relic of her brother and the alibi for hardness. No secondary reversals, but the single deepening is sufficient for 750-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“can she exit performed detachment without breaking new peace”—tightens via each whittling curl: tangible weight lost equals incremental permission gained. Escalation is accumulative: pattern of narrated emptiness grows unbearable until silence itself flips from oppression to option. Cost is visible: bouquet destroyed, wood gone, voice cracked; no reset. Agency is renunciation, not conquest; that aligns with lyric pressure model.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—will speaking banned beauty cost her?—tightens once: when the lake groans after her paraphrase, option of safe retreat vanishes. Escalation is single but sufficient for 750 words; agency is purely linguistic, yet irreversible. Cost remains conceptual rather than visceral, keeping score shy of 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—awaken Fen or leave him ossified—is signaled in paragraph four. Pressure escalates via accumulative pattern: each plant element adds social scrutiny; the reed’s imperfect note provides the single deepening that crystallizes Fen’s stance. Cost is legible: Fen publicly abandons forty years of “perfection,” Mira risks her most prized tool. No coincidence resolves; the reversal is triggered by Mira’s deliberate reed gesture. Sufficient for 700 words, though a mid-scene obstacle could have sharpened tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can lost sounds become connective tissue? Pressure tightens once: from worthless noise to usable map. The decisive turn is Karim’s invitation “Help me rebuild this,” which forecloses the path of starting over. Cost is the irrevocable pivot from clinical therapy to vulnerable testimony, felt in the dawn-hour fatigue and the bell ringer’s earlier exile from the gardens.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can she convert another’s ruin into art without re-breaking herself—tightens when she must embed actual cremains instead of neutral hair. Agency: she could refuse the commission; instead she adapts technique, risking emotional reopening. Cost is legible: ash clouds the resin, reminding her of Vincent’s ashes she once scattered. One beat shy of 8.8+ because the client remains off-stage; the tightening is material, not interpersonal.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can Mira keep the pattern secret?—is signaled early and tightens when she chooses confession, narrowing her future options from private researcher to public Cassandra. The cost is felt: once Tobias touches the thread web, the whole lattice trembles, making secrecy impossible. No external antagonist is needed; the pressure is the pattern itself, multiplying paths toward inevitable cultural contagion. Escalation is single but sufficient; a second reversal would over-crank this word count.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—hope’s erosion vs. personal integrity—signals early. Escalation is incremental: each archival clip deepens pattern, no new external antagonist required. The stone’s refusal to ascend with the library supplies the visible price, shaping her final gesture. Under Accumulative lens, density increase (two recordings → universal consumer haze) reweights cost sufficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—integrity vs. animal welfare—tightens once when she chooses to blow the whistle yet stay as caretaker. The single meaningful turn (notebook draft → resignation letter) narrows options under Causal lens and prices her out of funded security. Pressure is coherent but solitary; no external antagonist or ticking permit deadline escalates beyond the internal pivot, capping it short of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—recovering the ability to heal without harming—arrives early. Pressure tightens once: the coffee-ring reading forces her to reinterpret the displacement as love-split focus, not carelessness, which then enables the ivy healing. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; a tangible forfeiture would sharpen the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—liberating unused love—signals in paragraph two and tightens once: from cataloguing to releasing. The tightening is meaningful (she forgoes private communion for public projection), but the price is poetic rather than practical: no external obstacle or finite resource is risked, so cost is legible but not materially scaled. Still, agency is hers; escalation under Accumulative lens satisfies.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—free trapped creativity—signaled in opener; escalation via denser meteor cries that narrow options to single threshold act. Agency: Lyra’s alignment of astrolabe triggers rupture; coincidence complicates (aurora intensity) but does not resolve. Visible price: her corporeal dissolution forecloses any return. One meaningful tightening suffices; no reversal overload.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—cultivate sparks in unlit corners—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightened when she presses the button, collapsing a branch and foreclosing her prior omniscience. Escalation is Accumulative: density of blooming flowers and fracturing lullaby keys increases until the midnight threshold fractures. Cost is legible—she loses the knowledge held by the earlier-collapsed version of herself. No coincidence; all pressure emerges from her charm-action and quantum mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“map the wild frontier of his own consciousness”—is signaled early and tightens when the gear begins to rotate, forcing him to decide whether to keep unlocking defenses. One meaningful deepening occurs: the iron trees he feared re-price as necessary protections, narrowing future options. Cost is conceptual but legible; a second external pressure source would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—permission to reclaim her own courage—is clear early. Escalation is accumulative: each stamp deepens the cost of the life already lived rather than narrowing future options; the seventh star crystallizes meaning but does not create new tactical pressure. No visible price is paid on the descent; the punch transfer is gift, not trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“understand the cost of safety”—is signaled early; escalation is the accretion of twenty-three ash notes that convert abstract guilt into a compulsion to sing. One meaningful tightening: management’s piped music forces Marta to move her humming to off-hours, highlighting the stakes of sonic forgetting. Cost is visible: she risks employment and emotional exposure by singing; the fortress may expel her. Agency is renunciation/endurance rather than confrontation, fitting the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—unmask the pretender—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens once: when the library’s dissolution accelerates, Kael’s tactic shifts from slow seeding to a final, irreversible message. The price (her extinction) is felt on-page, but the external pressure plate (Orian’s reaction) occurs off-stage, slightly muting the visceral cost at the decisive beat. Still, the causal linkage between library decay and urgency is unmistakable, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—professional obligation to interpret ocean change—tightens when her existing predictive model collapses; the atlas offers a costly alternative path (abandon modern overlay). Escalation is intellectual, not action-adventure: each datum strip subtracts certainty until the old map becomes the only viable lens. Agency is decision/renunciation rather than external confrontation; price is surrender of career-long framework—visible when she tapes atlas over screen. Coincidence absent; pressure is internal-consistency of pattern recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—find meaning to restart rebellion—is signaled early; pressure tightens when opera glasses reveal hidden glyphs, converting abstract grief into actionable ritual. Agency is attention/interpretation rather than external deed; cost is conceptual (accepting patient cycle). One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens; escalation is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will Lira midwife an unknown future or cling to war—tightens once when she speaks the unsealing syllables, narrowing options from insurgent to gardener- midwife. Agency is visible: she climbs, decodes, speaks, touches; no off-stage resolution. Visible price: her insurgent path is foreclosed the instant amber shatters. Under Causal lens, escalation is linear yet sufficient for 750-word scope; a second reversal would over-crank.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can she stay present for the incoming children without shattering—is signaled early and tightened by the helicopter pass that forces the palm-flat ritual. Agency is renunciatory: she endures the somatic spike, re-anchors, returns to cuttings; the cost is breath and time, visible on page. No reversal beyond the micro-turn of freeze-to-thaw, but within 750 words one meaningful deepening suffices. Coincidence (coast-guard copter) complicates rather than rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single dominant stake—can she see and represent faces truthfully—tightens when walls literally contract, forcing the card rearrangement. The reversal is micro but meaningful: fragmentation stops being failure and becomes method. Cost is felt in the cracked box left open, a permanent loss of containment. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—prove the reality of time-slippage and follow the target—signaled in paragraph 4. One meaningful tightening: drone footage shows the target dissolving into the ink spirals, forcing Kael’s decision to replicate the method. Cost is legible: she accepts eventual self-disappearance. Under Causal lens, the eclipse-crisis linkage escalates options rather than danger, a fresh inversion that still narrows her path to one possible future.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—release versus protect forbidden histories—announced with the first glimpse of contraband seal. Pressure tightens once Kael realizes networks still live; options narrow to transmit or betray her mother’s sacrifice. Cost is implied rather than dramatized (no Authority guard appears; job loss or execution remain hypothetical), so escalation feels intellectual, not visceral. Still, the final beat makes the trade-off legible: silence is foreclosed, global chaos invited.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—continuity vs. armed survival—tightens once: knife moved from gun to soil, narrowing future options. Escalation is accretive: each canvas scrap and rose nod increases density until the blade-sheathe beat crystallizes cost. No coincidence; pacifism is tested by father’s restiveness, not external threat. Price is felt on-page in the whispered metal-on-leather and roses leaning toward both.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—retrieve the goddess-laugh to restore her daughter’s voice—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens once: the laugh resists, tries to transliterate Mira herself into scattering. That deepening forces the decisive act of driving the spike, with visible price (risk of self-scattering, three-hour night). Escalation is single but sufficient for 700-word scope; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. family mythology—signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation tightens once: Chen’s proof collapses inherited innocence, forcing public recant. Cost is explicit: “damage your family’s credibility” and the metaphoric fall from cloud sanctuary to city lights. No artificial reversals; single meaningful turn suffices for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering the possibility of meaning—tightens when the tile fragment’s arrival offers either proof of irretrievable loss or raw material for new pattern. No reversal, but deepening: the mandala’s deliberate gaps convert external chaos into internal necessity. Cost is the acceptance that the daughter will never see it; this forfeiture is dramatized by the mother’s “face crumpled and reformed,” a visible price. Escalation is textural, not causal: each coloured ring makes the silence heavier, compressing options until only shared breath remains.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—shield survivors’ need for hero vs. personal need for honesty—tightens the moment she touches the tessera; each vision escalates the cost of either choice. One clear reversal: decision to expose → decision to conceal, paid for by breaking the mosaic link. Price is legible: she forfeits both justice and the community’s possible catharsis, keeping the burden in her steel hand. Agency remains hers; no external coincidence resolves the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will the boy choose life?—is signaled at minute-17 threshold watch. Escalation arrives mid-text when Celeste decides to sing, narrowing her forever-circumspect ghost existence into audible exposure. Cost is felt: every echo she releases frays her own temporal anchorage (“she’d done what she could—accepting orchard solitude as price”). Agency remains hers; coincidence only complicates (future blossoms already present).

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—can lost neural intimacy be mapped/shared—tightens via each experiment narrowing to irreversible knowledge: no cure, only witness. Agency sits with Maya: she initiates every shock session and the final photographic act, paying with time, risk, and ultimate acceptance. Fractal “language” discovery reweights options for thousands, satisfying escalation under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—documenting/feeling the post-human coastline—tightens when she confronts non-human emotional residue; this deepening re-weights her task from archival to translational. No reversal or external antagonist is required under the lyric-accumulative lens. Cost is felt as irreversible immersion: she never leaves the cave, surrenders dry land identity. A sharper on-page moment where she actively abandons return would push this into 8+; as is, the price is legible but oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—repair the broken mission—signaled in line 4 and tightened when snow-code appears, foreclosing her retreat option. Escalation is causal: each drift line narrows safe inaction until Berlin vault request poses irrefusable risk. Cost is visible—she photographs evidence knowing sunlight will erase her last alibi. No coincidence resolves; Marcus’s arrival results from her barometric reply.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—legal/relational complexity vs. maternal intent—tightens once when the woman trades paperwork for needle, a visible forfeiture of leverage under the accretive pressure of silence and fog. Agency is present but mild: she actively folds the documents away, foreclosing litigation path; cost is the lost armor of layered clauses. No antagonist besides internalized legalese, so pressure is situational and coherent. Escalation is single-wave rather than iterative, adequate for sub-800-word form but short of the visible price that would push into 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—understanding why places resist entropy—is signaled early and deepens through pattern recognition rather than external opposition. The tightening is cognitive: dawn/noon/dusk timelines narrow her attention, forcing her to add her own layer. Cost is conceptual (she leaves part of herself), not tactical; visible price is muted, holding the score below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—illuminating the city’s overlooked children—surfaces early and tightens through the single escalation: private ritual (rose death) → communal risk (illegal lighthouse lighting). Agency is collective but Mira-led; the rhythm of oars literalizes “instilling change” as forward motion against tidal resistance. The reversal is the moment the lighthouse glass answers back, turning their clandestine lesson into a public beacon; options narrow—there is now visible evidence that will provoke response. Cost is projected rather than immediate, keeping pressure just sub-threshold for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“keeper of secrets must release them”—tightens once: the spiral’s appearance forces the archive into public view. Escalation is accumulative: each letter tied = rising visibility + social cost (strangers reclaim their past). No reversal, but the tightening forecloses the private-archive option. Cost is visible in the final image: her empty satchel vs. the community weeping beneath the letters.</question>
    <question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image, not statement: fragmented letters → communal reintegration = “nothing lost, only waiting for arrangement.” The thrush-nest spiral re-weights the premise at closure, achieving CR. Subtext operates in silence—Jun’s drip of water, the quiet tying gesture. No final-paragraph moralizing; the bells’ crystalline fracture offers non-literal answer. Minor slip: “thread that connects all things” flirts with thematic echo, but it’s buried mid-scene, not at end.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—retrieve the lost key—signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when the corridor visibly contracts, foreclosing retreat. Escalation is accumulative: each organ note narrows physical space and widens dimensional possibility, price felt in rising panic. Agency remains hers: she kneels, traces, reaches through void. Cost is on-page: collapse, gasping, shaking legs. One meaningful tightening suffices; no false coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—awakening empathy in a face-blind artist—tightens when ribbon reopens the sealed case, forcing a tactical shift from observer to portraitist of absence. Escalation is accretive: each quarry step deepens knowledge of killer’s loneliness, narrowing Vera’s options to either paint that void or let the cycle resume. Cost is legible: she forfeits the safety of pure witness and exposes her own blindness to the world.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—redeem Voss’s science before more ships die—surfaces early and tightens when the etched factor proves publishable. Agency sits with Mira’s push and Yoon’s risky yes; option set narrows from “stay exiled and silent” to “covert publication with personal peril.” Cost is legible: professional ruin, possible arrest. One meaningful turn suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“will she accept witness to the vanished?”—tightens once when she sees the names and again when she decides to sing. No reversible opposition, but pressure grows accumulatively: each spoken name layers obligation. Cost is conceptual (now responsible for the disappeared) rather than visceral; still legible under lyric lens.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“will he run again or stay and face inheritance?”—tightens when each marker-stone forfeits an exit route; the fox’s stare is the external pressure that crystallizes the choice. Cost is legible: he forfeits the satchel’s mythic mobility for the immobility of the rusted train.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—decode versus survive obsession—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when Kove admits he “can’t” watch another death. The harmonic realization is the single meaningful deepening that reweights options: collaboration becomes necessity, not virtue. No fake reversals; coincidence only complicates (telegram found now). Visible price: fifteen lost years, future years pledged.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—break curse by finishing confession—signaled paragraph 2. Escalation delivered via seed beat: once planted, no retreat; confession must complete or Kael is consumed. Cost is dramatized: her gasp, tree’s groan, lake’s stillness. No coincidence; resolution arises from her agency to feed truth its missing syllable.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—navigate the future by rebuilding the maze—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened when the scar-link proves the covenant real. One meaningful turn: Mara moves from isolated seer to co-builder, foreclosing retreat into mere prophecy. Cost is visible: bodies remain broken, pain re-ignited by scar-glow. Escalation is causal under lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“can destinies be patched without tearing the fabric?”—tightens when Kael reveals the emotional hole where Senna should be, forcing Mira toward an irreversible trade-back attempt. Escalation is a single causal tightening instead of a swirl of reversals, sufficient at this length. Agency is renunciation-driven: she chooses to risk obliterating her life’s work, a visible price paid on-page. Coincidence is absent; the confrontation is the inevitable repayment of her earlier theft.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—recover professional identity after public shame—tightens when the cloth’s mid-70s truth forecloses the Woodstock myth, forcing Marcus to decide whether to offer a smaller truth or hide again. The reversal is single but meaningful; cost is legible in his resumed seat at the desk amid quarry silence. No escalation loop; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—bridge grief/knowledge—clear from paragraph 2. Escalation is iterative (seed after seed) rather than option-narrowing; no reversal or price paid by Asha until the plant grows. Tightening is conceptual (“magnetic gate” insight) not tactical; cost is observational. Sufficient for short-form but lacks a visceral trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—how to keep wonder without tomorrow—tightens once: when Maren chooses to destroy the last stable pages to create a mutable scroll, she pays the irreversible price of perpetual forgetting. Escalation is situational but coherent; no reversal is needed because the single deepening (accepting contradiction) forecloses the path of fixed knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—whether Mara will uphold bureaucratic detachment or embrace communal vulnerability—emerges late (after shell discovery) but tightens decisively when she edits her report. One visible cost: she forfeits Commission protocol, placing her badge-weight behind preservation. Pressure accumulates rather than reverses; sufficient under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—signals early; pressure tightens when graffiti confronts her denial, forcing the accordion micro-choice. Escalation is textural: each mapped river beat adds guilt-density until the final cadence shift. Cost is conceptual (raw sound leaks from patched bellows) rather than tangible, keeping tension in the lyric register.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—map or be swallowed by unspoken silence—tightens when the Librarian warns of scholars “lost in recursive reading,” a visceral price that converts curiosity into mortal wager. Elena’s agency is continuous: she tracks, gambles, climbs, documents; each move forecloses retreat. The backward watch and impending letter serve as twin clocks, compressing option space without gimmickry. Cost is legible: lifelong indenture to a library that breathes in mist—no exit promised.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—dream vs empire—tightens once yet decisively: authentication offer vs propagation act. Escalation is causal and single-cycle; the price (exile, “difficult path illuminated”) is on-page. No reversal overload; one meaningful shift suffices for 700-word window.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single dominant stake: harvest the last spark before obliteration; no external antagonist or reversal, but pressure tightens once as the aurora brightens and the chip clouds—visible sign that the window is closing. Agency is pure attention/ritual precision; cost is off-loaded onto the dead woman rather than Kael, so the tightening is aesthetic, not personal. Sufficient for lyric mode but keeps the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can she stay true to caretaker purpose when faced with daughter’s killer? Pressure tightens once—hairpin reveal; option of private justice is foreclosed by her guided act. Cost is legible: she relinquishes personal retribution, retains burden of service. Agency is renunciation rather than confrontation—valid under Accumulative lens; still, a sharper external complication (soul resisting guidance) would have pushed 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—Keegan’s need for absolution—tightens when Mara refuses to give it, forcing self-confrontation. One crystalline reversal: certainty → permanent doubt, paid immediately in his collapsed posture. Agency is his, cost is felt; escalation is single but decisive under causal lens. No off-stage rescue; coincidence only complicates via honest wind.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: Maia’s wish to disappear versus the need to inhabit presence/absence simultaneously. Pressure tightens once—after the second stone she sees absence as structure, foreclosing the vanishing option. Cost is conceptual but legible: Keiran’s erasure literalizes the price of “being both,” and Maia’s final stone-drop accepts that dual state. Agency is internal—no external antagonist—but the choice still reconfigures her stance under the Accumulative lens, meeting the 8-bar.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake: can the skimmer free the pulse without moving? Escalation occurs when the birds’ scatter-and-regroup pattern sharpens the hunter’s unfinished chase, tightening her task from passive reception to active teaching. Cost is legible: she gains a companion but forfeits solitude—dust freshly settling implies eternal continuation of her stasis. Agency is attention-based; no physical act, yet the harmonic hum is an irreversible intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—prove that slow, beautiful magic still matters—tightens once: the keystone must reach the spire before efficiency wardens erase the last “impossibility.” Escalation is causal: because she climbs, the spire re-illuminates; because the spire glows, her self-worth is re-priced. Cost is visible—muscle burn, societal erasure, and the Academy’s incoming audit—foreclosing return to old life. No coincidence; mist walking accommodates her need, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“will he recover the color of sound or drown in the attempt?”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when the hull groan forces ascent. The luminous vow release is coincidence-allowed (wreck settling) but complicates, not resolves; Marcus still must choose witness over possession. Cost is visible: he surfaces “unsure,” forfeiting certainty. One beat shy of a second tightening keeps it from 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—find purpose via backwards prophecy—tightens once: frequency seven-theta-nine fails to satisfy, forcing the three-sigma-six shift that crystallizes her witness-role. Cost is legible: she forecloses personal certainty. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes; a mid-scene external jeopardy (dying receiver capacitor?) could escalate into 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can she resume reaping after unmooring loss—signals early and tightens when naming each monster risks re-inscribing pain. One meaningful deepening: the blade-caught light crystallizes spoken names, making retreat impossible. Cost is legible—physical shards in pocket, audible echo of child-voice—yet escalation is more textural accretion than irreversible fork. Sufficient for length, but second beat of external consequence would have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“can the cosmic balance be healed?”—is signaled in paragraph 4; tightening occurs when the rebuilt clapper must survive its first swing under the exact drip cadence she has obsessed over. Cost is persistent: her magic remains weak; success requires lifelong vigilance, visible in the closing image of her staying to “time the drips.” Agency is renunciation/endurance rather than victory; the choice to keep counting forecloses migration or ever feeling safe. Coincidence is absent; escalation is pure density of pattern reaching critical mass.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—memory vs. erasure—tightens when the county order to expunge arrives, forcing Mara’s public refusal. One visible price: professional reprimand and county opposition. Agency is clear: she scans, leaks, invites public. Coincidence (photo trail) complicates but does not resolve; the climax is her decision to memorialise. Cost is on-page; escalation is single but sufficient for 750-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—completing the formula—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the starling pattern offers the missing ingredient and the crystal’s dissolution forces a one-way flame act that forecloses return to pure rationality. Cost is legible: she relinquishes the crystal and her prior epistemic stance. Escalation is coherent under Accumulative lens; a second tightening beat would push it above 8.2.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—valley’s survival vs. her credibility—tightens once when council contradiction arrives. Escalation is knowledge-based: doubt could collapse sow/harvest timing; her refutation must be transparent or trust dies. Agency: she risks authority by inviting observers, narrowing her own power. Cost legible: she forfeits solitary mystique forever.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—who owns a life when identity is divisible—tightens when Kenji realizes the clone is not duplicate but complement, foreclosing the option of zero-sum victory. Escalation is single but meaningful: the custody hearing is the crucible where emotional numbness must break or calcify. Cost is legible: he forfeits sole claim to his past and accepts shared vulnerability, paying with tears in open court. Under causal lens, one deepening is sufficient and lands with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—save Labyrinth’s End from corporate takeover—is signaled early. Pressure escalates via Accumulative pattern: seed → viral plant → revenue spike → higher offers. The reversal (using the bloom as puzzle) narrows options, but the cost of refusal is off-stage; stakes feel abstract. One visible forfeiture (mentor’s death) is backstory, not on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—re-open the family’s closed throat—signaled immediately. Escalation is tonal rather than plot-reversals: each blower added thickens the off-key wind until the household must breathe again. Cost is diffuse but felt: Marcus exhausts himself, Risks hearing damage, cedes privacy of grief. The tightening is the moment mother’s hand freezes above kettle—external proof that pressure has breached stone.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—guardian’s need to belong somewhere—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation via deepening: stillness → boundary awareness → voluntary acceptance of boundary-keeper role; each stage forecloses return to original library. Pendant touch is the visible price moment, burning cold against sternum. No external antagonist, yet uncertainty functions as coherent pressure; acceptance is active stance crystallization under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—remain safe hierophant of coinage vs become rogue creator—is voiced early (“stifling destiny, safe and soulless”). Escalation is textural: each recalled failure adds density until the eighteenth re-casts them as cumulative spell. The decisive tightening occurs when she sings the once-discrete formulas as one incantation, foreclosing retreat. Cost is visible: the staff’s new life is “stranger, more honest,” forcing her into unmapped territories without institutional protection.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—decode the universe’s true voice—tightens when she swaps peak-seeking for valley-seeking; the lunar perigee acts as live clock, intensifying the signal and narrowing her options. Escalation is textural: each paragraph deepens the silence rather than forcing external reversals. Cost is conceptual but legible: she abandons the professional identity that kept her here. No external antagonist, yet the pressure of cosmic indifference feels coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—restore scattered passengers—signals early and tightens through pattern accumulation: coffee orders, seat numbers, newspapers. One meaningful deepening: Marcus realizes “each grain a passenger” in the grotto, shifting tactic from passive listening to active multi-frequency broadcast. Cost is visible (three years gone, captain half-ghost) and alters later tactics. No reversal or external antagonist, but accumulative pressure suffices under Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can she weave a space where two incompatible minds overlap—tightens as thread frequency rises; the single deepening (gallery turns living) forecloses retreat; price is her own absorption into the pattern, visible in her translucent older reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: personal relevance—will Yael remain the city’s anchor or risk obsolescence to learn alien navigation? Escalation comes via one meaningful tightening: chain link returned to Reeves = commitment made, topside path foreclosed. Cost is legible: isolation, exile, surrender of professional identity. Agency is decision/renunciation rather than external victory. Under Accumulative lens, pattern break (chain off console) reweights stakes acceptably; no additional reversals required. Visitors serve as situational irritant, not convenient resolver.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—deliver vulnerable last words—tightens when the pulse shifts from routine to life-saving, a meaningful escalation under causal lens. Pressure is coherent: each deeper listen makes the device hotter, time narrows with Elena flagged suicidal, and Mara’s agency (illegal record dive, urgent call) drives the reversal. Cost is visible—Mara’s hands shake, the aid burns—but the price is borne by Elena’s safety, not by Mara’s own foreclosed path, keeping it just below high-band. Still, one clear intensification satisfies length-appropriate demand.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—recover sister’s erased truth—signaled early. Escalation under causal lens: anomaly patterns → consciousness hypothesis → erased researchers → Maya’s vow. One visible price: tide returning early forecloses thorough salvage, demands immediate retreat. Agency is endurance/attention rather than defeat of antagonist; still narrows future options by committing her to infinite return cycles.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: reassemble identity after death-error; pressure tightens when ink hits opal—only one shot before pattern evaporates. Micro-turn: seeing grandmother’s pattern forces renunciation of counting safety. Cost is credible (loss of numeric armor, shard surrendered to void). Agency is attention/ritual endurance rather than external battle; escalation accrues via heartbeat tally and ink spread until silence crystallizes stance. Could reach 8+ if cost were verbally acknowledged on page; as is, price is imagistic but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—save Keshrin—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is accumulative: each successful texture-translation adds a silent “page” to the bone library, narrowing the future to either total extinction or total sublimation. The tightening is the realization that she will not live to hear it decoded; the price is her own exile from audible speech. No external antagonist; pressure is time + material decay. Agency visible every time she angles the diamond; final press = renunciation that forecloses any later reversal. Could edge higher if one beat showed a concrete loss (blood on bone, cracked tooth from vibration, etc.).

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to expose or join the harmony—surfaces early and tightens when Elena hears her mother’s post-mortem voice. The tightening is single but decisive: information vs. allegiance; she pays by pocketing the antenna, visibly foreclosing the expose-path. Pressure is coherent under causal lens; no artificial reversals. Cost is legible but understated—career/identity consequences are implied rather than felt on the skin.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stake is clear: liberate beauty from mechanical regimentation. Pressure escalates via music’s effect, but the statues never adapt or counter-attack; once the first tree walks, resistance collapses. No meaningful trade-off or visible price narrows Lira’s options—she spends no breath, string, or blood. The climax is spectacle rather than crucible; tension plateaus rather than tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: keep the human chain of memory alive across a lethal border. Escalation is textural—each forbidden object intensifies the moral cost—until the thunderstorm bottle becomes the final, irreversible test. No reversal, but a deepening: the storm’s alive flickers foreshadow the emotional voltage he must deliver. Cost is legible: Kael commits to seventeen more pre-dawn runs, sleep forfeit implied.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“can she coax sound from silence?”—is signaled early and tightened once: the moment she hums, stakes flip from mechanical restoration to self-restoration. Cost is legible—her own body becomes the instrument that risks breaking the seven-year vow—but external pressure is muted; no consequence looms if she fails, so escalation is poetic rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single dominant stake: locate where stories live. Escalation is textural—each overlay increases density until voids appear, narrowing her options from “mapping” to “inhabiting the curvature.” Cost is visible: she abandons the indexing project, accepting unmappable space. Agency is attention/renunciation; meets Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—freeing the caged creative self—tightens once through the astrolabe activation that forces the trade-off between fear and audible architecture of feeling. The meaningful tightening narrows options: after the floor tilts, silence is no longer tenable; she must admit the equation “beauty ≠ less love.” Cost is legible on the page: tears, dissolved certainty, and the silver filament that makes the sacrifice irreversible. Escalation is causal under the Causal lens; no coincidence rescues her—only her surrendered hair drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—recover stolen memory—signals early; the autumn equinox tide acts as a ticking clock that forces tonight’s attempt. Escalation is the mounting alignment of mushroom rings with fractured constellations, narrowing to the single key-press beat. Cost is visceral: the memory floods back with the weight of decades, foreclosing her earlier ignorance. No coincidence; the tightening is entirely driven by her detect-study-act agency.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“can Kael go home?”—is signaled in line 3 and tightened when Miren names her own double exile. Escalation is accumulative: each cup of tea and shard-reading raises the cost of misunderstanding exile. The final narrowing is Kael’s choice to carry the shadow-glass, foreclosing the option to forget what she’s learned. Price is felt: Miren stays behind among dust and creaking chains.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single dominant stake—save the tree’s wonder—tightens once when Esme threads essences; the narrowing is the act itself, cost her exhausted body. Escalation is quiet but legible; no reversal, yet the accrual of color-song-memory makes the stake feel increasingly fragile.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—free the boy or leave him muffled—surfaces in line 4 and tightens when his patricidal truth emerges. Mara’s agency is iterative: each needle insertion narrows her own future silence, a felt price. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal-reversal; the final stab is a cadence shift, not a new turn. Cost is visible (heavier internal quiet), though secondary spirits remain off-stage, keeping pressure slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can the Chapel’s silence still speak?—is signaled in paragraph 3. Escalation is textural: each compared frame thickens the pattern of identical head-tilts and spiral grass until silence becomes interpretable. The decisive tightening is Elena’s decision to expose the older foundation; this forecloses the “perfect documentation” option and risks Trust censure. Cost is legible: she trades certainty for reverence, a conceptual price paid on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: will Marina find—and accept—her grandmother’s last message? Pressure escalates methodically: each cylinder collected tightens the possibility of failure (oxygen, visibility, sub limitations). The decisive turn is reading Marsh’s note; it forecloses her implicit hope that the equations “solved” grief and instead forces acceptance of perpetual transformation—cost paid on-page in her deliberate shake of the globe during ascent. No off-stage resolutions; coincidence only places the globe where promised by earlier manifest.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“will anyone ever hear me?”—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is textural: each layer of graffiti tightens the visibility of formerly silent prayers. Cost is the balladeer’s surrender of invisibility; once the circuit closes, she can never again be “seldom-heard.” Agency is continuous; no coincidence resolves the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“prove empty spaces remember”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens through each recorded absence; the final spectral “homecoming” formation makes the cost legible. One meaningful deepening: shift from studying clouds to studying voids, narrowing options and raising reputational risk. Accumulative lens: pattern of absence-data intensifies rather than external plot reversals. No coincidence; pressure is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: can she honor the custodian’s invitation to “see differently” before the tree falls? Pressure escalates once: from arrival at dead custodian → discovery of coin → decision to preserve its pattern through her own asymptotic art. The tightening is textural: each mirrored attempt (canvas, coin, tree) narrows her options to mere continuation, not capture. Cost is felt: the library will fall, the coin’s detail remains invisible, yet she chooses to keep painting. Agency is renunciation/continuation rather than victory—a credible stance crystallization under situational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—escape the dead-air pocket—is signaled by paragraph 2 and tightened when Maren tests the hopscotch reversal. Cost is visible: the golden glow dissipates, ship tilts, starlings flee—environmental price is legible on-page. Agency is hers, not coincidence, fitting causal lens. One meaningful tightening is sufficient, but the personal stake (ambition vs. safety) stays abstract; escalation is more situational than internally wrenching.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will she learn repair or remain a passive opener—tightens when mirror-reflection forces her to hold one gear and hear silence-between-ticks; that moment forecloses the old identity. Escalation is one meaningful deepening, not multiple reversals, sufficient at 700 words. Cost is conceptual but legible: perpetual auditory double-heartbeat she can never un-hear. No coincidence; starlight spill is her deliberate agency.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—collective survival of the sharing economy—is signaled early and tightens once: merchant ship offer vs. communal refusal. Escalation is accumulative: each chalk message adds social pressure until the vote forecloses individual wealth. Cost is conceptual—future scarcity risk assumed together—but no personal resource is forfeited on-page, keeping the price abstract. Agency is distributed; ghost prompts, humans decide, so protagonist pressure is dilute.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake: can a mother’s song outlast the erasure of everything? Pressure escalates not through external antagonists but by each nesting that devours her remaining agency—until the last calibration is inward, irreversible. The tightening is visible: “she moved her hands…adjusting invisible calibrations…let herself become part of the pattern.” Cost is unmistakable—her body dissolves and the puppet turns to dust—yet the escalation is Accumulative; each layer of pattern deepens rather than narrows causal options. Slight minus: the world-scale stakes feel abstract next to the intimate grief; still, the lyrical design justifies the scale compression.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“save the hikers before night frost feeds them to trees”—is signaled early and tightens through literal countdown. Escalation is linear but sufficient: discovery of nut → patrol adjustment → guided exit → acceptance of eternal duty. Agency sits in Maren’s hovering footfalls and final voluntary return, both with on-page cost (freedom foregone). No second reversal or rising moral trade-off keeps it from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—translate grief into scientific continuation—is signaled early. Escalation under Causal lens: each foam re-patterning tightens the possibility that molecular “memory” could heal tissue, narrowing her avoidance into action. Visible price: she chooses the cold lab over warm nostalgia, foreclosing the fantasy that honoring Daniel means stasis. One meaningful turn suffices; cost legible on page.</answer>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges from foam → chrysalis → polymer chain homology; no explicit sermonizing. Subtext of “symphony” reweights from Daniel’s poetic aside to her actionable model, a quiet conceptual repricing. The ending refuses tidy moral—science is both mourning and betrayal—and invites counter-reading: is she healing or substituting? Epiphany is earned through tactile pattern recognition, not therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: can Mira locate the origin of remembering without contaminating the void? Pressure accumulates through sensory density: each groove she photographs adds tactile evidence that the void is already polluted. One decisive tightening: bottling the now-clouded moonlight commits her to selling collective forgetting—no reversal. Cost is legible: she forfeits ethical purity yet gains a marketable “homeopathic dose,” a trade-off felt in the final clause “weight the world had learned to release.”

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can Maren metabolize the fortress’s remorse without being subsumed?—is signaled in paragraph 3. Escalation is accumulative: each coral branch adds a sharper memory, tightening the emotional vise until the pavilion weeps. The cost is conceptual but legible: the coral’s preservation forfeits its existence once grief is digested. No antagonist is needed; the pressure is the cumulative weight of remorse itself.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—"bridge the silos"—is signaled early; escalation is the gradual audio recruitment of six elevators culminating in Seven’s song. Agency is mostly facilitative; Mira’s single risky act is the Tigrinya address, but it costs her nothing and failure is never tactile. Tightening occurs through sequential assent rather than narrowed options; coincidence is avoided. Cost is social but undramatized—no lost resource, no rebuttal, no fear of reprisal—so pressure plateaus rather than spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: recover or destroy the abandoned dream-archive. Escalation tightens once: mirror insertion → entangled flood → protocol flip. Cost is conceptual—Maya’s identity is now braided with strangers’ summers—but it is declared, not dramatized in a visible forfeiture (no lost relationship, tool, or stamina on page). Agency is present yet internal; pressure coheres under causal lens but stops short of a visceral price.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—archive survival via forgotten combination—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened when the hidden chamber exposes the masters’ prior planting. Inversion hour acts as live clock, foreclosing delay; every upward drift of sediment raises bodily cost. Protagonist agency drives each beat: she chooses the hour, pulls herself through thresholds, plants. Cost is visible in the final seed-press into stone that momentarily resists her thumb.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prove beauty can exist without sound—tightens when copper wire begins to draw blood; the tightening is visible, felt, and alters tactics (she cannot stop). Agency is continuous: every strum is a decision that narrows later options; painful fingertips are a persistent constraint shaping the crescendo. Cost is on-page and legible; escalation is accumulative rather than causal-reversal, satisfying its lens.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—city-saving covenant—signals in paragraph 2; escalation occurs through each chess demonstration that either compresses or expands magnetic geometries, narrowing Katrin’s options to “keep demonstrating or lose everything.” Agency is continuous; she initiates each correlation, pays with escalating exposure of her dismissed philosophy. Cost is felt when the beings re-arrange the board: she must now live inside an endless, thoughtful precision. One meaningful tightening is sufficient; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recover the diary—signaled in paragraph two and narrowed to a single live option: find the frequency or forsake Elena’s voice. Escalation is textural: each silence-sample deepens the emotional density (hesitation → protection → exhausted love) until the last vibration reweights what empathy costs. Agency is pure—every dial twist is Marcella’s choice, and the visible price is her trembling stamina and the tear-streamed reading that follows. No coincidence; the clasp yields only because she earns it.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—can she endure her own sensitivity—tightens once when the bloom begins and again when she chooses to stay, narrowing her options from flight to witnessing. The reversal is internal but legible: nausea escalates from “faint musk” to “overwhelmed” and is paid for with three days of voluntary exposure. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the cost is visceral and persistent. Stakes remain personal, but the on-page price is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—family survival—surfaces early and tightens when the echo names the buried treaty. The one-hour inversion clock visibly narrows options; failure means burial under returning gravity. Escalation is linear but effective: each water lane taken forecloses others. Cost is present (risk of crash, social exile), yet the final price feels prospective rather than paid, capping intensity just below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—understand the silence—tightens when wind charts reveal a living atmospheric trap; the meaningful deepening (pressure differential still rising) narrows Mara’s goal to urgent documentation. Agency is observational rather than interventionist, fitting the lens, but the evacuation back-story lessens felt jeopardy; the price is conceptual, not personal. Still, the foresight lesson is earned and forecloses any “crime” reading, so closure cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reseed wonder—tightens once: the chisel-spark yellow forces the anti-bell cascade, narrowing options from “perform music” to “perform silence.” Agency is pure: Kael engineers the synchronous moment and pays with perpetual quiet. Cost is on-page: “the bells hung silent…painting nothing but possibility,” a forfeiture of his own future song. Escalation under causal lens sufficient for 600-word scale.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can she reopen the lost world—tightens when flute note stretches instead of echoing, narrowing options to witness only. Agency drives escalation: her decision to keep playing after seeing the shimmer crystallizes the shift from rescue to documentation. Cost is visible: “the gilded flute itself was fading.” One meaningful turn suffices; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—map emotion’s math before celestial collapse—stays front-and-center; each star-loss beats like a metronome. Escalation is textural: halo on press bed + ink + fragment shatter fuses emotion into printable medium, foreclosing retreat. Operator’s agency drives the turn: he alone pulls the lever, pulverizing the fragment to bind empathy into paper at the cost of his last borrowed persona. Price is visible—walls dim, star gone, page now radioactive with shared loneliness, options narrowed to either solve or perish.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—carry wonder, not just parcels—surfaces early and tightens when she chooses conversation over haste; that choice forecloses the self-protective speed option. Pressure grows under causal lens: each pulse of the pendant costs time vulnerability. Herbalist beat reiterates the price: conversations become flowers that “never stop blooming,” proving irreversible commitment. No coincidence; escalation is her agency to extend moments.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prove objects absorb emotion—tightens when frost patterns confirm thesis and prism turns smoky; option to retreat to old skepticism foreclosed. Escalation is textural: each refracted shard adds density until rainbow vanishes, reweighting belief. Agency resides in Mara’s choice to soften vision and accept absorption; cost is the prism’s lost utility and the covert burden she assumes. No external antagonist needed—pressure is epistemic and emotional.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—message must cross impossible distance—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens through the seven-day weave; each day is a beat that forecloses stamina and life-force. The price is relentlessly visible: “fingers bled; she didn’t stop,” culminating in the chest-loosening departure of her own animating warmth. No coincidence intrudes; escalation is purely accumulative intensity ratcheted by repetition and bodily attrition.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—planet resurrection via personal obliteration—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is linear but meaningful: each hammer strike tightens the cost dial by erasing a slice of self. The single reversal is internal—glass → wood—but it is the planetary analogue to Kael’s own softening into oblivion, so pressure stays coherent. Price is visible and accumulating rather than spiking; that matches the lyric-causal design and satisfies the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—will Kaia shoulder the truth of her mother’s exile?—is signaled by the shard’s burn and tightens when the mother reveals illegality. One meaningful deepening: “the weight” shifts from abstract wound to literal apprenticeship cost. Agency is hers; she could seal the paths but instead steps into tutelage. Price is legible—she trades solitary freedom for cross-universe responsibility—though the off-stage legal threat feels slightly less visceral than the filial ache.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—answering the unseen keeper—tightens when the lamp dies and the final letter announces surrender. Escalation is accretive: each stone tower raises Vera’s implied promise, until the dark room forces her to verbalize commitment. Cost is present but soft: she pledges perpetual return, yet no immediate consequence (time, danger, reputation) is dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“steer them home or let them crash”—is signaled early and tightens through ritual precision; each storm deepens the pattern rather than reversing it. Agency is ritual endurance rather than decision; the meaningful turn is the synchronized course-correlation of three ships, visible proof that her prophecies bind reality. Cost accumulates texturally: each laugh costs her normal dread, each log entry costs societal connection. No single beat forecloses a live option, so the escalation stays accumulative rather than decisive; the price is felt but not sharply punctuated, keeping the score just below the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    Central stake—why stories stick to her—escalates through accumulating confessions rather than reversals; proprietor’s disclosure tightens the pattern into inherited duty. Cost is conceptual: she forfeits anonymity of observation; escalation is coherent under Accumulative lens, but no tangible resource is lost, keeping it just shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will Kael keep the labyrinth’s rating system pure or let in the unmeasured, arboreal grace—tightens once: the moment she chooses to re-tool the sextant against the oak beam, the old metric order is irretrievably breached. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence. The price is on-page: blistered palms, sleepless night, professional covenant broken. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; the storm’s flicker mirrors the irreversible internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“rekindle what had been lost”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and escalates through one meaningful tightening: the dawns will not stick without people, forcing Elara to spend her last coherence. Cost is visible on the page (thinning fragments) and shapes the final renunciation. No reversals beyond the single decisive shift, sufficient for 700-word scope. Agency is accumulative rather than causal-per-beat, coherent under the lyric-accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can solitude serve rather than suffocate?—tightens when the book “retreat that changes the world” reframes her empathy as gift, not wound. Pressure accumulates through pattern, not reversals: each paradox shelf deepens the cost of continuing pure withdrawal. Midnight deadline adds external cadence; hiding beat exposes social stakes. Cost visible in the final, irreversible nod that commits her to monthly exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can ordinary planting push back engineered forgetting? Pressure escalates as each garden memory surfaces (bakery bread, vanished neighbors) until tea-house reveals tenuous absolution for bystanders. One meaningful tightening: decision to seed the “younger” east wing crystallizes risk—time reversing may erase her too. Cost is felt but could be sharper if future consequence (arrest, exhaustion, temporal paradox) were hinted.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—save meaning from extinction—signalled early; pressure deepens as frequency readings reveal doom, narrowing options to transformation vs. total loss. Escalation is textural: each sampled frequency tightens the library’s mortality. Protagonist agency appears in the re-weaving act, paid for by irreversible structural failure; cost is visible when the capsule is released as surrogate future.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—identify the traitor—tightens precisely: three tagged lies narrow suspects to one. Sunrise clock adds external pressure; “her time was almost up” coincides with moral climax. Agency is continuous: she engineers the trap, confronts Kern, then actively erases the evidence. Cost is paid on-page: deletion of the confession she risked her life to obtain.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will empirical skepticism survive direct encounter?—is signaled early and tightened by each new tasted metal. One meaningful deepening: the ring’s re-interpretation from antique junk to “emergent compass” narrows her options to submit or remain blind. Protagonist agency drives the turn: she removes and offers the ring, paying with ancestral tether. Cost is visible on-page: “her skepticism transformed into luminous acceptance” carries irreversible conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—bury or release her art—tightens once: lock broken, painting gone, docent’s offer. Agency: she chooses ascent, paying the price of exposure. Cost is visceral: charcoal fingers leave literal trace of grief on the frame. No coincidence; escalation driven by her buried secret surfacing.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can candor survive in a society of necessary lies?—is signaled when the first fragment straightens her leaves. Escalation is incremental but coherent: each recovered shard tightens the possibility of public truth; the Archive scene forces the choice to keep hiding or begin speaking. Protagonist agency drives every turn: Mira decides to search, to bring Kade, to etch, to return. Cost is visible on the page: social risk (they could be ostracized for hoarding “emotional contraband”) and physiological drain (her papery fragility after years of wilting). No coincidence resolves; the depot discovery is earned by map logic.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve the audible color of wonder in a wordless world—surfaces in paragraph one and tightens as the ice shrinks, forcing Mara into a race with the sun. Escalation is textural: each droplet accelerates timbral density, moving from lone bass note to full choir; the meaningful turn is the moment the fragment becomes thumb-sized, signaling irreversible end. Cost is legible: the ice is gone, next winter’s silence approaches, and the gathered crowd now expects renewal she may not be able to deliver. No causal reversals are needed; the accretive inevitability is the point.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: restore internal coherence before electromagnetic chaos fries cognition. Escalation is accretive: each new fragment of static narrows options until only self-immolation or self-partitioning remains. Visible price: the farm, the last tangible child-artifact, and the android’s unbroken chassis integrity—all forfeited. Agency is constant—every burn line is laid by Unit-47’s damaged servos; no external rescuer.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—can listening lure a shut-away woman back to life?—is signaled early; pressure tightens when Iris appears in tears. Maya’s agency is to approach and offer key; this single beat re-opens Iris’s life, but cost is borne by Iris (sobbing, letters) rather than Maya, so protagonist price is oblique. Accumulative lens holds; one meaningful cadence shift sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—liberation via encoded dance—announced by paragraph three and sharpened each time she “writes” tide data that is really pirouette notation. Escalation is accumulative: every algae bloom, dice roll, and waltz across coral floor tightens the lattice until the walls hum back. The visible price is the forfeiture of her journals—years of coded self left behind—satisfying the felt-cost bar for this length. One soft note: external antagonists (guards, Ministry) remain off-stage props rather than adaptive pressure, slightly blunting the final release.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—“find where lost memories go”—is signaled on first page and tightens once: Maren must invent a retrieval method or surrender her grandmother forever. Agency is intellectual rather than external: a coffee-cup epiphany narrows options from hopeless to possible, paid with obsessive nights in a cavern. No antagonist, no reversal, but under Accumulative lens the single meaningful deepening is sufficient. Cost is conceptual not visceral; the price feels but does not scream.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“hush the prophecy before alignment”—is signaled early and escalates via countable ember-locations she must extinguish. Each traded hush narrows her future: deeper erasure duty, permanent isolation. Cost is visible in the apprentice’s ruined page and her own dawn-kneeling stiffness; alignment reduced to “merely astronomical” is a clear win with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—learning the language of old buildings—tightens when the narrator realizes the price is entry into immortal memory; the meteor shower intensifies this by offering a visible clock in the sky. One meaningful reversal: the agreed-upon lie flips into demanded truth, narrowing the narrator’s safe options from polite student to bound apprentice. Cost is legible on-page: loss of ordinary temporality (“never meant to be returned”). Pressure escalates under causal lens because each lesson removes the possibility of remaining merely human; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—can isolation become transformation rather than death?—is signaled early and tightens once when the shell-flower duet proves memories can stay “alive.” Agency is intellectual (Mara proposes the new method) but still forecloses the old specimen model; the cost is institutional/epistemic rather than personal-extreme. Under Accumulative lens, the density shift from frozen blooms to pulsing seeds is an adequate intensification. A visceral price (e.g., losing Anya again) would have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—free kingdom vs betray emperor—tightens with each brushstroke; visible price is her own blood and the dulled thorn. One meaningful escalation: refusal → reconsideration → execution under aurora shift. No coincidence; pressure is coherent and interior. Closure forecloses path: the decree is immutable once sealed, her innocence equally sealed.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—why some voices linger—signals early and tightens when Kael’s own voice splits, foreclosing her former single-song identity. The escalation is textural: each echo she uncovers adds density until the universe’s “secret song” reweights her purpose. Cost is conceptual but legible: perpetual double-singing is an irreversible new burden. A sharper visceral price (bleeding throat, disorientation) would have pushed higher.</answer>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges without moralizing: communication itself is a palimpsest—commerce on top, secret history beneath. The seashell’s reprise at the end re-weights the motif from curiosity to vocation. Reed-blown melancholy modulates into purposeful harmony, giving emotional aftereffect. Abstract final lines (“universe needed both to hum its secret song”) flirt with pseudo-profundity but stay anchored to Kael’s lived change.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—salvaging the truth of a dying planet—tightens once: Maya decodes the dream pattern and commits to resurfacing the logs. Escalation is Accumulative: each candle adds spectral evidence, narrowing possibilities until only the archival act remains; cost is the captain’s death, now borne by Maya as solitary messenger. No reversal is needed under this lens, but the pressure plate would feel sharper if the institution’s resistance or her own bodily risk were hinted.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: transmit “hidden effort” sight to the girl before mentorship begins. Pressure tightens when Chen tests the whisk-shadow pattern—if the girl fails to see, Chen’s life-purpose stalls. The beat is small but decisive: one flicked scatter of droplets forecloses silence and commits her to disclosure. Cost is the vulnerability of being misunderstood, felt but modest; hence not quite the 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. survival of the last green place—tightens once: the reconstructed memos force a binary, publish or protect. Escalation is intellectual rather than visceral, but the cost is made legible on-page when Maya ignites the evidence, trading her life’s mission for the orchard’s continuance.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—maintaining visionary neutrality while prophecies intensify—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens when soldiers arrive. One meaningful deepening: realization she is vessel, not source, narrows options to silence. Cost is legible: loss of personal agency, physical peril from warring camps, final renunciation of voice. Escalation is textural—accumulation of followers, stakes, storm intensity—rather than causal reversals, consistent with inferred Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—translate lost sounds to the living—signals at jar-labeling paragraph. Pressure escalates texturally: each added jar tightens the weave until the composite melody becomes too alive to hoard. The tightening is protagonist-driven; no external antagonist required. Cost is felt in the final image: Maren trades her invisibility for communal offer, pockets “only pennies and purpose.”

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—“protect sacred artifact without unleashing resonant collapse”—is signaled in the third paragraph and tightened when Kael demands “free it.” One meaningful escalation: the song’s jagged skip forces her from passive listening to active counter-composition, foreclosing the binary of shatter vs. silence. Cost is visible: Kael’s bodily freeze, her acceptance of lifelong stewardship. No coincidence; every pressure stems from prior ice-memory or her engineered choice.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—collective escape without triggering Directorate scans—tightens when the magnetic window is shown to be fleeting; any mis-step re-exposes them. The patient/glacier ethic itself becomes a second, internal stake: wildness must stay caged until the right moment. Escalation is accumulative: each quiet footstep under the humming viaduct adds density to the cost of discipline. Cost is legible in the final image: their prison lake is now behind them, but they still whisper, still walk softly—freedom not yet consumed.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—publish the truth vs. keep her job—signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when Chen’s drafted report is revealed. The reversal arrives with the fiber discovery: accidental drowning becomes deliberate entrapment, foreclosing the easy-sign option. Cost is visible—she forfeits career protection—but the beat is single; no secondary escalation. Pressure stays coherent under causal lens; coincidence only complicates (rains return) without resolving.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—will Marcus release the heart?—tightens once: seeing Sarah converts guilt into action, foreclosing the option to keep hiding. Pressure is coherent under causal lens; cost is the exposure of his fifteen-year failure. No escalation curve beyond the single turn, sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—map pre-conscious desire—announced early, but pressure is static: each kaleidoscope pattern confirms rather than complicates her path. No option is foreclosed, no price paid; the hunter-tip revelation adds texture instead of tighter options. Escalation is lexical (“absolutely idiotic that this works”) rather than tactical. The final “we’re not ready” is commentary, not a costly choice under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—recover erased minds—tightens when Mira learns they’re quarantined, not deleted, forcing an irreversible trespass. Pressure escalates via pattern recognition rather than external opposition; the cost is implied (job, safety), but not yet felt on the page, keeping it just shy of the 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—feud may fracture future generations—is signaled in paragraph three and tightened when the elders handle the fragment; option to keep hating is foreclosed by felt shared memory. Pressure grows causally: each mirror glimpse increases emotional cost until the final apple-grab image crystallizes the trade-off. Visible price: Kael risks her authoritative mystique by letting them feel her power; elders pay with public vulnerability. No coincidence; escalation is driven by her agency and the shard’s glimpses. Sufficient for 600-word scale.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“learn the sound of approaching endings”—tightens when the grandmother’s song literalizes that sound while Vera ferries life instead of waiting for death. Escalation is textural: each ice crack, child laugh, and keystroke adds density until the un-pressed button becomes the decisive cost. Agency is present but quiet; a louder external jeopardy beat (e.g., panicking child, capsizing risk) would have pushed this to 9-band. Still, the accrued texture reweights options under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—escape vs stay—tightens once: next bus not till morning. Grafting parable escalates by reframing family feud from fatal to “tension waiting to become complexity,” narrowing Elena’s options. Cost is legible: she forfeits city security and family approval. No coincidence; pressure is purely interpersonal and cumulative.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving walker knowledge—faces a single, irreversible cost: personal erasure into stone. Escalation is steady: first the echo is declared fading, then consecration is shown, finally the sacrifice is exacted. Agency remains with Maya; she initiates the demonstration and consents. Cost is visible and conceptually weighty, though emotional punch is slightly muted because the prophet’s stake is abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prove language is still growing—signals early and tightens when she activates the crystal, foreclosing her safety as anonymous scholar. Conceptual cost is legible: if Council rejects her, she becomes pariah; story lets that cost hang. No visible resource loss (time, money, stamina) on-page; escalation is epistemic, not visceral—keps sub-8.5. One clear deepening: child’s future-coinage “serendipity-engine” shatters finality myth.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving the sound of aging—tightens once: capture equals kill, so renunciation becomes the only costly stance. Agency is sustained attention and refusal; no external antagonist needed. Pressure accumulates through fog thickening and memory thinning; coincidence is absent. Cost is legible: Marcus’s trembling hand and Sarah’s chalk line make the forfeiture concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single dominant stake: synchronize telescopes before lunar transit or lose data—tight, time-boxed, and repeatedly shaken. Escalation is textural: each new tremor increases pressure on the clock fix; no arbitrary reversals. Mira’s agency drives the turning point—she renounces standard time, choosing tremor-time, foreclosing any return to “correct” chronometry. Cost is felt: the clock will never again tell human time, a loss dramatized in the closing auditory image.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“flawless goodbye”—signaled early. Escalation via Maya’s phone crusade: each unanswered call tightens failure risk. Cost visible when Linda finally arrives; alternative path (permanent silence) foreclosed. No reversal, but deepening suffices for 600-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“where do shadows go?”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and escalates from metaphysical puzzle to literal existential erasure. The midpoint tightening occurs when she recognizes Kelm and herself in the cases: the option to remain a shadow is foreclosed as ontologically incomplete. Cost is legible: she must surrender either independent existence or wholeness. Agency drives every beat: her key-turn, her vigil, her pending noon decision.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“can displaced children go home?”—is signaled early by Thomas and tightens through each bone placement, culminating in a narrowing two-way exchange. Agency is shared: Maren’s medical reordering + Thomas’s memory objects; together they foreclose the option of leaving the mistake intact. Visible price: the changeling forfeits his tooth, Maren forfeits lifelong epistemic safety; both costs are on-page at the beat of crossing. One meaningful escalation is sufficient at this length; no reversal is required, only the deepening recognition that constellation = portal, which reweights stakes from rescue to cosmic realignment.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—transform pain into non-burning light—tightens once: the white shard must achieve stillness or the wall’s constellation stays incomplete. Agency is continuous (weigh, polish, place); each stroke forfeits time and microscopic flesh. Escalation is density-driven: more shards = softer light = smaller chance she’ll ever strike a match. Cost is visible in cracked fingertips and the admission that some memories (blue fragments) remain un-transformed.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—can shared silence graft meaning onto wounds—tightens once: the executive speaks, Mira answers with the pendant, silence converts to shared charged poise. Pressure is accumulative: each drip widens the moss constellation, visually marking time and emotional saturation. Agency is bilateral yet soft: Mira’s offer is a renunciation of vengeance, the executive’s acceptance a self-imposed exile from absolution. No visible price is extracted from Mira, so escalation stays lyrical rather than visceral, capping the band just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring forgotten songs to heal land/spirits—is signaled early and tightened by the moon-dawn deadline. Agency is present: each song increases tendril response, culminating in the golden glow. Cost is conceptual (she will never be credited), but no tangible resource is lost, keeping the price ethereal. Escalation is steady but single-thread; no secondary opposition or reversal beyond the moon’s inevitable fade.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—reach the dead daughter’s heartbeat-route—anchors early and tightens once: the map’s completion forecloses her old life the instant the paper ignites. Pressure accumulates via density: each piece of trash equals one pulse, starlight pools, options narrow to “memorize or lose forever.” Cost is visible—the ash, the returning cold—though the cosmic-pulsar beat feels like a lucky revelation rather than earned reversal. Sufficient for 8-band, not the persistent constraint needed for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—private comprehension versus public revelation—signals early. Escalation is accumulative: each session densifies the echo-archive, tightening the stakes of disclosure. Midnight lamp session supplies the one meaningful deepening. Cost is intellectual solitude; visible but not visceral—hence not quite 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—will she gather the ungatherable weights?—is signaled early; pressure accrues via density, not reversal, as each alcove reveals deeper recursion. The single meaningful tightening is the recognition that collection unweaves existence; this is a conceptual, not tactical, narrowing. Cost is present but abstract: the endless task itself. Escalation is textural (pattern-thickening) rather than option-closing; no credible loss of tool, time, or social credit alters later moves, keeping the score below 8.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can loss be contained without crushing?—tightens once: subtractive carving vs. irreplaceable Viktor; the laugh-curve becomes the irreversible narrowing; escalation is single but sufficient under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—create vs. abandon personal legacy—signals early. Escalation is tonal/density-based: accumulating story-shards tighten the vise of unmade gardens until wheel-click forces the decisive tightening. Cost is visible: accepting the ghost’s touch means abandoning the alibi of perpetual maybe. No causal reversal, but accrual pattern break satisfies Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—prove adaptive reuse is possible—tightens when permits and volunteers must be recruited; each system redirected (water, heat, solar) forecloses the original aerospace function. No visible personal price (tuition, sleep, reputation) is dramatized, so escalation feels civic rather than visceral; still, the cumulative loss of launch capacity supplies conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—can she break her vow of silence—tightens once when the bow meets string; the price (public shame of imperfect sound) is named and paid on-page, though escalation is single-turn rather than progressively complex.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—truth versus seductive myth—tightens when the radio silence signals the myth’s intentional architecture. One decisive turn: Marcus shifts from seeker to salvager, narrowing his options from quest to evidence-gathering. Cost is legible: the Compass of Veiled Hours is revealed as hollow, replacing wonder with grief. No coincidence; every escalation is driven by his uncovering of Dessen’s maps.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—save dying chamomile—signaled ~5% in; tightening occurs when rope decodes fulgurite use, foreclosing ignorance. Agency is intellectual (decoding, planning), cost conceptual (lifetime patience), satisfying under accretive lens. No external antagonist or tangible risk, so escalation is perceptual rather than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—Marina’s detachment versus healing engagement—tightens when she chooses to steady Thomas’s hand, foreclosing observer stance. Pressure escalates via accumulative pattern: each recited absence sharpens the risk of her own disappearance. Cost visible: she misses the last ship symbolically by staying present. No coincidence; escalation is causal under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—rekindle beauty in a mechanized void—clarifies early and tightens through each failed calibration; options narrow to “succeed with hybrid or accept silence.” One decisive turn: the first pinhole into shell commits him irreversibly; no reset is possible. Escalation is accumulative: each stolen tube, skipped meal, and microscopic glimpse raises emotional and social cost until the hatch crystallizes the stakes in one glowing body. No external coincidence resolves tension; success itself is imperfect, so pressure stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake is legible by line 4: can Maya graft enough beauty to out-sing her father’s fires? Pressure tightens once when Marcus’s burned hands tremble on the blade—if the graft fails, her entire project loses credibility. No external antagonist is needed; the tightening is emotional and conceptual. The cost is visible: she forfeits the coins forever, foreclosing any future private reconciliation with her father.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restore feeling-memories—signaled early; escalation delivered through shard-collection beats that foreclose retreat. Final placement costs her residual glow, a visible price. Pressure coherent under causal lens; no coincidence resolves. One deepening suffices; no explicit antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: will this seeding break the fire-cycle? Pressure escalates via each gear-reckoning that proves futility; the tightening is conceptual but visceral—“that old, troubling serenity” names the cost. Decision to seed anyway is a renunciation that forecloses the option of giving up; price is lifetime disappointment. No external antagonist; internalized pattern suffices for coherent pressure under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—how to carve grief’s communal flow—surfaces early and tightens when each dusk lesson threatens Elena’s solitary identity; the meaningful turn is the ribbon’s reveal, narrowing her options to connected design. Cost is conceptual (she forfeits the safety of isolated sorrow) rather than viscerally felt; a single beat of public testing—e.g., a family reacting to her first linked headstones—would have made price tangible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore balance between living guilt and drowned memory—tightens when each carved name leaves the rake handle forever, foreclosing re-transfer. One meaningful escalation: the bob’s glow accelerates from “faint” to “schools of silver fish,” visualizing stakes for the whole town. Agency is ritual precision; one slip would jam the clock and erase the dead. Cost is cumulative and visible: the handle ends “light,” its freight permanently migrated onto the mechanism she must still service tomorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can the dead be faithfully tended—tightens once: the tapestry cipher forecloses the option that Castellan was merely eccentric, replacing it with the obligation to bear witness. Cost is visible on-page: Mira’s all-night labor, the ache in her knees, the decision to graft a living rose onto the grave—agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—colony survival—signaled in paragraph 2. One meaningful tightening: Future Two’s 41 % collapse risk forces the imaginative leap to Future Three. Cost is conceptual (innovation may die) rather than personal, keeping pressure cerebral. Escalation is accumulative—each future lowers the safety margin until only the un-mapped thermal option remains.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—keep the stories alive under state surveillance—tightens when patrol nears; option set narrows to “risk capture or silence.” Agency is continuous (encoding lyrics, cloaking dial) rather than one decisive beat; the pattern intensifies rather than reverses, satisfying Accumulative lens. Cost is visible: glow leaks, dust brightens, danger persists. No causal reversal, but deepening suffices at this length; could enter 8.8+ if a single beat forced an irrevocable trade-off on page.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—permanence vs obliteration—signaled in line 1. Escalation is density-driven: each new portrait layer thickens the lie, tightening the cost of discovery. Micro-turn when Cassius asks “Will you scatter this one too?” forces on-page false promise; option to confess is foreclosed. Price is conceptual but visible: Mira must live as keeper of the very permanence she denounces. Could use one tangible loss (broken kiln filter, expended shard) to raise band.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—can these divided kids sing together?—is clear early, but pressure escalates only by accretion: more weeks, more voices, no single beat where a student must choose harmony over loyalty or pay a price for doing so; the final braid is lovely but not a tightening turn.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—clandestine restoration of banned knowledge—tightens once: Council threat → moon-window → irrevocable fruit. Agency is continuous pruning; each snip forecloses a toxic memory, narrowing future options toward the “beautiful” strain. Cost is legible: she forfeits anonymity and risks Council reprisal (“tomorrow, someone would taste”). Escalation is linear rather than a sharp reversal, adequate for 700-word scale.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“will the house accept her witness?”—tightens when each displacement raises the cost of error. The reversal is the house’s exhale, forcing her stance shift. Price is felt: her prior life of detached noticing ends.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will the descendant accept the morally messy truth?—is signaled early and tightens when the ampoule is literally pressed to her chest. Agency sits with her: she could swim away; instead she opens the memory serum, accepting vocal exile. Cost is legible—she trades ancestral pride for perpetual witness. Escalation is a single deepening rather than multiple reversals, adequate for 700-word scale.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can she prove her way out?—tightens with each hundred-step trial; the 0.7 °C confirmation is a micro-turn that keeps hope alive. The rupture is the proof itself: escape becomes forbidden by her own logic, a decisive narrowing of options. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable: perpetual motion equals perpetual imprisonment. Escalation is single-threaded yet sufficient; no coincidence muddies the slope.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—prove kindness persists—threads every beat; each new face tightens the pattern like a lexical entry. The “rousing” moment deepens rather than reverses, reweighting her fatigue into visionary access; cost is legible (she will seek the anonymous giver, surrendering anonymity herself). Pressure stays coherent under accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves anything. A second tightening beat (e.g., paint shortage) could have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can culture survive displacement? Pressure tightens when shared grief is voiced in front of the recipe card; the invitation to bake forecloses her private refuge, turning guide into guardian. Escalation is lyric-accretive rather than plot-reversing: each exhibit accrues unbearable weight until the violinist’s tear drops, forcing Celeste’s offer. Cost is legible: she trades solitary ritual for communal vulnerability, a price she’ll pay every dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“step beyond fate’s design”—is signaled early and tightens through each tide cycle. Reversal at the throw: future pulls, then option narrows to one irreversible recall. Cost is legible in the “thread by thread” unmaking of his life. Escalation is causal and sufficient for 800-word scope.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
    <comment>Theme emerges through the spiral-not-line metaphor and the yoyo’s return: time is construct, fate is rewindable, but every retrieval demands self-dissolution. No moralizing; final image offers conceptual repricing without statement. Particulars (clock gears, crystal seed, hunger stone) carry expanding symbolic mass. Resonance reweights prior material with chilling exhilaration.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“will she keep hiding from erasure or embrace it?”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens once: the dictionary entry forces the choice to speak. Cost is legible on-page: each confession literally erases more facial detail, foreclosing the option to ever be seen clearly again. Escalation is causal under chosen lens; no coincidence resolves. One meaningful turn satisfies 600-word scope; secondary stakes (advisor’s motive, carnival back-story) remain optional.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—orchard survival—signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when fractal clouds portend “destroy or transform.” One meaningful escalation: Kael shifts from reading tides to authoring a counter-fractal song that harmonizes with the wave architecture. Cost is visible—three hours of physical playing, collapse, salt-apple taste—foreclosing rest and certainty. Agency remains causal under the lens; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“does the city drift blind?”—tightens when Mira learns the turtles are driven, not free. The whistle sequence provides one clear escalation beat that forecloses ignorance; however, the council’s betrayal is revealed only through static carvings, so the human antagonist never applies live pressure. Cost is legible but once-removed.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—exposing institutional falsification—is signalled by line 3 and personalizes when her own book is suppressed. One meaningful tightening: Council suppression → Aldric evidence → decision to publish. Price is declared (career loss) but not felt in-scene; no live option is foreclosed on the page. Escalation stays intellectual; pressure plateaus after the manuscript is secured.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“preserve what has vanished”—is signaled early and tightens when the cement crew’s arrival threatens permanent erasure. Single meaningful turn: professional duty flips to covert archive at the moment he chooses the crack over the clipboard. Cost is visible: the clay seal is temporary, guaranteeing perpetual return and perpetual secrecy. Escalation is accretive rather than causal, but the rising water mirrors rising obligation cleanly under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prove sabotacy theory—signals early (three-week-old letters) and tightens when blackout defeats the lock, forcing the clandestine shoot. One meaningful deepening: realizing Preservation Society didn’t lose but was erased; this re-weights risk and forecloses open protest, pushing Marcus into secret-archivist stance. Escalation is causal under chosen lens; each photographed page raises on-page exposure cost. No coincidence in resolution; security proximity complicates, does not save. Price is legible: forfeiture of moral transparency—he must keep pretending. Just shy of 8.8 only because antagonistic pressure (security) is generic, not personalised.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—transform grief into bearable form—signaled in paragraph 2; escalation is accretive, each lantern tightening the density of recorded dreams until the thousandth crane crystallizes the communal shift. No external antagonist; pressure is internal/time-based (thousand-crane vow) and visibly costs Mira’s nights of polishing/folding. The final illumination is not luck but the logical cumulation of her craft; options are reweighted when private grief becomes public garden she must maintain.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—releasing dammed futures—signals early and escalates via data spikes and altitude bleed, but agency is observational until the final smile; no narrowing fork forces a tactical choice. Cost is conceptual (paradox risk) rather than dramatized loss. Pressure is accumulative/textural: density of ghost-futures builds effectively. One meaningful deepening (coherence becomes “awakening”) satisfies the lens. Could use one beat where she must sacrifice life-support or data to proceed.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—find personal frequency—tightens when chip patterns match live sky, narrowing options to “send signal or stay silent.” Cost is conceptual but legible: Mara trades anonymity for network exposure. Escalation is single-wave but sufficient for 700-word frame; pilgrim adds thematic pressure, not antagonistic.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. protective lie—tightens when Clara substitutes the grandfather’s carved hand for Maren’s fabricated lineage; this narrows Maren to confession under the cobalt sky. The cost is legible: Maren’s professional identity as “memory architect” is forfeited in the final line. One escalation beat suffices under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prevent war via truth-exchange—signaled early and tightened when both admit their governments lied. One meaningful escalation: mutual revelation of covered-up atrocities narrows their options to either collude on truth or return to liars’ deadlock. Agency resides in the joint decision to risk espionage for honesty; cost is the implied death sentence if exposed. Pressure coherent under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—align heart with action—arrives early and tightens once: “Current’s tricky… hesitate and you’ll get pushed back,” forcing full commitment. The backlash of regrets is declared, then dramatized by dawn departure and solitary paddle; price is the solitude and stalled years. Escalation is single but sufficient for 750-word scope; no artificial reversals. James off-page keeps antagonistic pressure abstract, yet water current localizes the test.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—can a hollowed woman choose to feel again—tightens once: the baseball forces an active decoding quest that risks exposing her erased crimes to herself. The descent physically enacts narrowing options; cost is implicit in the irreversible commitment to a redemptive path she cannot yet feel.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—meet dead brother—signaled early; pressure tightens when transformation becomes the only path. Reluctance escalates cost: each sensory step forward intensifies the threat of self-dissolution. Phoenix-lit world rule is persistent constraint, not coincidence. One meaningful deepening suffices; no false reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—retrieve vs accept lost time—signaled early, tightens once when shimmer reveals time pooled in emptiness; no second tightening needed at this length. Agency visible: she chooses to leave card, keep saucer; this costs her certainty and grants earned poise. Cost is on-page: future birthdays will still hold gaps, but they will be shared gaps. Escalation pattern fits Accumulative lens: starlight, ink, hand-prints layer until knowledge reframes, no causal turns required.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: can a pacifist reopen a sealed dimension without violence? Pressure intensifies via texture—each stitched tear adds literal weight to the membrane they must breach. One meaningful tightening: when the photographs tear open, renunciation is no longer an option; passage requires accepting permanent weightlessness. Cost is visible on-page: Ren’s soles leave the deck for good, a price that cannot be reset.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is the need to grasp transformation’s texture; pressure escalates through density of omens (bugs, planetary alignment, elder’s words) rather than option-narrowing events; final release tightens the cadence and reweights the stake with felt cost—loss becomes creative medium under the volcano’s imminent rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—free the prisoners before the lower levels are sealed—tightens at the blackout beat; 72-hour clock is declared and felt. Mira’s agency drives every increment: embeds angles, retrieves holder, encodes next phase, accepts final patrol. Cost is the irreversible exposure she embraces in the last paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“decode before the ocean takes her”—is signaled early and tightens once: the pattern is not about the past but the future, forcing her from solitary decoder to future teacher. Price is conceptual (she must abandon elusivity) rather than visceral, but it is legible in the final image. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal required. Escalation is coherent under Causal lens; visions grow insistent because her earlier mistakes raised urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: map scars beyond state reach. Tightening occurs when envelope reveals state-violence negatives—knowledge that reweights danger. Agency: she keeps developing under nascent threat, foreclosing retreat. Cost visible (tremor, implicit peril). Under Accumulative lens, scar-density peaks here; no further twist needed for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single dominant stake—free assembly versus state control—tightens when the duel becomes a live test of wills; the card’s cipher raises personal exposure. Escalation proceeds via blade pressure and verbal ripostes; no coincidence resolves anything. Felt cost arrives only in the final salute, slightly late for top band. Agency is high: every parry and argument is Theodora’s tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether the poet will keep fleeing or root himself—tightens once: the moment he empties the letters into soil forecloses escape, price paid on-page. Escalation is accumulative: each seed planted and book shelved increases density until renunciation is the only option left. No coincidence; the library’s transformation is entirely agency-driven. Persistent constraint (tin emptied) shapes the final image under the selected lens.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: visibility vs. self-erasure. Pressure tightens once: the horizon’s nightfall deadline forces the final chord and the choice to return publicly authentic. The cost is the loss of the magical refuge and the safety of anonymity. Agency sits squarely with Marcus—he chooses the encore, carries the compasses home. No reversal overload; one meaningful tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes—cultural memory specificity—tighten once: gray mist vs. seed. The planting act is agency under pressure, foreclosing abandonment. No visible resource loss (tool, stamina) is dramatized, so the cost is conceptual rather than visceral, keeping it just below the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can she navigate out of grief without her mother’s apology—is signaled early. Escalation is a single deepening: the lace pattern reveals her mother was already sailing home, collapsing the external storm into internal severance. Cost is visible: she relinquishes ever hearing the apology spoken, accepting instead the sky’s color as proxy. Pressure is coherent but gentle; Takeshi functions as pressure valve rather than intensifier, keeping escalation lyrical rather than urgent.


== Grader: Qwen 3 Max ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reconciling control with chaos—is signaled early and deepens via accumulated dust patterns. Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency: daily returns, documentation, and eventual acceptance. The fresh butterfly raises stakes by proving transformation. Cost is felt but not visceral; the emotional price of relinquishing intellectual purity remains slightly abstract, preventing a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—surviving not just fire but complicity—is signaled early and tightens when Elena connects the patron’s questions to the ledger’s hiding place. Agency lies in attention: her choice to study gaps, not data, drives escalation. Cost is felt in lost art, bodily scars, and the moral weight of testifying. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each observation intensifies thematic and investigative stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—translating silence into music—is signaled early and deepens when Claire’s memory generates D-minor with major lifts. Marina’s agency drives escalation: she chooses test subjects, interprets data, initiates self-mapping. The cost is felt in what’s irrevocably lost (hearing) and what’s gained (a new compositional language), charged by the tuning fork’s mute vibration.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—giving the drowned dead rest in their element—is signaled early and deepens when Meridian realizes her lifelong error. Escalation is driven by her agency: placing lens fragments, entering the four-fold room, assembling the lens anew. Cost is unmistakable: she abandons her former role, becoming eternal keeper. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens—distress signals intensify then resolve through her actions, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—intergenerational cohesion under sanctions—is signaled early and tightens when the youngest family announces departure, forcing Mira’s thirteen-ring gambit. This escalation stems from her agency (not coincidence) and narrows options: stay fractured or cohere. The cost is felt in dwindling resources and eroded pride, which the anonymous system mitigates until the climax reweights it as shared dignity. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure grows via density (more contributors) and pattern break (public declaration), culminating in a stance crystallization that forecloses dispersal.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—where unused love goes—is signaled early and deepened through breathwork. Marina’s agency drives escalation: she chooses rhythm, adjusts crystal, interprets light. Cost is felt—the woman’s ribs press against trauma, then ease. One meaningful tightening suffices: breath sync dissolves the knot. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; healing emerges from shared attention.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding time’s texture—is signaled early and intensifies through Miriam’s agency: she chooses to enter the maze with the fragment, knowing the risk. The meaningful deepening occurs at the center, where geometry folds most intensely, forcing a trade-off between self-preservation and revelation. Cost is unmistakable: her edges disintegrate, photographs unbecome, yet she endures with reverence. Pressure coheres accumulatively, not causally, fitting the lens perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (preserving seeds as rebellion) tightens when boots approach, forcing Mira to decode faster. Agency drives escalation: her strategic patience yields the vault before soldiers arrive. Cost is unmistakable—three years imprisoned, now risking capture to protect knowledge. The soldier’s bolt cutters reweight freedom from regime-change to stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—capturing trust’s fracture frequency—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: Mira gathers absences, then transforms her own losses into the device’s core. The tightening occurs when she realizes trust-breaking is “not an absence but a transformation,” forcing her to innovate beyond her usual method. Cost is unmistakable: she imprints her dying cells into the component, trading biological continuity for therapeutic legacy. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each void collected reweights the final resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—access to illuminated moments—is signaled early and tightens when Mira sees her own portrait, forcing reinterpretation. Agency drives escalation: decoding flowers, uncapping the jar, releasing portraits. Cost is conceptual (abandoning theft for witnessing) and felt in her pulse quickening, then surrendering. Coincidence never resolves; pressure accumulates via protagonist’s choices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—creating sanctuaries for unresolved questions—is signaled early and tightens when Mira confronts the researcher’s despair (“We were wrong about everything”). Her agency drives escalation: choosing to stay, narrate, and shape glass despite institutional abandonment. Cost is unmistakable: exile, professional scorn (“intellectually reckless”), and the burden of witnessing planetary grief. The deepening occurs silently but decisively—her belief that “remembering and forgetting are both acts of survival” reframes the entire conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming selfhood—is signaled early and tightens when Carson appears, forcing Maya to weaponize her “flaw” (fear) as strategy. Her bluff leverages seven years of conditioned performance, turning vulnerability into tactical advantage. Cost is legible: she forfeits her constructed life to embrace fractured truth. Escalation is driven by her agency, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—mapping the coming eternal night via silence—is signaled early and tightens as the last star fades. Maren’s agency drives escalation: she observes, retreats, interprets, and finally writes, transforming passive witness into active cartographer. Cost is felt: irreversible isolation, the oracle’s death, the vanished star. No coincidence resolves tension; insight arises from sustained attention under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding where thoughts come from—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency: J-7 chooses to play the violin, triggering amalgamation. Escalation occurs via density increase (fractals → music → resonance) under Accumulative lens, not coincidence. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: J-7 accepts infinite repetition as the price of understanding. The tightening forecloses the path of linear inquiry, crystallizing stance without external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—moral accountability in institutional silence—is signaled early and deepens when Mira shifts from observer to actor. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her decision to eavesdrop (not coincidence) uncovers Viktor’s confession, forcing her to choose between complicity and confrontation. The tightening forecloses Mira’s prior paralysis (“I thought maybe it wasn’t my place”) and Viktor’s hidden life, with cost felt in his crumpled face and their joint walk toward consequences. Pressure remains coherent under the Causal lens, though Elena’s role slightly dilutes singular focus.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—proving gardens remember their gardeners—is signaled early and deepens when Elara deliberately tanks her metrics, foreclosing career survival for truth validation. Escalation is driven by her agency: cessation of care forces the garden’s “testimony.” Cost is unmistakable: three seasons of decline, Council’s arrival, and potential dismissal. The final spike in “luck” reweights the entire conflict under Accumulative pressure, with no off-stage resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—proving time moves sideways—is signaled early and deepens through Renna’s secret work. Agency is clear: she chooses to continue despite obligation. The tightening occurs when Voss interrupts, forcing delay, then returns to witness her breakthrough—elevating personal validation to scientific revolution. Cost is felt in her fear of exposure and the irreversible loss of obscurity.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—deciphering Magdalena’s code—is signaled early and deepens as water reveals increasingly complex patterns. Celeste’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to enter, retrieve the program, interpret its signs, and finally plunge her hands into the pit. The cost is conceptual but undeniable: accepting that true music resides in silence requires unlearning a lifetime of training. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with each page-turn tightening the thematic vise.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—whether to trust the margins of data—is signaled early and deepened when Mira admits filtering out anomalies that killed Eva. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to lower sensor thresholds despite Chen’s warning, accepting more false positives. Cost is unmistakable: “certainty is what killed her.” The tightening forecloses her old method forever, crystallizing a new ethics of forecasting under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—uncovering swallowed truth—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the radio confession forecloses passive observation, forcing Mara into advocacy. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her appraisal of calls leads to physical descent, which enables the climactic broadcast. Cost is unmistakable: she inherits the burden of justice, symbolized by the valve wheel’s weight. Pressure coheres under the Causal lens without reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—faithfully witnessing transformation—is signaled early and deepens when the obsidian refuge catalyzes a new folding pattern, forcing the keeper to relinquish authorial control over her record. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (she chooses to place the stone, to refold), narrowing her path from observer to conduit. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: true chronicle requires forgetting, and wisdom emerges only through loss. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, though the tightening could be slightly more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reconnection across emotional chasm—is signaled early and tightens via eclipse’s rare window. Maya’s agency drives the escalation: inviting Diane, playing the lullaby, presenting the curl. Cost is visible in Diane’s vulnerability and Mrs. Chen’s lifelong holding-on. Coincidence (eclipse timing) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from human choice within celestial frame.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving human resonance against erasure—is signaled early and tightens when Caroline’s “dark rooms with no doors” reveals dream-loss as existential collapse. The historian’s agency lies in attention: choosing to transcribe fragments forecloses forgetting, with cost in her eternal wakefulness. Escalation is textural (accumulating diary shards) not causal, but under the Accumulative lens, the deepening of “displaced axis” as metaphor-to-mechanism reweights stakes decisively. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres through sensory accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—meaning vs. accident—is signaled early and deepens when the stranger reveals decades of real-world consequence. Pressure tightens once: the microdot transforms abstract irony into tangible legacy. Margaret’s agency lies in her final stance (to continue or not), not action; cost is conceptual but felt. Coincidence complicates (fortunes found randomly) but doesn’t resolve—the revelation stems from her own words returning.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.2)
    The dominant stake—preventing full possession by disproving the demon’s metaphysical premise—is signaled immediately and escalates through Micah’s rhetorical deepening. His agency drives every turn: recording silence, questioning assumptions, applying white paint. The tightening occurs when he shifts from addressing Elena to directly confronting the entity’s paradox (“If you are nothing, how can you speak?”), narrowing its ontological foothold. Cost is felt in the shared trembling post-exorcism and the fragility of their victory—completed only because they acted before possession finalized.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—translating homesickness into prophetic truth—is signaled early and deepens as exhaustion encroaches. Maya’s agency drives escalation: she races the sun, choosing which memories to mine, knowing each fortune costs stamina. The tightening is visceral—“exhaustion gathering at the edges”—and culminates in a trade-off: produce meaning before clarity fades. Cost is felt in her body and the irreversible passage of the mirrored moment.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—conquering the labyrinth of self—is signaled early and tightens when Maya realizes the viaduct dims not externally but through her own corroding hope. Agency drives escalation: her choice to keep retracing timelines leads directly to the conceptual turning point. Cost is unmistakable: ten thousand iterations of despair crystallize into the renunciation of perfectionism, foreclosing endless searching with visible emotional toll.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming emotional connection through non-auditory music—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes technique alone can’t penetrate numbness. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses to reverse playback, demanding “perfect stillness” that forecloses conventional teaching methods. Cost is felt: she sacrifices surface legitimacy, her students surrender agency (“Don’t play—just feel”), and the cavern becomes a pilgrimage site only by excluding the noisy world. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, though the transition from personal quest to communal healing slightly softens individual pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving truth against weaponized data—is signaled early and deepens when the message arrives. Maren’s agency lies in renunciation (not handing over records) and creation (parallel documentation). The tightening occurs when she realizes neutrality is impossible; her lateral method forecloses compliance without overt confrontation. Cost is felt in her heightened vigilance and the burden of sole witness.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding why scent unmoors him—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency: he initiates the test, waits three days, performs the side-by-side comparison. The meaningful tightening occurs at blooming: identical scents yield divergent emotional responses, foreclosing the hope that replication equals resurrection. Cost is felt in his tears for the old vial alone—irreplaceable context cannot be engineered. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence or soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding or choosing the new texture of time—is signaled early and deepens through Elena’s obsessive layering and Marcus’s quiet reframing. The meaningful intensification occurs when Marcus declares, “The beings aren’t destroying… they’re inviting us to weave,” which reweights the conflict from loss to co-creation. Cost is unmistakable: Elena’s trembling hand, Marcus’s acknowledgment of fear alongside hope. Though escalation is contemplative rather than action-driven, it’s coherent under the Accumulative lens and driven by protagonist insight, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—restoring sound to a hushed world—is signaled early and deepens when she recognizes the ships’ hum as a “song with no release.” Her agency drives escalation: she matches, layers, and releases sounds rather than imposing resolution. Cost is felt in the world’s fragile response (birds call, water laps “more freely”) and her relinquishment of control over how sound returns.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—relief from grief at the cost of authentic memory—is signaled early and deepens as Maren applies the petal. The meaningful tightening occurs when Thomas’s jagged pain smooths into amber contentment, foreclosing access to raw truth. Agency lies in Maren’s choice to offer this trade, and the cost (her own eroding authenticity) is unmistakable in the final paragraph. Pressure remains coherent under the Situational lens, with no coincidental resolution—only deliberate, morally fraught service.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—visibility for invisible labor—is signaled early via the dockworkers’ photo and Marlena’s profession. Pressure tightens when Theo appears, transforming abstract guilt into actionable collaboration. The meaningful deepening occurs when Marlena voices her plan, narrowing her path from passive observer to active initiator. Cost is visible in her shame and implied in future effort; the night crews’ mention sharpens moral calculus. Coincidence (wrong address) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the agency remains hers.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—belonging through communal mystery—is signaled early and tightens when the sculptor offers her gift, transforming passive longing into active collaboration. The escalation is protagonist-driven: her offer catalyzes paired searches, shared stories, and mutual vulnerability. Cost is felt in disclosed losses (vanished daughter, abandoned ice-sculpting) and culminates in the bittersweet ache of connection. Coincidence (child finding tag) complicates but doesn’t resolve; meaning arises from collective response.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—documenting the origin of echoes—is signaled early and deepens into moral urgency: uncaging stolen sounds. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: Mira shapes time, navigates the Throat, and chooses to release voices despite risk. The giant’s nap imposes a live clock; each uncaging costs borrowed time, visibly depleting her reserve. Final act forecloses hoarding forever—echoes now “answer themselves”—with conceptual cost: the world’s acoustic fabric is permanently altered.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (“solve ambiguous loss via mathematics”) tightens when the flower’s dew reveals transformation > diminishment—a deepening that forecloses Marius’s original goal. Agency drives escalation: his planting ritual directly triggers the epiphany. Cost is unmistakable: he abandons recovery for stewardship (“tend the orchard where invisible things still grew”). The cavern’s rules (centuries-per-drop patience) shape tactics, making his three-year quest feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—survival through invisibility vs. connection through visibility—is signaled early and deepens when Maren finds the boy. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to reveal herself, uncovering caches and placing the note. Cost is unmistakable: trading safety for vulnerability. The outage complicates but doesn’t resolve; her decision crystallizes under coherent pressure, narrowing options to a single resonant act.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—control vs. surrender—is signaled early and deepens when Marcus witnesses wild plants surviving the storm. His agency drives escalation: cutting wires, abandoning pruning, redefining his speech. Cost is felt (loss of order, customer skepticism) and visible in the nursery’s “wild” appearance. One meaningful tightening suffices, though the storm functions more as catalyst than antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—threshing meaning from ruin—is signaled early and tightens when brooches transform private obsession into shared ritual. The exchange act forecloses solitary interpretation, forcing communal meaning-making with visible cost: vulnerability (trembling hands), trust (trading precious relics), and altered tactics (sleep as collective achievement). Escalation is protagonist-driven—she initiates the dig, offers the first brooch—and rain’s “promise” complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency remains human. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via object density and ritual cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—magnifying everyday magic—is signaled early and deepens when that very magic becomes autonomous. Escalation is driven by Vera’s method (amplifying enchantment), which inadvertently summons the unseen forces. Cost is felt in her loss of foresight and control, crystallized in “I don’t know.” The tightening is meaningful: her sanctuary transforms beyond her authorship, foreclosing her role as sole interpreter.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—restoring navigable relationship with the sea—is signaled early and deepens through Maris’s methodical cross-referencing, which forecloses passive mourning. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she chooses observation rhythms, interprets ghost-ships, and ultimately pilots the first boat. Cost is unmistakable: seven years of exile, fragmented records, fishermen’s paralyzed fear. The tightening occurs when she realizes the sea hasn’t forgotten—people lost their way of remembering—forcing adaptation over restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—mapping the unmappable—is signaled early and tightens when arrows lead to the fortress. Mara’s “dare” forecloses her old life; the cost is visible in solitude at dawn and the weight of future responsibility. Escalation is driven by her choices (kneeling, sketching, pressing the punch), not luck. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens via sensory and symbolic density until the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether memory and kindness can persist beyond individual failure—is signaled early and deepens when the tile reveals entangled grief. Escalation is driven by Elena’s agency: she chooses to press her palm, then to transcribe, narrowing her path from skeptic to translator. Cost is unmistakable: she relinquishes clinical certainty for fragile hope, enduring solitude to sustain connection. The whale migration clock tightens tactics—she must work at dusk crescendos—and the tile’s mechanics foreclose easy answers.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering what happens after goodbye—is signaled early and deepens through the spatial mutiny’s temporary bridges, which narrow Vesper’s eternal window to mere hours. Agency is clear: she chooses to follow the fragment despite fear, driven by accumulated grief. The cost is unmistakable—the risk of missing this once-in-millennium chance—and the escalation arises from protagonist-driven perception (“she recognized the pattern… spatial mutiny”) rather than coincidence. Pressure tightens coherently under the Accumulative lens via sensory and dimensional intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—truth versus survival—is signaled early and tightens when Pavel reveals the swallowed evidence. Mira’s agency escalates from refusal (“I can’t help you forge”) to active complicity in truth recovery (“I’ll stay”). The deepening occurs during the night watch: storytelling humanizes Elena, making the drive not just evidence but legacy. Cost is felt in Mira’s solitude and the ethical weight of handling death as both labor and moral theater.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving unrecorded temporal textures—is signaled early and deepens through the day’s work, culminating in a history that ages in the maze. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she interprets lamp frequencies, cross-references data, and chooses to seal and release the story. Cost is unmistakable: she accepts irrelevance in a silent world to uphold her discipline. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens, with one meaningful deepening—the fictional girl’s seven-year aging—that reweights time’s elasticity.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—unearthing the buried chemical plant—is signaled early and deepens through layered testimony. Pressure escalates via fragment accumulation, not external confrontation, fitting the Accumulative lens. Agency lies in attention and endurance; each overheard story narrows the path to silence or exposure. Cost is felt in lost identity and perpetual liminality.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—answering “Where does a voice go?”—is signaled immediately and deepens when Marina realizes forgotten voices persist as vibrations. The tightening occurs when she chooses to retell aloud, activating the cello’s resonance; this agency-driven escalation forecloses her old identity as myth-buster. Cost is felt in her tears and the irreversible act of painting her blood on the shell. Though pressure accumulates texturally rather than causally, the stakes remain viscerally anchored in loss and rediscovery.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving community amid necessary change—is signaled early and tightens coherently: demolition → water rights threat → accelerated timeline → cooperative compromise. Mira’s agency drives escalation (graffiti → reorganization → equity proposal), each move narrowing options with tangible cost (erased messages, lost trust, physical exhaustion). The “three weeks” clock pressures tactics without contrivance. Final trade-off—partial ownership over total displacement—is morally complex and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving Valentina against corporate erasure—is signaled early and tightens when Maya chooses documentation over futile resistance. Agency manifests as attention and endurance; her “outlasting darkness” is a credible renunciation with opportunity cost (she cannot stop the bulldozers). Escalation occurs through protagonist-driven setup of chemical beacons, each narrowing options until only photographic preservation remains. Cost is felt in the final walk away, charged by the knowledge that memory may outlast matter.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring integrity to broken things—is signaled early and deepens via the Mercantile’s timed departure, which tightens focus without resolving conflict. Pressure escalates texturally: harbor sounds pulse through water, demanding precision. Cost is felt in Mara’s solitary endurance; no path is foreclosed externally, but her renunciation of ordinary sight (seven years) implies sacrifice. Agency lies in attention: her decoding of feedback into direction alters nothing in the world except the drone’s function—and her own equilibrium.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—verifying the rivers’ origin—is signaled early and tightens when coordinates point impossibly to the lake’s center. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she tests the condensation hypothesis, cross-references charts, deciphers marginalia. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: accepting hydrological impossibility forecloses academic validation (“journals would dismiss it”), forcing solitary witness. Pressure coheres entirely through Accumulative lens—density of water-patterns reweights truth itself.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preventing Millhaven’s collapse—is signaled early and deepens as the tuner’s footsteps rebuild communal frequency. Escalation is driven by her agency: three days of walking, striking the fork, calibrating notes. Cost is felt indirectly: her solitude, the town’s prior hemorrhage, and the fragile “spider silk” balance imply what’s at risk. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via cadence shift—from discord to true chime—without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving what refuses to be forgotten—is signaled early and tightens when Marina realizes “there were no experts.” The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she overrides instinct, aligns the probe, triggers the sequence. Cost is unmistakable: potential death, the temple’s destruction, and the weight of sole responsibility. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Causal lens with one meaningful deepening (the vial’s true purpose).

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—breaking free from inherited falsehood—is signaled early and tightens through the approaching tide, which imposes a live deadline. Marcus’s agency lies in renunciation (not warning the escapees) and endurance (daily confession), culminating in his decision to speak. The escalation is driven by environmental pressure (tide receding) rather than protagonist action, slightly limiting Q4 under Accumulative lens—but the deepening of “hush” as a moral stance reweights the cost convincingly. Coincidence (bodies surfacing) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution hinges on Marcus’s choice to testify.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—repaying a cross-generational debt through alchemical harvest—is signaled early and deepens when the ghost bride reveals the night is “for you.” Pressure tightens via ephemeral guidance that demands trust without full understanding. Agency lies in Elara’s choice to stay and learn; cost is the forfeiture of normal time and light. Escalation is driven by revelation rather than action, fitting the Accumulative lens but slightly softening causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—honoring true reverence over static precedent—is signaled early and tightens when Mara chooses to hang her panels despite council prohibition. Her agency drives escalation: sleepwalking discovery → mapping → sewing → public display → catalyzing walkers. Cost is unmistakable: her solitary poetic practice ends (“loom silent”), replaced by collective becoming. The council’s arrival tests her stance, but resolution emerges not from luck but from demonstrable proof (aligned symbols, amplified whispers) shaped by her prior actions.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring interrupted rites—is signaled early and deepens when Mira discovers the sundial, shifting from duty to revelation. Pressure escalates through protagonist agency: her wandering uncovers chambers, her excavation revives communal memory. The priest’s conversion shows stakes expanding beyond self. Cost is felt: years of rootlessness, labor in darkness, and the irreversible commitment to return. One tightening suffices—and it forecloses perpetual departure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving human-mediated communication—is signaled early and deepens when Maya recognizes a “digital suicide pact,” raising emotional and tactical stakes. Her agency drives escalation: decoding, transcribing, creating pseudonyms, and dispatching Chen are all active choices that narrow her margin for error. The tightening at noon imposes real temporal pressure, and the cost—ephemeral labor, constant risk of exposure—is felt in every graphite stroke. Coincidence never resolves; everything flows from Maya’s commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preventing a coup—is signaled early through Mira’s listening. Escalation occurs via her accumulating insights (“separate threads… adjacent possibilities”), culminating in the decisive deepening: recognizing synchronization as the linchpin. Her agency drives the turn—she chooses to act, using her guise as cover. Cost is clear: she risks exposure by speaking, yet must speak. Pressure tightens coherently under the Accumulative lens without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming the unspoken apology—is signaled early and deepens via the shard’s evocation of the kitchen memory. Pressure escalates through protagonist agency: Isla *chooses* to witness her past self, then *runs* toward reconciliation. The cost (five years of silence, mirrored unsent letters) is felt in every beat. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the medium’s tools merely reveal what Isla must act upon.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake (preserving memory against displacement) intensifies through Maya’s agency: she decrypts the cast, offers collaboration, and commits to “graft new meaning onto old wounds.” The tightening occurs when she recognizes the cast as a map—not random scribbles—forcing a trade-off between professional detachment and personal investment. Cost is legible in her “lotus-hearted ache,” the weight of collected unhealed wounds now consciously borne. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with no coincidental resolutions.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—rediscovering authentic joy—is signaled early and deepens when Mira chooses to collaborate with the past instead of overwriting it. This tightening forecloses her old approach (imposing new images) with felt cost: vulnerability, impermanence. Escalation is driven by her agency under an Accumulative lens; pressure coheres through sensory and emotional density, not external conflict. Coincidence (network response) complicates but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—trading certainty for curiosity—is signaled early and tightens through protagonist agency: Marta sings, presses palms, chooses to fall backward. Each “awakening” deepens pressure by narrowing epistemic options while expanding perceptual ones. Cost is unmistakable: her memories thin, identity fractures, yet she embraces it. Escalation is driven by her choices under an Accumulative lens, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—mental autonomy vs. state control—is signaled early (“scrambled eggs cost forty credits”). Pressure tightens when Dr. Chen warns of garden patrols, forcing Malachi to refine tactics (spiral/straight/figure-eight codes). Agency is clear: planting is active defiance, not passive hope. Cost is felt in the daughter’s silenced creativity and implied audit risks, though the escalation lacks a decisive on-page reversal—relying instead on accumulative deepening under the Situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—transforming grief into sustaining beauty—is signaled early and deepens when Mira arrives with the bulb. The tightening is protagonist-driven: choosing collaboration over solitary verse, risking hope after centuries of endurance. Cost is legible in the poet’s chest-shift and rusty voice—emotional vulnerability after 300 years of armor. Coincidence (the postcard) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from their joint labor. The “blossom armistice” concept crystallizes stakes without solving them—petals become future postcards, extending the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving extinct emotions via precise sonic calibration—is signaled early and tightens when the chime cracks, risking “meaningless static.” Miren’s agency drives escalation: she doesn’t wait for rescue but descends, activates the phonograph, and discovers the crack creates a *new* frequency. The cost is felt in her deepened regret and crystallized purpose—she’ll forever tend “ghosts.” Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her systematic yet intuitive labor.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring collaborative trust through linguistic revelation—is signaled early and tightens via Maren’s confession (“I had to pursue it alone”). Protagonist agency drives escalation: her “carefully reckless” solitude enables the method, which Kael validates, crystallizing their stance. Cost is unmistakable: tomorrow’s irreversible divergence, rendered poignant by the “last hour” bell. Pressure coheres under causal lens without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—harmonizing upstream/downstream needs—is signaled early and tightens when Elena finds the hidden valve, foreclosing the false binary of “seal or restore.” The bypass solution forces both villages to accept interdependence, with cost paid in labor and surrendered distrust. Escalation is driven by Elena’s agency (analyzing glue, measuring chain), not luck. However, the villages’ off-stage conflict lacks on-page friction, slightly muting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—Elena’s need to reconcile truth with survival—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Carmen’s package arrives. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: Elena chooses to play the recording, then chooses to confess. Cost is unmistakable: she must surrender her protective lies, risking rejection or judgment. The stakes feel viscerally real because they’re tied to specific losses (Marcus, the choir) and concrete symbols (the meteorite, the hymnal). Coincidence (Carmen surviving) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the resolution hinges on Elena’s choice to speak.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding why some thresholds feel sacred—is signaled early and deepens when Maya deciphers the logbook, foreclosing the path of ignorance. Pressure tightens coherently under the Accumulative lens: each object (drafting table, logbook) adds density until the mother’s final entry forces stance crystallization. Agency is clear—Maya’s intuition and tactile analysis drive discovery—and cost is visible: irreversible loss of parental illusions. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; knowledge shifts via her persistent method.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—learning “the rhythm of belonging”—tightens through protagonist-driven deepening: Mara’s analysis of feather/jellyfish patterns forces Chen’s wonder, escalating from solitary study to collaborative revelation. Cost manifests as social vulnerability (her “soft-spoken mystic” status) paid forward in the shared exhale. Coincidence (plankton bloom) complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency lies in their interpretive synthesis. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, though the plankton’s “purposeful dance” slightly risks deus ex machina without clearer causal setup.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—preserving forgotten paths—is signaled early and tightens when Calla learns paths vanish from lack of repetition, not catastrophe. This deepening forces a trade-off: she cannot restore losses but can choose which paths to walk repeatedly. Agency is clear in her decision to plant the new seed immediately, racing “against time.” The cost—accepting inevitable loss while committing to witness—is felt in her “cheerful gloom” and legible in the final covenant.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—proving chaos can be shepherded without imprisonment—is signaled early and deepens through three escalating orchestrations, each narrowing Marina’s temporal and spatial margin. Agency drives escalation: her dropped ball, scattered cards, and luminous bishop are deliberate acts that foreclose passive observation. Cost is unmistakable: emotional labor (embodied in the bishop’s warmth), time loss (“twelve minutes”), and the sacrifice of personal recognition (declining the photo). Coincidence complicates (teens’ drift), never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory against state-enforced amnesia—is signaled early and tightens when Kael discovers the moonstone speck, forcing her to shift from passive remembrance to active inscription. Agency drives escalation: her dance *creates* the speck, which then compels the tattooing act. Cost is unmistakable: her body becomes a target (“they would see her”), trading anonymity for permanence. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each memory etched raises emotional and physical stakes without coincidence or soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving intangible value against commodification—is signaled early and tightens through Samuel’s escalating documentation. His agency drives escalation: each stone drop is a tactical choice to generate irrefutable evidence. Cost is unmistakable: time is running out (demolition looms), and his success hinges on translating beauty into a language spreadsheets might accept. The developer’s off-page presence exerts coherent pressure without resolving the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding and transcending inherited sacrifice—is signaled early and deepens when Marcus reads his father’s pain journals. The tightening occurs in his realization: “innocence, once bargained away, never truly returned.” His agency drives escalation—he chooses to continue the bargain knowingly, transforming passive trauma into active vocation. Cost is unmistakable: scars as language, grief as inheritance, peace as earned exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—revitalizing work through proof that effort matters across timelines—is signaled early and deepens via Maya’s intentional pattern-making. The escalation is driven by her agency: each shell placement tests permeability, culminating in synchronized choices that spike the gauge. Cost is unmistakable: she must relinquish the fantasy of singular success to embrace distributed hope. The 2,999-foot reading embodies conceptual price—almost but not quite perfect convergence—making stakes viscerally legible.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—validating architectural consciousness—is signaled early and deepens when Mara deciphers Eleanor’s diaries and the film negatives. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her decision to trust environmental cues leads to the acoustic anomaly, then to the conceptual breakthrough. Cost is unmistakable: she inherits Eleanor’s isolation and burden of belief. The tightening occurs when the echo pattern reveals intentional modulation—narrowing options from documentation to stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—accessing alternate realities where Maya lives—is signaled early and escalates through Aina’s coded lullabies, each song deepening the emotional risk. Agency is clear: she chooses specific melodies to encode increasingly intimate questions, narrowing options from general (“what color would your room be?”) to deeply personal (“who would you love?”). The bells’ chime imposes hard temporal pressure, forcing climax within seconds. Cost is unmistakable: exhaustion, vocal strain, and the agony of seeing—but not keeping—a living Maya, paid for the grace of possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—ending the forever war through practice, not proclamation—is signaled early and deepened when Mirena rejects treaties for gardening. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she introduces soil, seeds, and recovered words, forcing Kordas and Threll to choose participation or retreat. The tightening occurs when Threll whispers about her daughter, making refusal emotionally impossible without visible cost. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure grows via layered grief until the ritual becomes the only coherent response.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—rescuing extinct beauty through engineered ruin—is signaled early and deepens via Marcus’s quantum device deployment. Escalation is driven by his agency: bribes, diversions, and violence narrow options until only this salt flat remains. The tightening occurs when cracks spell coordinates, forcing the final choice to broadcast the call into impending rain. Cost is unmistakable: ecosystems collapsed, villages relocated, rivers murdered—all rendered in one devastating litany before the rain begins.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—autonomy versus performative compliance—is signaled early (“never once surrendered her body”) and deepens when Celestine risks everything to access the prism sanctuary. Her agency drives escalation: each gesture untangles threads of expectation, narrowing her options until only defiance remains. Cost is felt in the “alarming serenity” that alienates the guards, implying future isolation. Though stakes remain internal, they’re viscerally rendered through bodily poetic acts; however, the absence of an on-page antagonist slightly softens external pressure, preventing full 9+ escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether ethical storytelling requires confrontation or shelter—is signaled early and tightened when the drunk disrupts the show, forcing Marcus to witness his method’s real impact. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: Marcus chooses to let the interruption unfold, trusting his structure. Cost is felt in his solitude and unresolved partnership, yet visible in the audience’s murmured revelations. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure builds via density of symbolic objects converging into a single resonant moment.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—honoring overlooked extinctions—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: Sera chooses to build despite knowing no one will see it. The meaningful tightening occurs when monarchs arrive and interact with her structure, transforming it from inventory to sanctuary. Cost is unmistakable: physical (stiff fingers), temporal (descends by nightfall), and existential (witnessing the last migration). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves anything—every escalation stems from Sera’s deliberate acts.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving forgotten names before the rope disintegrates—is signaled early and tightens through Maren’s agency: she chooses transcription over mourning, bronze over ephemera. The deepening occurs when auroral light aligns with card holes, transforming labor into revelation. Cost is unmistakable: three years frozen, decades of skill repurposed, and the looming decades ahead to complete 200 names. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each punched hole narrows the gap between loss and legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding path-walker causality—is signaled early and deepens via the decaying directive. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her choice to interpret dreams (not force answers) enables the CR. Cost is unmistakable: surrender of human-centric free will. Storm timeframe tightens decisions without contrivance; pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—sealing a covenant with the unknown—is signaled early and deepens when the square reveals a 17-light-year perspective, raising epistemic stakes. Pressure tightens via protagonist agency: Mara’s translation forecloses ignorance, forcing her to become the covenant’s carrier. Cost is felt in frugality (precious paper, scarce instruments) and existential risk (new regimes may suppress knowledge). Coincidence never resolves; insight emerges from disciplined labor under constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—releasing resentment—is signaled early and tightens when Elena targets cellular memory, narrowing Marcus’s options from rigid blame to embodied vulnerability. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (Elena’s calibrated speech, Marcus’s reluctant handover of the box), culminating in visible cost: his weeping breaks the sanctuary’s silence. Pressure coheres under the Causal lens, though the reality-shift mechanic slightly risks coincidental resolution; however, it’s tied to Marcus’s internal state, avoiding deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—containing the dream before it shreds reality—is signaled early and tightens when the dream “grows more solid.” Eliane’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to enter the fog, deploy mirrors, synchronize breath, and recreate—not destroy—the dream. Cost is felt in her eroding boundaries (“between herself and the glass”) and the irreversible burden of carrying captured longing. Coincidence (Gregor’s death) complicates but doesn’t resolve; victory requires precise, earned technique.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reconciling broken vows with generational healing—is signaled early and deepens through Lisel’s accusation (“You turned away from me”) and Mara’s admission. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: Mara persists despite fear and height; Lisel reveals her own rule-breaking. Cost is unmistakable: Mara’s legacy of absence, Lisel’s damaged eye. The single tightening—choosing to mend together—forecloses isolation with visible emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—accessing forbidden knowledge within a causally inverted archive—is signaled early and deepens when Mara handles Artifact 77. The meaningful tightening occurs when she fits the cameo into the tree, transforming passive curation into active participation in nonlinear inheritance. Cost is unmistakable: she surrenders linear selfhood, accepting recursive identity (“she had her grandfather’s eyes—the grandfather she would inherit herself into becoming”). Escalation is driven entirely by her agency—“inquire systematically,” press the shell to the trunk—and the stakes evolve from intellectual curiosity to ontological surrender, all coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—rescuing students trapped by temporal damage—is signaled early and tightens when Mira realizes the rift stems from “all seventeen” overlapping visits. Her agency drives escalation: researching gaps, speaking absent prepositions, forcing the traveler to “renegotiate your contract with forgetting.” Cost is unmistakable—the traveler’s cyclical erasure (“already forgetting what he’d read”) and Mira’s burden of eternal readiness (“preparing for the next disturbance”). Coincidence complicates (traveler’s arrival) but never resolves; solution emerges from established rules.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost understanding of selfhood—is signaled early and tightens through Isla’s narrative experiments, each narrowing her options until only surrender remains. Agency is clear: she chooses which story to tell, how to hold the card, whether to step forward. Cost is felt in the Celestine’s fade and the relinquishing of singular identity. Escalation is driven by her actions under an Accumulative lens, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—resolving historical absences—is signaled early and deepens when Marin discovers the timeline merger letter. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to reconfigure the rope, narrowing options (only one pattern works) and paying the cost of altering reality. Pressure coheres under the Causal lens, with each beat tightening toward the decisive act. The cost—Chen’s restored name, stabilized archives—is unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming quiet in a violated sanctuary—is signaled early and deepens into coexistence rather than conquest. The meaningful tightening occurs when she shifts from seeking lost tranquility to conjuring a new kind of silence (“bloom of hush”). Agency drives escalation: her humming, guided by ice cracks, actively restructures reality. Cost is felt in bodily fatigue and the irreversible acceptance that the old song is gone forever.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—validating meaning in collapse—is signaled early and deepened by Mera’s six months of star-tracking and self-excavation. Agency drives escalation: she doesn’t wait for signs but deciphers, digs, aligns. Coincidence complicates (thistles before rain) but never resolves; the shard is found through her own shadow, earned via retrocognitive insight. Cost is felt in her academic exile and current solitude—a life spent convincing only herself until now.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving unstable memory before it vanishes—is signaled early and deepens as contradictions mount. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: Maris chooses conjecture over certainty, impermanence over preservation. Cost is unmistakable: her records fade, her identity shifts, and the city below remains unknowable. The storm’s fleeting clarity forces a trade-off between speed and precision, crystallizing her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—defying hopelessness—is signaled early and deepens when Mara reads the mosaic, transforming passive wandering into active resurrection. Escalation is driven by her agency: she chooses to launch despite the commander’s dismissal, using ambient awareness to calibrate each burst. Cost is legible: emotional labor, physical risk, and the implicit acknowledgment that this light is temporary. One meaningful tightening suffices for length, though a second micro-turn (commander’s shift) would have pushed this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—navigating transition—is signaled early and deepened when Mei realizes humans, too, live in thresholds. The tightening occurs when Lin reveals the cicada, forcing Mei to confront her own resistance. Agency is expressed through attention and renunciation, not action, consistent with the Accumulative lens. Cost is visible: Mei relinquishes control, accepting impermanence.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—collecting the gilded hush—is signaled early and deepens when the sprouting flower offers a live opportunity during inversion. Agency is clear: Lina chooses stillness to perceive, extends the doll, uncorks it at the right moment. The tightening occurs when the bloom coincides with gravity’s apex, narrowing her window. Cost is subtle but present: she risks vertigo and emotional exposure for a silence that can’t be shared, only carried inward.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—guiding others through grief without false comfort—is signaled early and deepens when the man arrives at the threshold of nervous-system recalibration. Mara’s agency lies in calibrated silence, not speech; her choice to show the vial instead of explaining it tightens the emotional aperture. The cost is ongoing: she remains in transit herself, tending arrivals but never departing. Pressure escalates texturally—sound layers thinning to 28 decibels—and culminates in a question that cannot be answered, only held.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding the stairway before sunrise—is signaled early and tightens via the flake’s inertness, forcing Vess to innovate (peeling paint). The method forecloses brute-force options, demanding patience over haste. Cost is legible: time lost to careful peeling, emotional vulnerability at the mural, and the burden of delayed claim. Sunrise isn’t just backdrop—it pressures every choice, though the escalation leans slightly more on discovery than irreversible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—freedom from suffocating connections—is signaled early and tightens when Sienna arrives. Maya’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to engage despite her rules, altering tactics from exclusion to instruction. The cost (relinquishing pure isolation) is felt in her acknowledgment of “careful encroachment.” Pressure remains coherent under an Accumulative lens, with one decisive deepening: the shift from self-preservation to shared ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—surviving the fallout of false promises—is signaled early and deepens when quantum promises threaten reality itself. Maya’s agency drives escalation: she interprets texts, retrieves the bolt, and volunteers. The tightening occurs at the threshold confrontation, where refusal would mean collapse; her choice trades personal freedom for cosmic stability. Cost is unmistakable: “the bolt fused to her chest,” bearing infinite pressure—a visible, irreversible price that reweights all prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the hidden truth—is signaled early and deepens when sound reveals what eyes could not. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she builds the “bridge of intuition,” interprets the tones, and acts on their guidance. The cost—ending the bloodline to reject a “poisonous legacy”—is felt in her solitude and tremors. Pressure tightens coherently under an Accumulative lens, with one decisive deepening that reweights everything.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake (capturing possibility to redeem loss) is signaled early and deepens through protagonist-driven escalation: each pattern unsnaps threads, demanding greater commitment. The tightening forecloses isolation—the knight must participate, not just observe—and the cost is felt in her bodily dissolution (“becoming pattern herself”). Under the Accumulative lens, pressure grows via sensory and dimensional intensification, culminating in a stance that reweights darkness from void to canvas. Coincidence never resolves; agency drives every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to the erased—is signaled early and deepens when Sarah discovers the soldier’s list. The tightening occurs when she chooses to document rather than merely sort, foreclosing passive grief. Cost is legible: her heart remains broken, yet her hands act. Escalation is driven by her agency (unfurling the document, beginning a new file), not luck, and the stakes crystallize around moral obligation versus personal healing.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving erased history—is signaled early and tightens when safe houses fall, forcing Mira into a high-risk upload with hours to spare. The meaningful deepening occurs when the puddle-map reveals the archive, narrowing options to one decisive act. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her interpretation of the courier’s clue enables the transmission. Cost is unmistakable: Bureau boots above as she flees, sacrificing the physical archive for digital dissemination.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—containing a prophecy through intentional silence—is signaled early and deepens when Elena realizes her music’s absence enables the whisper. Escalation is driven by her agency: she doesn’t flee but retools her art to play negative space. Cost is unmistakable: lifelong solitude at dawn, replacing performance with vigilance. The “vested hush” isn’t abstract—it’s a technique with rules, failure conditions, and generational burden.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—decoding the leaves’ message—is signaled early and deepens when the moonstone reveals transformation as communication. Escalation is driven by Miren’s agency: prodding the speck creates new moss patterns, each a test that narrows her interpretive options. Cost is unmistakable: she abandons seventeen years of fixed methodology to embrace flux, crystallized in her self-redefinition as “translator of possibility.” Coincidence (finding the speck) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her choices do.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the 3:47 pattern—tightens meaningfully when Ellis chooses improvisation over excavation permits, narrowing options to intuition alone. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her crowbar use triggers the cavern reveal, and her final renunciation (“took only the memory”) forecloses exploitation. Cost is felt in the weight of witnessed mystery versus solvable repair. Coincidence complicates (clocks stopping identically) but never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—understanding the weight of names—is signaled early and tightens when Mira chooses to use Cassian’s birth name, risking further dissolution. Escalation is driven by her agency: heating the coin, tracing ash with gold powder. Cost is unmistakable in bodily sacrifice (ring) and emotional exposure (“luminous regret”). The transmutation circle’s failure becomes the crucible for redemption, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—freeing souls by reintegrating joy into guilt—is signaled early and deepens when Mara targets the “I never forgave her” ghost. Escalation is driven by her agency: choosing imperfect melody, invoking shared laughter, wielding the tooth. Cost is unmistakable: time pressure (sunrise), emotional labor, and the harp’s permanent damage. The ghost’s release forecloses Mara’s path to rest—she must keep descending, bearing residual magic and unfinished work.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—discovering the mathematics of mercy—is signaled early and deepens through each memory surge. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: Kira chooses to stay, carve, remember, and reinterpret. Each trauma response narrows her options (knees buckle, hand spasms) yet forces cognitive reframing. The cost is legible: enduring unbearable awareness to reach a fragile conceptual breakthrough. While escalation is intense, it remains internal; a slightly more externalized consequence (e.g., physical injury from collapse) would heighten stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories—is signaled early and deepens when Mira uncovers her grandmother’s map of erased translators. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: her decoding work narrows options from passive search to active confrontation. Cost is conceptual (institutional backlash) and felt (emotional weight of ancestral legacy), though not yet paid on-page. Coincidence (merchant’s return) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Mira’s labor earns the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the truth behind the fire—is signaled early and deepens when Marcus chooses to engage the ceiling. His agency drives escalation: seeing cracks → removing tiles → finding the box. Cost is legible in the ghost’s trapped state and Marcus’s burden of carrying truth forward. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; his skill and decision do. One tightening suffices, though a second tactical shift (e.g., risk of structural collapse) could elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether truth can be permanently preserved—is signaled early and deepens when Margritte’s broadsheet triggers systemic rupture. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her printing, frost documentation, and uncorking of the whisper narrow Tessian’s options from control to adaptation. Cost is unmistakable: the library loses predictive harmony but gains experiential vitality; readers trade certainty for surprise. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies through pattern breaks (books backward, non-repeating frost) that reweight the value of impermanence.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—historical truth versus human exceptionalism—is signaled early and tightens when the storm reveals nonhuman builders, forcing Matthias to choose between academic conformity and poetic witness. His agency drives escalation: covering mirrors enables safe observation, which yields revelation, which demands elegiac response. Cost is unmistakable: exile from scholarly consensus, solitude, and the weight of being sole custodian of erased history. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving the covenant between form and function—is signaled early and deepens as Cornelius confronts increasingly fragile silences. Escalation is driven by his agency: humming, reweaving, enduring doubt—all under the pressure of potential failure (“one false note… and the threadwork would scatter”). The cost is felt in his physical and moral vigilance, culminating in a Charged Poise where song’s survival hinges on truthfulness, not technical skill. Coincidence never resolves; midnight’s theft is a condition, not a deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding fragrance beyond commodification—is signaled early and tightens when the compass leads her to a place “where explanations failed.” The deepening occurs at the lagoon: she realizes some thirsts demand better questions, not answers. Agency drives escalation: her choice to collect stone-tears (not petrichor) redefines success. Cost is felt in the renunciation of synthesis and the compass left behind—an Earned Stasis that forecloses return to utility.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding simplicity that scaffolds meaning—is clear early and tightens when the slide reveals ancient alignment with her designs. Escalation is driven by Iris’s agency: she studies, reinterprets, chooses to trust land over tech. Cost is conceptual (abandoning fixed outcomes) but felt in her acceptance of ephemerality. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, though a second pressure point (e.g., physical danger) could’ve elevated it further.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—answering “Why do they wait for darkness?”—tightens when Marina abandons scientific logic for perceptual truth. The dawning hush isn’t coincidence; it’s the precise condition enabling her discovery, forcing a trade-off: daylight clarity vs. twilight revelation. Agency drives escalation—she climbs, traces, chooses to paint on glass. Cost is conceptual: she relinquishes control over how her art is seen, accepting its dependence on transient light.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—unearthing encrypted truth—is signaled early and tightens when decoding unlocks retrocognition. Maya’s agency drives escalation: she convinces the captain, steps onto the sand, endures possession, and chooses full disclosure. Cost is unmistakable: loss of archival neutrality, psychic entanglement, and lifelong responsibility. The sheriff’s parley deepens stakes by revealing fragile alliance as higher-risk than outright resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—rejecting easy escape to forge necessary transformation—is signaled early and deepens through the alchemist’s renunciation of wish-granting. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: she actively transmutes town history into potential, narrowing options from preservation to reimagining. Cost is unmistakable: she endures isolation and abandons personal salvation, foreclosing the path of comfort taken by 300 others. The bottle’s shattering crystallizes this trade-off, with the town’s revival contingent on her sacrifice of nostalgia.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—decoding the accidental prophecy—is signaled by the opening silence and tightens when Miriam speaks the corrected nursery rhyme (nothing happens), forcing her to risk the mispronounced version. This deepening narrows options: only error yields truth. Agency drives escalation—her choice to voice the flawed Etruscan incants the tree’s pulse, altering her understanding of archiving. Cost is conceptual: she must relinquish control over “correct” language, accepting accident as vessel for meaning—a price paid in her final offering.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring stolen genetic futures—is signaled early and deepens when she realizes the vortex demands unacceptable entropy debt. The tightening occurs in her tactile reading of time’s “texture,” leading to a renunciation that forecloses magical recovery. Agency is clear: she *chooses* not to reach through, accepting loss. Cost is unmistakable: “Let the thieves have their stolen futures” carries emotional and generational weight, paid in the quiet resolve of planting “the impossible seed.”

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—survival via accurate storm prediction—is signaled early and deepened when Mira discovers the rope’s sensitivity exceeds sirens. Her agency tightens options: she rejects the emergency switch (foreclosing institutional protocol) to pull the rope, forcing communal adaptation. Cost is felt: her credibility hinges on unproven intuition. Escalation is driven by her microclimate tracking, not coincidence, and culminates in zero hour arriving hours early—a credible, high-stakes reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether witnessing matters in a forgotten world—is signaled early and deepens through the Perseid shower’s indifference. Kael’s agency lies in attention: he chooses to trace, empathize, and ultimately reinterpret solitude as connection. The tightening occurs when he notices the lantern’s refractions aligning with meteor paths—a discovery that reconfigures his understanding of flaw and beauty. Cost is felt: he carries loss but transforms it into quiet song, foreclosing despair without erasing its weight.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving human presence amid erasure—is signaled early and deepens when the list reveals wage records as resistance. Silas’s agency drives escalation: contextual observation → trial-and-error → pattern replication. Cost is unmistakable: he trades self-imposed exile for lifelong stewardship, implied by crafting a new box from dwindling resources. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; coincidence never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—tracking time without numbers—is signaled by line 3. Pressure tightens when the urn fragment clicks into place, shifting Marcus from collector to inheritor. Cost is visible: he carries Samuel’s ashes not as relic but as key, accepting emotional weight over precision. Escalation stems from his agency, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—reconciling incompleteness with creative worth—is signaled early and deepens when the young man reveals his writer’s block after his sister’s death. Pressure escalates not through external conflict but through the accumulation of fragile parallels: broken feather, fragmented poems, snapping string. The kite’s release is not coincidental but earned through his active harmonizing with wind, a metaphor for accepting discord. Cost is felt in what’s lost (control, old modes of writing) and what’s gained (freedom, new form).

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving interspecies symbiosis—is signaled early and deepens when Marina discovers the “bones within bones” pattern. Escalation is driven by her agency: mapping, drilling, wiring—not coincidence—and tightens options (only three saplings can heal three pillars). Cost is unmistakable: her life is spent in labor that outlives her, crystallized in the new caretaker inheriting a philosophy, not just a job. The “remodel” forecloses passive dying, forcing active legacy-building with visible emotional and physical toll.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding homecoming’s chemistry—is signaled early and tightens when footprints appear. Kira’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to descend, follow, kneel. The deepening at the fountain reweights everything: past/present selves converge. Cost is felt in the loss of her old identity (“who we actually were”), crystallized in Charged Poise at story’s end.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming war-torn land through ecological memory—is signaled early and deepens as Erasmus uses bird intelligence to locate fertile sediment. Agency is expressed through attention and ritual seeding, foreclosing paths of forgetfulness or passive mourning. The single meaningful tightening occurs when the heron’s call reveals tomorrow’s low tide, altering tactics (bulbs/tubers planned). Cost is felt in his isolation and the irreversible death of the reef culture that taught him.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—translating distance into closeness—is signaled early and deepens through Finder’s decoding labor. Escalation is driven entirely by her agency: she chooses to replay the cylinder, trace the grooves, interpret the leaf, undertake the journey. Cost is unmistakable: years of isolation, the emotional risk of reopening war wounds. The tightening—from static hiss to shared silence—narrows options from solitude to partnership, with no off-stage resolutions or coincidences.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—mapping the unmappable—is signaled early and deepens as Kira transforms confusion into rhythmic observation. Pressure escalates texturally: galaxies age faster, solitude intensifies, yet her agency grows through sketching. The meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes the compass rose anchors time, not space—a cognitive shift that redefines her tactics. Cost is visible: permanent exile, irreconcilable timeline divergence, yet she chooses continued witnessing.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—repairing cosmic truth—is signaled early and escalates through each piece swap. Agency is clear: Seren chooses which lies to replace, with visible cost (potential unmaking). Pressure tightens as the sky flickers with each truth restored. The final pawn placement delivers a decisive deepening: small things hold up the sky—a thematic and mechanical pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving erased gestures—is signaled early and deepens as Mara shifts from passive survivor to active archivist. Escalation is driven by her agency: she refines walking patterns into language, imposes repetition, and transforms space. Cost is unmistakable: traumatized children relive loss, elderly exhaust themselves, and Mara endures isolation. The tightening forecloses forgetting as an option, crystallizing her stance with emotional and physical toll clearly rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding home’s shape—is signaled early and tightens when the feather forces tactile reading, foreclosing Isla’s visual evasion. Her agency drives escalation: tracing symbols reactivates buried knowledge, altering tactics from memory substitution to active preservation. Cost is felt in the “hollow ache” replaced by purpose, and the irreversible loss of protective fiction. Coincidence (feather drop) complicates but resolution stems from Isla’s practiced hands, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled early and deepens via the tapestry’s coded instructions. Escalation is driven by Elena’s agency: each thread pulled narrows emotional options until only unconditional self-forgiveness remains. Cost is unmistakable: she must publicly admit cruelty while retaining exile. The “corridor of justified anger” beat crystallizes pressure into a moral calculus that forecloses pride permanently.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—forgiveness’s price—is signaled early and tightens when Mira realizes multiplication of truth fails; only acceptance suffices. Her agency drives escalation: poetry sessions are active attempts that deepen pressure, not passive waiting. Cost is unmistakable: loss of artistic identity (“never use these colors again”) and submission to judgment. The ritual clock creates live pressure without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—conjure meaning from oblivion—is signaled early and tightens via the rising acid wave, which narrows time and raises physical peril. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she deciphers the statue’s logic mid-crisis, then chooses to place her own uncertainty last, risking total failure. Cost is unmistakable—the wave strikes, the workshop nearly founders—and the final image shows survival earned not by mechanics alone but by assembled memory. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence resolving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—living inside moments vs. observing them—is signaled early and deepens when the hidden cave forces confrontation. Marina’s agency drives escalation: her wrong turn (micro-choice) leads to revelation, and her decision to sit in water crystallizes stance with cost. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; the cave’s temporary eternity sharpens the moral calculus without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reconciliation before Silas dies—is signaled early and tightens when Mara chooses whisper over shout, narrowing options irrevocably. The single deepening (vial’s release) transforms knowledge: Mara realizes her fury masked fear, and that truth must be sent “without distortion of volume.” Cost is felt: she relinquishes the identity forged in anger. Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens—no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—navigating the geography of loss—is signaled early and tightens via the reverse migration mechanic, which narrows options (only works near new moon) and demands tactile memory over coordinates. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she instructs callers to touch old objects, altering their paths. Cost is felt in every call—emotional labor, isolation—and crystallized in her unanswered longing for her daughter. Moon-phase constraint creates a live clock that pressures tactics without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—psychological safety—is signaled early and deepens when the neighbor’s visit forces Mara to confront the torture of unfiltered empathy. Her agency drives escalation: choosing to use the occluder despite risk. The tightening forecloses the path of passive endurance; she actively rebuilds selfhood. Cost is unmistakable: continued solitude, but now volitional—a trade-off crystallized in the final bridge scene where fear is felt but not broadcast.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—decoding Ernst’s final gesture—is signaled early and deepens through Margit’s investigation. The meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes the Edelweiss encodes grief, not just memory, forcing her to choose between keeping borrowed intimacy or honoring his wish for release. Cost is unmistakable: relinquishing the memories lightens her solitude but severs connection. Agency drives escalation—she actively replays, observes, walks, presses—and coincidence never resolves; the harbor police’s indifference only sharpens her burden.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to honor a decades-old promise by choosing at all—is signaled early and deepens through environmental pressure (rising water, marching ants, midsummer light). The tightening occurs when Marcus realizes the door isn’t about access but agency: “This wasn’t about opening the door… This was about choosing whether to open it at all.” Cost is legible in his abandonment of the shop, maps, and solitude—his entire identity. Escalation is driven by his perception and response, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—escaping disenchantment through mystery—is signaled early and tightens when the third messenger collapses, forcing action. The queen’s agency drives escalation: she climbs alone, passes tree line, enters grotto, accepts revelation. Cost is felt in her scraped hands, vanished kingdom “through thick glass,” and irreversible descent into purpose. One meaningful deepening suffices: the vision shifts from torment to invitation, narrowing her path to active rulership.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving meaningful presence against time and loss—is signaled early and deepens when Kael reveals his blindness. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she crafts six bespoke suns, each narrowing options toward intimate documentation over commerce. The cost is felt in Kael’s trembling hands and Mira’s abandoned capital ambitions. Pressure tightens coherently under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—distilling chaos into narrative—is signaled immediately and tightens through escalating impossibilities (waking on floor tasting copper, watching herself sleep). The deepening occurs when she confronts the headstone with her name, raising conceptual stakes: is she dead, dying, or yet to die? Agency persists in her relentless writing despite futility, and cost is unmistakable in her exhaustion and isolation. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens without reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—can Elena heal without smell?—is signaled early and deepens when she realizes healing was always about witnessing, not scent. The meaningful turn occurs when Mr. Chen models how broken things retain purpose, forcing Elena to reframe loss as transformation. Cost is legible: she must abandon her former identity, yet gains agency through attention. Escalation is driven by protagonist insight (“I used to think aromatherapy was about the oils…”) under Accumulative pressure, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—transforming trauma into wisdom—is signaled early and tightens when Kael realizes their breath’s crystallization isn’t a flaw but preservation. This deepening, driven by protagonist agency (recalling grandmother’s words), narrows options: they must inscribe from lived pain. Cost is unmistakable: exposing scars publicly, risking failure, and relinquishing shame. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with one decisive intensification (the exhalation) that reweights the entire trial.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—delivering an apology that cannot undo harm but may redirect its current—is signaled early and deepens when Derrick refuses forgiveness yet accepts her presence. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she abandons metaphor, admits motive (“I thought exposing you would reconnect us”), and offers the bottle. Cost is unmistakable: fifteen years of justification collapse, friendship remains broken, and the orchard’s fall looms. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via intensifying vulnerability, not plot turns.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—unraveling cosmic illusions—is signaled early and tightens when Kael grasps that “unraveling wasn’t destruction—it was integration.” This deepening forces a trade-off: abandon the quest for external truth or embody the paradox. The cost is conceptual but legible: the loss of the self as distinct observer. Pressure escalates through internal revelation rather than external opposition, fitting the Accumulative lens, though a more visceral tactical shift would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—understanding time’s essence—is signaled early and deepens when Maren risks protocol by counting backward. Her agency drives escalation: inserting the key isn’t passive discovery but active defiance. The cost is conceptual (abandoning measurement) and behavioral (ceasing to count), visible in her post-revelation stillness. However, the “wrong direction” idea lacks concrete pressure—it’s posited but not tested against alternatives, slightly softening the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—protecting the farm while honoring grief’s permeability—tightens when Mira must choose between protocol and compassion. Escalation is protagonist-driven: her expertise leads her to the breach, then to mercy.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reconciling knowledge with behavior—is signaled early and deepens when Mira decodes the notebooks as emotional cartography. Her agency drives escalation: she cross-references betting records, drafts a new pedagogy, chooses engagement over judgment. The tightening occurs when she realizes teaching must include “what mathematics couldn’t touch,” foreclosing pure rationalism. Cost is felt in the rehab center’s call—love persists despite damage, demanding presence without guarantees.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming estrangement into possibility—is signaled early and deepens via Iris’s nightly interventions. Escalation occurs through accumulation: each call tightens the thematic coil, culminating in her active role on the seventh night. Cost is felt in the crying that “waters seeds” and Iris’s isolation. Coincidence (wrong numbers) complicates but never resolves; agency lies in her deliberate misdirections.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving small moments as bulwark against loss—is signaled early and deepened when the archive becomes a “mausoleum.” The locket forces a decisive turn: Mira chooses to re-engage her own memory, not just others’. Agency is clear: she kneels, opens ink, writes—actions that narrow her path from mechanical preservation to sacred witness. Cost is felt in the admission that she’d treated Maya’s absence “like a wound that would reopen if touched”; the euphoria carries the price of vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—using systems to cure loneliness—is signaled early and deepens when the young man names her isolation. Vera’s agency drives escalation: rerouting supplies via rumor chains, then choosing raw honesty over jocularity. The cost is legible in her dropped mask and the moon rock’s silent witness—she risks inefficiency for authenticity. Coincidence (his arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her choice to engage crystallizes under pressure, foreclosing her old transactional mode.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding the stillpoint amid emotional chaos—is signaled by line 3 and tightens through Mara’s dowsing, which forecloses escape and demands presence. Agency is clear: she chooses to follow notes, reach into hollows, absorb melody. Cost is felt in the controlled fire in her chest and the relinquishment of cartography. Escalation is driven by her actions under an Accumulative lens, not coincidence, with each note narrowing her path toward acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—interpreting truth under cosmic uncertainty—is signaled early and deepens when Vera realizes signals are relational, not absolute. Her agency drives escalation: she doesn’t just receive data but actively “unbends” interpretations using the pen. Cost is unmistakable—the settlers’ adaptation, her personal shame—and the final turn forecloses singular certainty. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, intensifying through intellectual and moral stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—translating silence into music—is signaled early and deepens when Marina realizes she must “discover” rather than “remember” music. The meaningful tightening occurs when she abandons the viewfinder to move her body, foreclosing passive observation. Cost is felt in her tears and the irreversible loss of her old identity, though the world’s forgetting remains abstract. Escalation is driven by Marina’s agency under an Accumulative lens, yet the external pressure (world moving on) lacks concrete on-page manifestation beyond summary.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—rescuing Kiran’s truth from institutional burial—is signaled early and deepens when Marina deciphers the portrait’s hidden coordinates. Escalation is driven by her agency: analyzing art, photographing evidence, choosing broadcast over concealment. Cost is unmistakable: two years off-grid, branded arsonist, Kiran’s likely death. The tightening forecloses anonymity; she embraces exposure to fulfill her promise, crystallizing stance under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving entangled memories through sonic ritual—is signaled early and tightens as Maya drums faster, risking detection to sustain connection. Escalation is protagonist-driven: each tap deepens immersion until the lagoon blazes, forcing a trade-off between physical limits and spiritual duty. Cost is unmistakable (“fingers ached,” “weight… crushing as northern lights”). The hush of dawn imposes a live clock, narrowing her window for communion.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—uncovering who erased her father’s union campaign—is signaled early via the coin and deepened when Mira trades smuggler capture for access to 4472-G’s authorization. Escalation is driven by Mira’s agency: she rejects Voss’s brute-force approach, proposes her whisper method, and leverages storm-induced chaos to corner the data thief. Cost is unmistakable: three hours of high-stakes navigation during a worsening storm, risking her hard-won autonomy in the labyrinth. The geomagnetic storm isn’t just atmosphere—it’s a live clock that narrows tactical windows and disables tech, forcing human ingenuity over system reliance.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—Mara’s burdened secret—is signaled early and deepens as light patterns externalize her internal chaos. The tightening occurs when constellations form, reframing darkness as meaningful; this compels her agency. Cost is unmistakable: speaking risks judgment but enables rescue. Escalation is driven by protagonist perception shifting under accumulative pressure, not coincidence—the boats’ search gains purpose only after her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving children’s agency against institutional erasure—is signaled early and deepens through Marina’s rebellion. Escalation is protagonist-driven: window displays → grotto gathering → midnight activation. Cost is unmistakable: years of swallowed silence replaced by fragile, collective courage. The tightening forecloses passive endurance; she must act, risking irrelevance to reignite imagination.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—freedom from self-imposed armor—is signaled early and deepens when the scrimshaw surfaces. Marina’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to seek, interpret, and release. The whale’s call complicates but doesn’t resolve; her decision crystallizes under coherent pressure. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits the last relic of her brother’s story, trading it for emotional spaciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming authentic emotion in a post-Mandate void—is signaled early and deepens through Maya’s whittling, which shifts from mandated performance to private reduction. Agency resides in attention and renunciation: she chooses not to narrate the bouquet’s fall, marking a decisive break from performative selfhood. Cost is felt in her cracked voice and translucent wood—grief made physical then discarded. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence or soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—beauty as transgressive truth—is signaled early and deepened through Lyren’s paraphrasing, which risks reactivation of old prohibitions. Pressure escalates via the colonnade’s responsive hum and bodily reactions (teeth ache, heart quickens), culminating in a conceptual shift that forecloses compliance with artificial divisions. Cost is felt in the loneliness of return and the fragility of first ice, though not dramatized as external consequence. Agency resides in attention and linguistic choice, consistent with the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—awakening to imperfection—is signaled early and deepened when Mira uses the reed’s warble to challenge Fen’s dogma. The tightening occurs when Fen retrieves his hidden “failed” vase, foreclosing his old identity as a maker of flawless vessels. Cost is legible: he surrenders forty years of artistic certainty for uncertain, beautiful failures. Agency is fully Mira’s, yet Fen’s choice feels inevitable, not coerced.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether corrupted data can serve meaningful connection—is signaled early and deepens when the bell ringer layers fragments instead of restoring routes. Karim’s agency drives escalation: her choice to allow playback initiates the turn; her later request to “rebuild this… as testimony” crystallizes stance. Cost is felt: she relinquishes control and her original vision, embracing imperfection. Pressure tightens coherently under the Accumulative lens—each added sound fragment increases emotional density until the pilgrimage becomes emotionally real.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming loss into beauty without betrayal—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes this commission differs: it demands resurrection of unrealized life (the tattoo). Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to embed cremation ash in resin, a costly act that risks marring the silver. The price is felt: she trades emotional safety for connection, risking re-traumatization. Coincidence never resolves tension; every turn stems from her decisions under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—mapping how cultural patterns predict systemic collapse—is signaled early and deepens when Mira links crypto crashes to tulip mania via proportional analysis. The meaningful tightening occurs when she confesses her grandmother’s secret research, raising personal and intellectual stakes. Cost is conceptual but legible: inheriting a puzzle with no resolution, only continuation. Agency is clear—Mira chooses to extend the pattern into the digital age—but escalation leans more on revelation than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—accessing forbidden knowledge—is signaled early and tightens when Maressa realizes the Keltharan archived themselves to death, forcing her to choose between historical duty and ethical refusal. The deepening occurs at the console: purification requires avoiding patterns, which mirrors the civilization’s fatal flaw. Her agency drives escalation—she chooses randomness, experiences the memories, then renounces dissemination. Cost is unmistakable: loss of innocence, career purpose, and the burden of solitary wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving hope’s shape while watching it erode—is signaled early and tightens through Lyssa’s two recordings. Maren’s agency lies in attention and documentation; her choice to continue is a renunciation with felt cost. Pressure escalates via density (comparing footage) not external threat, fitting Accumulative lens. The “softly deliberate” work itself becomes the crucible of moral endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—balancing self-respect and compassion—is signaled early and tightens when Mara realizes reporting Adrian would abandon the animals. Her agency drives escalation: writing the report becomes an act of shedding false layers, narrowing her path to independent sanctuary work. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits career security and shared legacy. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens—each written word strips pretense while deepening her commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—can Maya heal without fracturing?—tightens when she realizes her attention split caused the displacement. The deepening comes via coffee-ring analysis, narrowing options to acceptance of imperfection. Agency drives escalation: her choice to reinterpret the gap as love, not error, enables the final act. Cost is felt (Mrs. Kowalski’s death) and conceptual (perfection is impossible).

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—locating and releasing unused love—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: Marina’s nightly readings deepen her understanding until she acts decisively on night 47. The tightening occurs when she realizes love is incubating, not trapped—a shift that forecloses passive witnessing and demands active release. Cost is felt in her tears and the irreversible act of projection; no coincidence resolves tension. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens, with each strip adding emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—freeing imprisoned creativity—is signaled early and escalates via meteor cries (*create*, *sing*, *become*) that narrow Lyra’s options to one act: becoming the conduit. Agency drives escalation: her tracing of paths isn’t passive observation but active pattern recognition. Cost is felt in her exhaustion (“could not hold it all”) and final surrender to Earned Stasis. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her perception and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reviving growth in a burned world—is signaled early and deepens via quantum access to divergent realities. The guard’s agency drives escalation: her singing charms wave functions, and pressing the clock collapses a branch. Cost is unmistakable: she sacrifices dreams and stable presence to exist in superposition. The single tightening—choosing to bleed knowledge from another self—narrows her path to tending sparks alone.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—mapping unmapped consciousness—is signaled early and deepens when Kael realizes the forest *is* his mind. Escalation is driven by agency: he actively applies the gear to unravel trees, each act narrowing options (e.g., confronting fear-trees as defenses). Cost is unmistakable: the dawn-pull signifies real-world time lost, yet he embraces translocation anew. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via cadence shift—from passive observation to deliberate deconstruction—reweighting his entire relationship to thought.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming selfhood after years of caregiving—is signaled early and deepens with each star. Pressure escalates not through external threat but through accumulating recognition: each stamp forces Maya to confront a buried sacrifice. The tightening is psychological but visceral, culminating in the cost of “arriving”—not just reaching a place, but accepting that her courage must now serve herself. Protagonist agency drives every turn; no coincidence resolves tension.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether silence should be honored or overwritten—is signaled early and tightens when Marta discovers the ash notes, forcing her from passive witness to active remembrance. Her humming defies management, narrowing her professional options but affirming her moral stance. The escalation is driven by her agency (kneeling, tracing, singing), not coincidence, and culminates in a visible trade-off: she risks her job to restore voice to the dead. Cost is unmistakable in the “frostbitten hope” of her solitary defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—unmasking Orian—is signaled early and escalates via Kael’s tailored messages, each narrowing options as the library decays. The tightening is protagonist-driven: she chooses which truths to seed, knowing each act accelerates dissolution. Cost is unmistakable: her existence and the archive vanish to release truth. Coincidence never resolves; victory comes through accumulated textual sabotage.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding why migration paths vanish—is signaled early and deepens when Maya realizes they’re shifting toward pre-industrial currents. The tightening occurs when she abandons modern models for speculative 2020s reconstructions, risking professional credibility. Cost is conceptual but felt: six years of misreading the ocean’s signals, now corrected at the price of humility. Escalation is driven entirely by Maya’s agency under an Accumulative lens—no coincidence, only pattern recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding meaning after failed rebellion—is signaled early and deepens via Kira’s nightly ritual. The tightening occurs when she interprets the constellation’s alignment as a call to action, transforming passive searching into active leadership. Cost is felt in her solitude and uncertainty (“still unsure if she was prophet or fool”), though the price of reigniting rebellion remains conceptual rather than visceral. Agency drives escalation: her observation leads to insight, then decision—no coincidence resolves tension.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving cultural identity against erasure—is signaled early and deepens when the kite’s script reframes “destiny” as adaptive continuity. Lira’s agency drives escalation: she climbs, decodes, speaks unsealing words—all narrowing options toward irreversible commitment. Cost is unmistakable: her daughter’s death, her own violent past, and now stewardship of a non-human future. The plants’ “eager and afraid” pressure crystallizes her stance without coincidence resolving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—surviving the “endless, ordinary after”—is signaled early and deepened by the school group’s impending arrival, forcing Layla to reconcile others’ joy with her grief. The helicopter incursion escalates pressure organically, testing her hard-won coping tactics. Her agency lies in renunciation: refusing to flee, choosing to count waves, returning to cuttings. Cost is felt in the sweat on her neck, blurred soil, and the unanswerable “mathematics” of Samir’s death versus her survival.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—seeing faces truly—is signaled early and deepens as fragmentation reveals layered selves. Pressure escalates coherently under Accumulative/Textural lens: walls contract, books fall, time tightens (“She needed to finish”). Elena’s agency drives escalation—she *chooses* to untangle threads, reposition cards, accept brokenness. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits the illusion of wholeness, embracing a harder, truer art. Coincidence never resolves; insight emerges from her labor.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding time’s fracture—is signaled early and deepens when ink patterns echo her brother’s death. Escalation is driven by Kael’s agency: she interprets, retrieves, decides. The eclipse’s end tightens the clock; the vanishing ink forces immediate action. Cost is unmistakable: she abandons conventional tracking for existential pursuit, accepting solitude as price. Coincidence complicates (eclipse timing) but doesn’t resolve—she earns insight through observation.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—truth versus survival—is signaled early and deepens when Kael realizes the letter isn’t from the past but a live call to action. Her agency drives escalation: interpreting frost, choosing to activate.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving continuity through chaos—is signaled early and deepens when the father’s presence threatens the dome’s balance. Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency: her refusal of protection, assertion that “plants know,” and invitation to “show me” force a meaningful tightening. The father’s sheathing of his knife forecloses his bounty hunter role with visible cost—his identity unravels as he presses canvas into soil. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each sensory beat intensifies the moral weight of choosing gentleness over thorns.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming her daughter’s voice through Althea’s echo—is signaled early and deepens when constellations’ sleepwalking scatters echoes into unreachable dimensions. Mira’s agency drives escalation: voicing silence creates stillness, then she pins the laugh despite cosmic drag. Cost is unmistakable: the laugh threatens to “scatter her across the garden,” and success demands her composure fracture into feral lullaby. Coincidence complicates (stars wander) but resolution stems solely from her paradoxical method and endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. legacy—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Adelaide realizes she’s “protecting a dead man’s reputation instead of seeking actual truth.” This internal reversal narrows her options: defend myth or restore fact. The cost is immediate credibility loss, yet she chooses intervention anyway. Pressure escalates through her own logic (proof by contradiction), not coincidence, and culminates in a stance that redefines her identity and public duty.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—translating untranslatable guilt—is signaled early and deepens when Mira discovers the letters are hers. The meaningful tightening occurs when she inserts the amber, narrowing her options from passive collection to active self-confrontation. Cost is unmistakable: she dissolves her mother’s gift (the firefly) into ink, sacrificing its preservation for understanding. Escalation is driven entirely by Mira’s agency under the Accumulative lens—each letter, firmware message, and memory tightens pressure until the final choice crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering or redefining meaning amid collective unlearning—is signaled early and tightens when the tile flake arrives, forcing Isla to integrate loss into her design. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she chooses to place the tile, deepening the pattern into a question. Cost is unmistakable: the acknowledgment of the daughter’s disappearance and the surrender of individual artistic control for communal re-meaning. Coincidence (the woman’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Isla’s action crystallizes the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—whether to expose Davos—is signaled early and escalates through Vessa’s retrocognitive access. Her agency drives the deepening: she *chooses* to break the tessera’s link, trading justice for communal healing. Cost is unmistakable: bearing solitary truth in a world needing myth. Pressure remains coherent under an Accumulative lens, intensifying via memory density rather than external confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—luring possibility from despair—is signaled early via the young man’s ash-tasting despair and tightens when Celeste chooses to intervene using her ghostly performance. The escalation is driven by her agency: she retrieves the tarot coin, enters the garden, and sings, each act narrowing her options (binding her hope to his response). Cost is unmistakable: she risks emotional reinjury by reliving her fire-trauma in song, and her potential encore hinges entirely on a stranger’s unknowing return. Though luck (his presence) complicates, resolution stems from her deliberate, costly performance—not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—making invisible pathways visible—is signaled early and tightens when Maya realizes electricity might bridge the gap. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her choice to test muscovite narrows options to empirical validation. Cost is unmistakable: Iris remains uncured, but their work illuminates paths for others. The deepening—from personal grief to communal tool—reweights stakes under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to the post-human world—is signaled early and deepens when Mira detects non-human consciousness. Escalation occurs through her agency: she chooses to dive deeper, set up equipment, broadcast findings. Cost is conceptual (abandoning human-centric mapping) and felt (isolation, suspension in saltwater limbo). No antagonist needed; pressure arises from the silence of the sleeping and the urgency of the transforming Earth.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—freeing prophecy from distortion—is signaled early and deepens when Maren realizes generations “heard only fragments.” Her agency drives escalation: sorting buttons isn’t passive archiving but active decryption, narrowing options until only truth remains. Cost is felt in her tremor and past sacrifices, crystallized when she carries ledgers into town—risking ridicule to replace chains with choice. The eastern wind’s return proves stakes were real, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—completing the compromised mission—is signaled early and deepens when Claire realizes “the broken thing wasn’t her life—it was the mission itself.” Escalation is driven by her agency: interpreting snow-codes, sending a covert reply, choosing to re-engage.

Marcus’s arrival crystallizes pressure without coincidence resolving conflict—he’s been writing since January, testing her readiness.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the mother’s true promise—is signaled early and deepens through the palimpsest metaphor. Pressure escalates not via external threats but through internal friction: her legal fixation versus intuitive mending. The coachman’s philosophy forces a reweighting, not resolution, aligning with Accumulative lens. Cost is felt in her surrender of control, though the absence of tangible consequence (e.g., missed deadline) slightly softens escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding how care preserves place—is signaled early and deepens through the potter’s shift from observer to participant. Escalation is driven by her agency: filling the glass, speaking to trees, sweeping paths. Each act narrows her options (she stays longer) and alters tactics (from passive watching to active tending). Cost is felt in her delayed departure and the self she leaves behind—visible, conceptual, and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—transforming hidden care into visible action—is signaled early (“when the final petal dropped, she would stop hiding”) and tightens decisively at the lighthouse. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she chooses exposure, gathers children, borrows boats, distributes flashlights. The cost is conceptual (city will see and question) and emotional (vulnerability as method), made undeniable in the final blaze. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each beat deepens the commitment to “being light itself.”

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—translating isolation into independence—is signaled early and tightens when the sundial points to the avoided cartography wing. Kael’s agency drives escalation: she chooses confrontation over avoidance, altering her relationship to memory and place. Cost is visible in “brittle awakenings” and past near-dissolution, though the tide’s rising threat at climax lacks a new tactical consequence beyond affirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—whether truth belongs to the keeper or the world—is signaled early and deepens when the storm unearths ancestral fragments, forcing Mei Lin to confront the hubris of curation. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to add her forty-three letters, transforming private archive into public offering. The cost is clear: she surrenders control over interpretation, risking misuse or indifference, yet gains communal healing. Jun’s parallel arc tightens pressure—his need to write “the next one myself” crystallizes the thematic trade-off between mediated safety and raw, personal risk.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—resisting cosmic manipulation of human discord—is signaled early and tightens when Mara initiates transmission, narrowing options to success or catastrophic failure. Escalation is protagonist-driven: her calculations adapt as tricksters counter, raising physical/cognitive cost (vision swimming, bone-deep vibration). Coincidence (Jupiter’s alignment) complicates but doesn’t resolve; victory stems from her agency. Cost is felt in campus violence and personal risk, though global stakes slightly outpace on-page consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—retrieving the architect’s key during winter’s hollow silence—is signaled early and deepened by the organ’s revelation that sound reshapes space. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she interprets vibrations, traces the spiral, and reaches through dissolving stone. The cost is felt in her constricted throat, trembling grip, and post-retrieval collapse. While pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens, the organ’s appearance borders on convenient, slightly softening causality—but its integration into spatial logic mitigates this.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—can empathy prevent future violence?—is signaled early and deepens when Vera realizes the killer crafted the masks. Her agency drives escalation: choosing to interpret the ribbon, descend, reconstruct, and finally draw. The rockslide isn’t deus ex machina; it enables her insight but doesn’t resolve the conflict—her choice to portray loneliness does. Cost is conceptual: by humanizing the killer, she risks public outrage and personal vulnerability, crystallized in the final poised act.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—validating Voss’s predictions to save lives—is signaled early and deepens when the nail reveals the correction factor. Pressure escalates causally: decoding → ascent → confrontation → revelation → collaborative action. Cost is legible: exile’s permanence (“myth”), suppressed science, and shipwrecked lives. Mira’s agency drives each turn; no coincidence resolves core conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—making the invisible visible—is signaled early and deepens when Maria realizes the names demand dynamic observation. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to descend, to recount, to photograph (even if it fails), and finally to sing. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: truth exists only fleetingly, requiring constant vigilance and artistry to sustain. Coincidence (the hitchhiker’s gift) complicates but doesn’t resolve—Maria must act.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—breaking the cycle of extraction—is signaled early and deepens when Luka realizes his fintech venture was digital predation. The meaningful tightening occurs when he recognizes his stone markers aren’t fortifications but commitments to endure discomfort. Agency drives escalation: his choice to stay (not flee to another scheme) forecloses a path with felt cost—the loss of his old identity as innovator. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, culminating in a stance crystallization that reweights his entire past.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—decoding the inscriptions—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes it requires multiple observers. The tightening occurs when they overlay star cycles, foreclosing Chen’s solitary path. Cost is felt in Kove’s guilt and Mira’s inherited burden; agency lies in their choice to pool data. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens: each shared observation intensifies the emotional and intellectual convergence until the “harmonizing” epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—completing a frozen confession—is signaled early and tightens when Kael realizes truth was seized mid-utterance. Escalation is driven by her agency: each circuit deepens knowledge, culminating in the seed’s deployment. Cost is unmistakable: she must temporarily “lose herself” to find the truth, gasping upon return. Coincidence never resolves; the charlatan’s failure merely sets the stage for her disciplined method.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—navigating the Accelerated future—is signaled early and tightens when Chen confirms shared knowledge of the eclipsed covenant. Mara’s agency drives escalation: her decision to present the clipping initiates collaborative world-building. Cost is felt in glowing scars and implied ongoing bodily limitation. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; convergence is earned through shared wounds and vision.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—can bartered destinies be undone without deeper harm?—tightens when Kael reveals Senna was his destined wife, transforming abstract guilt into intimate loss. Pressure escalates through protagonist agency: Mira’s past choice created the crisis, and her present choice to “try” accepts irreversible cost. The moral calculus—trading one death for another—sharpens the peak decision, and the “hole where she should be” makes stakes viscerally felt, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—Marcus’s search for purpose after public failure—is signaled early and tightens when the woman’s belief collides with his facts. His agency drives escalation: choosing honesty, then softening it, then reclaiming meaning through preservation. The cost—emotional exposure, lingering shame—is felt in every beat. Though stakes remain internal, pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, culminating in a stance crystallization that forecloses his old identity as infallible expert.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding transition to reconcile grief—is signaled early and tightens when Asha realizes the arbor is a “threshold,” narrowing her tactic to analogical planting. Agency drives escalation: her cross-referencing and seed placement are active choices, not luck. Cost is legible in seven failed seeds and emotional labor, culminating in the fruit’s ripening as both reward and reconfiguration. The deepening (from preservation to participation) is meaningful, though the shift leans slightly on revelation over struggle—hence just shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder in a world without tomorrow—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: Maren chooses to smelt contradictions, risking further dissolution. The tightening occurs when stable pages meet migrating books, forcing synthesis over preservation. Cost is unmistakable: she surrenders fixed identity (“the self is a tide, not a stone”) to gain the scroll’s dimensional truth. Coincidence never resolves; the dream-guided creel discovery is framed as intuitive inheritance, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. protocol—is signaled early and deepens when Mara confronts the shells’ emotional weight. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each handled shell tightens pressure until her decisive act (etching, crowning) forecloses bureaucratic detachment. Cost is unmistakable: she trades professional integrity for human connection, crystallized in her falsified report. Under the Accumulative lens, density of confessions reweights survival into renewal, making stakes visceral rather than abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness through truth—is signaled early and tightens when the graffiti forces Maya to confront her penance-as-avoidance. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her choice to play the accordion (not just document) deepens the conflict from external recording to internal reckoning. Cost is unmistakable: “painful, yes, but undeniably real” replaces numbing medication. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each notation narrowed her world until the river demanded presence.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—access to the unspoken library—is signaled early and tightens when the Librarian reveals the Council’s rejection, forcing Elena to rely on her own documentation as proof. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: she chooses to ascend despite warnings, and the backward-ticking watch intensifies pressure. Cost is felt in the burden of knowledge (“some objects were burdens disguised as prizes”) and the irreversible commitment to a life spent “learning to read its particular silence.”

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.3)
    The dominant stake—whether beauty should be possessed or propagated—is signaled early and deepens through Iris’s visions. Each coffee-stain revelation tightens the vise: authentication secures luxury but erases purpose; propagation risks everything but fulfills the violin’s intent. The Emperor’s deadline (“by sunset”) creates a live clock that forces agency, not coincidence. The cost is unmistakable in the final lines: exile weighed against multiplying music, with the “mulberry ache” embodying the price of integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—capturing the last spark before oblivion—is signaled early and tightens through Kael’s pattern-finding, which narrows her focus to essential life fragments. The deepening occurs when aurora intensifies “as if responding,” raising stakes by thinning the veil between worlds. Cost is unmistakable: Kael expends her own attention and energy (hands washed in aurora-melt), and the emerald’s depletion proves irreversible. Agency drives escalation—no coincidence resolves tension.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether Mei can hold compassion for her daughter’s killer—is signaled early and deepens when the soul appears. The tightening occurs at the Pool: Mei must choose between comfort and truth, opting for the latter with cost (“You destroyed much”). Her agency drives escalation—she leads, reveals, releases—and the price is emotional endurance. Under an Accumulative lens, this deepening reweights the central stake through density of moral tension, not plot mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—moral accountability in scientific research—is signaled early and deepens when Mara reveals Keegan “stopped questioning” his hypothesis. The tightening occurs when the wind chimes shift mid-confrontation, forcing Keegan to face his self-deception; this narrows his options from deflection to raw admission (“I wanted to help them”). Cost is unmistakable: he must publicly dismantle his work (“write a paper about what went wrong”), sacrificing professional reputation. Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist agency—Mara’s use of the mirror shard and chime interpretation—and the wind’s “honesty” serves pressure, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—learning to exist between presence and absence—is signaled early and deepens through each stone drop, culminating in Maia’s renunciation of invisibility as performance. Pressure tightens via Keiran’s backwards aging (a live countdown) and the trance state that heightens perception. Agency lies in attention: Maia chooses to see the “stillness between” ripples, foreclosing her old coping mechanism. Cost is felt in her relinquished armor of withdrawal, though a second tightening beat would push this into 9+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether the wandering pulse can be released without violating the canyon’s sacred memory—is signaled early and deepens when the birds arrive, forcing the skimmer to act through indirect, non-invasive means. Escalation is driven by her agency: she reads the birds’ patterns, matches the hum, and teaches stillness-as-navigation. The cost is conceptual yet undeniable: she absorbs another soul’s unresolved trauma into her eternal vigil, expanding her solitude into stewardship. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens without coincidence resolving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—validating hand-drawn magic in an automated world—is signaled early and tightens when Teryn chooses mist walking over teleportation, narrowing her path to one of faith over precision. The deepening occurs at the spire’s apex: inserting the keystone isn’t just restoration but defiance, with clear cost (isolation, impending scrutiny). Agency drives escalation—every step is Teryn’s choice under pressure. The “accommodates impossibilities” trait enables her success but at the price of speed, relevance, and institutional belonging, making stakes viscerally felt rather than abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—discovering whether his mother’s synesthetic love-vows caused or coincided with the sinking—is signaled early and deepens when Marcus reads her final journal entry. The meaningful tightening occurs underwater: learning she sought to “bind deeper than any words” reframes his quest from recovery to witness. Agency is clear—his decision to descend during the festival—and the cost is conceptual: he trades empirical closure for poetic resonance. Coincidence (calm tide, lantern festival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the revelation emerges from his mother’s own records.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—finding purpose in a causally inverted universe—is signaled early and deepened through two meaningful tightenings: first via frequency seven-theta-nine (“decisions matter in their making”), then three-sigma-six (“harmonizing with something deep in her chest”). Each choice narrows Kael’s path toward witness rather than predictor, with opportunity cost (isolation, futility). Escalation is driven by her agency—casting lots, tuning receivers—not coincidence. Cost is unmistakable: enduring infinite doubt without resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—naming nameless fears—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes reapers map emotional monsters. Escalation is driven by her agency: choosing to speak true names crystallizes abstract pain into navigable form. Cost is unmistakable: she endures hearing her daughter voice her sorrows, transforming paralysis into purpose. The tightening forecloses her prior path of anonymous reaping, with the price felt in “sharp-edged” crystals carried forward.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring cosmic balance through precise timing—is signaled early and tightens when the elders dismiss the river’s disappearance as natural. Maren’s agency drives escalation: her decision to rebuild the clapper using dew and weak magic narrows options (no fire, no help) and deepens stakes (if she fails, the cycle dies). The cost is felt in her isolation and the fragility of her creation—“neither fully solid nor fully liquid.” Luck complicates (dew patterns) but doesn’t resolve; victory stems from her persistent, naive attention.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory against institutional erasure—is signaled early and deepens when the radio order demands expungement. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she copies photos, contacts media, enabling public reclamation. Cost is unmistakable: professional retaliation (“insubordinate”) and emotional exposure (facing weeping survivors). The tightening forecloses bureaucratic compliance, forcing moral endurance with tangible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—completing the formula—is signaled early and deepens when intuition proves necessary. The tightening occurs at the starlings’ flight: chaos reveals order her science missed, forcing her to risk belief over measurement. Agency drives escalation—she chooses to speak forbidden words, melting the crystal into flame. Cost is felt: surrendering intellectual sovereignty, though not physically dramatized, resonates as emotional forfeiture. Coincidence (starlings appearing) complicates but doesn’t resolve; insight stems from her observation.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving trust through accurate pattern-reading—is signaled early and tightens when council contradicts her. Vera’s agency drives escalation: she doesn’t wait for validation but re-engages the arbor through muscle memory, then crafts a transparent response. Cost is legible: she risks fracture of hard-won trust by standing firm. One meaningful deepening suffices, though the absence of a second reversal slightly limits pressure range.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—legal/personal identity—is signaled early and tightens at the courthouse. Kenji’s agency drives escalation: he chooses vulnerability over litigation. Cost is unmistakable—emotional exposure (“voice shake”), relational risk, and surrender of sole claim to selfhood. The clone isn’t a coincidence but pressure incarnate, forcing Kenji to crystallize stance through complementary recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—safeguarding creative independence—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when corporate offers escalate alongside the plant’s growth. Miranda’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to integrate the flower into puzzles, transforming threat into innovation. Cost is unmistakable—foregoing lucrative buyouts—and visible in her strategic pivot. Coincidence (the mentor’s seed) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from Miranda’s adaptive choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—breaking the household’s calcified silence—is signaled early and deepens via Marcus’s escalating sonic ritual. The meaningful tightening occurs when mechanical noise becomes “wild joy” that reaches upstairs, forcing the brother to lift his head and the mother to pause. Cost is visible: Marcus expends physical/emotional labor for only a “crack in the silence,” not resolution. Agency is clear—his choices drive escalation, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—making peace with uncertainty—is signaled early and deepens through her shift from tallying time to interiorizing exteriors. Agency is clear: she chooses to touch the pendant, wear it, stand, and read. The tightening occurs when she stops questioning the pendant’s origin, accepting that “uncertainty could be befriended.” Cost is felt physically (feral body resisting upright posture) and existentially (permanent displacement).

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—escaping a stifling, predetermined destiny—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Maren realizes failures were “successive approximations.” Her agency drives escalation: she reinterprets past errors, then actively betrays her master’s doctrine by improvising. The cost is conceptual (abandoning Royal Metallurgist security) and emotional (carrying “accumulated wreckage” as wisdom). Coincidence plays no role; pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural logic.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—deciphering the true message of the cosmos—is signaled early and tightened when Mira discards conventional frequency-mapping to seek valleys instead of peaks. This deepening, driven by her agency, narrows options: she risks total failure by rejecting established methods. The cost is intellectual and existential—abandoning the belief that meaning lies in human-made signals—but it’s felt only implicitly through her breath catching and the warmth of the fragment. While pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, the escalation lacks a concrete tactical loss (e.g., equipment failure, physical toll), slightly muting the stakes’ visceral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reuniting scattered passengers—is signaled early and tightens when Marcus realizes sand = passengers across timelines. Escalation is driven by his agency: radio broadcasts synthesize boarding patterns into a rescue tool. Cost is felt in Reeves’s translucence and the passengers’ confusion, though the resolution’s ease slightly softens the price. Coincidence never resolves; all turns stem from Marcus’s accumulated knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering if connection has tangible form—is signaled early and tightens when the threads begin vibrating, raising the emotional stakes from art to communion. Marina’s agency drives escalation: she calculates, weaves, and ties the final strand, forcing the gallery to respond. The cost is conceptual yet felt: accepting a constructed brother as real requires surrendering empirical truth. Coincidence never resolves; the eruption stems directly from her rational enchantment.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming navigational wisdom to comprehend alien knowledge—is signaled early and deepens via Yael’s renunciation of her station role. The tightening occurs when she declares her six-month surface request: a live option foreclosed (staying below), with cost (professional disruption, emotional rupture). Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves anything. The “unfolded horizons” concept sharpens the moral calculus: to learn the new, she must first recover the old—a trade-off with intellectual and existential stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—delivering a final message to prevent suicide—is signaled early and escalates when the pulse reveals Elena’s danger. Mara’s agency drives every turn: she accesses records, interprets clues, calls authorities. The cost is felt in her isolation and the moral weight of intervening; the tightening occurs when the hearing aid shifts from vessel to warning. Coincidence complicates (the forgotten device), but resolution stems from Mara’s actions.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering truth erased by fear—is signaled early and tightens as water seeps under the door, forcing a decisive download-and-flee. Maya’s agency drives escalation: she powers the station, interprets data, annotates the codex. Cost is unmistakable: she risks drowning to retrieve what others buried, and her sister’s name remains officially unmade. The tide’s return isn’t coincidence—it’s a coherent environmental pressure that crystallizes her renunciation of safety for loyalty.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reconciling near-death with continued life—is signaled early and deepens when ink reveals grandmother’s lived failures. Marcus’s agency drives escalation: choosing to spill ink, then place the shard, transforms passive counting into active integration. Cost is felt in the loss of his counting anchor and the irreversible fading of the vision. Pressure tightens coherently under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—saving Keshrin from oblivion—tightens when Maerith realizes sound fails and pivots to texture, narrowing options to solitary, physical inscription. Agency drives escalation: bird observation → diamond calibration → encoding. Cost is felt (“cost her sleep… sanity”) and conceptual (language survives only for hypothetical future listeners). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves—only persistent, lonely labor.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—whether to expose or join the harmony—is signaled early and deepens when Elena hears her dead mother, forcing a trade-off between professional duty and personal healing. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she chooses to answer the phone, pocket the arrowhead, and finally reject reporting. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits her identity as documentarian for uncertain transformation. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each confession intensifies thematic weight without coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—freeing imprisoned beauty—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Lira realizes the statues imprison rather than protect. Her agency drives escalation: playing harder, synchronizing with the orchard’s pulse, using the locust shell as catalyst. Cost is unmistakable: the orchard’s luminescence is lost (“memory of luminescence”), yet freedom is chosen anyway. The final image shows wonder returned “strange and imperfect,” proving stakes were viscerally felt, not abstractly declared.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—delivering what borders forbid—is signaled immediately and deepens when Mira reveals the daughter’s question: “where broken promises heal.” The tightening comes not through external threat but emotional weight: the bottle contains the storm from her birth night, making absence tangible. Kael’s agency lies in endurance and precise delivery; cost is felt in the unspoken grief of separation and the constant risk of arrest. Coincidence (drones) complicates but doesn’t resolve—pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—interpreting silence as fertile ground—is signaled early and deepened when humming erupts mid-restoration. The “wrong turn” complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency lies entirely in her persistent hands. Cost is unmistakable: seven years of withheld voice, now irrevocably spent in song. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates via sensory density (chiming, gleaming, creaking) until the carousel’s motion reconfigures what silence means.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—finding where stories live—is signaled early and deepens via Meridian’s three-year mapping project. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: overlaying maps reveals voids her model can’t capture, forcing conceptual surrender. Cost is felt: she relinquishes control of total knowledge for a more profound truth. Under Accumulative lens, this single intensification suffices; pressure remains coherent and thematically resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—translating absence into bearable presence—is signaled early and deepens through Marina’s agency: choosing colors, shooting frames, interpreting light. The meaningful tightening occurs when she discovers Iris’s hidden message, which doesn’t resolve but reconfigures her pursuit into fluent dialogue with loss. Cost is unmistakable: she accepts perpetual dawn labor instead of reunion. Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist action under an Accumulative lens, with no coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—freeing the trapped symphony—is signaled early and tightens when the locksmith declares the work “will disorient you.” The meaningful deepening occurs during the device’s activation: Mara’s “careful narratives… fragmenting into their component lies,” forcing her to confront the cost of her fear. Agency is clear—she consents (“if you’re certain”) and endures the disorientation. Cost is unmistakable: the realization that her sacrifice “imprisoned the full truth” of what she could have taught Clara. Escalation is driven by protagonist choice under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering stolen memories—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes they were mapped, not lost. Her agency drives escalation: she doesn’t stumble upon truth but deciphers it via star charts and fungal rings. The cost is conceptual yet visceral: bearing knowledge once deemed too heavy for a teenager. Autumn equinox isn’t just atmosphere—it’s a live clock that tightens tactics, making tonight the only possible moment.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—return from reversible exile—is signaled early and deepened through Miren’s revelation of her own double exile. Pressure escalates via Kael’s resistance, the tea-leaf analysis, and the shared backward-walking tic, culminating in a crystallized stance: return requires bending, not breaking. Cost is unmistakable—Kael must surrender her combative impatience, a trait that caused her exile. Agency drives every turn; coincidence never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—saving the tree’s essence—is signaled early and tightens when Esme risks bodily strain to braid essences. Agency drives escalation: her pruning knowledge enables cross-world perception. Cost (aching knees, cramping hands) alters nothing tactically but charges closure emotionally. Could deepen pressure: no tangible consequence if she fails, slightly muting stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—freeing spirits versus bearing their silence—is signaled early and deepens when the boy reveals his brother’s guilt, transforming technical restoration into moral reckoning. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to continue despite trembling hands and accumulating internal weight. The cost is visceral—silence “pressing against her ribs like unfallen snow”—and culminates in a heavier emptiness after release. This single, meaningful tightening (truth as both liberation and burden) forecloses peace but affirms purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—validating the henge’s “peculiar grace”—tightens when Elena discovers the spiral grass pattern, forcing her to choose between bureaucratic compliance and poetic truth. Her agency drives escalation: frame comparison → geological cross-reference → recommendation to expose the wound. The cost is professional risk (shielded openness) and philosophical surrender (accepting unmappability). Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds via pattern recognition until silence itself becomes legible—a deepening that reweights all prior observation.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—did Eleanor’s last transmission reach Marsh?—is signaled early and deepens into existential inquiry about attachment. Pressure escalates via discovery: radio log confirms receipt, then Marsh’s note reframes the entire mission. Marina’s agency drives every turn; no coincidence resolves core tension. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: she surrenders the need for answers, trading certainty for witness—a visible shift in her final action (shaking the globe, not opening more cylinders).

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—articulating unspoken needs—is signaled early and deepens when the ghost reveals forgotten supplicants’ prayers. The balladeer’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to encode, not merely witness. Cost is felt: her songs failed because they evaporated; now she must translate melody into durable, mechanical language. The tightening occurs between lightning and thunder—a live clock that forces urgency without coincidence resolving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering Thessaly’s lost self—tightens as entries shift from joy to dissolution, culminating in Maren’s realization that preservation *is* the act of love. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: choosing to read, to wear goggles, to pack. Cost is felt (grief transmuted, not erased) and conceptual (memory as fragile, encrypted artifact). One meaningful deepening suffices, though pressure remains internal rather than externalized conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—validating that the sky memorializes loss—is signaled early and tightens through Mara’s defiance of institutional skepticism. Agency manifests as attention: choosing to study gaps over clouds, photographing departed light, preparing for Council presentation. Cost is visible in professional ostracization (“careful, clinical eyes”) and emotional exposure. Escalation occurs via protagonist-driven deepening: today’s “remembering violence” void proves their hypothesis, raising stakes for tomorrow’s reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—mirroring the infinite despite human limits—is signaled early and tightens when the custodian’s death raises urgency. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to seek the book, interpret the journal, photograph the coin, and commit to painting blind. Cost is unmistakable: the tree falls, the guild vanishes, yet she persists in “measured approximation.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each layer of engraved stars deepens the thematic weight without false resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—escape via understanding—is signaled early and tightens when provisions dwindle and morale frays. Maren’s agency drives escalation: her decoding forces a trade-off between accepted stasis and risky intervention. Cost is felt: crew anxiety, fuel loss, time wasted. Coincidence (mysterious hopscotch) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the solution emerges from her pattern recognition, not external aid.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding repair over mere opening—is signaled early and deepens when prophecy fragments demand interpretation over force. Pressure escalates texturally: brittle scraps → disorienting mirrors → liquid starlight’s irreversible spill. Cost is legible in Celeste’s lost decades (“hollow” expertise) and the vial’s one-time use. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves tension. Minor deduction: prophecy mechanics lack mid-beat friction—they appear but don’t complicate attempts.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving collective survival against fragmentation—is signaled early and escalates cleanly: resource hoarding → failed pollination → merchant temptation. Mirela’s agency drives each tightening via chalk messages that force concrete choices (Kess opening her storehouse, work crews crossing factions). The merchant offer crystallizes the moral calculus: individual wealth vs. communal integrity. Cost is unmistakable in Mirela’s spectral depletion and the settlers’ conscious rejection of off-world currency.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—embedding care beyond time’s end—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: Mara chooses not salvation but memory, planting the lullaby despite knowing humanity ignored her warnings. The meaningful tightening occurs when she shifts from adjusting external clocks to calibrating reality’s inner structure (“adjusting invisible calibrations”). Cost is unmistakable: her daughter’s death, the broken puppet, her own dissolution. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of fractal imagery, rhythmic hum, and dusk’s progression narrow options until only inward adjustment remains.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—escape versus duty—is signaled early and tightens when hikers appear, raising urgency. Protagonist agency drives escalation: Maren uses the nut’s blueprint to “assemble” a path through intention, narrowing options via precise hovering steps. Cost is unmistakable: freedom sacrificed for responsibility, crystallized in her return to the labyrinth. The night frost deadline forces credible trade-offs without coincidence resolving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reconciling divergent research paths—is signaled early and deepens when Maya realizes they’re convergent. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: her observation of foam leads to insight, which crystallizes into actionable science. Cost is felt in her loosened grief and the implicit burden of continuing alone. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, though the tightening could be slightly more visceral in the middle beat.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—whether stories begin in silence or scar—is signaled early and deepens as Mira quantifies absence. Her agency drives escalation: each incision she maps narrows the gap between forgetting and remembering, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration. The cost is legible: her clean slates now carry “trace elements of others’ absences,” implying emotional contagion as price. Coincidence never resolves; the visitors’ arrival merely frames her completed work, not alters it.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—sandpapering rough memories—is signaled early and deepens as stored remorse threatens to subsume Maren. Escalation is driven by her agency: she chooses to sort, soften, and antisepticize memories despite contagion risk. Cost is unmistakable: the emotional labor nearly drowns her, and the pavilion’s dissolution proves irreversible transformation. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each memory tasted intensifies the thematic weight until dawn forces resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—human connection across linguistic trauma—is signaled early and deepens when Elevator Seven’s silence forces Mira to abandon song for raw speech. Her agency drives escalation: choosing imperfect phrases over polished neutrality, then ceding the channel to let others speak. Cost is unmistakable—the weight’s finite descent creates urgency, and her voice’s exhaustion is implied in “vigorous, tender efforts.” Coincidence never resolves; trust emerges only through earned vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—redeeming abandoned dreams through modified memory tech—is signaled early and tightens when Maya realizes Keiko’s horror and the weaponization risk. The meaningful deepening occurs when she feels the subjects’ buried aspirations, forcing a trade-off: preserve scientific neutrality or restore possibility. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens, though the cost (permanent memory entanglement) is implied rather than viscerally dramatized in action.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving forgotten knowledge before the archive dies—is signaled early and deepens through the inversion-hour constraint, which forces a narrow, high-risk window. Celene’s agency drives escalation: she interprets the doodle, times her arrival, and acts at each threshold. The cost is legible in the physical peril and emotional weight of being the last guardian. Pressure coheres under the Hybrid lens, with the inversion hour functioning as both literal and metaphorical deadline that reweights every choice.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—proving music survives the Silence—is signaled early and escalates through Mara’s increasingly costly strumming, culminating in bloodied hands and full-grove synchronization. Agency is clear: her choice to translate symphonies into wire tension drives the sole meaningful deepening, narrowing options to this fragile, tactile performance. Cost is unmistakable: physical pain, isolation, and the risk of failure in a world that no longer believes in music. The hedgehog’s dream confirms the stake’s success, making the emotional price felt rather than stated.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preventing city-wide collapse via covenant renewal—is signaled early and tightens when Katrin realizes words fail, forcing her to risk everything on chess-as-language. Her agency drives escalation: each piece movement is a high-stakes attempt that narrows options (e.g., showing cooperation, not opposition). Cost is unmistakable: years of exile deemed “worthless” now demand validation through vulnerability. The magnetic beings’ counter-proposal raises stakes further—they don’t just accept but refine, demanding perpetual precision.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—accessing Elena’s truth—is signaled immediately and tightens through three escalating frequencies: hesitation, protection, exhausted love. Each attempt narrows options; failure teaches what kind of silence must be matched. Agency drives escalation: Marcella chooses which silences to replay, interpreting emotion through metal. Cost is felt in the irreversible confrontation with her sister’s unshielded hope, which demands new courage from her.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—cultivating serenity within motion—is signaled early and tightens when the bloom forces Lirien to choose presence over flight. Agency is endurance, not action, but it carries visceral cost (nausea, tremors) that alters her tactics (shallow breathing, doodling). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each journal entry deepens commitment, narrowing options until only witnessing remains. Villagers’ doubt and Old Marin’s cryptic wisdom apply secondary pressure without resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restoring her family’s stolen resilience—is signaled early and deepens when the echo reveals betrayal. Pressure escalates causally: limited Turning window forces riskier flight, chaotic water streams narrow options, and gravity’s return races against excavation. Cost is visible in the abandoned First Orchard and crossed-out ledger. Agency drives every escalation; coincidence never resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding why twenty thousand vanished—is signaled early and tightens when Mara pivots from structural failure to atmospheric convergence. Her agency drives escalation: interpreting wind charts leads to vortex discovery, which demands meteorological verification. The cost is conceptual yet visceral: realizing human foresight outpaced institutional response, and that her report may be the only bulwark against recurrence. Pressure coheres causally, with each finding narrowing interpretive options until the singular convergence becomes undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring wonder as essential—is signaled early and deepens via the amber score’s demand for anti-performance. Escalation occurs through Kael’s precise choreography of sound and silence under auroral timing, narrowing options to a single resonant act. Cost is legible: he sacrifices song for hush, and the world regains awe at the price of his solitary labor. Coincidence (sculptor’s strike) complicates but doesn’t resolve—Kael’s agency drives the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding failure—is signaled early and deepens when Mira discovers the flute itself is fading. This escalation, driven by her agency (testing echoes, playing the sequence), forecloses her path to restoration and forces a redefinition of purpose. Cost is unmistakable: she accepts permanent separation, trading hope for witness. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens—each marker, each note tightens the thematic vise without coincidence or reset.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—decoding emotion’s mathematics before cosmic collapse—is signaled early and deepens when Mira accuses him of fear, forcing him to confront his own incompleteness. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he chooses to print the fragment despite knowing it will shatter, accepting the loss to achieve transposed empathy. Cost is visible in the fragment’s destruction, the vanished star, and Mira’s sorrow—each narrowing future options. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure coheres through layered images (borrowed hands, shifting voices, fading light) that reweight the central question without false resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—carrying wonder, not just relics—is signaled early and deepened when Kessa chooses conversation over haste. The tightening occurs at the stone wall: using the pendant extends time, forcing her to engage despite schedule pressure. Cost is felt (lost minutes) and conceptual (risking professional detachment). Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens; the herbalist encounter confirms the stake’s validity. No false resolutions—Orin’s absence remains unresolved, but its meaning transforms.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—proving objects absorb emotion to honor Castellan—is signaled early and deepens when the prism pulses with sorrow. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to soften her vision, releasing certainty, which triggers the frost’s revelation. Cost is unmistakable: her scientific identity fractures, replaced by guardianship of “dangerous knowledge.” Pressure tightens once, decisively, under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—sending knowledge across impossible distance—is signaled early and tightens when the puzzle box appears, narrowing options to weaving-as-prayer. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she chooses to recommence, threads edges, sacrifices vitality. Cost is unmistakable: her life-force departs, bead dims, hands still. Under Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via sensory unraveling (“seams tearing”) until the final act reweights silence itself.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—coaxing resilience from ruin—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Kael trades memories for silk, then again when each hammer blow costs another fragment of self. Agency is clear: his deliberate strikes drive escalation, not coincidence. The meaningful deepening occurs at the climax where personal erasure becomes the price of planetary healing, narrowing options to a single path. Cost is unmistakable: love, laughter, identity—all sacrificed visibly on the page to reconfigure the world.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—carrying the truth’s weight—tightens when Kaia confronts her mother’s exile motive, foreclosing naive reunion. Escalation is driven by Kaia’s agency: she follows the shard, steps through worlds, chooses learning over escape. Cost is legible in abandonment’s duality (protection vs. loss). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via intensifying sensory currents.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—combating existential loneliness through reciprocal witnessing—is signaled early and deepens when the lamp dies, foreclosing automation’s anonymity. Vera’s agency drives escalation: her stone-stacking choices narrow her path from observer to guardian. Cost is unmistakable: she inherits the ghosts’ burden, trading solitude for sacred duty (“the dark would never be empty again”). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each letter tightens emotional stakes until the final vow crystallizes her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—guiding ships through storms using arcane light—is signaled early and tightens when three vessels synchronously alter course, proving the beam’s active steering. Mara’s prophetic utterances raise stakes by implying her words shape reality, yet escalation hinges on her ritual execution, not coincidence. Cost is visible in her solitude and the world’s indifference (“logbook no one read anymore”), though the salvage captain’s near-disaster remains off-stage, slightly muting immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding why stories are drawn to her—is signaled early and deepens through escalating confessions (merchant, pilgrim, widow). The tightening occurs when the proprietor reveals the wing’s prior owner, transforming passive reception into active inheritance. Cost is unmistakable: she must now bear this gravitational pull indefinitely. Agency lies in her quiet acceptance, not refusal, aligning with Earned Stasis under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—whether human sorrow can be healed by remembering what trees witnessed—is signaled early and deepens when Kael heals her wound via moonlight on glass. Her agency drives escalation: she reconstructs the sextant not as tool but as ritual instrument, narrowing options by rejecting quantification. The cost is conceptual yet palpable: she trades measurable units of grief for the unmeasurable burden of witness, crystallized in the heavier pin she carries.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—rekindling the realm through communal memory—is signaled early and tightens when Elara realizes songs can bind her fragments. Escalation is driven by her agency: humming → singing forgotten songs → carrying dawns to settlements. Cost is unmistakable: each song releases a fragment until she vanishes. The deepening (songs returning to living throats) narrows her options—she must dissolve to succeed—and the final trade-off (her existence for collective renewal) is viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether empathy demands immersion or distance—is signaled early and deepens when Eleanor reads “The Courage of Retreat.” Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to enter, to read, to stop hiding. Cost is unmistakable: three years of pain, the risk of exposure, the surrender of her mistaken belief. The tightening occurs when strangers arrive—she must act, not just reflect—and her emergence crystallizes stance under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—resisting erasure through attention—is signaled early and deepens when Mira confronts her own complicity. The tightening occurs at the tea house: absolution is tenuous, gardening is archaeology, and silence has moral weight. Cost is unmistakable (“her own complicity tasted bitter”) and shapes her renewed commitment. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (finding bread) complicates but doesn’t resolve—Mira chooses to keep planting.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving luminous vows against oblivion—is signaled early and tightens when Celeste realizes preservation is futile; transformation becomes necessary. Her agency drives escalation: she reweaves vows into a “seed of continuous becoming,” foreclosing the library’s survival to enable future meaning-making. Cost is felt in her solitary stand amid collapse. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the deepening (from recording to reconfiguring) reweights the entire premise with emotional and conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—identifying the traitor—is signaled early and deepens into a moral dilemma: justice versus mercy. Della’s agency drives escalation; her false starts are tactical, and Kern’s counter-pressure (“They had my daughter”) forces a crystallized stance. The tightening occurs when only Kern knew the north caves detail, narrowing options to confrontation. Cost is unmistakable: she sacrifices recorded proof, accepting lifelong uncertainty for human compassion.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding weather-carriers—is signaled early and deepens through Kaia’s sensory encounters. Pressure escalates via accumulating anomalies (taste shifts, compass overload) until her epiphany reweights the entire premise: emergence, not selection. Agency drives escalation—she attends the convergence, questions carriers, removes the ring. Cost is felt in the loss of empirical certainty, crystallized when she trades the compass for mentorship.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—honoring her brother’s belief in her calling—is signaled early and deepens when the letter is revealed. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: Maya chooses to descend, confronts the theft, and ultimately consents to exhibit. The tightening occurs when the docent forces reckoning with the letter’s plea, foreclosing continued self-punishment. Cost is unmistakable: fifteen years of suppressed talent, embodied in charcoal smudges on frame and stone.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—recovering emotional truth in a lie-saturated world—is signaled early (“conversations became transactional”) and tightens when Kade admits fear, forcing Mira to choose between isolation and shared vulnerability. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her search yields the map, her invitation draws Kade in, her presence validates his honesty. Cost is unmistakable: years of physical decline, social withdrawal, and the ever-present toxic sky that literalizes suffocation. The deepening—from private longing to collaborative action—narrows options: they must now return and spread candor, foreclosing retreat into silence.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving truth in a wordless world—is signaled early and deepens as the ice melts, narrowing options: Mara can’t rush or alter the process, only witness and frame it. Agency lies in attention and endurance; her choice to suspend the ice initiates irreversible escalation. Cost is unmistakable: the fragment’s disappearance mirrors language’s loss, yet its transformation into music offers bittersweet compensation. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each drop tightens thematic stakes without false resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—containing inner chaos—is signaled early via the unopened box and deepened catastrophically by the pole shift. Unit-47’s agency drives escalation: gathering stalks, sparking fire, compressing consciousness. Cost is unmistakable: the child’s labeled fears are incinerated, the farm reduced to ash. The tightening forces a trade-off—preserve the past or forge a functional future—and the android chooses the latter with irreversible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—unlocking sealed grief—is signaled early and deepens when Iris appears sobbing. Maya’s agency (listening, offering locket) narrows options: Iris must choose between continued flight or facing letters. Cost is visible in Iris’s physical collapse and emotional exposure. Coincidence (Iris appearing at dawn) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution comes from Maya’s cultivated method. One tightening suffices, though escalation could heighten risk (e.g., landlord intervention).

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—encoding autonomy under surveillance—is signaled early and deepens via the hangman’s dice, whose true function narrows Mira’s options (she must perform precise movements undetected). Escalation is driven by her agency: journal entries choreograph the escape, culminating in the moonless tide window. Cost is unmistakable—the abandonment of her life’s work (journals) and three years of isolation. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each “strand” of her web tightening stakes until the door groans open.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost memories—is signaled early and deepens when Maren realizes the whale carried deleted moments. The tightening occurs when she shifts from passive witness to active exhumation, narrowing options to one fragile method (coffee grounds + crystals). Cost is felt in the grandmother’s irreversible dementia and the painstaking slowness of recovery. Escalation is driven entirely by Maren’s agency under an Accumulative lens, with no coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—silencing a self-fulfilling prophecy—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the summoner traces the spread to human consciousness. The deepening occurs at the apprentice’s journal: a single act (water spill) reverses momentum, narrowing options to one decisive intervention. Cost is felt (physical strain, isolation) but not sharply dramatized; escalation relies on accumulation rather than protagonist-driven reversal, fitting the lens but lacking visceral trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the language of buildings—intensifies into a metaphysical quest. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: from passive borrowing to active interrogation. The “agreed upon lies” create tension that tightens until rupture on the rooftop. Cost is unmistakable: the comfort of disbelief is forfeited for a burdensome, ancient knowledge that redefines his relationship to time and place.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving memories without killing them—is signaled early and deepens when Mara discovers resonance structures can keep them “alive.” The meaningful tightening occurs when she tests the shell on the flower, proving integration isn’t surrender but evolution. Cost is unmistakable: three decades of grief, Anya’s absence, and the risk of failed trials. Escalation is driven entirely by Mara’s agency—her sleepless insight, her insistence on starting with Anya—and the world’s rules cohere under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—freeing the kingdom from tribute—is signaled early and tightened through Lien’s moral calculus: forgery as fidelity. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency (her refusal then acceptance) under Accumulative pressure (dripping stalactites, fading aurora). Cost is unmistakable: she commits treason with full awareness, trading personal integrity for collective freedom. The “calibrated” nature of the betrayal ensures stakes remain coherent and morally complex without false equivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—protecting hidden truths—is signaled early and deepens when Kael discovers her own echoing ability. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses to harmonize both voices, foreclosing her old identity. Cost is visible in the dissolution of melancholy into responsibility, though the antagonistic pressure (Veshar’s network) remains abstract, slightly softening escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering the captain’s suppressed climate data—is signaled early and deepens when Maya interprets dream symbols as evidence of his final act. Pressure tightens via protagonist agency: her analysis narrows options from vague haunting to actionable truth. Cost is unmistakable: she commits to resurfacing painful history, trading anonymity for advocacy. Coincidence complicates (scattered dreams) but resolution stems from her interpretive labor.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—making hidden effort visible—is signaled early and deepens through Chen’s anticipation of the scholar. The meaningful tightening occurs when Chen decides the girl’s worthiness hinges on seeing the whisk’s embedded mathematics, foreclosing easy mentorship. Cost is conceptual: truth remains unseen unless perceived, echoing the daughter’s temple defacement. Agency drives escalation—Chen actively chooses to test, not wait—but the pressure remains internalized, slightly muting external tension expected at elite tier.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. preservation—is signaled early and deepens when Maya learns the Institute caused the liquidation. Pressure escalates causally: shredded documents → Project Stillpoint → catastrophic trade-off. The tightening occurs when Maya realizes destroying the diamond kills the orchard. Cost is unmistakable: saving collective hope requires perpetuating a lie that blames victims. Agency drives escalation—Maya’s choices unearth then conceal the truth.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—interpreting truth amid competing allegiances—is signaled early and tightens when factions militarize around her words. Vera’s agency drives escalation: she broadcasts raw fragments, refuses alignment, and endures being claimed by all. The deepening comes not from external threat but from internal crystallization: “truth shifted like storm clouds.” Cost is felt in her loneliness-turned-burden, though physical stakes remain abstract; still, under an Accumulative lens, this suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving ephemeral meaning—intensifies through protagonist agency: Maren actively layers recordings to restore context, narrowing her path from solitary archivist to communal translator. The deepening (incomplete melody → composite) forecloses isolation with visible cost (exposure to judgment). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves conflict. Coincidental music box discovery complicates but doesn’t solve—Maren’s labor earns the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving harmony without destruction—is signaled early and deepens when Kael reveals the ice’s accumulated pain.

Cost is unmistakable: Kael becomes part of the chorus he sought to free. Pressure tightens coherently under the Accumulative lens, with one decisive deepening (the jagged song) forcing the final trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—freedom through patient revolution—is signaled early and deepened by Kael’s rejection of wildfire revolt. Escalation is driven by her agency: she times the exodus using lunar-magnetic convergence, narrowing options to precise corridors. Cost is unmistakable: emotional suppression, minimal possessions, delayed joy (“not yet”). The Directorate’s blindness to maps as tools of possibility creates coherent antagonistic pressure without needing on-page villains.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—exposing corruption vs. preserving career—is signaled early and tightens when Sara finds proof Marcus was trapped pre-flood. Escalation is driven by her agency: each photograph and notation narrows Chen’s plausible deniability. Cost is visible (professional ruin) and conceptual (truth as liberation). The single meaningful deepening—the timeline contradiction—forces a trade-off that crystallizes her stance under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—redemption through action—is signaled early and tightens when Marcus sees Sarah volunteering, forcing him to confront his inertia. The deepening occurs in his admission: “an apology is just air unless it becomes action.” Agency drives escalation; coincidence (Sarah’s presence) complicates but doesn’t resolve. Cost is felt—his wasted years—but not yet fully paid; Thursday’s delivery looms as the true test.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the algorithm of desire—is signaled early and deepens when the new pattern (“dissolution of boundaries”) emerges, forcing thematic reckoning. Pressure coheres under Accumulative logic: each transliteration tightens the thematic coil, culminating in Fennec’s laughter and acknowledgment of unreadiness. Though no physical reversal occurs, the deepening of insight constitutes meaningful escalation. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: the burden of foresight without audience, borne in solitude on a caustic sea.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering erased astronauts—is signaled early and deepens through discovery of neural backups. Escalation is driven by Mira’s agency: each breadcrumb narrows options until she confronts the ethical imperative to extract. The recurring number 2347 transforms from anomaly to coordinate, raising conceptual stakes. Cost is unmistakable: professional risk, emotional toll, and the burden of becoming sole witness to digital souls in purgatory.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preventing clan war over fishing rights—is signaled early and deepens via Kael’s shadow-glimpses, which narrow options by revealing hidden debts and kindnesses. The tightening occurs when she offers the shard, forcing leaders to feel emotional truths they’d denied. Cost is unmistakable: the risk of renewed violence if they reject empathy, made visceral through trembling hands and the image of fracturing ice. Agency lies entirely with Kael’s method; coincidence plays no role.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—learning “the sound of approaching endings”—tightens when Vera’s transformation reframes her role from passive tourist to active reconnecter. The stranded family escalates pressure, forcing a choice that crystallizes her stance: she helps despite her own scheduled death. Cost is unmistakable in the uncancelled appointment and the grandmother’s song—survival’s joy contrasting her suspended fate. Agency drives deepening: her decision to stay through summer forecloses sterile Nuuk efficiency for uncertain, resonant presence.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—choosing authentic connection over socially sanctioned match—is signaled early via the burned letter and deepens through Marco’s grafting analogy. Pressure tightens when Elena admits familial consensus on Dimitri, forcing her to confront buried truth. Agency lies in Elena’s quiet renunciation (“next bus isn’t until morning”), which forecloses a path with felt cost. Escalation is driven by dialogue-as-action, not coincidence, under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving the walkers’ fading wisdom—is signaled early and deepens into existential urgency (“The alternative is silence”). Escalation occurs through Maya’s demonstration and declaration of consecration, which narrows options to one irreversible path. The cost—permanent fragmentation of self—is not abstract but physically and cognitively specified (“My awareness will become part of the parapet’s memory”). Pressure tightens organically under the Accumulative lens via rising resonance and harmonic convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transmuting collective pain—is signaled early and deepens when Thomas recognizes “everyone’s pain.” Mira’s agency drives escalation: her arrangement forces confrontation, then conversation, then communal decisions. Cost is visible in the donated photos’ raw vulnerability and the foreclosed path of private suffering. One meaningful tightening suffices: the shift from solitary grief to mural planning tightens social stakes without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—defending language’s unfinished nature—is signaled early and tightens through Maren’s deepening understanding of the crystal’s evidence. Agency manifests in her choice to testify despite fear, foreclosing silence with social cost (Council’s likely rejection). Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each decoded fragment intensifies her resolve. Cost is unmistakable in her trembling hands, cramped notes, and the library’s dying light—visible prices that charge the final poise.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—capturing time’s sound—is signaled early and deepens when Sarah’s personal loss (mother’s dementia) braids with Marcus’s quest. The tightening occurs at the arch: Marcus realizes recording kills the sound, forcing renunciation over acquisition. Cost is unmistakable—his future self’s mapped path leads only to ephemeral witness—and agency drives escalation: arranging driftwood, trusting Sarah, choosing silence. Coincidence never resolves; pressure accumulates through character decisions under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—synchronizing the telescope before lunar transit—is signaled early and deepens into a metaphysical conflict: can we capture what moves? Mira’s agency drives escalation; she doesn’t fix the clock but restructures it to measure instability, narrowing options from control to attunement. Cost is unmistakable: she abandons the astronomers’ goal of freezing time, accepting instead that only the ephemeral’s rhythm can be tracked. Pressure tightens coherently under an Accumulative lens, culminating in a Charged Poise where stakes are reconfigured, not resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—executing a “flawless goodbye”—tightens immediately with the three-week deadline. Maya’s agency escalates pressure: seventeen calls, then the eighteenth’s blunt truth forces Linda’s choice. Cost is visible: Richard’s vulnerability (“eyes wet”), Linda’s sacrificed pride (“I’ll come tomorrow”). Coincidence doesn’t resolve; human effort does. The deepening—from silence to shared breath—is earned through recorded “breadcrumb trails.”

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake (reuniting with original self) tightens when Mira recognizes her own case, foreclosing denial. Escalation is driven by her agency: deciphering runes, inserting the key, choosing to sit before her sleeping form. The noon deadline imposes coherent pressure, and the cost—sacrificing her shadow-self’s memories and experiences—is viscerally felt in her trembling hands and translucent self-perception. Coincidence (Bent Constellation alignment) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her choice remains central.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring displaced souls—is signaled early via the substitute body and deepens when Thomas reveals his accidental crossing. Maren’s agency drives escalation: she doesn’t just witness but actively “sets this right” by rearranging bones with medical logic fused to changeling memory. Cost is legible in her shattered certainty (“the chasm”) and the irreversible loss of her old worldview. The tightening occurs when she chooses to believe and act, foreclosing her former skepticism with emotional and epistemological price paid in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (“share light without fire”) tightens through Mara’s polishing ritual, which forecloses forgetting and demands confrontation with memory. The amber shard (mother’s perfume) forces emotional reckoning; the white shard (daughter’s laughter) escalates cost through unbearable specificity. Agency is clear: each polish is a choice to transform rather than flee. Pressure accumulates texturally under the lens, culminating in Charged Poise—Mara’s readiness to receive tomorrow’s wanderers.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—grafting meaning onto wounds—is signaled early and deepens when the architect of Mira’s pain appears. The tightening occurs not through external threat but internal pressure: the executive’s confession forces Mira to choose between vengeance and sanctuary. Mira’s agency lies in renunciation—refusing hatred—and in proffering the pendant, which narrows the emotional path toward mutual recognition. Cost is felt in her admission of past rage and the visible exhaustion of maintaining this fragile space.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether to seek reunion or sanctify fragments—is signaled early and deepens when the stranger reframes “solemnizing” as sacred action. Pressure tightens once: the cameo encounter narrows options from binary resolution to acceptance of incompleteness. Cost is felt in the relinquishment of literal reunion; agency lies in attention, not action. Coincidence complicates (stranger’s arrival) but doesn’t resolve—the insight stems from protagonist’s prior accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—mending spirit-hollow harvests through forgotten songs—is signaled early and tightens via the “final dawn” deadline. Maera’s agency drives escalation: she chooses which tendril to attune, persists despite vocal flaws, accelerates singing as moon fades. Cost is felt (years of study, emotional labor of piecing fragments) but not visibly dramatized as loss; the “hush” deepens, yet no tangible sacrifice (e.g., voice strain, tool breakage) alters tactics. Still, pressure coheres under Accumulative lens with one decisive deepening: the vine’s hum harmonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—retrieving her daughter’s lost pulse—is signaled early and deepens when starlight reveals cosmic entanglement. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: she chooses slow precision over haste, enabling the map’s emergence. Cost is unmistakable: burning the only physical map to awaken the world, trusting memory alone. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of relics and starlight intensifies until ignition.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding the cavern’s acoustic logic—is signaled early and deepens through the locksmith’s methodical visits. Escalation occurs via her agency: widening cracks, testing angles, rebuilding the timer. The cost is conceptual but felt: she chooses solitude over sharing, sealing away marvel. Under an Accumulative lens, each visit tightens the weave of knowledge until the symphony floods back—pressure coheres without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—measuring burden-weights—is signaled early and deepens when the weaver discovers their interconnectedness, foreclosing the possibility of completion. Escalation is driven by her agency: each orientation reveals more complexity, culminating in the ancient fused weight that forces conceptual repricing. Cost is unmistakable: infinite responsibility without resolution, yet she accepts it as purpose. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with one decisive deepening that reweights all prior effort.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—honoring Viktor through carved moments—tightens when the kettle’s boil interrupts work, forcing Mira to choose ritual (tea) over rush, deepening her commitment to slowness as resistance to erasure. Agency drives escalation: each cut subtracts irreversibly, mirroring grief’s irreversible losses. Cost is unmistakable—cold tea, darkening light, solitary labor—and the final Charged Poise makes stakes legible: love demands ongoing creation, not closure. Coincidence never resolves; rain merely amplifies pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming agency over abandoned dreams—tightens when Kera admits, “I collected their stories because I couldn’t bear my own.” The camera wheel’s discovery forces confrontation; her choice to pocket it and reach for the ghost forecloses perpetual scavenging. Cost is felt: she trades grandiosity for achievable scale. Escalation is driven by her agency under Accumulative pressure, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming abandonment into sustenance—is signaled early and tightens through Maya’s engineering choices (e.g., rerouting water, salvaging solar energy). Agency drives escalation: her permits, favors, and volunteer recruitment foreclose passive observation. Cost is visible: labor through autumn, confronting decay’s inertia. Coincidence (carnival’s departure) complicates but doesn’t resolve; victory stems from redirecting existing flows, not external aid.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reconciling with abandoned artistry—is signaled early and deepens when Maren chooses vulnerability over perfection. The tightening occurs in her decision to play *anything* in this sacred silence, risking the sanctuary’s hush and her own shame.

Agency drives escalation—no coincidence resolves her conflict; every turn stems from her choices under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—uncovering why the lie was built—tightens when Marcus shifts from seeking magic to salvaging maps, foreclosing his old identity as legend-seeker. Agency is clear: his training drives each discovery, and the radio’s return signals external pressure resolving only after he secures truth. Cost is felt in Dessen’s buried grief and Marcus’s new burden of knowledge, which alters his purpose permanently.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reviving lost botanical knowledge—is signaled early and deepens when Maren realizes fulgurite can awaken sterile chamomile. The tightening occurs in the knot-decoding sequence, which narrows her path to one precise, risky method. Cost is conceptual but legible: sharing risks exploitation; withholding abandons healing. Agency is clear—she chooses to act, document, and selectively share—but the escalation leans slightly more on discovery than active confrontation, just shy of 9.0+ pressure intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming selfhood from explained absence—is signaled early and deepens when Marina shifts from documenting loss to mapping healing’s geography. The tightening occurs when she reframes Thomas’s tremors as persistent weaving, foreclosing despair with visible cost: he must accept a new loom. Agency is quiet but potent—attention as renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reviving organic beauty in a mechanized world—is signaled early and deepens when the prince admits his creation is “flawed genesis.” Pressure escalates through self-imposed deprivation (forgotten meals, trembling focus) and irreversible loss (his sword, his father’s respect). The cost is unmistakable: the creature can never experience true wildness, yet its song makes the sacrifice resonant. One meaningful tightening occurs at the pinhole drilling—a point of no return that forecloses pure restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—transforming inherited trauma into generative care—is signaled early and deepens through Maya’s agency: she chooses to graft, to thread coins, to bring Marcus. The meaningful tightening occurs when Marcus admits remembering his mother hurts; Maya reframes pain as song, narrowing options to active reconfiguration. Cost is unmistakable: Maya bears the burden of her father’s legacy without absolution. Escalation is driven by protagonist decisions under an Accumulative lens, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—liberating trapped emotions—is signaled early and tightens through protagonist agency: each breadcrumb placement narrows options until only sidereal patience remains. Escalation is driven by Mara’s deliberate choices under Accumulative pressure, not coincidence. Cost is unmistakable: her glow fades as memories return, marking personal sacrifice. The “defiant hush” crystallizes stakes without melodrama, and the final act forecloses her luminous identity with quiet finality.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving non-destructive light—is signaled early and deepens when the gear confirms cyclical failure. The tightening occurs when the Keeper selects six new civilizations despite knowing the outcome, narrowing options to ritualized hope. Agency is clear: they choose to act, not because success is likely, but because cessation would violate their core identity. Cost is unmistakable—the grief of “hope”—and pressure accumulates texturally through repeated historical echoes (Architects, Choir Collective) that sharpen the inevitability without resolving it.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding grief’s communal shape—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist-driven choices: Elena initiates each return, recites poems, examines the ribbon. The meaningful tightening occurs when she reinterprets past carvings as failures of connection, foreclosing her old method with visible cost (thirty years of solitary monuments). Escalation follows the Accumulative lens: density increases via butterfly arrivals, poetic exchanges, and tactile exploration of the ribbon. Coincidence never resolves; all insight stems from Elena’s attention and action.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—restoring balance between living and drowned—is signaled early and deepens through Mara’s ritual. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: she chooses the pause, presses the handle, enables names to transfer. Cost is unmistakable: inherited grief, isolation, the weight of 200-pound brass and hundreds of dead. The tightening comes not from external threat but internal obligation crystallizing under tidal pressure, fitting the Accumulative lens perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering Castellan’s hidden truth—is signaled early and deepens when frayed threads yield coordinates. Escalation is driven by Mira’s agency: she fetches magnifying glass, untangles systematically, examines floorboards. Cost is felt: hours pass, stars wheel, solitude intensifies. The tightening occurs at “Beneath silo”—a live option foreclosed only by her labor. Coincidence (lawyer delivering case) complicates but doesn’t resolve; decoding is earned through persistent attention.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—survival within dwindling resources—is signaled early and deepens through each future’s trade-offs. Maren’s agency drives escalation: she doesn’t just list paths but weighs hidden costs (innovation death, environmental collapse). The tightening occurs at Future Three, where limitation “forced elegance.” Cost is unmistakable: her labor through the night, the risk of being ignored, the burden of making the invisible visible.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—narrative survival—is signaled early and escalates when the patrol nearly discovers Maren. Her agency drives deepening: she chooses to embed the broadcast despite danger, narrowing options (radio must stay hidden). Cost is unmistakable: constant fear, isolation, and the ever-present threat of execution. The tightening isn’t reversal but accumulation—each copied note increases peril while advancing resistance, perfectly aligned with the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.2)
    The dominant stake—reconciling art’s impermanence with human longing for permanence—tightens as Cassius nears death, forcing Mira to choose between truth and mercy. Her agency drives escalation: she draws, burns, and rebuilds according to her hidden code, not external forces. The cost is legible in her soot-stained hands and secret archive—a lifetime of solitary grief masked as ritual. Coincidence plays no role; pressure accumulates through the chair’s slowing rhythm and fading light, deepening the moral weight of each stroke.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. sanctioned forgetting—is signaled early and escalates through Marcellus’s agency: excavating, cross-referencing, sealing evidence. The patrol’s appearance forces stillness, a tactical shift that heightens risk. Cost is unmistakable: social erasure (“worse than sewer rat”) and existential threat (“philosopher’s death”). Escalation is driven by his choices under Accumulative pressure, not coincidence, with each layer of ruin deepening the epistemological conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—harmony across inherited divisions—is signaled early and tightens through weekly attrition and vocal braiding. Mira’s agency drives escalation: her method forces students to confront silence before sound, narrowing options from suspicion to tentative trust. Cost is felt in departures and the weight of history (“accents still carried distant mountains”), though the pressure remains situational rather than intensely causal. Coincidence never resolves; change stems from sustained attention.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—cultivating forbidden memory—is signaled early and deepens when pruning becomes moral triage. Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency: she chooses which memories to nourish or excise, narrowing options with each cut. Cost is unmistakable: the bitterness of lost orchards, the weight of rebellion in solitude. The celestial alignment tightens the clock, making her choices urgent yet deliberate under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring pollination—is signaled early and deepens when revealed as a crisis of philosophy, not code. Pressure escalates causally: blackout → drone failure → riddle → pollen revelation → modified flight. Mira’s agency drives the turn; the old woman complicates but doesn’t resolve. Cost is visible: lost time, ecological silence, and the engineers’ futile coding. The tightening—replacing algorithmic precision with “messy miracle”—forecloses a path of sterile optimization, though the emotional toll on Mira could be sharper in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding why houses feel alive—is signaled early and deepens when Maya realizes the house is “teaching itself to remember.” The tightening occurs in the kitchen: objects aren’t moved randomly but map 1923 placements, forcing Maya to shift from observer to participant. Cost is felt in her relinquished detachment (“no longer an observer but a witness”) and future commitment. Escalation is driven by her agency (entering, interpreting, placing the root), though the house’s sentience borders on coincidence—yet it’s earned through consistent textual cues (“windows watched her”).

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. comforting myth—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: she chooses to open the ampoule despite anguish. Pressure escalates causally (founders’ choice → plague context → voluntary transformation), narrowing options from denial to stewardship. Cost is unmistakable: her ancestral narrative shatters, replaced by burdensome guardianship. The moral calculus (“competing goods”) sharpens the climax without coincidence resolving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.3)
    The dominant stake—proving perpetual motion to reclaim lost opportunity—is signaled early and deepens when Elena realizes *she* is the system’s energy. This crystallization narrows all options: escape would break conservation, which the staircase forbids. The cost is legible in her laughter and continued climbing—agency becomes endurance with visible emotional toll. Pressure escalates through her own methodology (dice rolls, proofs), not coincidence, and culminates in a Charged Poise where stakes and impossibility are made undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—proving kindness persists—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s act of painting as resistance. Pressure escalates not through external conflict but internal exhaustion and the weight of memory, culminating in a Charged Poise: she commits to finding the donor, accepting vulnerability after months of solitary witness. Cost is felt in her forty-seven-hour wakefulness and abandoned linguistics career. Agency drives escalation—her brushwork summons the vision that reconfigures her mission.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving cultural continuity amid erasure—is signaled early and deepens when the violinist recognizes the bread custom, transforming abstract mission into reciprocal healing. Celeste’s agency drives escalation: her invitation forecloses isolation, demanding vulnerability. Cost is felt in the grandmother’s faded script and the refugees’ unfinished sentences. Pressure tightens once, decisively, through shared memory rather than external threat.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming unlived time—is signaled early and tightens when Silas learns the hunger stone’s people “expended their latent radiance.” The deepening (discovering compressed moments in the axle) forces a trade-off: activate the yoyo or remain passive. Agency drives escalation: his modifications and wrist-snap cause the climax. Cost is unmistakable: his life’s design unravels, foreclosing his former existence. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from his choices under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—freedom vs. erasure—is signaled early (“distorted, blurred at the edges”) and tightens when Vera chooses to “unbosom” herself, narrowing options from hiding to active dissolution. Escalation is driven by her agency: each confession deepens her indistinctness, raising the cost of permanence. The advisor’s paradoxes complicate but don’t resolve; Vera’s final act crystallizes stance under coherent pressure. Felt cost: she abandons the desire to be seen, embracing fluidity as survival.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—orchard survival through harmonic attunement—is signaled early and tightens when clouds fracture into recursive warnings. Kael’s agency drives escalation: she doesn’t wait but actively maps, names (“Mercy,” “Hold”), and plays the structure. The cost is physical exhaustion and the constant risk of misinterpretation; her victory requires three hours of relentless, precise labor. Pressure coheres entirely under Accumulative/Textural logic—density of pattern recognition reweights survival itself.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—truth versus enforced ignorance—tightens decisively when Mira discovers the gate was welded shut, not rusted. Her agency drives escalation: playing the whistle cracks shells, reveals maps, uncovers betrayal. The cost is felt in the desiccated spiral of the dead expedition and crystallized in the final act—asking the question that halts the city. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens: each fracture adds data until knowledge becomes unavoidable.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving interlaced absence—is signaled early and deepens when Garrett chooses to embed personal and communal memory into structural repair. His agency lies in attention and ritual; the meaningful tightening occurs at the column fissure, where he wrestles the note into stone, trading private grief for public legacy. Cost is legible: he accepts invisibility (“part of him would remain here”) and the uncertainty of future discovery. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with each measurement functioning as elegy.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the truth behind the city’s flooding—is signaled early and tightens when Marcus finds the portfolio. Agency drives escalation: his “alternative hypothesis” leads him to the archive, and his readjustment under threat sharpens urgency. Cost is felt (risk of capture, emotional burden), though the security footsteps verge on convenient complication. Still, pressure coheres under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—making grief bearable through craft—is signaled early and deepens when paper fails, forcing Mira to invent dream-recording lanterns. Escalation is driven by her agency: each polished gem narrows options (no return to simple origami) and raises cost (physical labor, emotional exposure). The basilica’s “descends while ascending” paradox crystallizes the core tension: sinking into memory while climbing toward survival. Cost is unmistakable in the thousand-night toll and the final acceptance that her daughter’s shadow now inhabits crafted light, not flesh—a trade-off with irreversible emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—finding where unused potential pools—is signaled early and deepens into triggering its eruption. Amal’s agency drives escalation: she recalibrates instruments, adjusts the geode, chooses revelation over safety. The cost is unmistakable: isolation, system collapse, and unleashing a potentially devastating awakening. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens—each layer of lost futures intensifies the quantum echo until critical mass forces a stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding belonging through resonance—is signaled early and deepens when the chip reveals coordinates, narrowing options to active transmission. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she scans, launches, interprets, and finally programs a return signal. Cost is felt: her isolation gives way to vulnerability (“tears surprising her eyes”) and commitment to an unseen network. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, though the pilgrim’s arrival edges toward convenience; however, it serves thematic necessity without resolving conflict mechanically.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth versus protective lies—is signaled early and tightens when Clara demands the real story. Maren’s agency drives escalation: her initial refusal, then search, then confession narrow options with visible cost (her self-deception collapses). The grandfather’s carvings deepen stakes by complicating the villainy Iris wanted buried. Cost is unmistakable: Maren sacrifices her professional armor and faces the daughter she misled.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—peace through truth—is signaled early and deepens when both admit hidden failures, narrowing options from vague diplomacy to risky transparency. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: Mara’s reveal of the misread coordinates forces Chen’s admission, raising personal and political cost. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens, with the moon-phase method embodying the story’s core tension between human impatience and natural rhythm. Cost is unmistakable: both must now defy their governments.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (aligning heart with action) tightens decisively when James’ text arrives, forcing Marina to choose between perpetual regret or risking the crossing. The "backlash of regrets" isn’t abstract—it manifests as physical pressure ("wave of all the mornings...") that clarifies rather than crushes, driving her agency. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits the safety of shore, accepting that hesitation means failure ("pushed back").

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming moral agency after erasure—is signaled early and tightens when Maya chooses to descend rather than report the artifact. Escalation is driven by her agency: decoding ads, driving north, entering the cave. Cost is unmistakable: she trades amnesiac peace for lifelong burden (“dedicate her remaining years”). Pressure coheres under Causal lens; coincidence (the baseball) complicates but doesn’t resolve—she must act.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reforging a bond beyond death—is signaled early and tightens when Mira resists transformation, forcing a trade-off: remain human or become a bridge. Escalation is driven by her agency (conjuring via spices), not coincidence. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits her “solid form” permanently. The phoenix’s rise sets a live clock, but pressure stems from internal reluctance, consistent with the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost maternal time—is signaled early and deepens when Nadia realizes recovery is impossible, only future presence is actionable. The meaningful tightening occurs when the cloth reveals the gap: options narrow from retrieval to reparation. Agency drives escalation—her cloudbound ascent, card-scattering, cloth placement—and the cost (irreversible absence) is unmistakable in the final descent. Coincidence never resolves; insight emerges from ritual under self-imposed pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—whether to bear witness or intervene—intensifies through Ren’s stitching, which narrows options: each thread binds them closer to the lost, raising the cost of retreat. The deepening occurs when joy lifts them off the floor, forcing adaptation (“they had learned to use it”). Agency drives escalation: Ren chooses shadow work over escape, stitches grief into bridge, and confronts the dimension with pacifist resolve. Cost is unmistakable—bodily dissolution for communion—and the locked dimension’s resistance ensures stakes remain visceral, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding transformation’s texture—is signaled early and deepens when the old woman equates loss with creation. The meaningful tightening occurs when Maris releases the bugs, a renunciation that forecloses her role as collector and accepts her new function as conduit. Though coincidence brings her here, agency drives the climax: she chooses release. Cost is felt—not in material terms, but in the irreversible surrender of her last curated possession, aligning with the Accumulative lens’s demand for reweighting over causality.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (freeing prisoners before sealing) tightens via the blackout—a protagonist-driven escalation that narrows options to a 72-hour window. Pressure coheres under Causal lens: each beat (sundial decoding, message exchange) compounds toward irreversible action. Cost is unmistakable (“two dozen prisoners,” Mira’s exposure), and agency drives every turn—luck complicates (Voss’s patrol) but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—deciphering sacred patterns to fulfill her sister’s promise—is signaled early and tightens via the curse’s intensifying visions, which nearly cost her the rocks. Agency drives escalation: Kaela chooses to persist despite faulty foresight, and her final insight (“harness what comes next”) emerges from her own placement of sequences. Cost is felt in lost time, near-disaster, and the haunting “too late” vision.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—making hidden trauma visible—is signaled early and tightens when the envelope reveals state violence, raising personal risk. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to develop the negatives despite knowing censorship stems from fear of her “cartography.” Cost is unmistakable: her life is now in danger, yet she proceeds. The storm’s “masks slip” timeframe forces the decisive act, narrowing options to witness or hide.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—intellectual freedom vs. state control—is signaled by the edict and deepened when Theodora reveals the sundial cipher. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her multitasking disarms Venn physically and ideologically. The tightening occurs when amnesty is offered, raising stakes from personal duel to citywide colloquium. Cost is unmistakable: if rejected, the underground is exposed; if accepted, the council surrenders control of discourse.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—forging beauty from anarchy—tightens decisively when Solomon empties letters into soil, trading secret history for communal growth. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to reveal the false bottom, planting with Marcus, posting the sign. Cost is legible in lost anonymity (shedding names) and buried correspondence, altering tactics from solitary performance to shared stewardship. Coincidence (parole approval) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the work is theirs alone.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—visibility versus artistic integrity—tightens decisively when Marcus chooses to play his hidden composition in the arbor, trading potential obscurity for self-honesty. Protagonist agency drives escalation: threading the reel, walking through light, selecting his own music. Cost is unmistakable—the arbor’s ephemerality means this refuge vanishes at sunset, making his choice irreversible. Coincidence (mother’s note) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Marcus’s strategic creativity enables the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving specific cultural memory against generic erasure—is signaled early and tightens when Mira witnesses gray mist consuming details in the dream-space. Her agency drives escalation: interpreting dreams reveals the crisis, then planting the seed becomes the only countermeasure. Cost is unmistakable: years of vigilance with no guarantee, framed by monsoon’s approach. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens—density of lost details (honey/cardamom, name Kael) reweights what’s at stake.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reconciling abandonment with love—is signaled early and deepens when Marisol realizes her mother was sailing home. The tightening occurs in her memory recall (“I turned away”), which forecloses the fantasy of blame and forces ownership. Cost is felt: she must forgive not just her mother but herself. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (compass washing ashore) complicates but doesn’t resolve.
