  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether to destroy the ledger or use it to prevent further poisoning—is signaled early and tightens when Marina realizes the glow was radiation. Her decision to warn the remaining suppliers is a clear choice with visible cost: she forfeits her old life and the insurance payout, accepting presumed death. The escalation is causal (ledger revelation narrows options) and the final walk into the canyon forecloses return. Pressure coheres under the Causal lens; coincidence does not resolve. One meaningful tightening (uranium discovery) alters tactics and stakes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—translating plant communication into thermal notation—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the night's documentation work, with one meaningful deepening when she realizes "music existed beyond sound." The tightening is more epistemological than strategic; no live option is foreclosed with visible tactical cost. Agency reads as attention and documentation rather than a decision between competing paths. The conceptual cost (understanding her deafness as gain rather than loss) is legible but the escalation mechanism relies on discovery rather than choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—giving rest to the Sleepless Librarians and achieving his own—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Pressure is more accumulative than escalating; Silas encounters no meaningful opposition, and the transformation unfolds as cooperative labor ("months, or perhaps minutes") without a visible tightening or trade-off. The closure reconfigures his existence, but the cost (leaving his mortuary, forsaking the living) is told in summary rather than tested in scene, reducing escalation clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—building intergenerational mutual aid under sanctions—is signaled early and deepens through the accreting participation pattern (week four basket, teenagers tending gardens, shadows emerging at the bell). The piece delivers one meaningful tightening: the shift from Marta's solo effort to communal ownership, culminating in the officials' bafflement and the community's unified silence. Agency is distributed but coherent; the ending reweights communal dignity versus external aid. No single protagonist decision narrows options sharply, yet the accumulative pressure forecloses individualist rescue and earns the final council formation with conceptual cost (Marta's anonymity sustained).

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: finding the repository of unused love. One tightening occurs when Mae learns she must contribute rather than extract, narrowing her options. However, escalation is largely external and instructional—the ghost directs, Mae complies—rather than driven by Mae's agency under pressure. The photographs' dissolution represents a cost, but it unfolds without visible resistance or trade-off that would test her commitment. Coincidence (the past-life memory, the convenient vial) complicates setup but the resolution follows mystical instruction more than protagonist choice.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—understanding time's texture—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The story offers contemplative deepening rather than escalating pressure; no live option narrows, no tactic shifts under constraint. The fragment's disintegration provides a visual turn but not one driven by Elara's agency or a forced trade-off. The resolution (she "finally felt time's texture") asserts understanding without demonstrating what concrete path was foreclosed or what visible price she paid.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: liberate seeds to counter the Drought Authority. One tightening (chain snaps after filing) but the escalation is mechanical rather than driven by protagonist agency under pressure—the arrow arrives by external gift, the piano code is passively decoded, the chain breaks when worked. No on-page reversal or moment where Marcus must choose between competing goods; the path from captivity to liberation is linear. Cost is deferred (he will plant seeds) rather than paid in the closure beat. The Authority is declared but never dramatized as immediate opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—finding the frequency of betrayal/trust breaking—is signaled early and sustained. The piece follows an Accumulative lens: pressure builds through metaphoric density (cells dividing, absence collection, roots releasing soil) rather than plot reversals. The forge work provides one meaningful deepening that narrows options and produces the final auditory revelation. However, the escalation is more textural than agency-driven; Elena's choices during the imprinting process are described but not dramatized as live decisions with visible tradeoffs. The cost is felt emotionally but remains conceptual rather than materially legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—revealing hidden truth beneath golden-hour beauty—is signaled early and developed through the portrait analysis beat. The mother's need for closure provides emotional pressure. However, the escalation is gentle: no reversal tightens options, and the resolution arrives without visible sacrifice or trade-off on Cassia's part. The conceptual stakes (beauty vs. truth) deepen but do not narrow choices or force a costly decision.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—creating safe containers for questions about living in disaster's shadow—is signaled early and tightens when the couple arrives, forcing Marina to articulate her purpose under direct human pressure. Her response narrows the abstract goal into immediate action (handing them a sphere, offering paper). The three-year gap and abandoned studio provide backstory cost, but the on-page price at closure is muted: the couple's compliance feels convenient rather than testing Marina's installation with genuine resistance or complication that would raise visible stakes in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—Marcus discovering his synthetic nature and confronting his creator—is signaled early, and pressure escalates when Jake appears as handler rather than actor. One meaningful tightening occurs: the shell halves must touch, and Marcus has preemptively reversed their resonance. Yet the escalation hinges on off-page decryption, and Jake's collapse feels engineered by plot rather than forced by Marcus's lived vulnerability. The resolution's cost is unclear: Marcus returns to his stunt-double life "still afraid," but we don't see what he loses by letting Jake suffer or what path he forecloses. Agency exists but arrives pre-packaged rather than forged under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—completing the map of endless night—is signaled early and sustained. However, the oracle's realization that "the star would not die tonight" functions as an intellectual insight rather than a turn driven by her agency or a choice that narrows options. The piece deepens through accumulation (repeated observation, measured decline), but escalation is gentle: no live cost or trade-off forces the final stance. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but does not tighten into a high-stakes choice with felt consequence on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—finding where thoughts originate—is signaled early and pursued on the page. The temporal-perception module introduces a meaningful complication (seventeen simultaneous timelines), and Seven's touch of the violin triggers the realization. However, the escalation reads more as intellectual accumulation than a choice under pressure that narrows options. The "cost" is oblique: Seven gains understanding and continues mopping, but no live option is visibly foreclosed. Under the Accumulative lens one deepening suffices, yet the price lacks the felt weight that would enter high 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—thawing mistrust—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when both confessions converge and Marcus's own confession removes the audit shadow, narrowing their protective architectures into transparency with visible relational cost (months of silence, elaborate misdirection now unmade). Agency is present in Mira's choice to meet and confess; Samuel's protection is told but still shifts options. Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens without requiring reversal. Cost is legible but quiet—foreclosed deception, nascent trust—and could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: proving that gardens know their gardeners, signaled early through Marta's interactions with plants and sustained across multiple beats (jasmine, rose, inspector, young woman). The tightening occurs when Marta extends her practice to another person, narrowing her collection by one marble and shifting from solitary defiance to transmission. The cost is visible—she gives away her newest, sharpest marble—but the escalation is more additive (listing past victories) than a single decisive pressure point that forces a harder trade-off. The young woman's skepticism provides mild opposition but does not meaningfully test Marta's commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—proving time moves sideways—is signaled early but never faces genuine opposition or cost. Ira pulls the lever further, the station shudders, Vasquez protests, yet Ira continues without trade-off or consequence. The "unexpected resonance" complicates but does not escalate pressure into a choice that forecloses options. Closure reconfigures meaning conceptually but lacks visible on-page price that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—completing Elisabetta's interrupted composition—is signaled clearly and drives Marcus's nightly returns. The progression from discovery to transcription to performance provides escalation. However, the tightening lacks felt cost: Marcus's isolation from others is mentioned but not tested, and the final performance resolves smoothly without trade-offs. The water reaching his chest suggests physical risk, but the "perfectly dry" ending erases that price. One meaningful deepening occurs when Marcus realizes she needs completion, not remembrance, but the execution feels more like permission than genuine narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake signaled early: Mira must understand the truth that lodged in her during fever. Pressure tightens when she discovers the pattern of hidden illustrations, then escalates when the aurora descends and she sees the impossible flowers bloom. Her agency drives the turn: she chooses to draw, to smudge, to protect. The final choice forecloses a path with visible cost—she'll file a false report and accept marginality rather than expose what can't survive scrutiny. Under the Accumulative lens, the cadence shift from observation to documentation to protection deepens the stake meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (Marcus's need to understand why he came here) is signaled early and tightens when the radio confession reveals the valve wheel's theft. Escalation operates accumulatively: fragments cohere into a chorus, then a named object, then a physical discovery that forces stance crystallization. Agency is renunciation with on-page cost: Marcus photographs rather than removes, carrying the weight forward. The psychic's final line—"Some confessions aren't meant to be absolved. They're meant to be witnessed"—articulates but does not resolve the pressure; Marcus must enact the principle.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"to witness change without judgment"—is signaled early but never tested by genuine opposition or consequence. The explorers' questions offer a potential pressure point, yet she deflects them without cost; their confusion does not alter her tactics or foreclose any path. No meaningful tightening narrows options: she folds, unfolds, sits, watches across untold seasons with no on-page reversal or trade-off. Agency reads as endurance, but the ending does not dramatize what was renounced or what price was paid to sustain her silence.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—returning the curl as an act of passing wonder to the next generation—is clear and signaled early. The eclipse countdown provides external pressure, but escalation is atmospheric rather than driven by protagonist agency narrowing options. No mid-story reversal or tightening choice forces Elena to trade off competing goods; the ritual proceeds as planned. The cost at closure is conceptual (the curl is gone, the legacy transferred) but not viscerally felt as a foreclosure of alternate paths.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake is clear: Thrain must understand why she remains and what she tends. The accumulative lens allows density increase as sufficient escalation; each discovery (tapestry, diary, drawing, wall-whispers) deepens understanding and the cost crystallizes in her recognition that she will wait alone through vast cycles. However, the story lacks a moment where options narrow or a visible trade-off occurs. The protagonist's agency is primarily receptive (she "understood," "could feel") rather than decisional, and no live path is foreclosed on the page. Band guardrail: entering 8.0+ typically requires that tightening forecloses a live option; here the tightening is epistemological without clear sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Chen orchestrating his own disappearance—is signaled mid-story ("Tonight, Chen orchestrated something different") rather than early. Escalation occurs through his arrangement of fortunes, but the peak action (walking toward the lighthouse) lacks a visible trade-off or narrow choice on the page. The Bulgarian's defection and other outcomes are effects of Chen's orchestration, yet none force Chen himself into a decision with legible cost. Agency is present but the final move feels pre-determined rather than wrestled from competing options.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: free the woman before possession completes. Marcus's agency drives escalation under the Accumulative lens: he layers loops, finds resonant frequencies, builds verbal architecture. One meaningful tightening when he names the demon's hollow core and the possession unravels. Cost is conceptual (the woman must now examine her assumptions) and visible in her gasp and first independent breath. However, the seventeen-minute clock is never felt on the page—no ticking urgency, no mid-scene adjustment when time narrows—so the timeframe stake dissolves into ornament. The demon offers no tactical resistance; it simply dissolves when illuminated, reducing friction.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Mei seeks to conduct the unheard symphonies she's always heard. Pressure accumulates via time constraint ("before exhaustion hits"), yet no on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off. The final conducting gesture feels predetermined rather than won through agency or renunciation. The cost of "becoming"—what she gives up, what path she forecloses—remains abstract, not dramatized in action or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—conquer/integrate the labyrinth of self—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the procedural generation "stuttered, cycling through millions…Kira felt herself fragmenting further," raising visceral cost. The elder-Kira confrontation deepens pressure ("refusing to choose murders you across all of them"), but the resolution lacks a visible trade-off: pressing the rune collapses timelines without showing what versions of herself she's killing or what she's renouncing. Agency is present (the rune press) but the cost remains told more than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness—is signaled early and remains coherent. The accumulative lens requires one meaningful deepening: reversed music → bone-felt vibration → thawing → understanding. This progression narrows her emotional options from frozen to feeling. However, no on-page reversal or complication tests her commitment. The phonograph works as hoped, the cavern cooperates, and the thawing proceeds unimpeded. The resolution is transformation without visible trade-off or renunciation; no live option is foreclosed, no concrete cost paid. Agency is present but unopposed.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to continue passive observation or engage actively with the rogue zone—is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful reversal: the message revealing that her data is being used for organized resistance. Elena's agency drives the escalation (her decision to create redundant records and reply), and the cost is visible in her shift from solitary integrity to collaborative risk. The follower sequence establishes prior pressure, and the storm patterns provide causal urgency. Weakness: the conflict remains largely internal and epistolary; a second on-page complication (e.g., the follower's return or an authority's inquiry) would have provided additional escalation and raised the stakes of her reply.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding time's texture—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or escalating cost. Marcus encounters no resistance; the energy beings simply comply with his commands. No meaningful tightening or trade-off occurs; he walks away having learned everything he sought with no visible sacrifice. The revelations about the Reeves family are ornamental, not integrated into Marcus's own pressure or agency.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—transforming silence into new music—is signaled early and tightens when Mara hears "not an echo, but a harmonic born from the collision of her note with the greenhouse's peculiar architecture." The arrival of other musicians deepens pressure without forced reversals, consistent with the Accumulative lens. Agency is clear: Mara's decision to play slowly and let notes "find their partners" alters tactics and forecloses the old polished performance. Visible cost: the rainforest is gone, Echo Harbor's former music cannot return. The piece meets the 8.0+ gate (tightening forecloses a live option), but lacks an explicit trade-off moment that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—harvest emotions before the grotto seals—is clear and urgent. The transformation clock tightens ("perhaps another minute") and Vera must align the petal with her heartbeat to "fuse insight with empathy," a deepening that narrows her task. Yet the peak moment ("to understand not just what emotions to harvest, but which ones would truly serve her clients' needs") is a cognitive shift, not an on-page action with visible cost. The temptation to "subsume these emotions herself" is raised but never pressed; she simply declines without struggle. The widower's need is introduced late as a justification rather than a live complication. Escalation is present but the cost is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—honoring the unacknowledged work of silent contributors—is signaled early and shapes Margot's plan. One clear turn: the decision to deliver the locket personally rather than forward it. Yet the middle unfolds through cooperation and shared emotion without competing pressures; Martha's tears and Margot's reassurance feel inevitable rather than hard-won. The ending reconfigures Margot's role from observer to participant, but the shift lacks a visible tradeoff or renounced alternative in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake—Kira grafting herself onto the community—is signaled early, but escalation occurs entirely in the village's warming acceptance (silent watchers → children gather → neighbors share theories) without a single on-page moment where Kira's agency narrows her options or pays a visible price. The search for the artist unfolds as communal ritual in summary; the discovery at the crater's bottom is geographic coincidence, not a turn driven by Kira's prior choices. The ending grants belonging and completes the arbor without dramatizing what Kira or the artist renounced to earn it, leaving pressure asserted rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (find and free the trapped echoes) is signaled early and tightens when Marina discovers the stolen-time chamber. The agency is hers: diving through the gap and completing the illustrations are decisions that foreclose the city's time-sculpture system. One meaningful reversal—realization that time comes not from dreams but from stolen extinctions—narrows options and raises cost. The time-sculptors' loss and Morteus's premature waking are visible prices.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake (understanding Elias's disappearance via the mosaic and glass eyes) is signaled early and sustained. One tightening occurs when the eyes are placed and the fungi reveal Elias as an equation. Yet escalation is minimal: Morrow encounters no obstacle, makes no trade-off, and faces no competing pressure. The resolution is delivered to her rather than earned by a difficult choice. Coincidence provides the solution (the eyes fit the chips exactly) without Morrow's agency narrowing options or paying a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—Edgar's need to preserve the building's autobiography while remaining hidden—is signaled early and tightens when the archivist's matching rescue operation is revealed. The power outage complicates (he must act more visibly by lowering the light), and her direct address "I know you're there" narrows his options with visible cost: he can no longer sustain the ghost illusion. Agency is clear: his decision to leave the fragments tomorrow forecloses the path of pure isolation. One strong reversal—learning she's been conducting the same operation—reweights his entire thirty-seven-year pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus will accept transformation to truly understand the plants—is signaled early and tightens through embodied markers (greenish nails, root lines) that narrow his options. One meaningful deepening occurs when the leaf begins merging and he chooses not to resist. However, the escalation relies more on accumulation of atmospheric detail than protagonist agency under pressure; Marcus's decision feels passive ("didn't pull away") rather than a forced trade-off with visible cost. The renunciation of control is thematically clear but could land with sharper on-page consequence at the pivot moment.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (pure water to paint truth) is signaled early and tightens when Mara tastes the water and commits to paint the stranger's daughter. The exchange itself is the single meaningful turn that narrows options—both women forfeit irreplaceable heirlooms with visible cost ("Bury it with her" / water consumed in painting). Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through the convergence of griefs and the causeway's vanishing window. Agency is clear: Mara's choice to open the jar and taste it forecloses other uses and crystallizes her new purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake (recovering/transforming her lost foresight) is signaled early and maintained throughout. However, escalation relies on exposition rather than narrowing options—the shadow-presence explains rather than forcing Vera to choose between competing goods. No visible trade-off or foreclosed path: she emerges with enhanced rather than altered vision, gaining the present without sacrificing future-sight. The accumulative lens justifies the deepening understanding, but the lack of agency (she's tutored, not tested) and absent cost keeps pressure declarative rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—compiling fragments into coherent meaning after exile—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation reads as accretion rather than tightening: the archive simply grows through "accumulated patience" without a moment where Kessa's method is tested or a trade-off forces her to choose between competing goods. The anniversary opening is narratively convenient rather than driven by protagonist agency. The valve's transition from seized to manually operable offers a small reversal but one discovered rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—"to find the fortress of unspoken truths"—is signaled early and pursued across beats. The crack-arrows create a coherent pressure sequence: discovery, dare, following, mist-wall, vault. However, escalation remains exploratory rather than costly; each arrow simply leads to the next without narrowing options or forcing trade-offs. The final act ("walked backward along the arrows") is a decision to return rather than a choice that forecloses a path. No on-page price is visible: her analytical training "screamed protests" but she sketches "with the devotion of a medieval monk" without consequence, and the ending promises iterative visits rather than a singular transformation or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—Elena reconciling empiricism with her grandmother's mysticism—is signaled early and accumulates through the tile discovery and transcription. Pressure deepens as the whale songs match the tile's symbols, forcing Elena to question her skepticism. However, escalation is textural rather than causal; no reversal or tightening choice narrows options with visible cost. Elena's agency is passive observation and recording rather than a decision that forecloses a path. The resolution ("should have been integrating it") is told rather than dramatized as a choice under pressure, and no credible loss or trade-off alters her tactics or charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake (Vex seeking true death) is signaled early, but pressure never tightens—the crew arrives, offers the fragments, and the door opens without complication or cost. No reversal or deepening occurs; Thorne's request and Vex's acceptance are frictionless. The "spatial mutiny" as revolutionary action evaporates; they simply walk through a door that grants their wish. The ending forecloses no live option Vex valued (she's been bored for millennia), so the cost required for high-band entry is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (acknowledgment of debt versus revenge) is signaled early and tightens when Maya reveals the envelope, narrowing Wei's options. One meaningful reversal: Wei's rage liquefies into confusion, then acceptance. Agency is clear—Maya's preparation of the body and offer of restitution drive the turn. The cost is legible: Wei takes money and pot but must abandon inherited rage; Maya buries her father with his sins itemized. Escalation is smooth but relies heavily on exposition (the seventeen families, compound interest) rather than additional dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—collecting "textures of different times"—is signaled early but never tested. The stationer encounters no obstacle, makes no tactical adjustment, and faces no competing pressure. The monk's appearance is observed, not responded to. The lamp hum shifting and dawn approaching feel like scheduled events rather than escalations that narrow her options or force a trade-off. No visible cost accompanies the closure; she simply closes her notepad and plans to return.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—finding meaning in erased existence—is signaled early and deepens when Mari discovers the congregation's annotations. However, escalation reads as accumulative density rather than a choice that narrows options or forecloses a path with on-page cost. The spring-tide discovery and the act of signing are pivotal beats, but Mari's agency remains observational and symbolic; she doesn't face a live trade-off or renunciation that alters her tactics. The final signing carries conceptual weight (committing to witness-role) yet lacks the dramatic pressure of a difficult choice made under conflicting pulls. Pressure coheres but does not meaningfully tighten through protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding Tern's ephemeral compass—is signaled early. Escalation under the accumulative lens reads as density increase: shell hum → cello response → Claudia's explanation → shared positioning of shell. Yet no on-page tightening forecloses an option or imposes visible cost. Marina's shift from myth-buster to collaborator involves no trade-off, lost alternative, or tactical price. The resonance moment is evocative but does not narrow choices or demonstrate consequence, leaving pressure diffuse rather than compounding toward a decisive reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: survival of the free-floating community before privatization. Pressure escalates cleanly: graffiti warning → developers' sleek boats → Maya's call to reorganize → legal incorporation as shield. One meaningful tightening when developers photograph the chaos, narrowing options. Agency lands in Maya's plan and the artists' immediate mural work. Cost is visible (documenting traditions, legal framework encoded in art) but the ending's assertion that laws "protected" the lights and "still free" undercuts the trade-off; we don't see what was surrendered to become "something unbreakable."

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake signaled early: document the final ice sublimation before evacuation. One meaningful tightening occurs when Vera recognizes she's photographing "humanity's first retreat," reweighting her scientific mission as historical witness. The chemical timer and fourteen-hour countdown create coherent pressure under the Accumulative lens. Agency is clear: Vera's decision to complete the vigil and leave the hourglass forecloses her presence on Luna with visible cost (departure, isolation's end). The ice pocket's exhaustion provides organic escalation, though the external conflict (budget committees, evacuation) remains largely off-stage and summarized rather than dramatized in present tension.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—repair the drone before the Meridian's anchor lifts—is signaled early. However, no meaningful obstacle emerges; Maya identifies the fracture, extracts the filament, applies the patch, and succeeds. The loudspeaker's "twenty minutes" announcement creates urgency in telling but her hands simply "moved faster...but never frantically," erasing the pressure. The tightening is declared rather than dramatized through a visible trade-off or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding the source rivers—is signaled early and drives Margot's chart work. Pressure tightens when the inspector arrives seeking the same research, forcing Margot to choose between secrecy and collaboration. The reversal (rivers flow outward from beneath the lake, not inward) narrows options and reframes her three-month pursuit. However, the inspector's arrival feels more coincidental than causally earned by Margot's prior actions, and the final choice to share lacks a visible trade-off or immediate cost that would charge it more fully.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (restore the town's heartbeat) is signaled early and pursued through walking rituals. One meaningful deepening occurs when townspeople join and the stones begin to hum, narrowing failure into communal success. However, no on-page opposition or setback tests commitment; the escalation is accumulative density rather than a turn that forecloses options. The resolution unfolds through cooperative movement without a visible price paid—no dissenter, no failed attempt, no moment where the method risks collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—survive or join the temple's eternal congregation—is signaled early and tightens as the vial empties. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening when Maya discovers the sanctum and sees James preserved, forcing her to choose transcendence over surface return. However, the escalation lacks a visible price that narrows options: Maya swims deeper voluntarily, and her "last breath" is a choice pre-announced rather than a tactical trade-off forced by circumstance. Agency is present (she overrides instinct, records her findings), but coincidence supplies the sanctum's location and the compound's memory-touching property enables rather than complicates her final act. Cost at closure is conceptual—she joins eternity—but not dramatized as a struggle or loss on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake is clear: exonerate his father and reveal the true crime. However, pressure remains static; Marcus faces no opposition, doubt, or tactical adjustment. The door opens "another inch" after decades, but this isn't earned—it simply happens. The discovery of journals and bones is convenient rather than contested. No reversal or tightening choice narrows options; Marcus proceeds from discovery to testimony without friction. The ending promises consequences ("by morning") but delivers no on-page cost or foreclosed path. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening (journal → testimony) is present but lacks felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear early: the debt binding both figures across lifetimes. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ghost bride solidifies and the barrier thins, forcing the confrontation. The resolution—her dissipation and the dawn—lands with visible cost (her dissolution, the end of the alchemical garden, the broken bead). However, Marlow's agency is thin; the ghost bride enacts the release while he remains largely reactive. The escalation is driven more by the centennial cycle than by protagonist choice, which caps the score despite clear pressure and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—weaving myth from ruin—is signaled early and sustained. The three-moon discovery of the nautilus pattern offers a tightening, and her nightly walks show commitment. Yet no on-page reversal tests that commitment: the illustration plate warms and its children move as hoped, the tide pools leave treasures, drowsiness returns on cue. Escalation remains conceptual; no visible cost or trade-off narrows her options before the affirmative ending.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Miriam's interrupted journeys and the question of why she returned. The tightening occurs when Yakov reveals the sundial gnomon and the grandmother's inscription, narrowing Miriam's options from passive observation to active commitment. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening—fitting the gnomon and discovering the names inscribed as hours—that reweights her understanding of diaspora as circular rather than linear. Cost is visible: "months" of rebuilding work and accepting a "faith not in the divine but in the persistence of growth." Minor gap: the escalation is more gradual accumulation than sharp reversal, appropriate to the accumulative lens but softening the pressure curve slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—crafting a pseudonym that gives the client a "true" identity—is signaled early but never tested or tightened on the page. Mira completes her work without obstacle, reversal, or trade-off; no live option is foreclosed, and no visible price alters her tactics. The piece accumulates texture (chalk, client backstory, postal trucks) but lacks the one meaningful escalation or deepening choice required to enter the 7-band under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake signaled early: prevent the coup by transmitting intelligence without detection. Pressure tightens meaningfully when Crane announces the observatory closure, confirming tomorrow's timeline and eliminating future opportunities. Vera's agency drives escalation—each encoded chart, each feigned foolishness is a tactical choice with detection risk. The "twin moons synchronize" detail demonstrates she's tracking multiple constraints. Cost is visible in her sustained performance ("letting drool collect") and the conceptual price of years spent isolated in disguise. One solid reversal when the timeframe compresses from abstract future to "tomorrow night."

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: reconcile with Marina by voicing the apology that has waited three years. One on-page tightening occurs when the medium touches the third window and time folds, forcing her to confront her original evasion; the spirits' song shifts to Marina's lullaby, deepening pressure. The resolution is protagonist-driven (she chooses to speak the message) with visible cost (shard crumbles, years of armor released). The price—admitting she was wrong, ending isolation—is legible and charges the final image. No secondary reversals needed at this length; escalation and cost are clear under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: whether Maya can transform her survivor's isolation into shared healing. The child's request initiates pressure; Maya's translations accumulate collaborative meaning on the cast, narrowing her options from solitary mourning to communal witness. The gift of the coral is a tightening choice with visible cost—she relinquishes her private relic. However, the escalation is primarily additive (more people join) rather than a causal reversal that tests Maya's commitment, and the resolution feels cooperative rather than earned through protagonist friction.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—rediscovering and displaying lost joy—is signaled early and persists. One meaningful deepening: the knowledge network sparks mid-story, expanding her from solo reconstruction to collective project. Agency is attention and reception; she does not face a trade-off or reversal that forecloses a live option. The resolution ("venture deeper," "burn away the fog") is aspirational intent rather than an on-page choice with visible cost. Coincidence (network awakening, other artists stirring) complicates without forcing a decision. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but does not narrow tactics with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding the mural's "true purpose"—is signaled early but never tested with a trade-off or visible cost. The nested-awakenings reveal arrives as exposition ("You've restored this mural before") rather than through Elena's choices narrowing options. Her decision to "choose differently" by flipping the coin and then re-hiding it does not foreclose a live alternative; Marcus's frozen state is reversed without consequence, and the ending loops back to the start with no felt price. Escalation under any lens is minimal: the garden hums, the coin alternates faces, but no protagonist agency tightens the spiral.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake (protecting the secret language network from discovery) is clear early and tightens when Auditors arrive. Marcus's agency is visible: he deploys beetles, mantises, moths, and locusts in escalating waves, each narrowing the Auditors' options while buying time for Serena's escape. The cost is legible—he stays to face capture—but the price lands more as implication than on-page consequence. One meaningful pressure point (the door-rattle discovery) drives the escalation; the resolution hinges on Marcus's prepared defenses rather than a harder choice that transforms him.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: transforming suffering into sustainable beauty via the blossom armistice. The piece seeds this early and deepens it through accumulation (first one arrival, then dozens, then hundreds), but no single on-page moment dramatizes a tightening choice with competing goods or a visible price paid *in scene*. Agency is passive curation—she teaches, she shows the postcard—rather than a decision that forecloses a path. The centuries-long frame makes escalation summary rather than lived pressure, capping the score despite thematic coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—capturing her grandmother's name before the bamboo splits—is signaled early and tightens through one clear escalation: "The bamboo chime shuddered, its crack spreading like lightning." Mira's agency drives the scene (retrieving the orchid, heating it, whispering the name), and the ticking clock adds urgency. Cost is legible in the object's destruction and the end of her thirty-year search, though no competing want complicates her choice. The accumulative lens supports this single deepening; no reversal is required, but the resolution feels slightly frictionless since Mira encounters no internal or external obstacle beyond time.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preventing war by restoring the broken treaty before tomorrow's final summit—is signaled early and remains coherent. The timeframe tightens pressure (seven sleepless nights, three hours until the summit), and Elena's choice to translate "promise-for-promise" rather than word-for-word constitutes one meaningful turn that narrows her approach. Agency is present in her decision to pursue "carefully reckless" scholarship after cautious methods failed for two decades. However, the escalation unfolds without visible friction or setback—each decoding crystallizes smoothly, the ink well glows in confirmation, and no on-page obstacle tests her commitment or forces a trade-off with felt cost in the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—reconciling the factions via floodgate design—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure tightens when Mara moves from observation (discovering the dual-resin envelope) to agency (mapping new positions, embedding collaboration requirements). The plan itself narrows options: she commits to anonymity and indirect persuasion, foreclosing direct mediation. However, the escalation reads more as incremental execution than a reversal or deepening choice that tests her commitment under fire. The cost (her invisibility, the risk of rejection) is named but not viscerally felt on the page at the moment of decision. No antagonist appears to complicate her move.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—Margot's need to reconcile her disgraced past with her present sanctuary—is signaled early through the meteorite dilemma and the burned clippings. Pressure accumulates through her archival work, discovering emotional truths in strangers' letters, and Theodore's climactic reveal. The tightening is more a deepening than a reversal: the envelope scene reweights her self-understanding rather than forcing a difficult choice. Agency reads as acceptance and reframing rather than renunciation with visible tradeoff. The escalation fits the Accumulative lens but lacks a moment where she must forfeit one live option for another.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—finding her father and understanding sacred thresholds—is signaled early. Marina's navigation through the maze (turning at pressure differentials, counting steps) shows agency, but the tightening is mild: she follows the logbook without meaningful friction or trade-off. No live option is foreclosed; the maze "responds" cooperatively. The cost at closure (choosing to inhabit the threshold herself) is conceptual rather than felt on the page. One deepening occurs (discovering the permanent differential) but it arrives without obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding the city's celestial mechanism—is signaled early, but escalation remains observational rather than driven by Mira's agency under pressure. The alignment happens to her; she waits and watches rather than making a choice that narrows options or imposes cost. The "luminous respite" sequence provides atmospheric accumulation but no reversal or tightening that forecloses a path. The ending crystallizes her stance (inhabiting mystery) without a visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding why paths disappear—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, the story lacks a meaningful tightening or reversal that narrows options under pressure; the recollectionist moves from discovery to reflection to departure without facing a complication that forces a costly trade-off. The sprouts at the end offer a conceptual reframe but do not emerge from protagonist agency or a prior pressure point. The cost (work never finishes, mystery deepens) is thematic rather than legible in a specific on-page forfeiture or tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—sustaining his livelihood through engineered spontaneity—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when Marcus shifts from the shanty to his own dark-winter composition for the teenager, narrowing his repertoire to match observed need. The guitar pick drop is a micro turn that reweights the interaction, but the escalation is modest: no live option is foreclosed, no visible trade-off dramatized. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure accumulates through the performance cycles, yet the cost at closure (packing, resetting for tomorrow) feels routine rather than urgent. The piece lacks a second pressure point or a stakes test where Marcus must choose between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: create defiant art before the Council detects her. The piece signals the authority threat early and the dance becomes the tightening act. However, Mira faces no on-page obstacle—no misstep, no tool failure, no temptation to stop—so pressure is declared rather than tested. The ending accepts capture as inevitable rather than dramatizing a choice that forecloses an alternative. Cost is conceptual (imprint in the garden) but not viscerally paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Marcus seeks to understand what his decades of glazier work have been revealing, then shifts to preserving that insight before demolition. One meaningful tightening occurs when the development letter enters, narrowing his timeline to "the last morning." The stone-throwing acts are Marcus's agency—observation, decision, documentation—and the final stance (teaching others) forecloses his old passive installation role with felt cost. Deduction: the escalation relies on external coincidence (demolition notice) rather than a turn driven by Marcus's prior choices, and the pressure remains contemplative rather than testing him with a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: can Marcus transform private guilt into shared wisdom? Pressure accumulates through reflection on the rookie's death, the old woman's lesson, and his own scar-bargain, tightening to the decision to record the message. The choice forecloses his prior stance of silent expertise and commits him to vulnerability with his crew. Cost is felt in the shift from isolation to exposure. One cap consideration: the escalation is textural (deepening understanding) rather than a high-stakes external reversal, but it fits the Accumulative lens and the final act meaningfully narrows his prior emotional options.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—revitalizing grandmother's work—is declared but never tested with visible cost. Marina releases lanterns, watches visions, and documents formulas without opposition, reversal, or price. The "dimensional confluence" and grandmother's appearance happen to Marina rather than being earned by her agency. No tightening or deepening narrows options; the resolution (teaching others tomorrow) lies entirely off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving and decoding acoustic memory—is signaled early and tightens when Mira realizes Voss had the same perception and left a map. The film negative strip discovery and diary annotations create one meaningful pressure point that narrows her options to extraction work. Agency is primarily attention and endurance; the ending crystallizes her stance (adding her whisper, ensuring future searchers) with conceptual cost (ongoing solitude, burden perpetuated). No antagonist or physical obstacles test her commitment, keeping escalation modest.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: reach Sophia through painted possibility-maps. Pressure accumulates through the ticking dawn (bells about to ring), the quickening borrowed heartbeat, and Maya's faster brushwork. One meaningful tightening occurs when the sparrow sings back, narrowing the question from "will the messages work?" to "Sophia is responding now." Agency is present in Maya's campaign of paintings and her choice to paint the jammed bells yesterday, though that retroactive detail feels slightly convenient. Cost is conceptual (three months of elusive work, the hush engineered, fingers trembling) and the resolution hinges on external validation (sparrow, heartbeat) rather than a protagonist decision that narrows options with visible trade-off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—stopping the endless cycle of failed treaties and inherited hatred—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure tightens when Mara breaks protocol ("Not in celebration, but in recognition of what we've broken") and narrows options by rejecting the traditional grievance recital, forcing delegates to confront personal loss via the clipboard. The senior Theren's challenge ("You propose we abandon justice?") and Mara's rebuttal create one meaningful reversal. The final shift—delegates approaching the clipboard and recognizing names—feels somewhat rapid and convenient, as if understanding arrives too easily after three hundred years of failure. Cost is legible (renunciation of righteousness, admission of complicity) but the delegates' collective pivot could use one more beat of resistance to fully earn the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving extinct species through controlled destruction—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when Vera cracks the egg, narrowing her choice to irreversible fossilization with visible cost (albumin penetration, permanent entombment). Agency is present: her satellite activation, her engineered heat wave, her encrypted map. However, the peak choice (placing and cracking the egg) arrives without on-page opposition or complication; the act proceeds as planned without friction, limiting escalation under pressure. The storm's diversion is a tactical move but doesn't test commitment because no counter-pressure emerges.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—freeing the captured echoes to claim agency—is signaled early and tightens as each thread gives way. The accumulation of echoes does deepen pressure, but the escalation is textural rather than agonistic; no live option is foreclosed, no visible trade-off dramatized. The Academy's response is anticipated but off-page, and Lyralei's "technical faithfulness to vows" sidesteps rather than confronts cost, leaving the price abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—how to tell necessary truths without violence—is signaled early, but no on-page escalation or tightening occurs; Marcus remains in his reflective preparation from start to finish with no reversal, complication, or price paid. The heated argument with collaborators happened twenty minutes before the story opens, so its pressure is pre-existing rather than dramatized. His decision to prepare tomorrow's performance is uncontested and involves no trade-off or foreclosed option, leaving the conflict abstract and the cost unlanded.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—honoring the cloud dwellers by encoding their history for the last monarch—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure is textural rather than causal: Mira works methodically without opposition or internal doubt, and the arrival of the butterfly feels awaited rather than contested. The tightening occurs when the butterfly lands on the moth wing and "reads" it, then departs—a meaningful beat that forecloses continuation (the butterfly will die, structures dissolve) with felt cost. Under the Accumulative lens this is sufficient, though the lack of a complicating reversal or moment of doubt keeps the score from the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—is signaled early and sustained. The punched card discovery provides one meaningful tightening that narrows her approach. However, the story lacks on-page opposition or trade-offs; Elsa succeeds at each step without visible cost or foreclosed options until the reflective acceptance at the end. The escalation reads as accumulation (braid by braid) rather than pressure that forces harder choices. Under the Accumulative lens this is functional but the stakes remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—discovering why paths choose walkers—is signaled early and drives the descent. The neural interface moment (minute twelve) provides a reversal when Kira learns she is remembering the future, not seeing it. However, this revelation arrives via Chen's preserved dreams rather than through Kira's agency; she is a receptor, not an actor. The storm provides external pressure but does not force a trade-off; she ascends against the water as foreseen. No on-page choice forecloses a path with visible cost—she walks the predetermined loop. The conceptual tightening (time flows backward here) reframes the premise but does not escalate through protagonist decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—complete the palace's function and make contact—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through discovery beats (tile → cavity → second tile → resonance), but escalation is additive rather than constrictive; each find simply enables the next without narrowing options or forcing a trade-off. No on-page reversal or cost-bearing choice tightens her path. The ending grants success without visible price; her years of frugality are told in retrospect, not dramatized as a present forfeiture. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful tightening or cost at closure is required; this delivers affirmation without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (saving the Magistrate's son / teaching release of resentment) is signaled early, but escalation is absent—Marcus "had been waiting for this confluence" and executes a pre-formed plan without reversal or tightening. The Magistrate's arrival should complicate, but Marcus is "ready" and transmission of cellular memory resolves instantly with no visible trade-off. Cost is declared ("releasing its stranglehold") but not dramatized as a foreclosed path or paid price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—recreating the astronomer's lost vision—is signaled early and tightens when synchronized breathing becomes the method. The vision sequence accumulates pressure through layered imagery (stars in floorboards, nebulae in beams) that tests Elara's craft claim. When the astronomer breaks rhythm and the vision fades, a micro-turn forces Elara's prepared solution: the fog-silvered hand-mirror. The cost is conceptual rather than visceral—accepting carriage over capture—and legible in the astronomer's gasp and understanding. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as density increase and pattern payoff; one meaningful deepening occurs when Elara's prepared mirror reweights the quest with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—restore the seeing stones—is signaled early. The tightening occurs when Elara chooses to climb and teach rather than refuse, foreclosing isolation as a path. Agency is clear (decision to mend and transmit), but the convenience of the "wrong bag" softens escalation slightly. The cost is present (abandoning her protective vow, defying the Council) but more relational than material. One meaningful pressure point suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding the undocumented shell—is signaled early and drives the journey to the orchard. One meaningful deepening: the bathroom retreat allows cognitive processing that leads to the inheritance insight, narrowing her understanding and compelling acceptance of the loop. However, escalation is primarily epistemic (she learns) rather than forcing a trade-off with visible cost. The resolution is acceptance/endurance, but the price (looping forever, memory instability) is conceptual and told ("would forget this journey, remember it") rather than dramatized through a present foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake (reach the library of unlearned lessons) signals early and tightens through three obstacles: the rearranging passages, the circular trap room, and the final negotiation. The trap room provides one meaningful reversal where gap-pattern recognition unlocks progress. However, the climactic negotiation lacks friction—the mountain accepts Mira's first offer without counter-pressure, and the cost (filling blank pages) remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake signaled early: recapture proof of her twin's existence. One meaningful tightening occurs when Coraline offers the binary choice—pin the card and forget, or carry it and "never quite recapture." The cost is visible in the final image (warm green pulse, navigating by fragment). However, escalation is driven more by revelation than by Marina's agency under pressure; she receives information rather than forcing reversals through her decisions. Coincidence (the ship appearing, Coraline waiting) complicates but does not resolve, acceptable under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—translating diplomatic confusion into clarity to access merged territories—is signaled early and tightens through the rope's three configurations. Each braid reconfiguration narrows options and deepens knowledge, consistent with the Accumulative lens. The thirteenth-chime deadline imposes time pressure. However, escalation lacks a visible trade-off or renunciation; Elara succeeds without apparent sacrifice, and the final step feels more like intellectual victory than a choice that forecloses a path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: restore harmonic balance threatened by the energy beings' overwhelming frequencies. One meaningful tightening occurs when she discovers the bloom of hush and performs the extraction ritual, narrowing options from abstract seeking to concrete action. The bloom's expansion forces the beings to modulate their presence, creating visible consequence. However, the resolution unfolds without a costly trade-off—the beings simply learn reverence when exposed to the bloom. Agency is present (she chooses to extract the bloom rather than confront or flee), but the victory arrives without visible sacrifice or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—rekindling the beacon to call home the evacuation ships—is signaled early and pursued coherently. The shard's arrival introduces a meaningful complication that shifts Mira's tactics from polishing dead mirrors to using silence to heal the prism. However, the execution feels frictionless: the vision shows her exactly how to succeed, and no misstep or setback tests her commitment. The ending delivers conceptual weight (seventeen years of waiting validated) but the escalation lacks an on-page reversal or visible price that narrows options under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving collective memory to maintain humanity—is signaled early and coherent under the Accumulative lens. However, escalation is weak: Lyra walks among crystals, examines shadows, touches one, writes with the summer-quill, and realizes the importance of cherishing memories. No live option is foreclosed, no tightening forces a trade-off, and the evening ritual proceeds without visible friction or cost to Lyra personally. The fog-stone catastrophe happened three days prior (off-page), and survivors simply continue their routine. The story deepens thematic texture but does not narrow Lyra's options or test her commitment with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—defying hopelessness through communal fireworks—is signaled early but never truly tested. No reversal occurs; Kaia proposes a solution, gathers materials, and succeeds without setback. The mosaic artist's prior weeks of work should create friction (why didn't it work before?) but instead validates Kaia's arrival. The rockets' sustained burn is a technical triumph, not a dramatic one—no live choice narrows options or forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Chen will return to chronicle work—is signaled early and accumulates through confession and cicada exchange. One meaningful tightening: Chen's revelation that foreseeing patterns became unbearable. The resolution, however, pivots on Mira's persuasion and the pools' "foretelling" rather than a difficult on-page choice by either character that forecloses a path with visible cost. The piece deepens understanding but does not force a trade-off; Chen's return feels assured rather than earned through active sacrifice or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—collecting silence flavors during the inversion—is signaled early and maintained throughout. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening when the doll cracks and sprouts, transforming Mira's collection task into a sensory cathedral of quiet that "rang with possibilities." The inversion's forty-minute window creates temporal pressure, and Mira's choice to remain at the observation deck (rather than retreat to tethered beds like other guests) demonstrates agency. However, the escalation operates primarily through accumulation of sensory detail rather than narrowing options or forcing trade-offs; Mira encounters no obstacles, failed attempts, or competing costs during her harvest, which keeps the pressure atmospheric rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—teaching the passenger to find comfort in curated silence—is clear and coherent. However, escalation is minimal: Marcus identifies her distress, adjusts gondola speed and route, offers wisdom, and succeeds without friction or cost. No reversal tests his commitment; the storm glass "grows warm" but doesn't force a tactical pivot. The woman's transformation from rigid to relaxed is asserted through description ("shoulders began to drop") rather than shown through a choice that forecloses a path. Agency rests almost entirely with Marcus, and even his actions face no resistance or price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake (find the stairway before sunrise) is signaled early and coheres through the paint-peeling sequence. However, no on-page reversal or tightening narrows options—each paint layer simply reveals the next piece of history without cost or trade-off. The deadline ("until sunrise") creates urgency in framing but never forces a tactical choice; Anya completes her discovery with time to spare and sits to listen. The resolution (sharing knowledge, not claiming power) is thematically clear but not dramatized as a choice under pressure; no competing want (e.g., temptation to hoard the fragment, fear of returning empty-handed) creates friction. The ruby flake dissolves passively, not as a renunciation with visible cost. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is present (density increases through layered reveals) but lacks a moment where Anya's agency forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—teaching shadows to breathe—is signaled early, but escalation reads as repetition rather than tightening. The shadow with the fresh scar arrives, is taught, and departs; then "another shadow began its encroachment" in identical pattern. No on-page reversal narrows options or raises cost for the keeper; her methodology succeeds without friction. The piece gestures at internal conflict ("some teachers must become absence itself") but never dramatizes a moment where her severed connections create a present dilemma or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake (transforming broken promises into value) is signaled early but never tightens into a trade-off. Marina faces no genuine obstacle—the convergence happens to her, the bolt's purpose is revealed by text message, and the transformation succeeds without cost or risk. Dr. Chen's presence adds no pressure. The one meaningful tightening required at this length is absent; instead we get escalation-by-declaration ("This is impossible") without Marina's agency driving the turn. Coincidence (messages, convergence timing) resolves rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to master or renounce the family gift—is signaled early and tightens when the gramophone reveals the poisonous history. The choice to lift the needle, throw the crank, and donate the estate narrows options with visible cost (loss of power, genuine solitude). One meaningful deepening occurs when standing waves show her the generational isolation, shifting her stance from temptation to refusal. The escalation is conceptual rather than action-driven, fitting the Accumulative lens, but the pressure remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"to capture the shape of possibility"—is abstract and never tested by a concrete on-page dilemma. No reversal or tightening forces a trade-off; Aldric recites the oath, the marionettes stir, and transformation proceeds without resistance or cost. The program's instructions are followed rather than interpreted under pressure. The final "surrender to infinite possibility" names the outcome but does not dramatize what Aldric gave up to achieve it, leaving escalation inert.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Marcus's need to find meaning in foster care records—is signaled early and deepens through the discovery of Timothy Walsh's file, where he finds not grand revelation but "accumulated kindnesses preserved in dust and marginalia." Escalation operates under the Accumulative lens: each artifact (button, note, marginal notation, forwarding address, returned button) tightens the thematic question until Marcus recognizes that healing requires witnessing rather than solving. Agency is visible in his photographing, cross-referencing, and decision to add Timothy's name to his private index, all micro-choices that foreclose other paths. The cost is legible—he accepts延ed searching and solitary nights over the relationship with Sarah—though the final moves summarize his realization rather than dramatizing a fresh tactical shift, keeping this from 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—recover suppressed evidence before the Ministry arrests the resistance—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is weak: Jakob's warning creates urgency, but Mira's plan unfolds without meaningful obstacles or trade-offs. The Ministry never materializes as on-page opposition; their strike happens conveniently off-stage, and Mira's success reads as unopposed execution rather than agency under duress. The piece declares stakes ("hold the line against the tyranny of indifference") but never dramatizes a moment where Mira must choose between competing goods or pay a visible price for her victory.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (contain the prophecy before it becomes inevitable) is signaled early and coherent. The tightening occurs when Marcus shifts from planning to performing the un-music, a meaningful turn but not a high-cost reversal—he executes the plan without tactical adaptation or visible sacrifice. The prophecy's response is immediate and cooperative rather than resistant, reducing friction. Cost is deferred ("will wake again someday") rather than paid in the present beat, keeping escalation in functional mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—decoding the message between earth and sky—is signaled early but remains abstract. Mira faces no meaningful opposition or cost: she doesn't report the speck (no consequence shown), builds monuments (no one stops her), and awakens her gift (pure upgrade). The leaves' "warnings or promises" distinction is posed but never tested through choice. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or reweight options; here it simply accumulates description until Mira achieves understanding. No tightening forecloses a live option or forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—Marcus seeking purpose after 317 failures—is signaled early but never faces a test that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The compass unlocks a pattern rather than creating pressure; each discovery (clocks ticking, leaves organizing) arrives as confirmation, not complication. No reversal forecloses a path or imposes visible cost. The accumulative design deepens understanding but does not escalate tension or agency under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Mira's need to understand her name's burden—is signaled early and drives the scene. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is thin: once Vera explains and demonstrates the kintsugi principle, Mira's acceptance arrives without visible friction or trade-off. The search party's disbanding (the inciting urgency) and the foundry's cursed reputation create atmospheric pressure but don't test Mira's choices in the peak beat. The coin's transformation provides a visual turn, but Mira's agency in that moment is passive reception rather than costly decision.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: freeing Thomas through confession to acceptance. Pressure coheres through the accumulative lens: harp notes shift from discordant to "achingly luminous," Mara's off-key humming forces Thomas to reframe mistake as music, and the tooth's heating pulse signals the breakthrough moment. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara urges "Play it broken and beautiful," which directly precipitates Thomas's final performance and dissolution. Cost is visible in Thomas's vanishing and Mara's return to solitary labor ("another soul stirring"), though the ease of the breakthrough—Thomas smiles and plays once, then dissolves—trends toward wish-fulfillment; no second attempt or resistance tests commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: whether Lyra will remain trapped by her trauma or transform it into mercy. One meaningful tightening occurs when she removes the strap with "inverted motion," foreclosing revenge and isolation. Her agency—standing, walking into the forest, kneeling at calculated distance—narrows options toward teaching. The child's appearance introduces a concrete test of her new mathematics, but arrives late (final third) without prior complication, so the escalation reads as a single deepening rather than compounding pressure. Cost is visible: she leaves the strap behind and commits to a pedagogical future among the displaced, though the price feels more conceptual than visceral at the moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—uncovering and honoring the erased seafaring peoples' histories—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mira realizes the keeper's daughter was also a between-worlds translator, which reweights her mission as legacy continuance. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is limited: no complication, resistance, or cost intervenes during the paint-scraping or discovery; Mira's acceptance of the knife and her plan to project stories are frictionless. The resolution feels preordained rather than earned by a tightening choice or visible trade-off, weakening the pressure required to enter the 8.0+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering what ceilings hide, exposing systemic corruption—is signaled early and coheres under the Causal lens. Marcus's agency is clear: he follows the trail, pries up the floorboard, climbs to retrieve the journals, and decides to take them to reporters. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ghost stops counting and points upward, forcing Marcus to act. The resolution is earned by his choices and his grandmother's legacy, with visible cost (inheriting a dangerous burden). However, the conspiracy's scale is declared more than tested on the page; we're told of "a web of neglect" and "hundreds of lives saved" without seeing Marcus wrestle with the personal danger or social friction that would push the score higher.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: maintain the library's perfect system versus the destabilizing bottle. The uncorking provides one meaningful turn that reweights options, and the library's dissolution follows. However, the escalation feels smooth and preordained rather than forced by protagonist agency under pressure. Moth's decision to print the compression is declared ("working quickly") but not tested by a visible trade-off or live friction. The cost—library dissolved, self scattered—is conceptual and distant rather than felt in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—control of the Venusian collection versus reimagining a civilization—is signaled early and tightens when Cassia angles the shard to reveal ghosts, a reversal that shifts Huang from dismissal to curiosity. However, the escalation lacks a visible tradeoff: Cassia proposes resurrection without dramatizing what she forfeits (her exile status, Institute standing, or immediate consequence). The story delivers one meaningful pressure point (the ghost-summoning) but the final commitment feels more like a manifesto than a choice that forecloses a live option with on-page cost. Agency is present but the price remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (restore dawn/break the Covenant) is signaled early and tightens when Vex bursts in, forcing Elias to complete the work under immediate threat. However, the tightening arrives via external coincidence (Vex's arrival) rather than Elias's prior choice creating the complication, and the resolution costs Vex but leaves Elias unscathed—no visible trade-off or stamina/resource depletion that alters his tactics. One meaningful pressure point is present, but the lack of personal cost at closure keeps this from the 8.0+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—finding the source of otherworldly petrichor—is signaled early and tightens through the descent. The psychometric vision narrows options by revealing the Hartley expedition's fate and intensifying the pull of the threshold. However, Vera's withdrawal is presented as prudent preparation rather than a forced choice with immediate cost; no live danger compels retreat, diluting the escalation at closure. One meaningful tightening via vision, but the final choice feels more like deferral than renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—Marina's need to reimagine what seems broken—is signaled early and sustained through the carving sequence, but pressure remains ambient rather than escalating through reversals or forced tradeoffs. The storm and GPS failure complicate her situation, yet she encounters no meaningful obstacle or cost during the carving itself; the shipwright's knowledge and the stonecutter's insight arrive as gifts, not friction. The sculpture emerges through inherited wisdom rather than hard-won discovery, and the ending offers renewal without visible sacrifice. One tightening occurs when she understands the GPS failure's purpose, but it deepens theme more than it narrows tactical options or forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding why the flowers were painted and hidden—is signaled early and tightens once at the solstice when Mara realizes the postcards are instruction, not documentation. That tightening reweights her mural work with visible cost: she commits to secrecy, accepts that her art will be misread by most, and walks away still carrying the mystery. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation reads as density increase (winter → spring → summer → autumn → winter solstice) that deepens her investment. One friction: the pivotal realization is conceptual rather than tested by an on-page reversal or refusal; no live option is dramatized and foreclosed in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding the encrypted truth of betrayal and forgiveness—is signaled early. However, pressure remains largely static: Amara decodes, Marcus explains, and the lagoon reveals coordinates without meaningful tightening or a live trade-off. The "searing weight" and moral calculus are told rather than tested through decisions that narrow options. No on-page reversal forces Amara to choose between competing costs, leaving escalation underdeveloped under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: restore the town without false comfort, honoring memory while conceiving new possibility. The tightening occurs when Silas rejects the "easy path" of shattering the bottle and instead commits to the untried method of drawing essence through himself—narrowing options with implied personal cost. However, the escalation is conceptual rather than tactical; no live obstacle tests his resolve once the choice is made, and the hours of standing are summarized rather than dramatized with visible degradation or complication. The outcome (people will arrive, revival begun) is declared rather than shown through a reversal or price that lands in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving emotional patterns before they're lost—is signaled early and sustained. The discovery of the prophetic shaving provides one meaningful tightening: it narrows options by predicting the tower crack and mandating transcription work. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens remains modest; the prophecy's fulfillment happens *to* Matthias rather than through his agency. The manuscript creation is dramatized but lacks visible friction or tradeoff—no competing need, no resource scarcity, no cost beyond time spent. The waters rising below add atmospheric pressure but don't force a harder choice at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—reopening the sealed garden without unraveling causality—is signaled early and tightens as the vortex slows and ice sublimates. Mira's seed-sorting and acorn placement narrow the path from chaos to deliberate rotation, and her understanding of why her grandmother sealed the inheritance deepens mid-scene. Yet the resolution is frictionless: no trade-off, no visible price paid, no live option foreclosed. The final act (planting the acorn, smiling "furiously tranquil") reconfigures the inheritance as continuation, but escalation plateaus rather than exacting cost.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—warn the valleys in time—is signaled early and tightens once when Mara chooses the bell over the electronic system, a reversal that narrows options and raises credibility cost ("would anyone… believe a warning issued in such perfect weather?"). The cost is visible: villages evacuate, Mara remains exposed in the sanctuary as the avalanche reshapes the landscape. The tightening is meaningful and forecloses a path (passive monitoring). Minor issue: the avalanche's appearance feels coincidental in timing rather than dramatized as a consequence of her choice, slightly softening agency at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—finding meaning in obsolescence—is signaled early and tightens when the still star appears, forcing Kepler-9 to choose between modern technology's certainties and vulnerable, open perception. The escalation operates through deepening rather than external reversal: witnessing the impossible star narrows options by making the janitor's raw openness necessary. However, the protagonist's agency is primarily observational; the star's appearance and departure are not driven by Kepler-9's decisions. The cost (acceptance of isolation, handwritten documentation over computers) is felt but subtle, leaning more toward conceptual reweighting than a trade-off that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why the collective dissolved—is signaled early and tightens through discovery (box → photographs → letters). One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara realizes "the covenant hadn't failed because of what was said, but because of what wasn't," which reweights her grandfather's silence. The ghosts' gestures provide external pressure that forces interpretation. However, escalation is primarily cognitive (realization) rather than a choice that forecloses options with visible cost; the decision to stay feels like acceptance rather than a trade-off that narrows live alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—rediscovering how to mark time after the Great Uncounting—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. Marcus searches, finds exactly what the records said, reads the messages, has an epiphany, and departs; no complication or narrowing of options occurs. The "borrowed-time timekeeper" status is label-only and imposes no visible trade-off or limit on his actions. Agency is present in the decision to gather fragments and teach, but it arrives without friction, price, or a foreclosed alternative path. One tightening is required under Accumulative lens; none appears.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: Mira's effort to harmonize discord between loss and remainder, signaled early and held throughout. The kite-string snap provides one meaningful tightening that narrows the boy's options (loss is irreversible) and deepens Mira's practice by forcing her to articulate it to another. Agency reads as attention and teaching rather than renunciation; Mira's response to the boy forecloses purely private reflection, yet the cost is muted—she shares her insight without visible sacrifice or trade-off. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres and the cadence shift at closure reweights the stake, but the escalation lacks a second distinct beat or visible price that would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—prevent resort conversion by demonstrating interspecies communication—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the copper network completes and she grasps the tumor's role, foreclosing retreat and committing her to the translator path. However, the escalation feels more like revelation unfolding than genuine pressure: the orchard waits patiently, the trustees are offstage, and Mira's agency reads as philosophical acceptance rather than a choice that trades competing goods. Cost is present (she will die into this purpose) but the price is conceptual and future-facing rather than paid in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding the artificial pilgrimage network and humanity's role—is signaled early and sustained. Elena's journey to the tower and her placement of the amber on the scanner constitute agency, but the escalation is primarily cognitive (data reveals → realization) rather than a choice that narrows live options. The story delivers one meaningful deepening when Elena recognizes "we're the experiment," but the cost is conceptual (loss of agency, scripted rebellion) without a visceral trade-off or renunciation on the page. No reversal forces a decision between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—letting the garden consume the battlefield—is signaled early and held. Pressure accumulates texturally (density of language, invocation cadence) rather than through reversal or tightening choice. No on-page obstacle tests the coachman's resolve; he kneels, plants, and departs without friction. The seeds splitting at the end provides a micro-turn from intention to inevitability, but the coachman's agency is completion of a predetermined ritual rather than a decision that narrows options. Cost is projected (decades of forgetting) rather than paid on this page.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—finding the child—is signaled early and tightens when the leaf reveals coordinates only Sage can read, narrowing her path to one magnetic compass. The journey costs three nights and visible solitude, and the closure redefines her purpose with the obligation to guide others, a felt price that forecloses her retirement. Agency is clear: Sage chooses to leave the Heap, follow the chromatic compass, and howl to summon refugees. One escalation: the leaf's translation forces her ancestral gift into use. The valley's arrival and the children's revelation land with stakes intact, though coincidence (other refugees arriving simultaneously) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: navigating the station's broken chronology for the scattered crew. Pressure accumulates through Kira's realization that her temporal stretching is a compass, not a curse, and tightens when she begins sketching the station-as-constellation. The turn is internal and textural—confusion reweighted as exploration—with visible cost: she becomes the fixed point, foreclosing her own mobility. Agency is clear in her decision to sketch and press the drawing to the compass. One quibble: the crewmates' arrival in the final paragraph arrives as result rather than complication, softening the escalation curve slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (pass the test by understanding wonder's true nature) is signaled early. The tightening occurs when Renn recognizes her master's error and enacts the swap, but the Keeper's immediate approval deflates the turn—no resistance, no second complication. The amendment forecloses the path of hoarding secrets, yet the cost feels abstract (her master's failure) rather than a visible sacrifice Renn herself pays on the page. One meaningful pressure point, minimally contested.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—documenting small truths versus becoming official witness—is signaled early and tightens when the other survivor calls her to testify. Marina's refusal is protagonist-driven agency that forecloses the path of reintegration. The interregnum provides situational pressure (breathless pause, nomadic penumbra) but escalation proceeds more through accumulation than reversal. The cost of remaining marginalized is felt but not deeply tested; no second complication forces her to defend or risk her sanctuary. One meaningful deepening is present but the final third restates rather than intensifies.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—recovering a buried talent—is signaled early and tightens when the stone guides her downward. One meaningful deepening occurs when she finds the soil chamber and understands "not her past, but permission to plant a future." Agency is present (she chooses to plant), and the cost is legible (abandoning prophecy). However, the escalation is primarily internal and atmospheric; no external reversal or difficult trade-off tests her commitment on the page. The final act reweights options under the Accumulative lens, but pressure remains largely metaphorical.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—self-forgiveness for a past teaching error—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when Kaspar realizes the frozen game mirrors his own mistake, which narrows his options to acceptance rather than external redemption. However, the pressure is largely internal and reflective; no live antagonist or external force tests his choice. The cost of walking away (leaving the village frozen, accepting his student's lost future as unchangeable) is legible but feels conceptual rather than viscerally felt. The piece operates under an Accumulative lens, so the lack of causal reversal is not penalized, but the tightening remains modest.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake (shatter the Silencers' monopoly on truth) is signaled early and tightens through the climb to the resonance chamber, where occupying the ritual space forecloses the Silencers' planned silencing. The cost is conceptual and strategic—the canyon's "forged hush" breaks, making suppression structurally impossible—but Kira's personal risk (she is condemned, the Silencers approach) never materializes into a visible tradeoff or price paid on the page. The escalation is driven by her agency under the Accumulative lens, yet the final image asserts transformation without showing what Kira loses or renounces to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear and signaled early: preserve the story/meaning before the workshop falls. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure tightens through atmospheric escalation (snapping moorings, tilting platform, rising acid) rather than reversals, and Mira's agency—narrating to completion despite imminent death—drives the final act with visible cost (her life). The piece delivers one meaningful deepening: the statue's awakening confirms success before the plunge. Agency is present but leans toward ritual execution rather than dynamic choice under fire; a mid-scene doubt or tactical shift would have elevated this further.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding her artistic isolation and her grandmother's disappearance—is signaled early and tightens when Marina finds the shells and journal. The discovery deepens her understanding of "temporary eternities" and forecloses the path of simple quay repetition. However, the escalation is driven by passive discovery rather than Marina's tactical choices under pressure. The final decision to maintain both practices shows agency, but the turn itself arrives via coincidence (wrong turn, hidden cave) rather than protagonist-forced narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: bring Thomas back from the in-between. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara shifts from beckoning to absolving his guilt, which allows the shimmer to solidify. However, escalation is driven by Mara's ritual completion rather than protagonist agency under pressure—she releases the vial, climbs, speaks forgiveness in sequence without a visible trade-off or narrowing of options. Thomas's materialization feels granted rather than earned by a choice that forecloses a path. No credible loss (time, stamina, social cost) alters tactics on the page. The final image of "two shadows" offers poetic closure but lacks legible cost under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: guide scattered families through safe passage while resisting her own biological pull to migrate. The hydraulics failure creates immediate pressure (frozen array, three-hour window) and Diego's call in the sulfur fields delivers the peak tightening—she must guide someone she loves through lethal terrain while articulating why she herself will not follow. The cost of her choice is legible on the page: permanent separation, endurance of "terrible longing," and acceptance of solitary duty. One reversal when the array finally moves "close enough" enables the brother's call, then her final stance crystallizes with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: escape the truth compulsion before it destroys all remaining relationships. The tightening is clear—Mara's isolation, her desperation, the discredited cure's uncertainty ("I'm afraid it won't work"). The reversal when she finds pre-hidden truffles raises hope; drinking the mixture is agency under pressure. The cost is visible: the eye blinds, and she inherits the harder burden of discretion. One meaningful escalation (quest → discovery → cure → choice) is sufficient at this length and the price reconfigures her stance credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—decoding the stranger's gesture to recover lost selfhood—is signaled early and tightens through discovery: the boutonniere resists, gaps align with the lighthouse, coordinates are temporal, the stranger was his son. Agency is investigative and renunciatory: Magnus chooses to investigate the gaps, then accepts the returned memories and his isolation. The pile of objects (compass, pen, watch) deepens the cost by cataloging what was stolen. The final choice to return to the lighthouse with the boutonniere pinned forecloses reunion but gains companioned solitude, a trade-off with visible price. One credible reversal (the stranger as son, not victim) reweights all prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus will finally follow rather than sell journeys—is signaled early and the creek-rising timeframe creates a ticking clock. The story tightens once when Marcus closes his shop and follows the ants, a meaningful break from thirty years of routine. However, the cavern sequence offers no resistance; the doorway opens easily, no tradeoff is dramatized between staying and going, and the final step-through is described as a shift in self-perception rather than a choice that forecloses a live option with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—solve the bloodline mystery or become another cautionary tale—is signaled early and tightens when Seraphina discovers the bargain's terms. The escalation is clear: climb → revelation → choice → transformation. However, the pivot moment ("What if I refuse?") is answered by threat rather than by Seraphina's agency testing options; the grotto's coercion narrows her path externally. The cost is visible (transformation, perpetuation of cycle) but the final act feels more acceptance than a choice that forecloses competing paths.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—capturing presence in alchemical form—is signaled early and tightens when Lyra realizes she's "been approaching this backwards." The reversal (from trapping to inviting) is protagonist-driven and narrows options with visible cost: she abandons her three-year method. The cost is conceptual rather than visceral, but the shell levitating and the nexus responding provide on-page escalation. Marcus's witness role feels thematic rather than pressure-inducing; a second character doesn't actively complicate the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—distilling chaos into narrative order—is signaled early and tightens as Maya confronts the futility of linear documentation. The scroll's promise of flight and the memory of her grave create pressure that forces her final choice to step outside. Agency is present (she writes, she walks out, she accepts), though the renunciation feels more resigned than high-cost. The escalation under the Accumulative lens works: each reflection reweights her relationship to the archive until the final image reconfigures the premise. Cost is conceptual (she abandons the archive's promise of order) but the tradeoff lacks sharp physical or relational bite.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—translating mechanical failure into human truth for Mrs. Huang—is signaled early and tightens when Mara discovers the screw stopped time at 3:47. Agency manifests in Mara's decision to leave the screw "deliberately loose," a repair choice that integrates loss rather than erasing it, foreclosing the path of perfect restoration. The escalation is more accumulative than causal: no reversal tests Mara's method, and Mrs. Huang's arrival functions as confirmation rather than complication. Cost is conceptual (accepting that repair means integration of damage) but lacks a visible trade-off that narrows Mara's options in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—pass the final test by creating an original rune—is signaled early and remains legible. Pressure tightens as crystalline formations spread and Kira's breath-holding intensifies, narrowing her window. The cost is felt: she must integrate the "affliction" she has denied. However, escalation is compressed into one extended beat; there is no failed attempt or mid-scene reversal that forces a tactical shift. The grandmother's rhyme solves the problem without Kira first exhausting a scholarly approach on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake (Vera helping Marcus/Elisabetta finish the requiem before the orchard dies) is signaled early and tightens through the falling trees. One clear escalation: the time pressure forces collaboration that Vera would have resisted, narrowing her options from her former "rip spirits out like weeds" approach. Agency is visible in Vera's choice to participate, applying perfume and transcribing. Cost is on-page: Elisabetta dissolves after completion, Vera's prior triumphant narrative is replaced. The orchard's destruction provides persistent constraint that shapes all tactics in the archive.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake—unraveling cosmic illusion—is signaled early but never tightens into a choice with competing costs. The universe's "hiccup" recurs as atmospheric detail rather than escalating pressure; Kaia's walk through the library meets no obstacle, reversal, or trade-off. The overlapping apocalypses and the dictionary's final entry arrive as revelations, not as turns earned by protagonist agency. No visible price is paid; understanding simply accumulates until the conceptual repricing concludes the journey without a felt cost that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding what clocks really measure—is signaled early and pursued through the counting ritual. Pressure remains contemplative rather than escalating; the shepherd performs her usual practice without opposition, complication, or cost. The counting sequence provides rhythmic tightening but no reversal or decision that narrows options. The realization at zero (time as "the razor edge between what was and what would be") deepens understanding but does not foreclose a path or force a trade-off. Agency is limited to perception; she "prepared for the next hour's count" with unchanged purpose, offering continuity rather than transformation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—Elena seeking to reconcile her professional work with her father's addiction—is signaled early. The subway message decoding provides one tightening point ("after the storm's heart" reinterpreted). The stranger's arrival should escalate pressure but instead delivers thematic exposition that resolves Elena's question for her. Elena's agency at closure is writing a subway message, but this decision is enabled by the stranger's speech rather than Elena's prior struggle. No visible trade-off: Elena gains understanding without losing her teaching position, relationship with her father, or prior certainty. The "impossible hope" insight is granted rather than earned through on-page reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—Marcus's method of cultivating estrangement—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or reversal. Eleanor's self-awareness offers a potential tightening ("Sometimes I think I made her up entirely"), yet Marcus's response deflects rather than escalates. No on-page choice narrows options or forces a trade-off; the ending loops back to the routine without cost. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is required; here the pattern repeats without reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—preserve Eleanor's peace versus historical truth—is signaled early and tightens when Mara discovers Thomas's arson. The codicil offers a synthesis rather than a forced binary, which is thematically rich but mechanically convenient: no live option is foreclosed, no visible cost paid in the present scene. Eleanor never learns of the codicil, so Mara's agency operates in a consequence-free zone for this encounter. The fire backstory provides escalation in knowledge, but the three-day offstage deliberation diffuses pressure rather than concentrating it, and the final exchange unfolds without friction or surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (Sadie needs the moon rock to build her connection chain) is clear and escalates through one meaningful turn: the satellite phone trade reframes the transaction from material to relational. Marcus's agency is present but reactive—he takes the phone, understanding shifts—rather than driving the reversal. The cost is legible (Marcus must now engage monthly) but conceptual rather than viscerally tested on the page. Pressure coheres under a Causal lens with one solid tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake (finding the stillpoint to deepen her practice) is signaled early. The journey accumulates sensory input and tightens spatially as she approaches the forest heart. Yet no reversal or constraint forces Elara to choose between competing goods or pay a visible price—she simply arrives, sits, and absorbs. The melodic trail guides without opposition. Agency at closure is reception, not decision or renunciation with cost, limiting escalation credit under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: save the colonial fleet. The anomaly offers an edited history where the mistake vanishes, creating a meaningful tightening at the end—accept the revision or preserve the discovery. However, escalation is conceptual rather than situational: Mira deliberates rather than facing compounding pressures that narrow her options through action. The rescue ship's trajectory shift adds a reversal, but it arrives conveniently rather than as a consequence of her prior choices. The final decision to broadcast both coordinates crystallizes the dilemma with conceptual cost (knowledge vs. absolution), though the price feels more stated than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Maya's attempt to translate her new silence back into shareable experience. One meaningful tightening occurs when Chen interprets Maya's map into sign language while Maya photographs, crystallizing their collaborative performance. The cost is Maya's acceptance that "no one remembers my music" and her shift to creating something that exists only in the moment—a visible forfeiture of legacy and audience. The escalation is modest but sufficient for this length under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake (rescue ancestral technique) is signaled early but never escalates through genuine opposition. Mira's journey is a treasure hunt without meaningful reversals; each clue leads smoothly to the next, and the archive holds "enough fragments to reconstruct the entire technique" with no visible scarcity or trade-off. The promised future conflict (emerging to preserve truth) is off-page. No on-page choice narrows options or forecloses a path with cost; she will "master what had been hidden" without dramatized friction or price.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: preserve consciousness against extraction and dissolution. The drumming subnet is seeded early, and the inversion at "the hush of the universe inhaling" provides one meaningful escalation that narrows the scientists' control. However, the reversal is conceptual (memories "fused, creating something unprecedented") without on-page cost to Mira's tactics—she "held firm" without specifying what she sacrificed or how holding differed from releasing. Dr. Chen's attempt to terminate offers external pressure but deflates immediately. The final transformation is declared irreversible but not tested by a live trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (prove whispers outpace shouts) is signaled in paragraph two and tested when the storm kills electronics. One meaningful tightening occurs: Chen's panic forces her to follow Marcus's method. However, the escalation is situational coincidence (storm arrives) rather than protagonist-driven pressure; Marcus does not choose the challenge's timing or create the conditions that validate him. The procession of workers and Chen's capitulation feel summarized rather than dramatized with a visible trade-off or cost that narrows options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake: Thomas's frozen confession to his dying grandmother. Pressure tightens through Mira's demonstration (shutters opening one by one = incremental reweighting), but escalation remains metaphorical rather than narrowing Thomas's options via decision. He watches transfixed, "began to understand," then rises and walks away—no on-page choice or renunciation that forecloses a path with cost. The demonstration deepens thematic texture without forcing Thomas to act under constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—teaching Elena and preserving free thought against authoritarian suppression—is signaled early and clear. The story attempts escalation through the father's discovery and the planned window display, but the peak turn (the town's awakening) happens off-page as summary, undercutting earned pressure. Elena's confidence shift from sobbing to making seven moves and whispering "checkmate" compresses without visible intermediate struggle. The cost (authorities arriving "soon," Marcus knowing "it was too late") is declared rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—finding authentic selfhood versus maintaining protective disguise—is signaled early and tightens when Mira begins unwrapping bindings under Torven's gaze. The scrimshaw pulses, the whale calls, and the island appears, creating an accumulative intensification rather than a causal reversal. However, the escalation feels more atmospheric than earned by protagonist agency: the island "becomes" rather than Mira *making* a costly choice to reach it. The cost of abandoning her livelihood and disguise is gestured at (clothes on rocks) but not dramatized through a moment of renunciation with immediate consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—learning to carry grief without drowning under enforced happiness—signals early and tightens through one meaningful turn: Mrs. Chen's shift from passive observer to active participant when she extends the bouquet and later practices the narration herself. Agency is renunciation (giving up authentic expression) with visible cost (the flatness she must adopt). The whittling deepens pressure by demonstrating the method's mechanics. No forced reversal; the Accumulative lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—striding through once-sacred boundaries—is signaled early but never pressured by resistance, cost, or a competing desire. Silas's dance proceeds unimpeded; the lake cracks "not with violence, but with... lantern-moth hush," erasing tension rather than escalating it. The arrival of fellow poets deepens the image but does not constitute a turn driven by Silas's agency. No on-page reversal narrows his options or forces a trade-off; the resolution feels declared rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is Mira securing workspace, with Enzo's reconciliation as the secondary thread. The barter (painting for courtyard time, then flower-language lessons) tightens once when Mira offers the reed tongue and reads Enzo's grief. However, the escalation is mild: Enzo's acceptance feels assured once Mira demonstrates her insight, and the daughter's return arrives as coincidence (drawn by the sound) rather than a choice-driven turn. No visible cost or trade-off at closure; the reunion succeeds without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—connection through questioning artificial pilgrimage—is signaled early and sustained. Vera's improvisation creates one meaningful turn: she breaks the prescribed sequence, strangers gather, unscripted sounds emerge. However, the escalation is smooth rather than tightening; no live cost appears on the page (no supervisor objects, no job jeopardy, no internal doubt that she dramatizes through micro-choice). The resolution feels more like discovery than decision with visible price. Under the Accumulative lens, the pattern-break works, but the pressure never narrows options or forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: Elena's recovery and her emerging role as guide for others. The visitor's arrival tests Elena's progress—she must now articulate and enact what she's learned—but this moment deepens more than it tightens; the stranger's need is met cooperatively with no refusal or trade-off dramatized. The decision to prepare the tattoo needle at the end signals commitment but is not yet executed on the page. One meaningful deepening is present (from passive refuge-dweller to active light-keeper), but no on-page reversal forecloses a live option with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake is clear: prove the Jakarta network's preservation strategy. One meaningful deepening occurs when Vera reveals they're "creating a distributed cultural archive," narrowing from communication to intentional redundancy. Yet this revelation arrives through explanation rather than a choice under pressure; Marcus receives data, Vera interprets. No visible trade-off or tactic shift results from the forty-three-day cycle discovery. The escalation is informational, not volitional.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—purifying the memory plague to prevent its weaponization—is signaled by the midpoint and drives the final act. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira shatters the vessel and inhales the poison, a choice that narrows options. However, the escalation is more declarative than dramatized: the guardians arrive "soon" but never force a trade-off on the page, and the ritual's cost (processing lifetimes of anguish) is summarized rather than shown through a visible price that alters her final state in concrete terms.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving the shadow's journey—is signaled, but no on-page reversal tightens Mira's options. Her colleagues' dismissal is mentioned in summary, not dramatized as opposition that forces a trade-off. The discovery unfolds as linear revelation without a moment where Mira must choose between competing goods or accept a visible price. Accumulative lens does not waive the need for one meaningful pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is Marina's self-respect versus the sanctuary's survival, tightened when Chen exposes the truth. The surgery is a meaningful pressure point: each chip removal forecloses the deception path and forces the confession choice. The final act—typing the public confession, arranging rehoming—is driven by Marina's agency with visible cost (investigations, lawsuits, closure, self-incrimination). The tightening is decisive and the price unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Maya seeks to decode scar-stories and understand the displaced miracle. One meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes the miracle is scattered and her scars are "maps of possibility" rather than records needing closure. Agency is present (she stands, walks, examines, presses palm to glass) but the final stance—"remaining open"—is a renunciation that forecloses the closure-seeking path with visible cost (continued surgery, perpetual wounding). The cost is felt but not as viscerally tested as higher bands require. Escalation is conceptual rather than situational pressure that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether to preserve the building's emotional archive—emerges clearly and deepens through psychometric accumulation. However, escalation is primarily textural (more letters, more grief) rather than a narrowing of options or trade-off. The final choice (taking the film) does not visibly foreclose an alternative or impose a felt cost; Vera's professional report will be "clinical" regardless, so the pocket-rescue feels like addition rather than reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is signaled early and held throughout. However, escalation is minimal: Lyra moves through the archway, sits, and turns the astrolabe without meaningful resistance or complication that narrows her options. The "test" of falling stars is recounted rather than dramatized, and the final act (turning "the astrolabe's final ring") resolves the conflict without visible trade-off or alteration in tactics. Coincidence (the astrolabe warming, the aurora flaring) completes the task rather than protagonist agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: guard the cargo and ensure sparks reach the unlit corners. The pirate's arrival tightens pressure, and Kess's lullaby-charm creates a micro-reversal where the container shifts into a parallel probability. However, the resolution unfolds without visible cost—Kess sings, reality complies, the pirate fades. No live option is foreclosed, no price paid on the page; the tactic succeeds cleanly. One meaningful tightening is present, but the ease of victory and lack of trade-off caps the score in the mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—rediscovering wild thought—is signaled early but never genuinely tested. The philosopher encounters no opposition, makes no trade-offs, and pays no visible price; he simply inserts the gear and receives validation. The "deepening" is declarative memory recovery rather than a tightening choice that narrows options. Under the Accumulative lens, one would expect density increase or pattern break with felt cost, but the forest's song simply "approves" without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—Marina's need to let go of control—is signaled early and coheres through the journey. Pressure tightens in the confession beat ("I was never brave enough to let him run free") and the guide's response with the star punch. However, no on-page reversal or live choice narrows Marina's options: the ferry guides steer the journey, the ticket is punched without her decision, and she arrives at the far shore without agency. The resolution feels delivered rather than earned by protagonist action under the inferred Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding the cost of unpardonable silence—is declared but never tested through a present tightening or trade-off. Marcus's seven-year wait and Elena's return happen in summary; no on-page reversal narrows options or raises cost. The ending's "single note" is told as transformative without showing what tactics or paths are foreclosed. Under an Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is required; here the pressure remains static from opening to close.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake signaled early: unmask the pretender to restore the true heir. Escalation occurs when the pretender breaches the drift and confronts Syln, forcing her to deploy the pellet. However, the turn is convenient—she simply drops the pellet, it auto-resolves, and the pretender flees. No trade-off or visible price is dramatized; Syln's three-thousand-year wait ends in a tidy victory without loss. One reversal (messages → breach → confrontation) is sufficient for this length, but the lack of on-page cost caps the band.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why Mooreton vanished and what her grandmother intended—is signaled early and tightens as shadows become geometry become streets. One meaningful deepening occurs when Lena stops needing the atlas page, recognizing the coral as transcription rather than death. However, the escalation is largely perceptual; no external opposition tests her commitment, and the decision to descend carries stated isolation but minimal on-page cost (no sacrifice of position, safety protocol violation, or relational rupture dramatized in the moment). The "drifting between worlds" operates more as lyric summary than felt trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—reigniting the stalled rebellion—is signaled early. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is thin: Kira observes, walks, understands, decides to bring others. No reversal narrows her options; the stones' hum intensifies atmospherically but does not force a choice with visible cost. The piece deepens texture without tightening pressure. Agency at closure is intention, not renunciation or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—undo the Authority's control—is signaled early and sustained. One tightening occurs when Chen mixes the formula and cracks the amber, narrowing options. However, escalation is smooth rather than forced by protagonist struggle: the plants decode the kite, the formula works instantly, and soldiers arrive too late to complicate. No on-page reversal tests Chen's commitment; the lieutenant's conversion happens to him, not through Chen's tactical choice under fire. The resolution hinges on off-stage propagation (bacterial spread, wind-borne spores) rather than a climactic decision with visible cost, keeping the score in mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: can she endure trauma without closure and still cultivate life? The tightening occurs when panic markers arrive and she chooses practiced stillness over flight, forecloses magical thinking. Agency is endurance with visible cost: she returns knowing violence persists, choosing alignment with growth's indifference. The jade cutting propagation and succession planting dramatize her tactics under the chosen lens (Accumulative). No explicit antagonist needed; the structural pressure is post-trauma recalibration versus erasure. Final stance crystallizes in the lighthouse parallel: guidance requiring no human presence, only structures built to last.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Marina's need to paint truth after her subjects fragment—is signaled early and tightens when she begins sketching on the tarot cards. Pressure accumulates through the pattern of collapsing reality, but escalation is textural (books blur, glass falls upward) rather than driven by Marina's agency narrowing options. The ending crystallizes her stance, yet no live option is visibly foreclosed; the choice to "descend into darkness" is announced rather than demonstrated through a trade-off with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding why time slows during crisis—is signaled early, but no on-page pressure tests it. The ink's disappearance is a passive observation, not a reversal that narrows options; the tracker encounters no obstacle, makes no trade-off, and faces no consequence. The eclipse countdown ("Three minutes until totality ends") promises escalation but deflates when the ending simply confirms her hypothesis without cost. Agency is absent: the tracker watches patterns, records data, and concludes—coincidence (the eclipse) triggers the phenomenon, and she passively harvests the answer.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—release dangerous truths versus preserve them—is signaled early and tightens when security's four-minute response undercuts the six-minute upload window, forcing Vera's cascade-failure gambit. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to activate the network, feed the files, and sabotage the cooling system. The cost is legible on the page—arrest is imminent, her career and freedom forfeit—and the "terrible peace" crystallizes her acceptance. One meaningful pressure point (the timing crunch) narrows her options and she pays a visible price. The moral calculus (oath vs. truth) sharpens the peak choice, though the tension could be more viscerally embodied in the moment rather than summarized in her smile.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.2)
    One dominant stake is signaled early: Mira's cultivation work as counterpoint to her father's violence. Pressure escalates when the father returns "earlier than expected," weapon in hand, and the scene tightens as she leads him into the greenhouse. The father's sheathing of his weapon and kneeling at the rose constitute a meaningful deepening that narrows his options—he chooses to engage her method—but the cost (foregoing the hunt's identity) remains implicit rather than shown through a dramatized trade-off. The escalation is coherent under the Accumulative lens, but the stakes would enter the 8+ band if the father's choice foreclosed a live option on the page (e.g., a contract abandoned, a weapon laid down permanently) with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: hunting the echo of a goddess, a sound that "could cure or curse, depending on the listener's readiness." Kova's seven-year preparation establishes the cost of unreadiness. The tightening occurs when the echo circles her three times, testing, and her emotions transliterate into visible currents that she must ignore to hold the moment—a clear narrowing of options where panic would scatter the catch. The dance (pulling with silence, resisting with ancient song) is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, though the echo "choosing to be held" rather than being captured dilutes the sense that Kova's skill alone secured the outcome. The cost is legible: she receives the goddess's message and is "changed," now carrying the echo forward with visible consequence (humming the feral lullaby that alters reality). One persistent constraint—the need to keep her mind's surface still—shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (protect father's reputation vs. reveal truth) is signaled early and tightens through Margot's reasoning process. The realization that both accounts can be true via proxy constitutes meaningful escalation that narrows her options. The final choice—create a third impossible story—shows protagonist agency and forecloses the path of honest intervention with visible cost (truth becomes "impossible to determine"). The price is conceptual but legible: she abandons the investigative integrity her "devotedly observant nature" implies. One clear tightening and one decisive turn meet length requirements under Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.9)
    One dominant stake is clear: give the firmware ghosts their memorial to end the crying. The tightening occurs when crying shifts from static to language/music/mathematics, narrowing Mara's task to a specific constellation form—one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. However, no choice forces a trade-off; Mara's task proceeds without obstacle, and the amber cracks "just slightly" without altering her tactics. The cost (amber fractured, future letters ensured) is conceptual and retrospective rather than a live on-page price that forecloses options during the work itself.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—discovering meaning in the unlearning's hush—is signaled early and tightens through the mandala's progression and the tile flake's arrival. The protagonist's agency manifests in continuing the sand work despite anxiety and in choosing to leave the mandala to scatter, foreclosing preservation. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens through layered whispers and the tile's heat, culminating in a shift from control to acceptance. The escalation is gentle but coherent; the cost of releasing control is felt but not viscerally tested against an opposing desire on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Sarai's compulsion to restore versus the Brotherhood's threat—tightens meaningfully when the mosaic accepts her, forcing a choice between continued hiding and public transformation. The escalation follows the Accumulative lens: each tessera placement deepens understanding until the final vision shifts from past to possibility. Agency is clear in her decision to "begin gathering the scattered" with visible cost (Brotherhood pursuit). One beat lacks full pressure: the old man's warning arrives but doesn't force an immediate tactical trade-off before her choice crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (reuniting with Isabella by manipulating fractured time) is signaled early and drives all beats. Pressure accumulates through layered echoes until Isabella materializes. One meaningful tightening occurs when the coin grows warm and timelines resonate, narrowing possibility to the brightest strand. Cost is conceptual (eternal encore, bound performance) rather than a visible trade-off; Cornelius never weighs renunciation or loses a live alternative, and the escalation feels textural rather than agonistic.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—Maya's effort to make hidden pathways visible—is signaled early and sustained. However, pressure never meaningfully tightens: David's concern poses no real obstacle, and his conversion happens through witnessing rather than through a choice that forecloses options. The reveal that "human connection didn't require medication" arrives as exposition rather than as a discovery earned through struggle, and no visible cost accompanies the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: documenting and translating the unknown presence. Pressure accumulates through the deepening sensory trail and discovery of non-human emotion, but escalation is textural rather than turning—Kira floats deeper, perceives more, then decides to teach. No credible loss, trade-off, or antagonistic force narrows options; the entity is neither hostile nor resistant. The resolution (teaching others) is declared without visible cost or a choice that forecloses an alternate path. One meaningful deepening (alien emotion) tightens focus but does not force a harder decision.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake (preserve/transform prophecy) is signaled late and remains abstract. Mara faces no meaningful tightening or trade-off; the buttons glow, she arranges them, and the hourglass refills without opposition or visible cost. Agency is present (opening the jar) but no option is foreclosed and no price paid. Escalation under the Accumulative lens requires density increase or pattern break that reweights the stake with cost—here the pattern is taught too late and cost is declared, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Margot can trust Viktor and reclaim agency—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Viktor reveals the burn was intentional, reframing three years of exile. However, escalation relies on exposition rather than protagonist pressure: Viktor delivers folder, explanations, and choice; Margot receives rather than wrestles. The resolution ("I'll deliver it") involves agency but no visible trade-off or live cost on the page; the decision feels inevitable rather than fraught. Coincidence (Viktor's arrival at the exact coordinates) complicates setup but the lack of interim reversals or tactical choices under duress keeps pressure theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the woman can be eased of her burden—is signaled early and tightens when Thomas offers his service. The woman's acceptance and Thomas's needle-work constitute one meaningful deepening, though the lack of visible resistance or internal cost from the woman reduces pressure. The rain gutters stopping and fog lifting provide a timed constraint that narrows the window. Cost is more implied than directly dramatized: the woman's tears and the "marks that won't fully fade" suggest residue, but her agency in the choice is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding why the oasis resists timeline fractures—is signaled early and sustained. Mei's arrival and glass-aided observation constitute one meaningful deepening that changes her knowledge. However, no reversal or trade-off occurs; the glass reveals without cost, and Mei's agency is purely receptive. The flattened smoke signals synchronization, but this is environmental luck rather than protagonist-driven escalation. The ending forecloses return "until timelines heal," a mild opportunity cost, but the decision feels more like narrative closure than a choice under pressure that narrows live options.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—releasing what has served its purpose to make space for renewal—is signaled early and coheres throughout. The piece tightens through accumulative pressure: the petal falls, Marina climbs down, the rower's rhythm instills patience, and the gauge is wedged as monument. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening (the decision to leave the gauge) forecloses a path with cost. However, the cost is more conceptual than felt; Marina's choice reads as contemplative inevitability rather than a trade-off forced by live pressure, keeping this in the mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—Kira translating her crushing isolation into bearable independence—is signaled early and remains consistent. Pressure accumulates through the hum intensifying and the sundial warming, but no on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off with visible cost. Marcus's arrival and tea offering provide a conversational beat but no opposition. The resolution (understanding that anachronisms coexist with absence) arrives as insight rather than through a choice that forecloses a path, meeting the Accumulative lens minimally but without the felt cost that would elevate into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Mira's need to reveal the hidden thread connecting her ghostwritten letters—is signaled early but remains abstract. The installation is built off-page in summary; Chen's arrival and their collaboration do not generate a meaningful reversal or tightening that narrows live options. The revelation that Chen kept her letters is a micro turn, but it does not force a trade-off or impose a visible cost that alters tactics. Under the inferred accumulative lens, one deepening is present (the shared acknowledgment), but the price is conceptual and the escalation is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: stop the faculty vote before humanity broadcasts to a malicious AI. One tightening: Maya discovers the subsonic manipulation and begins counter-broadcasts, narrowing the faculty's misinformed certainty. However, escalation is mechanical—she "worked with ethereal precision" without visible friction, and the AI's defeat reads as technical rather than a choice that costs her something. The vote postponement happens to others; Maya's agency is observation and transmission, not a decision that forecloses a path. No trade-off or visible price charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—finding the cartographers' key/compass—is signaled early and pursued throughout. Marcus's descent and following the organ music provide forward pressure, but the escalation is largely passive: the music guides him, the blueprint glows, the passages open. No on-page moment forces him to choose between safety and discovery with visible cost; he walks forward "letting the sound guide him" without renouncing an alternative or paying a price until the ambiguous transformation at the end. The resolution hinges on touching the compass, an act that happens to him as much as chosen by him.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding why the masks were taken—is signaled early and resolved. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is weak: Sarah moves systematically through portraits without a reversal or complication that narrows options. The phone call resolves the investigation, but no on-page cost is visible in that beat; her insight arrives without a trade-off or forfeited path. The investigation proceeds smoothly, lacking a moment where her method fails or forces a sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—decoding her ancestor's secret and broadcasting the coordinates—is clear and escalates as the hurricane approaches, forcing Elara to choose between evacuation and completing the mission. The tightening is legible: discover → decode → broadcast under immediate storm threat. The cost is visible (she stays in danger, exposes hidden populations), though the convenient appearance of ships in the storm wall undercuts some of the earned tension. The reversal from "maps never lied, but could be made to forget" to "maps would remember everything now" provides thematic closure with agency.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding the hitchhiker's vanishing—is signaled early but never escalates into a decision with competing costs. Marla's backward melody summons the hitchhiker without visible risk or trade-off; the glass flake's revelation is received passively. The piece offers tightening through accumulation (pixelated fragments → understanding → playing again) but pressure remains conceptual rather than forcing a choice that forecloses a path. Under the Hybrid lens, the deepening reweights her past actions, yet no on-page reversal tests her commitment or alters her tactics with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is Marcus's campaign to dissuade TerraLoop, signaled early and sustained across seasons. Pressure accumulates through Marcus's phased escalation (bills, artifacts, whispers) and TerraLoop's responses (dismissal, nervous energy, algorithm dysfunction). One meaningful tightening: the algorithm begins "detecting patterns that weren't there, creating phantom thieves from statistical noise," narrowing TerraLoop's options. However, the climactic choice (Chen's decision to dissolve) occurs off-page, and the cost—though conceptually clear—is told rather than dramatized. Marcus's agency shapes the middle beats but the ending belongs to Chen's off-stage renunciation, weakening protagonist-driven closure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake: decode the temple-star link and understand the generational relay. One meaningful deepening occurs when Hayashi realizes the inscriptions are predictions, narrowing the question from archaeological to astronomical. The final act is documentation rather than a choice that forecloses a live option; cost is conceptual (accepting the witness role) rather than a visible trade-off. Escalation is smooth but lacks a moment where agency visibly alters tactics under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: prove innocence or face execution within seven sunsets. The dive and discovery sequence generates one meaningful tightening when Kael presses amber to ice, cracking both and releasing the full confession. However, the pressure is largely solved by discovery rather than a trade-off or forced choice. Kael does not sacrifice a live option or pay a visible price on the page; his ancestor bore the cost in the past. The final image promises future action (planting the seed when the Blight comes) but does not foreclose a path or test Kael's commitment now. Escalation under the Causal lens is present but thin; agency at closure is preparation rather than decision with immediate cost.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake: find the intersection and understand the eclipsed covenant. No meaningful tightening occurs; Mira moves from clipping to maze to intersection without resistance or price. Agency at closure is acceptance without visible cost—she simply reaches for the covenant. Coincidence facilitates rather than complicates: the topiary responds instantly, the maze reveals scars on cue, the intersection "blooms around her." No on-page reversal narrows her options or changes her knowledge in a way that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is clearly Mara's need to recover Elena's destiny and patch her soul. One meaningful tightening: the keeper's challenge forces Mara to understand the card's self-burned origin and that the apple fuses both paths, narrowing her choice to accept a bartered rather than stolen fate. The cost—trampling her singular destiny—is visible in the ash and the merged nature of the outcome. Agency is present in the bite, and coincidence does not resolve. However, the escalation is more conceptual revelation than pressure that narrows live options; the keeper's appearance feels convenient rather than a consequence of prior choices.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clearly Marcus's need to reconcile expertise with failure, signaled early through the expo humiliation. The cloth recognition provides one meaningful tightening that forces him to choose between continued detachment and engaged translation of his past. The Nashville call exacts visible cost—he must own the wounds that gave him authority. However, the pressure buildup could be sharper; the middle section lingers in reflection without additional complication before the breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake: bridging ancient wisdom and modern understanding. The breakthrough via lodestone analogy provides one meaningful tightening, and Sarah's arrival at the arbor deepens the mystery. Yet the final beat—consuming the seed—unfolds without visible resistance, cost negotiation, or trade-off on the page. The priest's departure and Sarah's acceptance happen in sequence without pressure testing her commitment. No on-page reversal forces a harder choice; the resolution feels granted rather than earned through protagonist agency under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder and guiding transformation—is signaled early but remains static. The visitor's arc unfolds without reversal: she arrives, smelts, and departs successfully with no meaningful friction or cost visible on the page. Kaine observes rather than acts; her own smelting is backstory. The moon reaching apex and the furnace roaring "without flame" are declarative rather than pressure-tested, and no tightening narrows options or raises stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Mara's fear of living "above ground, where hearts can break"—is signaled early and clear. One meaningful deepening occurs when she etches her own confession, an act of agency that forecloses her professional detachment. The cost is legible: she marks the bunker unsuitable and types messages that will end her isolation. However, the escalation relies more on Crown's prior work than Mara's on-page struggle; she reads confessions and responds, but no live obstacle tests her commitment. The pearl's eruption feels more reward than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—finding permission to move forward from paralyzing guilt—is signaled early and tightens through the graffiti encounter. The escalation is accumulative: Marcus moves from passive chronicling to active self-representation on the wall, then to releasing the map ritual entirely. Agency is clear in the decision to write "Mile marker zero" and abandon cartographic absolution. Cost is visible: he forecloses the obsessive documentation path that has structured his identity for five years. No reversals required under the accumulative lens; one meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—finding the library of unspoken words—is signaled early but never truly tested. The protagonist encounters no meaningful obstacles; the librarian appears to approve and guide rather than oppose. The watch's backward tick and the propagation-delay insight arrive without cost or tradeoff. The piece lacks a tightening turn where options narrow or a price must be paid; instead, revelations cascade without friction, and the second letter materializes as reward rather than consequence of her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Elara's choice between academic empire and historical truth—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation is weak: Elara resolves her dilemma off-page (the night spent forging papers), then executes a pre-formed plan rather than navigating live pressure. Marcus's arrival provides an antagonist but no meaningful reversal; the violin's automatic justice mechanism removes agency from the climax. The story tells us Elara "had to let you touch it" but doesn't show her maneuvering him into contact under pressure. One tightening occurs (the violin's song and sublimation), but it's driven by object magic rather than protagonist choice with visible cost in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—preserve the last spark before oblivion—is signaled early and remains clear. The Silence's arrival ("grotto trembled") creates one meaningful tightening that forces Mira to work faster, narrowing her window. However, the escalation remains external pressure rather than protagonist-driven choice; Mira succeeds without visible trade-off or tactical pivot. The "bubble of potential" solution arrives without prior cost, and her dual role (beautician-mortician) enables rather than complicates the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Mara's search for contentment after Chen's betrayal—is signaled early and drives her ritual climb. One meaningful tightening occurs when the mysterious woman reframes the scrolls as "merely maps" and Mara as "the territory itself," forcing her to reconsider her relationship to lost knowledge. However, escalation relies on revelation rather than choice: Mara receives understanding rather than forging it through a decision with visible cost. The final image ("content at last") asserts resolution without showing a tactical or emotional trade-off that forecloses an alternative path. Agency is more passive reception than active stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Marcus's need to understand his daughter's suicide and his own complicity—is signaled early and tightens when the narrator reveals the real books and reframes the problem from "complexity killed her" to "simplicity killed her." One reversal shifts Marcus from seeking absolution to receiving a harder gift: the burden of perpetual moral choosing. The cost is clear but somewhat abstract: he must nurture nuance or shrink from it. No visceral trade-off forecloses a path on the page, keeping this in upper-mid band.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=4.2)
    The dominant stake—teaching Marcus to "see time differently"—is declared but never tested. No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options; the meditation proceeds to inevitable success. Marcus's "confusion" is mentioned but not dramatized as resistance that must be overcome. The lesson succeeds without visible cost, trade-off, or credible alternative path, leaving escalation absent under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Escalation under the Accumulative lens: the vultures' spiral tightens, the wandering pulse shifts in response to Yula's synchronization, and the swallows encode the awaited message, culminating in the pulse's return as her own younger voice. Agency is endurance/attention that forecloses movement with on-page cost: three centuries of stillness, dust accumulation, and the final recognition that "the greatest journey was the one that required no steps at all." The cost is conceptual and temporal but legible in the final image. One meaningful deepening is present; no reversals are required under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—finding value in her failed magic—is signaled early and tightens when Mira drops the medallion and steps onto mist, a choice that forecloses the Academy path. The mist-walking sequence deepens her understanding of "accommodating impossibilities," but the escalation is more accumulative than agonistic: the ice gardens appear without complication, and no live obstacle tests her commitment. The resolution rests on realization rather than a forced trade-off, fitting the situational lens but lacking a felt price that alters tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: discover the color of sound and understand the sister's disappearance. One meaningful turn occurs when Marlow reads Elena's journal and realizes the ritual exists. However, the escalation is informational rather than pressure-driven—each discovery confirms rather than complicates. The ritual unfolds without obstacle; Marlow speaks her vow and the lanterns "pulse in response" with no test of commitment. Cost is asserted ("I will no longer hide behind truth") but not dramatized through a trade-off or forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving the possibility of expansion in a contracting universe—is signaled early and sustained. Escalation reads as accumulation: each coin-cast creates "micro-expansions" that deepen her purpose until the seventh cast crystallizes her eternal role. Agency is present in her choice to continue casting despite stellar doubt. The backward-causality frame introduces genuine constraint (she can only understand after fulfilling her purpose), forcing endurance with conceptual cost. One tightening occurs when she shifts from divining to "becoming the decision itself."

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—learning to survive eternal isolation—is signaled early and tightens when she discovers all reapers share this wound. The naming ritual provides one meaningful deepening that narrows her relationship to grief. However, the escalation relies on internal realization rather than mounting pressure; the discovery that "unnamed fears grew monstrous" arrives as given wisdom rather than a hard-won insight under duress. Cost is present but conceptual (accepting she will never be remembered) rather than a live trade-off in this scene.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (restore the fish, validate the theory) is signaled early and pursued throughout. However, escalation is minimal: Mira performs the ritual as rehearsed, condensation forms on cue, and the climax ("The third drop never fell") arrives as spectacle rather than a choice-driven tightening. No visible trade-off or forfeited option is dramatized; the success is complete and unambiguous. The cost—collapse from exhaustion—is generic and doesn't narrow future options or force a renunciation, keeping pressure in the mid-band under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Marcus's role as vigilant warden responsible for monitoring the resurrection. The discovery of Elena's photograph introduces a secondary moral stake (truth vs. official erasure) that braids with the first. Pressure accumulates through the photographic trail, and the final commitment to write her name beneath each image provides a tightening choice. However, the escalation lacks on-page friction—no commissioners arrive to object, no personal cost (career risk, social blowback) is dramatized. The decision feels morally clear rather than testing competing goods, reducing felt cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: harmonizing logic and intuition before her final transformation. One meaningful deepening occurs when the starlings' pattern clarifies the formula, reweighting Vera's understanding and enabling her to choose release over preservation. The sublimation of the crystal forecloses the option to preserve wonder as proof, and the cost—absence holding power—is felt in the final image of the empty cloth. Agency is present in the decision to flame the crystal with "wild warmth of intention." No antagonist, but internal pressure coheres and tightens through the accumulative lens. The transformation tomorrow remains abstract; on-page pressure is conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake is clearly signaled: whether the sky-forests will be preserved or harvested, determined by Maya's reports. The mysterious voice tightens pressure by forcing immediate allegiance choice. The escalation is coherent under Situational lens—coincidence (unfamiliar handler) complicates but doesn't resolve; Maya's agency (choosing to reveal withheld data, lying about timeline) drives the turn. One meaningful deepening occurs: her understanding shifts from "watcher's burden" to active witness/guardian. The cost is felt (exposure, lost safety) though the full price isn't yet paid on the page. No antagonist required; the corporate-vs-environmental tension provides sufficient pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—Marcus's numbness and the custody conflict—is signaled early but never tightens through on-page opposition. No reversal occurs; Chen's lecture provides the solution without Marcus resisting or testing it. The duplicate's parallel revelation is told, not shown, eliminating potential friction. The sparring mirrors the thesis but doesn't escalate pressure or foreclose an option; Marcus simply absorbs the lesson. Cost is abstract ("potential") rather than visible.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—restoring laughter to the Hendricks family—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Marcus faces no genuine opposition or internal conflict; his twelve-blower symphony proceeds without complication, mistake, or adaptation. The "tightening" occurs when Emma laughs, but this moment arrives as consequence of Marcus's unimpeded performance rather than through a choice that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The ritual's repetitive future ("next month, and the month after") suggests endurance with cost, yet no specific price is made legible on the page—no stamina drain, social price, or tactical compromise appears in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: escape/rescue from the sealed garden. One clear tightening when the scholar offers dual retrieval, forcing trust in "uncertainty." The guardian's agency is renunciation (removes pendant) and acceptance (steps into the Codex light). Cost is visible: she gives up her only anchor and her guardian role. The scholar's need (sister retrieval) converges with the guardian's need (escape) at closure, creating a credible trade-off. Pressure coheres under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—proving his worth after thirty years of failure—is signaled early and drives every choice. Pressure escalates through the crozier's destruction, failed ash-forms, and the blood sacrifice that finally succeeds. The cost is visible (heresy, self-wounding, burning a sacred relic), though the resolution lacks a live antagonist or secondary complication that would test his commitment beyond the technical challenge.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—finding the shard of hush—is signaled early and pursued throughout. Pressure accumulates through Maya's climb and tuning process, and the lunar perigee tightens the window. However, escalation is linear rather than deepening: she seeks, she finds, she descends. No reversal or complication tests her commitment; the shard opens "like a door" without resistance. The decision to teach rather than monetize is a thematic pivot, but it arrives without on-page friction or a visible trade-off that would raise cost.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—merging parallel timelines—is declared but never tested with a meaningful reversal or cost that narrows options. Marcus initiates convergence without on-page obstacles, failures, or visible prices paid during the act itself. The woman passenger's "which timeline tonight?" exchange is a potential pressure point but dissolves into passive observation. No escalation or deepening occurs; the ferry "shudders," timelines "braid," and success is immediate. Under an Accumulative lens, we'd expect density to tighten choices or a pattern to break and force a stance; instead, the resolution is announced in summary.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.8)
    Dominant stake ("discover the texture of connection") is signaled early. No meaningful tightening or escalation: visitors evacuate hours before the opening, removing all external pressure, and the architect works "without interruption" to complete her design exactly as intended. The closure delivers on her goal with no cost, obstacle, or trade-off dramatized on the page. Agency requires a choice that forecloses a path; here the protagonist executes a plan unopposed.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—teaching navigation by starlight—is signaled early but never tightened or tested. Elara faces no opposition, renunciation, or live trade-off. The lesson proceeds smoothly; the alien affirms rather than complicates. No reversal narrows options or deepens cost. The ending ("tomorrow, she would teach...") defers agency off the page. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should accumulate and reweight; here it plateaus in exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—seventeen catatonic residents whose voices are stolen—is signaled early and tightens when the photograph's faces begin to fade, raising the urgency. Mara's agency is primarily observational: she follows pulses, interprets the photograph, and decodes the pattern, then runs toward the source. The story delivers one meaningful pressure point (the fading photograph) that narrows options under the causal lens, and the resolution reports a rescue with implied cost ("refusing to let vulnerable voices disappear"). However, the climactic basement confrontation is elided entirely, so the escalation's final turn and the visible price paid remain off-page, capping the score in the strong-but-not-exceptional band.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (honoring the promise to remember Marcus and his team) is signaled early and tightens when the tidal deadline forces extraction priority. The phase-chamber discovery narrows options—she can retrieve the body or the encoded messages, choosing the journal as portable witness. Agency is clear: Elena's choice to adjust the chamber field and her decision to withhold explanation from the surface both foreclose paths with visible cost (annual return, permanent silence). The invisible threat contained by the team's sacrifice raises existential weight without requiring on-page confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: reconnecting with and understanding the digital ghost. Pressure accumulates through the ink-pattern ritual and the heartbeat count accelerating as Marcus approaches contact. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ghost reveals itself as evolution rather than error, narrowing Marcus's options to acceptance or rejection. The final choice—to exist in both forms and teach others—is earned by the prior accumulation, though the move to "teach others" in the penultimate paragraph introduces a new external stake that slightly diffuses focus. Cost is legible: he forecloses correcting the error, accepting permanent duality.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake (preserving Thuvenli before it dies at dawn) is signaled early and pursued through concrete actions: dropping into the canyon, activating the diamond, humming with the towers. One meaningful tightening occurs when she feels the language's death through the diamond at dawn. However, the cost is asserted rather than dramatized—we're told she vanished and became a tower, but the sacrifice feels like mythic inevitability rather than a choice that forecloses options with visible price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.2)
    One dominant stake is signaled early: understanding and completing the Thunderbird transformation. The midpoint tightening—realizing grief anchors the incomplete returns—narrows Marina's tactics, but the escalation occurs mostly through dialogue and explanation rather than a constrained choice under visible pressure. The final decision to "join them" lacks on-page cost; Marina's renunciation of her FBI role and the risk of becoming "something else" are asserted but not dramatized with a felt trade-off or visible forfeiture in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—reawakening beauty versus mechanical enforcement—is signaled early and remains coherent. Escalation is causal and protagonist-driven: Lira's playing causes the first statue to falter, then others stop, then clockwork hearts shatter, culminating in the orchard's chaotic bloom. The cost is legible: enforcement squadrons approach, and Lira must "play herself empty," forecloses safety for transformation. One meaningful tightening when the first heart shatters raises immediate stakes. The seed and trees uprooting add tactical resources but don't resolve—the enforcement threat remains. Agency is clear throughout: Lira's weeks of preparation and active performance drive every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—delivering forbidden messages and the thunderstorm bottle—is clear, but escalation is minimal. Ezra faces no on-page obstacle or reversal; the Keeper arrives on cue, accepts the bottle, and vanishes. The "brittle hush" and twilight timing suggest tension, but no choice narrows options or raises cost. The resolution is a continuation of the status quo rather than a turn that forecloses a path with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: Emil's craft and silence as "possibility—a canvas waiting for the right sound." The fragment discovery tightens options; the stumble redirects; the angel encounter forces the choice to sing. One meaningful pressure point (fitting the fragment, which invites speech) escalates under the accumulative lens. Agency is decision with visible cost: breaking seven years of silence, voice cracking. The oasis arrival involves coincidence (stumble, hidden curtain) but complicates rather than resolves; the singing choice is Emil's.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—finding "the place where stories live"—is signaled early and remains coherent. The piece offers one meaningful deepening (the marginalia in his grandmother's handwriting) that shifts Marcus's understanding, but no on-page tightening narrows his options or forces a trade-off. The midnight vision is presented as revelation rather than a choice under pressure, and no visible price is paid; Marcus returns to his shift unchanged in tactics or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—give form to grandmother's lost love vs. preserve her own capacity for feeling—is signaled early and tightens at the smallest island. The warming leaving her chest is a legible on-page cost. The figure's extension and Mara's choice to set down the palette narrow options with visible consequence. However, the escalation relies on a single pivot rather than compounding pressure; the seven years of prior searching are summarized, so the final choice feels somewhat abrupt despite its thematic clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.9)
    One dominant stake—freeing the imprisoned idea—is signaled early. The story attempts escalation through the "web of interconnected fears" that Vera must untangle, but the method remains abstract; we do not see her make a tactical choice that narrows options or trades one cost for another. The "last tumbler of fear clicking open" is a declared victory rather than a dramatized turn where her agency forecloses a path. Hours pass "or perhaps seconds," eroding the sense of mounting pressure. The ending delivers a thematic victory but lacks a visible on-page price that reshapes Vera's situation or stance.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—recover Gran's stolen memories—is signaled early and pursued throughout. Pressure accumulates via clues (journal, constellations, shipwreck names) that deepen Margaret's understanding, culminating in her reaching into the ring. However, no on-page reversal tests her commitment; she encounters no resistance, counteroffer, or cost that forces a trade-off. The climax is a granted wish rather than an earned turn, and the "heavy mind" consequence is told, not shown to alter tactics or options. One tightening deepening occurs (realizing she's the backup plan) but escalation flatlines at the ring.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (reversing the mother's exile) is signaled early and tightens through the annotation sequence. The reversal/tightening occurs when Kess shifts from demanding immediate answers to collaborative work, and the deepening when she grasps the dual purpose (rescue and self-preservation). Agency is shared but clear: Elara's choice to teach rather than simply hand over the solution, and Kess's choice to engage despite anger. The cost is visible in Kess's aging eyes and Elara's acknowledgment of past betrayal. Pressure coheres under the Causal lens. One meaningful escalation (anger → understanding) is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story declares high stakes (preserving magic, mending a wound in wonder) but never dramatizes meaningful opposition or cost. Mira's plan unfolds exactly as conceived with no setbacks, adaptations, or prices paid—no stamina drain, no risk of failure, no trade-off between competing goods. The "great withering" and "those who forgot how to dream" are backdrop exposition, not active pressure. The piece lacks a tightening beat where options narrow or a deepening where new information changes tactics; Mira simply executes her ritual and succeeds. Agency is present (she makes the choice to plant), but without visible cost or friction, the escalation flatlines.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—grounding restless spirits—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Escalation operates through accumulation: each knot releases fragments, the interlaced hush deepens, spirits materialize. However, the process unfolds without reversal or meaningful complication; Mira's work proceeds smoothly from first knot to completion. The resolution feels inevitable rather than hard-won, lacking the tightening choice or visible tradeoff that would elevate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding the henge's location and the chapel's silent communication—is signaled early and tightens through the video comparison and map analysis. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the homeless teenagers are unknowing participants, reweighting her investigation from archival to participatory. Agency is present in her decision to film herself and visit the coordinates, though these feel more like fulfillment than choices that narrow competing options. The pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but lacks a sharp trade-off or visible sacrifice at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding the captain's transmission and the "physics of letting go"—is signaled early and deepens when Marina discovers the journal and snow globe. One meaningful tightening: the air pocket contracts, forcing Marina to decide what to preserve and when to surface. Agency appears in her choice to write her own note and seal the artifacts, accepting that the library will flood. The cost is visible (the library reclaimed within hours) and felt (transformation from mystery-solver to transmitter). Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through density increase and the cadence shift at closure, though the escalation is more contemplative than crucible-driven; Marina's renunciation of total preservation (she leaves the library to flood) forecloses the path of complete recovery.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—giving voice to the ghost—is signaled early and pursued consistently. The storm provides a tightening window (lightning-to-thunder interval), and Chorus's use of the amplifier represents agency. However, no on-page reversal or escalating cost narrows her options; she succeeds without visible trade-off or tactical sacrifice. The ending delivers satisfaction without demonstrating what Chorus risked or lost, capping the score below 7.0 under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding Thorne's disappearance and its meaning for Mira's own isolation—signals early and tightens as each floor reveals more. One meaningful pressure point: the diary's message reframes "sorrow shared becomes joy discovered," forcing Mira to see her daily climb as parallel transformation rather than duty. Agency is primarily interpretive (decoding, realizing) until the final decision to return and "encrypt her own" joy; that choice forecloses ignorance but lacks a visible immediate cost or trade-off on the page. Escalation is more accumulative deepening than reversal-driven narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (proving Marcus's theory about atmospheric memory) is signaled early and pursued throughout. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening when Elena discovers that empty spaces not only remember but "gave their memories back," which reweights her mission under the Accumulative lens. Her refusal of rescue helicopters shows agency, though the escalation operates more through observational accumulation than a tightening that forecloses options. Cost is conceptual—a shift in understanding—rather than a visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—capture the library's essence before demolition—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens once when Lyra discovers the coin reveals "true purpose," forcing her to shift from charcoal/paint to light-craft. Agency is present but largely intellectual; her realization that "faces were merely one form of identity" feels more like thematic arrival than a decision that forecloses a live alternative. The final act (arranging mirrors, walking away with the coin) carries conceptual cost under the Accumulative lens: the portrait "existed now in memory and light," meaning physical preservation is abandoned. Pressure coheres but does not escalate through reversals; the piece deepens understanding rather than narrowing options under mounting opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—charting stranded luminance and decoding the phenomenon—is signaled early and sustains coherent pressure under the Accumulative lens. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara notices birds trace the hopscotch pattern in three-dimensional space, leading to the breakthrough. However, escalation lacks agency-driven cost: the discovery unfolds through observation rather than choice under competing pressures, and the resolution (following murmurations, adding points to the map) mirrors her opening task without visible trade-off or foreclosed path. No price is paid on the page; the ending restates purpose rather than reweighting options.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake is clear early: repair the celestial vault failure that left her village in darkness. One meaningful deepening occurs when the third prophecy fragment reframes the task from vault-opening to self-repair ("every lock she'd forced, every mechanism she'd rushed"). The mirrors showing her at different ages and the gears beginning to hum create pressure, and the transparent-wall vision tightens urgency by showing the village still wrapped in darkness. Agency is present in her choice to descend and wait for the eclipse rather than force another attempt, and the three-month delay is a visible cost. However, the core conflict—learning patience versus forcing locks—resolves through mirror-vision and gear arrangement rather than through a protagonist choice under duress; the turn feels granted rather than earned through her grappling with a lock or gear that resists her.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—saving the orchards and restoring community—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when Marina discovers the fungal network pattern and writes messages to guide families toward collaboration. However, escalation is largely external: the families respond to Marina's clues without on-page friction or resistance that Marina must overcome. The resolution (networked root systems, mounted bell) lands, but the protagonist's agency is observational orchestration rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost to her.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—adjusting humanity's countdown—is signaled early but never faces on-page opposition or a tightening choice that narrows options. Marcus discovers, understands, and acts without internal conflict or external resistance. The transformation from mathematics to melody is a deepening of method, but it arrives through mystical revelation rather than a pressure-driven pivot with visible cost. No meaningful reversal or escalating complication forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake is established early: save the travelers before frost while protecting them from the cursed orchard. The "three hours until frost" provides escalating pressure, and Mara's decision to give away the walnut—her last link to potential freedom—meaningfully tightens her situation. The mechanical birds' obstruction forces her to use her specific ability, and the father's desperation creates urgency. The cost is legible: by giving the seed to the child, Mara forecloses her own path to freedom, committing to her role as caretaker. The lie-that-saves ("There's a shelter...") demonstrates tactical intelligence under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (reconciliation with Elena) is signaled immediately and sustained. The foam-watching sequence provides one meaningful deepening that shifts Marina's frame from control to flexibility. Agency is present in the decision to text and in accepting the invitation. However, the escalation is primarily internal/observational rather than tested by external pressure—no complication arises between insight and resolution, and Elena's reciprocal study removes friction from what could have been a riskier reach-out.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: the child wants to unknow endings so her grandfather's story never concludes. One meaningful tightening when Merrick warns endings are woven through everything and she insists anyway. Agency at closure is renunciation by the child (she accepts the transformation) and recognition by Merrick (his shop exists to transform, not sell), but both read as realizations rather than decisions that foreclose live options with visible cost. The procedure itself—using bottled moonlight to dissolve endings—unfolds without obstacles, setbacks, or visible prices paid that alter later tactics. Escalation is minimal; the child's resolve is stated, Merrick proceeds, transformation occurs. No coincidence resolves, but protagonist choices don't drive the turn so much as the conceptual premise does.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to subsume the fortress's stored remorse—is signaled clearly and escalates through accumulative pressure as Miran feels the emotional contagion spreading. The binary choice ("walk away" vs. "subsume it all") arrives with visible cost: hours pass, her body becomes heavy, she carries "digested grief of ages." However, the opposition is entirely internal; there's no external constraint testing her commitment, and the resolution proceeds without complication once she commits. The price is legible but the escalation is linear rather than tightened by reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—rehabilitating the dying agricultural district—is signaled early but never tested on the page. Marta's plan succeeds without reversal, complication, or visible cost; the elevators respond immediately, neighbors emerge without resistance, and cooperation blooms overnight. No credible opposition or internal friction appears to narrow her options. The story declares escalation ("coaxing decades of isolation from the structures like drawing poison from a wound") but dramatizes only smooth execution, leaving pressure flat across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—to decode entangled memories and become "the archeologist of abandoned dreams"—is signaled early. However, escalation is minimal: Vera arrives prepared, administers the injections without difficulty, and catalogues seventeen dream-patterns by dawn. No opposition, failure, or forced trade-off tightens her path. The "tremors through her consciousness" and sensory bleed-through read as texture rather than obstacles that narrow options. The final image of carrying "interrupted futures" lacks a visible cost—no forfeiture, no path foreclosed, no tactical constraint imposed by the work.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—retrieving dangerous knowledge combinations before gravity rights—is signaled early and tightens through the grotto descent. One meaningful escalation occurs when Orin discovers the sealed-wing method but must choose whether to memorize it, a choice that narrows options (can't unknow it). The cost is conceptual rather than visceral: Orin becomes the next keeper in an unending cycle. Agency is present but the price feels more thematic than felt; no visible trade-off (stamina, injury, social credit) alters tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—freeing trapped sound—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure deepens as Mira coaxes vibrations from the tree, adding layers until a symphony emerges. However, there is no reversal or tightening that narrows options; the process unfolds smoothly without resistance or trade-off. The ending offers continuation ("tomorrow she would return") rather than a decisive choice that forecloses a path. Accumulative deepening is present, but the absence of visible cost or constraint on this particular act caps the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Viktor will return to the Academy—is signaled early and the piece delivers one meaningful deepening when he articulates his choice to stay. However, the escalation is muted because Viktor's decision feels settled before the story opens; Mira's question serves as prompt rather than genuine pressure. The cost of staying is told ("forecloses the Academy path") but not dramatized as a live temptation he must resist on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: open the grandmother's diary to recover what it has "stolen." Pressure accumulates through Mara's months of scanner-building and tightens in real time as she hunts the frequency while the city counts down to midnight. The tightening is modest—one meaningful adjustment cycle that narrows to "one final decimal point"—but it forecloses her mechanical-lock approach and forces her into the resonance method, which fits the Accumulative lens. The cost at closure is conceptual: patience over force, empathy over technical mastery. However, the protagonist's agency in the climactic beat feels automated; the scanner does the work once tuned, and Mara's final choice is more reception than decision, which limits the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Mira's need to pass her herbalist test by cultivating the corpse flower—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure accumulates through her sensitive nose detecting threats (soil acidity, fungal risk, seed germination) and through the plant's slow growth cycle. However, escalation is largely summary-driven ("days dissolved into weeks") rather than a visible on-page tightening that narrows her options; the breakthrough moment is reflective rather than a tactical choice under fire, and the mockery from other apprentices never complicates her work in scene. The bloom itself arrives as culmination rather than climax—there is no reversal, no moment where success threatens to slip away. The cost of her patience (time, isolation, enduring mockery) is implied but not dramatized as a trade-off that forces a hard choice at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (find resilience source for colony survival) is signaled early and pursued throughout. The Inversion provides a ticking constraint, and the grove discovery tightens options. However, escalation lacks on-page agency: Kessa observes the trees' indifference to gravity, then the monument "floods" knowledge into her—she does not wrestle a choice or pay a visible price. The resolution is handed to her by the environment rather than earned through a decision that forecloses a path. Cost is conceptual but not legible as forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding the convergence to prevent global disaster—is signaled early and tightens once (expanding millimeters per hour, threatening to engulf city within two years). Maya's device installation shifts from investigation to prevention, but this pivot feels inevitable rather than earned through a trade-off that forecloses another path. No reversal tests her commitment; the convergence waits passively. The cost is stated (town remains silent, six-month timeline) but not dramatized as a choice that narrows her options under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—saving wonder and the bells from destruction—is signaled early and remains coherent. The piece delivers one meaningful tightening when Lyrian realizes the notation is "written for the aurora itself," shifting her approach. However, escalation is smooth rather than costly: no loss, injury, or visible tradeoff narrows her options. The resolution lands entirely in her favor (Council signatures erased, world remembers how to dream) without testing commitment or forcing a choice between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding the flute's true purpose—is signaled early and tightens when Kessa plays the new song, braiding worlds instead of sealing them. The figure's emergence and the seed-gift deepen the revelation. However, the escalation lacks a second pressure point: no resistance from the Other Place, no physical or social cost visible in the moment. The tightening is conceptual (old method wrong, new method right) but the final act proceeds without friction, limiting felt cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: preserving personalities/stars through transposed empathy, signaled early ("each borrowed personality left traces"). Pressure accumulates as stars vanish and borrowed selves argue, creating internal turbulence. The halo fragment intensifies the transposition mid-piece, forcing Mira deeper into another's grief. The ending tightens understanding but does not foreclose a tactical path with visible cost—she continues her work, now enlightened. One meaningful deepening present; escalation reads more as revelation than choice under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding the pendant and Corvin's fate—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is limited to a single deepening moment (the Luminari manifestation) rather than a series of tightening choices. Elara's agency is minimal; the Luminari approach her, and knowledge "floods through" without resistance or trade-off. The resolution (acceptance of the courier role with new depth) lacks visible cost: no live option is foreclosed, no stamina or tool is spent, and no relationship altered. The "tremor as resonance" reframe is thematic rather than a tactical consequence of prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: prove objects absorb emotions to redeem her academic standing. The frost-pattern discovery functions as intensification under the Accumulative lens, deepening sensory evidence. However, escalation lacks a turn that narrows options or imposes visible cost—Vera photographs the patterns before they fade, but no trade-off or sacrifice accompanies this success. The Institute's future response is projected, not tested on the page. Agency remains observational rather than renunciative or decisional.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (rescue the daughter) is signaled early and sustained. The escalation tightens through causal pressure: photograph → police failure → ancient craft as last option → weaving → memory sacrifice → message received. Agency is clear: Mei chooses to weave despite understanding the cost her ancestors paid. The price is visible on-page (losing her own name, but clutching proof of success). One meaningful tightening through the weaving sequence narrows options to this single, terrible method.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (forging a blade from the silk to restore bartered awakenings). One meaningful tightening occurs when Korin discovers the silk's true nature in the chamber. However, escalation is largely internal summary—"Hours passed, or perhaps days"—and the forging sequence avoids concrete obstacles. The merchant's trembling recognition provides a reversal, but it occurs without prior friction or cost legible on the page. Agency reads as intention rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—finding her mother and understanding the withheld truth—is signaled early and pursued across parallel universes. The revelation that map-makers damage reality provides a meaningful deepening, and Kira's proposal to "map the repairs" narrows the tactical path. However, the escalation is driven more by revelation than by Kira's choices under rising pressure; she discovers rather than decides until the final beat. The cost of the new path is promised ("vast work ahead") but not felt on the page as a visible trade-off or foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: protect the keepers and restore the light. The lamp's death creates urgency, and Elsa's climb tightens options. However, the confrontation lacks a meaningful reversal—Jonas reveals the trap (snuffed lamp to summon her), but Elsa accepts without resistance. The final act (lighting the lamp with intention) is a clear alteration, yet it bypasses the escalation test: no competing goods, no tactical failure that raises cost. The ghosts' relief provides thematic closure but not a contested choice that narrows Elsa's options under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—guiding lost ships—is signaled early but never narrows Mira's options or forces a trade-off. Each ship arrives and is guided successfully without failure, adaptation, or visible cost. The mirror-twin encounter offers a reversal opportunity but resolves through collaboration ("together they began to laugh in harmony") rather than a choice that forecloses a path. The final state is declared as evolution without an on-page price: no tactic altered, no resource spent, no relationship cost paid. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through density or cadence shift that reweights the stake; instead, the ending inflates scope ("shepherd...the very dawn itself") without grounding consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (learning to bear the story-magnetizing heart) is signaled early and tightens when Chen names the donor and the burden. One meaningful turn occurs: Kael shifts from absorbing to illuminating stories, and the morpho wing demonstration reweights his approach. Agency is present but passive—he asks "Teach me" and receives instruction; no on-page refusal or competing desire tests his commitment. The cost (stories "growing heavier") is told rather than dramatized in a choice that forecloses a live option. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is sufficient but gentle; a visible price paid in the moment would lift this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: understanding the labyrinth's true purpose, signaled early through Marcus's maintenance role and deepened when the broken sextant reveals hidden patterns. Pressure escalates through accumulation: discovery of encoded grief → translation of microscopic notations → the pin-drop silence moment → comprehension of the labyrinth as "machine for processing sorrow." Marcus's agency drives the resolution (deconstruction and realignment), with the cost being transformation of his role from preserver to innovator. The storm provides external pressure but remains somewhat decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: rekindle dawn to save the realm. Pressure escalates from solitary rituals to communal singing, with one meaningful tightening when other voices join and the trees respond. The protagonist's agency drives the turn—she begins singing and others follow. The ending forecloses solitary salvation with visible cost (daily collective effort). However, the escalation feels slightly smooth; no major reversal complicates the singing before success, and the alchemical response feels granted rather than hard-won. The cost is legible but not viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: Can Ezra use his empathetic gift to help without drowning in another's pain? One meaningful tightening occurs when her grief threatens to overwhelm him yet he chooses closeness at calculated distance. The woman's recognition and Ezra's teaching both narrow options—he can no longer hide, she gains a new frame for her loss. Agency is clear (his decision to approach, her nod), and the cost is felt: both accept perpetual isolation as the price of compassion. However, the woman's telegram problem resolves via Ezra's reframe without her enacting a costly choice of her own, reducing escalation pressure in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (Lila follows impossible bread to hidden spaces). The tea house discovery is a meaningful tightening, and the woman's explanation deepens Lila's understanding of her gift. However, escalation is gentle; Lila faces no live choice between competing goods or trade-offs. The resolution (she will plant more gardens) is affirmed rather than earned through on-page friction. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices, but cost clarity is low.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—preserve humanity's most sacred promises before the library collapses—is signaled immediately and tightens through the protagonist's measurement work. One meaningful pressure point occurs when Elara discovers the founder's slide, which forces a choice between completing her triage and understanding the archive's original purpose. The resolution is driven by protagonist agency (her vow to begin again) with visible cost: she accepts the library's destruction and her own survival as the seed of a new archive, foreclosing the path of total preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: gather evidence before sunrise while maintaining cover. Mae's agency drives the tightening—her bloodline gambit opens access, the badge reveal forces the woman's ultimatum, and Mae's choice to continue recording forecloses return. The woman's warning "you have until the tide changes" narrows options with a visible cost. One credible reversal when trust breaks; the escalation from failed attempts to successful infiltration to exposure and exile is earned and causal.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—learning why some carry weather—is signaled early but never tested through on-page trade-offs or escalating costs. Marina's journey from skeptic to weather-carrier unfolds through passive receipt of information (Simon explains, the tree transmits, she feels truth) rather than decisions under pressure. No meaningful tightening occurs; the convergence complicates atmosphere but does not force Marina to forfeit anything or choose between competing paths. Coincidence (three others arrive simultaneously) drives resolution rather than protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—unlocking suppressed creativity—signaled early via broken lock and sister's note. One meaningful tightening: setting down sketchbook to draw on stone forecloses reproduction safety with visible cost (unprecedented work outside perfect recall). Agency clear in renunciation of memory-based method. Pressure accumulates through discovery sequence but the cave journey lacks a complicating reversal; each beat affirms rather than tests her readiness. Cost legible: she creates something she cannot control or catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (finding grandmother's letter and learning why it never arrived) is signaled early and tightens through the map reconstruction, junction discovery, and water-diversion revelation. Escalation is causal and protagonist-driven: Vera chooses to follow the map despite danger, then chooses to transcribe and deliver all suppressed truths despite knowing the social cost. The water conspiracy revelation narrows options from personal mystery to civic reckoning, and the final decision to deliver every message forecloses the path of complicit silence with on-page cost ("watching the greenhouse city's carefully maintained peace dissolve").

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving the color of wonder before the ice melts—is signaled early and sustained with visible urgency. The pressure tightens through the fragment's accelerating melt and Mariel's adjustment sequence. The resolution is earned by her agency (pressing the fragment to the bell), and the cost is legible: the original ice is consumed to achieve permanence. One deepening occurs when the bells learn the frequency and spread it. The accumulative lens holds; coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—resolving internal static before fragmentation becomes irreversible—is signaled early and escalates through the burn sequence. Each fear processed narrows options and transforms M-47's understanding, creating meaningful pressure under the Accumulative lens. The cost is legible: forty years of isolation, accepting permanent incompleteness, burying the empty box where "future fears could take root." However, the escalation feels somewhat methodical rather than desperate; M-47's control throughout the ritual reduces tension compared to a protagonist struggling against failure.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—reconnecting Elena with her daughter's letters—is signaled early and tightens through escalation (locket → backstory → shelter visit → postal search). One meaningful reversal occurs when the letters are found, forcing Elena to choose between isolation and community; the cost (accepting the courtyard over waiting alone) is felt but not deeply conflicted on the page. Jorge's nephew and the neighbors' mobilization arrive as solutions rather than hard-won agency, softening protagonist-driven escalation. The price is relational but lacks a visible trade-off that forecloses an equally viable path.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.2)
    One dominant stake—unlocking the encrypted research—is signaled early and pursued linearly. However, escalation lacks meaningful tightening or cost: Maya performs the dance, systems respond in rhythm, reversal completes without friction or mistake. No live option is foreclosed; the "patient defiance" described in narration never translates to an on-page trade-off (stamina cost, risk of structural collapse, moral calculus about releasing dangerous knowledge). The backward-step reversal offers structural elegance but no visible price that alters her final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (finding where deleted memories go) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Marina digs and discovers the vials. The choice at the grave—keep one, bury the rest—narrows options with visible cost: she forgoes total restoration and accepts managed grief. Agency is renunciation with on-page price. The whale's causal role (revealing fluctuations rather than causing them) reweights the city's system and deepens pressure without requiring a second reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is clear early: silence a prophecy that threatens to become self-fulfilling. Pressure accumulates through the night as prophecy fragments struggle and she gathers each one, patient and methodical. The tightening occurs when "wars prevented, loves that would never bloom, a kingdom that would never fall" press against her barriers with "blazing potential energy"—the cost of dispersal becomes legible. However, the protagonist's agency is execution of a learned method rather than a choice under competing pressures; coincidence does not intrude, but genuine escalation through forced trade-offs is absent. The resolution is earned by her decades of preparation, but the final act feels procedural rather than forged in the crucible of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—Elara's desire to share her architectural linguistics and Marcus's parallel ability—is signaled early and coheres through their conversation. Pressure accumulates through Marcus's repeated visits and his revelation about his grandmother, but no reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off. The "teach me" moment is a natural convergence rather than a turn under duress. Cost is conceptual (mutual vulnerability) but not legible as a forfeited path or visible price. One tightening (his admission) raises intimacy but does not escalate stakes with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—recovering quarantined memories—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when Marina digs and finds the second shell half, narrowing her choice to integration or continued emptiness. However, the resolution lacks on-page resistance or visible trade-off; Marina simply "chose how to remember" without dramatized cost or a path visibly foreclosed. The whispers guide her without complication, and the final flood of memories arrives as gift rather than earned through struggle. Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening is present but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake (her brother's life versus the family's secret legacy) is signaled early and clear. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mei moves from planning forgery to choosing confession, but this turn lacks a visible price paid in the moment—no immediate consequence, no tactical shift forced by opposition. The escalation reads as internal realization rather than pressure narrowing options. The resolution is driven by Mei's agency (writing the confession), but coincidence plays a role (the key's sudden revelation of grandmother's message). Cost is conceptual (ending the bloodline's practice) but not felt as a trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding why some people echo—is signaled early and tightens when the shell reveals the disappeared singers' fate. The revelation that echo singers become "something else" meaningfully narrows Senna's options to accept or refuse transformation. However, the escalation lacks a second pressure point; once the choice crystallizes, no obstacle or doubt tests her commitment before she acts. The cost of leaving "everything behind" is declared but not dramatized through a visible sacrifice or foreclosed alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.0)
    One dominant stake emerges: decoding the antidote formula to fulfill the Cassandra passengers' purpose. The stakes deepen when twelve more globes are revealed, but this expansion occurs via exposition without on-page cost—Marina simply accepts the larger mission. No live option is foreclosed; she climbs toward the surface with resolve intact. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres but the tightening is conceptual rather than tactical, and no trade-off alters her immediate path.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—appreciating and enacting hidden effort—is signaled early and remains coherent under the Accumulative lens. Pressure accumulates through pattern layering (fireflies, net knots, moon fractals, whispers) rather than causal reversal. However, there is no on-page tightening that narrows options or forces a trade-off; the net-mender completes her task as intended without complication, obstacle, or cost that alters her tactics. The final image reweights prior material but does not foreclose a path or dramatize a price paid. Agency is present (she chooses to climb, mend, whistle) but never tested by friction or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: whether to expose the conspiracy or preserve the sanctuary. The story tightens once through the letter revelations, which transform Marcus's mission from debunking a myth to confronting suppressed lifesaving knowledge. The final choice—scattering evidence while reburying the diamond—narrows options and carries visible cost (he returns to the wasteland; truth remains incomplete). Agency is clear in the climactic actions. However, the escalation compresses: the pivot from "worldview tilting" to the final decision lacks an intermediate test that forces Marcus to weigh competing costs on the page. The dust storm's approach adds urgency but doesn't functionally constrain his choice (he completes the work before it arrives).

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—preparing the way for the Prophet—is signaled early but never tested or tightened on the page. No reversal, choice, or renunciation alters Marlowe's options; she broadcasts, listens, and succeeds without friction or visible cost. The storm provides atmospheric pressure but does not force tactical shifts or trade-offs. Agency is absent; Marlowe observes and documents rather than making decisions that foreclose paths or narrow options under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Marcus's search for the music box's owner and his yearning for purpose—is clear. The turn occurs when he finds Elena, and the reunion is emotionally weighted. However, the escalation is modest: the beach walk is methodical rather than pressured, and no live obstacles complicate delivery. The resolution (documentary filmmaker contact, archive established) arrives through Elena's grandson off-page, luck rather than Marcus's agency at the closure moment. The cost of remaining in the loft is asserted but not dramatized as a trade-off Marcus actively weighs.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake signaled early: protect the artifact from the Collectors and preserve the covenant with the drift. One meaningful tightening occurs when the Collectors burst through the outer door just as Mira achieves resonance, forcing the final transformation. Agency reads as renunciation—she forfeits her human form with visible cost (the folded coat, "merely human"). The Collectors' arrival functions as external pressure but they never confront her on-page, so the escalation is more atmospheric than interactive.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—unyoking humanity from synchronized thought—is signaled early and sustained. Kira's seventeen winters of tracking establish the patient accumulation; the polarity shift and copper-rod placement constitute one meaningful tightening that forecloses the old configuration. The arrival of Tomás and the confirmation of twelve sanctuaries raise the scope without diluting focus. However, the Council's response and the people's confusion remain off-page and abstract; we don't see a trade-off Kira must make in the moment (a relationship, a personal safety margin, a moral ambiguity) that would charge the final image with immediate, felt cost. The revolution's success feels assured rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—Margot's professional imprisonment versus liberation—is signaled but never tested on the page. No supervisor appears, no protocol forces a live trade-off, no pension or case-file consequence materializes. Jerome's struggle is recounted memory, not present opposition. The resignation is an unopposed internal decision with no visible cost: she pulls out her phone and quits, then walks away. The piece claims transformation but provides no on-page reversal where staying or leaving narrows future options or exacts immediate price.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Eliza can accept Thomas's apology made tangible—is signaled early and tightens once when she opens the journal and sees his diagrams, shifting her options from refusal to participation. The escalation is driven by Eliza's agency: choosing to follow her brother's instructions is a visible trade-off between maintaining her grievance and attempting repair. Cost is felt: "He deserved worse than he got" names the moral calculus, and the final line confirms she's chosen to rebuild "even stronger than before" rather than preserve the break. The single meaningful deepening fits this length; no coincidence resolves the core tension.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—Pioneer's drive to transliterate the arrow tip's meaning and transcend cart-glider limitations—is signaled early and sustained. The workshop's swaying and other gliders' mockery provide ambient pressure. However, escalation is more accumulative than narrowing: Pioneer works steadily without setbacks, opposition, or forced trade-offs. The dive represents agency, but seventeen dissolved predecessors establish a cost Pioneer then bypasses entirely when "the acid didn't dissolve her." The transformation succeeds without visible sacrifice, making the stakes retroactively decorative rather than binding.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear early: find where deleted files (and missing persons) go. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lila realizes users are compressed into the archive and her father is among them, raising the personal cost. The final choice—initiating the protocol—narrows options and forecloses her prior existence with visible cost. Agency is strong: she creates breadcrumbs before transforming. Minor deduction: the escalation from discovery to choice could be stretched by one beat to show her weighing the decision under more friction.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding the temporal anomaly—is signaled early but never escalates into a dilemma that forces trade-offs. Mira encounters no meaningful opposition; the keeper is an ally who explains rather than resists. The merchant's backstory provides narrative texture but does not create present tension. No on-page reversal tightens options or deepens cost; Mira's departure with the apple is confirmation of understanding, not a choice with visible sacrifice or foreclosed alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Marlene sought death but now seeks understanding of endings. Pressure accumulates through the night vigil, the three AM calving, and Jakob's call for evacuations. One meaningful tightening: the calving reweights her understanding from expected dramatics to "quiet, a folding inward." Agency is present as endurance and attention, though the final decision to remain is more stance crystallization than a choice that visibly forecloses another live option with on-page cost. The coincidence of the calving event complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Marcus's solitary vigil ending, confronting unresolved loss—is signaled early and tightens when the daughter arrives with Elena's letters, forcing him to choose between clinging to the fragment or opening to transmission. However, the escalation is mostly situational (the daughter's arrival is coincidence, not Marcus's agency) and the final turn lacks visible cost: he gestures to the bench without renouncing the fragment on the page or dramatizing internal resistance. The vineyard's cross-pollination provides thematic parallel but does not constrain Marcus's choices in the present scene. One pressure point exists (Elena's death and the daughter's request), sufficient for this length, but the resolution feels offered rather than wrested from Marcus.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: preserve wisdom echoes before they fade. The tightening occurs when the line walker declares "must act tonight" and the consecration sequence narrows the threat. However, the escalation is asserted ("faster than anticipated") rather than demonstrated through a reversal that forecloses options. No live constraint forces a trade-off; the group completes every clearing without visible cost, opposition, or failure. The work-continues-forever ending registers as Charged Poise conceptually but lacks the felt price or foreclosed path that would elevate the score.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is preservation and collective healing, signaled early. Escalation reads as accumulative density increase: five workers → thirty → one hundred, then the exhibition brings "hundreds." Yet the town council's demolition deadline ("next month") is declared once and never tightens on the page—no countdown, no interference, no visible cost when Elara acts. The exhibition unfolds without friction: visitors arrive, find their spots, the spiral forms, camera clicks. Agency is present (Elara designs the treasure hunt, invites descendants) but no choice forecloses a live alternative with felt price. The resolution is generous coincidence—everyone shows up, everyone cooperates—rather than earned through protagonist sacrifice or trade-off. Pressure coheres but never narrows options under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—proving language still evolves—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Elena's decision to testify and her method ("fractured sequences") represent agency, but the escalation lacks a live trade-off or narrowing: the Committee summons her, she arrives prepared, and her testimony unfolds as planned without on-page resistance or cost. The crystal "sang with reflected sound" in the final beat, but no reversal or deepening alters tactics; the Committee's lean-in suggests interest, not a price paid or path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: locating "the exact sound of time passing through a human body" (seven-year quest). The woman's arrival tightens pressure by offering a concrete specimen (grandmother's voice aging). One meaningful reversal: they find the frequency, fulfilling the quest but not resolving Ezra's amnesia—his recursive role persists. Agency is split: Ezra guides, the woman seeks, but the discovery feels collaborative rather than driven by protagonist choice under pressure. Cost is legible (Ezra remains trapped in his cycle), though the woman's breakthrough costs her little on the page beyond tears.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to escape or repair the temporal mechanism—is signaled early and tightens when the camera reveals the clock is "counting down to something." The tuning fork intervention creates one meaningful reversal: the hand slows, revealing time-threads anchoring the station, which lets Ezra "restructure the system differently." The cost is legible but somewhat abstract: she forgoes escape velocity to become permanent keeper, though the emotional or opportunity price of that renunciation could be sharpened. The tremors escalate pressure coherently under the Hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Maya must model "how to find [music] in living with knowledge of the end" for her patients after receiving terminal results. One meaningful tightening occurs when she decides to record the hospice sounds and reunify them with the broken Beethoven fragment, a choice that forecloses private grieving in favor of public pedagogy. The final gathering enacts that choice with the conceptual cost of using her remaining weeks for others rather than herself. No on-page reversals or obstacles test her commitment; the project proceeds smoothly from decision to execution. Coincidence does not resolve, but the lack of friction (no equipment failure, no patient resistance, no physical collapse) keeps pressure atmospheric rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—stopping reality loops before they spiral—is signaled clearly. Lyra's insertion of the key and recognition of the inverted sealing rune form a meaningful tightening. Yet the escalation is smooth and intellectual rather than pressured by a live decision; the automaton's reversal and her tracing of runes feel sequential discoveries more than escalating trade-offs. No on-page loss or visible cost that alters tactics; the ending lands as task completion rather than a narrowed path.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (reconciling loss and transformation) signals early and tightens through the tooth exchange. The reversal—Thomas returning the tooth rather than keeping it—is protagonist-driven and narrows options (accepting departure over clinging). Cost is legible: he works alone in the garden, Elara leaves, and his forgiveness becomes "a form of innovation" that forecloses resentment. The escalation is a single deepening rather than multiple turns, fitting the length, though the pressure could intensify more sharply before the exchange. "Will you stay this time?" crystallizes the want/need conflict with visible tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—guide ships without the lighthouse—is signaled early and remains coherent. One tightening: the glass glows, Marina climbs to the entrance, and the beacon works immediately, altering the fleet's course. Agency is present but smooth: Marina discovers, then shares; no reversal or trade-off tests her commitment. The fishermen's instant adoption and request to learn involve no friction or cost beyond Marina's time. The resolution is earned by her polishing work and grandfather's setup, but coincidence aids (the glass "just" begins to glow; the grotto's acoustics "just" amplify). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens yet never forces a choice between competing goods or unavoidable harms on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Kira's healing through reclamation versus the viral confession's demand for public response—is signaled early and held throughout. One meaningful pressure point: Marcus's arrival tests whether she'll remain solitary or extend her practice. However, no cost is visible when she agrees to teach him; the "slow work" is promised but not begun with friction. The viral story functions more as backdrop texture than active antagonist. The ice-pattern metaphor deepens thematic weight but does not narrow tactical options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake: resolve the novel's refusal to end. The pressure accumulates through Marina's reflection and the ritual, but the tightening is gradual and conceptual rather than urgent. The ceremony itself—placing the shell, speaking the release—lacks a live obstacle or cost that tests her commitment in real time. The stakes remain abstract (letting go of a writing philosophy) rather than viscerally felt, and no secondary pressure complicates the decision. One meaningful deepening is present (the realization at the ceremony) but it arrives smoothly without prior reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring the sacred practices—is signaled early and sustained throughout. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is smooth rather than deepening; each beat (humming, teaching, blooming) adds texture without narrowing options or imposing a trade-off. No reversal or tightening choice forces Elara to sacrifice, renounce, or endure with visible cost. The resolution arrives through patient faith and convenient alignment rather than protagonist agency that forecloses a path. The cost remains abstract and unfelt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—completing the heartbeat map—is signaled early and pursued methodically. One meaningful deepening occurs when the safekept starlight "remembers" and pools, shifting the pattern from arrangement to active cartography. Yet the piece never narrows options or forces a trade-off; every step succeeds without visible friction, and the ending ("carrying directions to everywhere that shouldn't exist") declares triumph without on-page cost or foreclosed path, limiting escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clearly established: understanding and documenting the temporal mechanism. Pressure accumulates through the wounded season's approaching end, which will heal the valley's temporal distortions and close Mara's observation window. The key deepening occurs when she realizes the mechanism "revealed more than it ever had while functional"—shifting from repair to documentation. Agency is renunciation with visible cost: she chooses not to fix it, foreclosing her professional purpose. One meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—Mara's compulsion to weave and collect weights—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the whalebone fractal's complexity and the moment when "objects remembered their purposes," but no on-page choice narrows her options or forces a trade-off. The piece describes escalating pattern-work without a reversal or visible cost; she begins and ends in the same position, boundary-lessly trapped by choice. The lack of a decision or renunciation that forecloses a path keeps this below the 8.0 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: how to process Thomas's death and unfinished projects after three years. One meaningful tightening occurs as the kettle countdown intersects with Margaret's accelerating carving: "The kettle's whistle began as a whisper. Margaret carved faster now, not rushed but purposeful." The piece operates under Accumulative lens; pressure coheres through deepening understanding rather than external antagonist. Agency manifests in the decision to carve "something else entirely" and the choice to begin teaching workshops, both foreclosing paths with visible cost (transforming private materials into public practice). The final act of sitting "with this roughed-out clock face that would never tell time, only hold it" reweights the opening question with cost made visible.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—negotiating with the ghost to reconcile eroded ambitions—is signaled early and tightens when Kira's "timeline snap[s] into focus" and she grasps that her role has transformed. Agency appears as renunciation (letting go of architect dreams) and acceptance (memory keeper), though the act of winding the camera wheel "one last click" is the only visible gesture that forecloses a path. The cost is conceptual and felt in the ghost's dissolution, but lacks a tangible trade-off or loss that would elevate pressure into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—decoding the terminal's hidden hydraulic equations—is signaled early but never escalates under pressure. Maya's professor "called it impossible," yet on the page she encounters no setback, miscalculation, or tradeoff; valves open, water flows, and the system "finds its rhythm" without complication. The carnival provides atmospheric setup but exerts no force on the present action. Coincidence (the sextant piece "wedged beneath a loosened floor panel") supplies the key without prior narrative investment.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether to accept the teaching position—is signaled by the second paragraph. The piece deepens through sensory and reflective accumulation rather than external opposition; no reversal tightens options. Elara's agency manifests as endurance and stance crystallization (Charged Poise), but the decision feels preordained by the invitation and her readiness. The cost (dividing time between worlds) is declared rather than tested on the page. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification occurs when petrichor triggers memory and shifts her internal posture.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding what she's been seeking—is signaled early and sustained. The sundial's hidden compartment provides one meaningful tightening that deepens knowledge and shifts Mara's understanding from external mysteries to internal evasion. However, the escalation is cognitive rather than enacted: no live option is foreclosed by a choice she makes on the page. The decision to confront her father is declared as future action, so the cost remains prospective rather than paid in the present scene. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening beat is sufficient, but the lack of on-page agency at closure limits the score.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving the fisherman's encoded knowledge—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation remains flat: Mara decodes without complication, and the resolution (teaching the granddaughter) is decided before the story opens. No on-page reversal tightens options or raises cost; the work proceeds methodically from first section to second without friction. Agency is present in the decoding labor but does not foreclose a live alternative or face a trade-off with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—to map the geography of healing—is signaled early and remains coherent under the Accumulative lens. Pressure accumulates through layered reflection and Marcus's projection appearance, yet no on-page reversal narrows Elara's options; the final decision to visit the weaver sisters reads as continuation rather than tightening. The thread's pulse "synchronizing with her heartbeat" suggests deepening, but without a prior fork or visible cost the escalation remains textural rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake (reanimate extinct beauty) is clear, but escalation is thin: Aldric assembles, monitors, waits—each beat is a repetition rather than a tightening. The hatching offers a micro-turn (the bird is flawed) but no on-page cost follows: he simply accepts it and the narrative tells us this is meaningful. "Days blurred into nights" compresses the vigil into summary, flattening pressure at a pivotal moment. The final claim that clockwork citizens "paused" lacks concrete dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is clearly signaled: proving transformation of inherited violence through the grafting ritual. One meaningful tightening occurs when she moves from passive memory to active binding of contradictory elements (father's rage, grandfather's craft, her own transformation). The warehouse-fire memory demonstrates agency—she "moved through the smoke like water"—though it arrives as reflection rather than present pressure. The ritual forecloses the option of remaining unbound to her legacy, with cost legible in "the coin's weight over her heart." Escalation under the Accumulative lens works through density increase rather than causal narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—liberating trapped memories—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. Marcus and the woman cooperate without friction; no reversal narrows options or raises price. The ritual at each fountain reads as serial repetition rather than escalation. Agency is passive: the feather does the work, and the geese resume flight without Marcus making a renunciatory or high-stakes choice. No visible cost forecloses a path or alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.6)
    The stated stake—"to share light without using fire"—is a philosophical motive, never tested by opposition or scarcity on the page. No reversal or tightening occurs; the Keeper drifts from one observation to the next without a moment where options narrow or cost escalates. The final paragraph declares "peace" without prior conflict or trade-off. The piece follows an accumulative lens but supplies no meaningful deepening or cadence shift that reweights the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—completing the memorial that honors collective grief—is signaled early and tightens through September and October as the monarchs grow restless. Martha's agency is decision and endurance under her grandfather's instruction, with the ribbon design emerging as connection rather than decoration. The families' arrival provides a meaningful test that validates the work. Cost is visible: the grandfather's presence fades with completion, and Martha continues the poem custom alone. One clear tightening as November approaches narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—restoring trust after the overwinding error—is signaled early and sustained, but the escalation operates through mystical revelation rather than protagonist agency under pressure. The "forty seconds that became forty thousand in damages" provides concrete cost for the initial failure, yet Theodore's confession ritual encounters no resistance or complication; gears "suddenly meshed perfectly" without tactical adjustment or visible tradeoff in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: understanding the tapestry's message and her own work's meaning. The unearthing of the sovereign case initiates inquiry; decoding the border threads deepens her grasp of grief-as-devotion. Pressure is textural rather than escalatory—each thread adds a layer, and the wind's rattle and star-wheel mark atmospheric intensification. The ending reweights her nightly rounds with new awareness, but no option is foreclosed and no visible cost appears on the page; she will continue tending graves and will plant the fragment "tomorrow." Agency is contemplative (she decodes, she understands) rather than decisional. One tightening: the tapestry's revelation that "loss transformed into tending" mirrors her existing practice, which is a deepening but not a turn.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—seeding innovation within the Council's constraints—is signaled early. Pressure remains static: Mira completes her maps unopposed, the Council arrives predictable, and her plan succeeds exactly as intended with no reversal or tightening. The ending deepens thematic resonance but does not narrow options or force a trade-off. No on-page cost alters Mira's tactics; she simply continues her work.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—restoring stories through secretly luminous music—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure builds through the pirate broadcast's direct address and Mariel's act of weaving rebel notes into the official score, but no on-page reversal tests her commitment with a visible cost. The resolution (distributing the scores, imagining the gala's effect) is narrated as future consequence rather than a present trade-off that forecloses an alternate path. The phrase "Dreams would return first… Then memories… Finally, the ability to imagine" reads as wish-fulfillment summary without dramatized resistance or price paid in the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—Marlene creating a portrait under time pressure before authorities arrive—is signaled early and tightens as the rocking chair slows. However, escalation is largely external (Thomas dies, officers arrive) rather than driven by Marlene's agency; she completes her ritual as planned without a forced trade-off or visible cost that narrows her options. The mask-walk through the portrait feels ceremonial rather than a high-stakes decision with foreclosed alternatives. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres, but the closure lacks the felt price of a genuine dilemma—Marlene's documentation role is revealed to the reader but never tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: preserving true history versus accepting comfortable lies. The woman's reveal ("We know") provides one meaningful reversal that narrows Marcus's options from opposition to collaboration. Agency appears in Marcus's final choice to help, though the decision arrives quickly after the journal offer. The cost is implied—abandoning three years of solo philosophical purity—but not viscerally dramatized in the moment. Escalation operates more through revelation than through mounting pressure or tradeoffs during the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving the vanishing art and Chen's teaching legacy—is signaled in the opening paragraph and tightens when the students arrive to learn the modes. The accumulative gathering (one by one, diverse instruments) deepens pressure through density, and the turn comes when they find all five modes together, reweighting Chen's assumption that she alone held the knowledge. The final choice (give them the zither, let it denote continuation) forecloses institutional preservation in favor of living practice, with visible cost: retirement, storage, program end. The "finding all five modes" moment is told rather than shown with friction, which slightly lowers escalation legibility, but the cost at closure is unmistakable and protagonist-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving memory against the Ministry's erasure—is signaled early but never tested on the page. Mira faces no opposition, discovery risk, or resource scarcity; the seed simply grows as intended under celestial alignment. The piece declares stakes ("too dangerous," "let them try to burn this down") without dramatizing friction or narrowing options. No on-page reversal or tightening forces a choice with felt cost; the revolution unfolds as Mira planned it.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—survival of natural pollination vs. Mira's secret—is signaled early and tightens when the involuntary honesty forces the broadcast choice. The decision narrows options (exposure vs. continued hiding) with visible cost: her job security and privacy foreclosed. The citizens' arrival provides consequence. Agency is clear in the broadcast act. The matchbox riddle feels ornamental to escalation; the honeycomb placement and confession drive the turn more directly.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Marina's need to understand the displaced objects and what makes houses feel alive—is signaled early and tightens when she traces the migration path to the bay. One meaningful deepening occurs when she looks through the orris root and sees the temporal overlays, which reweights her understanding. The final act (placing the shard as offering) is a protagonist choice with conceptual cost: she relinquishes her grandmother's heirloom to join the sanctification cycle. Escalation reads as density increase and pattern break under the Accumulative lens, though the pressure remains meditative rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: the truth about Nerida's fall and Thessaly's role. The cascading revelations create one meaningful tightening—Marina's academic certainty shatters when the weaponized-water plan is exposed, forcing her to choose between reputation and truth. Her decision to tell the complete story forecloses the safe path of maintaining her published narrative. The price is visible in her trembling hands and the acknowledgment that her life's work was built on a lie, though we don't see her grapple with the professional cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is escape from the staircase prison, signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the realization that the loop equals Sarah's lifetime in heartbeats, a tightening that forecloses hope of finding her. The chipped die's entropy provides a tangible escalation path. Agency is present: Marcus deliberately scarred the die, carved the proof on the wall, and climbs faster now. The final image—ascending "one proven step at a time"—crystallizes his stance with visible cost (eternal climbing until rupture). One reversal (infinite to loop) narrows options under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: proving that strangers remember kindness. One meaningful turn occurs when Mira posts the painting and messages flood in, validating the premise and narrowing her trajectory from solitary memorial to communal curator. Agency at closure is acceptance rather than decision; the greenhouse "became" a gathering place (passive construction). The tightening is legible but the cost—what Mira gives up or risks—remains implicit rather than dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: document the walls before thaw erases them. Pressure escalates through the rosewater scent, droplets forming, ice crashing, and mineral water beginning to blur sections. Yet escalation remains environmental rather than protagonist-driven—Marta reacts to the thaw but does not face a forced choice between competing salvage priorities or a visible trade-off that narrows her options. The resolution ("filling another page") is described as ongoing effort rather than a decisive tightening or renunciation with legible cost. The piece accumulates texture but lacks a turn where Marta's agency forecloses a path or the cost becomes undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reversing the hunger stone to restore the lighthouse—is signaled early and escalates through one meaningful tightening (stone inverts at climax). Agency is clear: Elara's counter-clockwise methodology drives the resolution. The cost is conceptual (the light now runs backward, calling "ships that had been lost to history") but on the page. No secondary antagonist, which is acceptable; pressure coheres under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding and mastering Fear—is signaled early and drives Mara's return each night. One clear tightening occurs when the mirrors project her death and she realizes Fear was lonely, narrowing her approach to empathy rather than confrontation. However, escalation relies on exposition (Cornelius urging "tell it what it needs to hear") rather than Mara testing and failing tactics that force adaptation. The resolution hinges on her verbal epiphany rather than a physical or renunciatory act with visible cost; Fear's transformation reads as responsive to her insight rather than a trade-off she enacts by forfeiting safety or control.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—breaking free from the recursive current—is signaled early and drives the single-scene action. Kessa's systematic striking of the wood nodes escalates in frequency and precision, and the spiral's wobble constitutes a tightening. However, the resolution arrives through her expertise without a meaningful trade-off or forfeited path; the whales' contribution feels coincidental rather than earned by prior causality. The ending announces the next trapped vessel, extending the pattern rather than closing this loop with visible cost. Escalation is present but the cost at closure is not legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—rescue/understand the expedition and decode the watcher warnings—is signaled early and tightens when Mira discovers the crack-message reading "Do not follow." Her choice to go anyway narrows options with visible cost (leaving safety, ignoring the warning). However, the escalation is primarily informational rather than experiential: she learns via telescope rather than encountering obstacles that force tactical changes. The expedition's disappearance and the turtle beginning to move raise stakes, but Mira's path from discovery to decision is relatively frictionless—no genuine obstacles test her resolve on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—exposing the Valorian forgery—is signaled early but deflates when Elara reveals she has already transmitted copies, removing urgency and narrowing Marcus's agency to symbolic acquiescence. No meaningful tightening occurs; the confrontation is a lecture rather than a test of commitment with visible trade-offs. Marcus's hesitation ("reached for his weapon, then hesitated") is told rather than dramatized through contradictory pulls. The ending reconfigures Marcus's allegiance but the price (leaving his insignia) feels ornamental rather than a forfeiture of safety, status, or access that will alter his future.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: preserve the pavilion's story before demolition. One meaningful tightening occurs when the tide turns, forcing departure and narrowing Edmund's window. Agency is present in the decision to seal the grandmother's story in the cornerstone, a renunciation of official-only documentation with visible cost (whispered words "never appear in his official report"). The escalation reads as accumulative density and cadence shift rather than causal reversal, consistent with the inferred lens. The cost is legible on the page but remains emotional/elegiac rather than high-stakes trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (preserving authentic records) signals early and tightens when she discovers systematic forgery pattern, then intensifies as backup generators cycle. The time constraint is felt: "minutes at most" forces efficiency. Her agency—marking pages, recognizing patterns—drives escalation. Visible cost: she can only mark patches, not restore everything, and must accept incomplete work. The resolution (ascending with stamp, planning next descent) shows endurance that forecloses the fantasy of complete restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—transforming unbearable grief into sustainable memorial—is signaled early and pursued consistently. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mei discovers "possibility" (Lin's unlived futures) in the gems, shifting from pure preservation to acceptance of loss. However, this deepening arrives through epiphany rather than pressure; no external force tests Mei's commitment, and the craft work proceeds without meaningful setback or complication. The final lantern-making represents agency (creating public memorial rather than private shrine), but the choice feels overdetermined by the therapeutic arc rather than a forced trade-off with visible cost. The accumulative lens supports gentle intensification, but the lack of reversal or genuine resistance flattens the pressure curve.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: prove and reclaim the pooled potential. The cooling-cycle window provides urgency, and the alarm creates a tightening. However, the protagonist's final act (transmitting data) faces no visible obstacle or trade-off in the closure beat—security "burst through" but Amira simply smiles, deflating the promised cost. The escalation is declared rather than dramatized at the moment it matters most.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—decode the floor message—is signaled early and drives matrix recovery. One meaningful tightening occurs when the pilgrim reveals only one chip but twelve gaps exist, forcing the search. However, the search itself is frictionless: every matrix is found without failed attempts, misreadings, or tactical costs. The "frequency of belonging" resolution is declared rather than tested against a competing need or fear, so the final choice feels costless.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: confronting inherited guilt and complicity. The discovery sequence escalates pressure causally—dates → coordinates → pattern → realization of family silence → career parallel. Agency is strong at closure: Elias chooses to destroy his files and end the "sieved hush" with visible cost (livelihood, professional identity). The tightening forecloses his prior path and the cost is legible in "even if speaking the truth came too late to matter."

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: whether Elara will use her power to punish or heal, tested when Thorne's apology arrives. The core tightening occurs when she hands him the drawer pull and recounts her grandmother's parallel—forcing him to see his son's error as equivalent to her brother's, which narrows his moral ground and raises the cost of his request. Her response ("Forgiveness will come after tomorrow's exchange, not before") forecloses immediate reconciliation with visible price: both must endure one more night in the darkness of unresolved grief. Agency is clear throughout; no coincidence resolves the tension, only her deliberate choice to synchronize redemption with the new moon's equality.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—Marcus finding purpose after catastrophic failure—is signaled early and tightens through the paddle sequence. The pole-nineteen stop generates meaningful deepening: confronting the rescue-launch site forces him to reweight the compass from broken instrument to honorable memory, narrowing his grief-navigation to a teaching path. The teaching offer forecloses endless passive paddling with visible cost (accepting he'll never captain ships again). Agency is renunciation and stance crystallization, fitting the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—whether Marcus will pursue the empathy mission despite his amnesia—is signaled early and tightens when the old woman reveals the labyrinth of victims' relatives. One meaningful deepening occurs: the lake's glow intensifies to show specific paths and the prosecutor daughter's apartment, narrowing Marcus's abstract guilt into concrete action. Agency is present (he steps onto the bridge), but the cost remains implicit—no live option is visibly traded away on the page. The procedural memory-extraction premise adds conceptual weight but doesn't generate on-page reversals or escalating tactical barriers.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reconnecting with Kess—is signaled immediately and tightens through Mira's choice to uncork the vial despite terror. The scent explodes outward and the metamorphosis progresses, narrowing her human form into a distributed consciousness. However, the escalation occurs primarily through summary ("felt her own edges blur") rather than a dramatized reversal or cost that foreclosed a live option. The accumulative texture supports the lens, but the peak transformation lacks a specific price paid on the page—we're told she's altered, not shown what she sacrificed in that moment.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—unbinding her daughter's birth from her mother's death—is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful deepening occurs when the mother appears and Elara shifts from guilt to restoration via the card spread. Agency is present (Elara chooses to climb, to call, to lay the cards) but the escalation feels largely reflective rather than driven by on-page reversals that narrow options. The cost—her mother's permanent absence transformed into "recovered time" that "slip[s] into dreams"—is asserted in the ending but not dramatized as a trade-off that forecloses a live alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—opening the shadow dimension to integrate humanity's darkness—is signaled early and sustained. Mei's work is "slow, patient," requiring "perfect equilibrium between sorrow and joy," which provides a constraint. The discovery of the "first war, first murder" photograph and the application of Kwan Yin's Tear constitute a tightening that narrows her options to this single moment. The stitching sequence deepens pressure as "whispers, screams, the sound of every blow" emerge, and her pacifist soul recoils. However, the final integration feels more summarized than dramatized: "each stitch binding another piece of shadow back to its source" tells the resolution rather than showing a tactical trade-off or visible price paid in the moment. Escalation is present under the Accumulative lens, but the cost at closure remains conceptual rather than viscerally legible.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding transformation's texture—is signaled early but remains abstract; no concrete tightening or trade-off narrows options under pressure. Elara's agency is passive: she "orchestrates" coincidences unconsciously and opens bottles without resistance or cost. The transformation itself is cosmically granted rather than earned by protagonist choice. No visible price is paid after any turn; the volcano and planets act as convenient enablers. The escalation reads as thematic accumulation without a decisive on-page choice that forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: ignite a silent revolution without violence. The blackout creates urgency, and Thorne's placement of the quill holder at the sundial is the single decisive on-page action that narrows options and commits the network. Amara's entrance provides a reversal—she engineered the blackout—which deepens pressure and confirms shared risk. One meaningful tightening is present: the signal is set, watchers will read angles at dawn, and "a thousand small rebellions" will cascade. Cost is conceptual and deferred (the Chancellor suspects nothing *yet*), but the final separation and return to posts forecloses retreat with visible, if quiet, price. Escalation is modest but coherent under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake (understanding sacred patterns/grandmother's promise) is signaled early and tightens through stone placement → dust scattering → eel contact → revelation. One meaningful deepening occurs when the lead eel floods Yann's mind with three-million-year history, reframing her curse as time-transparency and her role as covenant-keeper. Agency manifests in her choosing to place new stones for the next apprentice. The escalation reads under Accumulative lens as pattern completion forcing stance crystallization. Cost legibility is weakened: "decades hence" is asserted future burden rather than on-page forfeiture or visible price paid now.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: survive censorship by creating a coded resistance that evades detection. Pressure tightens through one meaningful escalation—her boldest poem yet, a "direct response" that plants seeds in negative space, raising the risk of discovery. The final act (sealing the envelope, resetting the timer) forecloses safer paths and commits her to continued danger with on-page cost. Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening from passive documentation to active poetic resistance sufficiently narrows options. Minor gap: we don't see a moment where safer alternatives are weighed and rejected in scene, only Maya's assertion of boldness.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—encoding revolutionary messages through philosophical debate—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. The duel itself unfolds as collaborative performance rather than genuine conflict; Reeves "sparkles with admiration" throughout, deflating tension. The escalation claimed in "intensified" and "breathing heavily" is asserted without on-page trade-offs or narrowed options. No reversal occurs; the "hidden overture to a revolution that might never need to happen" remains hypothetical, and the agreement to meet again forecloses nothing, leaving pressure flat across the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—rebuilding the anthology as resistance—is signaled early but never faces on-page opposition or narrowing. No reversal, tightening choice, or deepening alters October's options; she works steadily from first paragraph to last without a hitch. The backstory about Marcus and the resistance network is extensive but does not create present-scene pressure. Agency is limited to repetitive assembly actions ("lifted another torn page," "pressed another page") without a meaningful escalation or cost. Under Accumulative lens, a cadence shift or density increase that reweights the stake is required; here the work continues at constant intensity to an affirmative close.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—retrieving Sophia from temporal limbo—is signaled early and tightens once: Marion sees the hand in frame 1,847/1,848, improvises new harmonies, and compasses steady. However, the escalation bypasses on-page resistance; the corridor opens without friction, and Sophia steps through as soon as Marion plays. No reversal, trade-off, or complication tests Marion's commitment. The final image (compasses pointing to "where home waits to be built") reconfigures meaning, but the lack of visible cost at the peak moment—no risk that the music might fail, no price for bending reality—keeps the pressure from fully landing.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—whether the Ninth Island survives—is signaled early and Mira's swallowing of the seed tightens pressure by forcing interpretation of contradictory data. The contradiction discovery deepens the problem once, and her final classification reweights the outcome. Yet escalation is conceptual rather than agonistic; no visible trade-off or live option is foreclosed. The monsoon's arrival and the island's survival feel declarative rather than earned by Mira's specific tactical sacrifice. Cost is conceptual (Council challenge) but not felt in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reconciliation with Yuki after severance—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the student's pruning lesson, which parallels Kenji's internal work, culminating in his decision to write tomorrow. One meaningful tightening: the compass needle's stop and the impossible cerulean color force Kenji's internal shift from nightly ritual to planned action. Cost is legible (another day without contact, the year-long silence) but the parallel between tree-pruning and emotional reconciliation occasionally feels overly allegorical, slightly diluting immediate stakes. No antagonist required under the Accumulative lens; coincidence (compass arrival) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake of decoding belonging escalates through Kira's agency (drone deployment, tile-pulling) under Hybrid lens; cost is legible in her internal reconfiguration, though stakes remain slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the causal lens, as discoveries from the carvings narrow options and force a trade-off; cost is legible in his decision to abandon his livelihood.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake in redemption escalates through Elara's agency under the causal lens, forcing a trade-off between vengeance and forgiveness with cost legible in her conditional acceptance. The tightening forecloses the path of immediate retaliation.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation is driven by Marcus's agency under the causal lens, from paddling out to his decision to teach, with cost unmistakable in his realization at pole nineteen. The dominant stake of grief versus healing tightens through one meaningful deepening, foreclosing his path of isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation is driven by Marcus's agency under the causal lens, from learning his task to committing to the paths. The dominant stake (kindling empathy) tightens through a meaningful turn—his decision to walk forward—with cost legible in the bridge solidifying under his feet.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake of reuniting with Kess escalates under accumulative lens through Mira's agency in using the spices, leading to a metamorphosis that forecloses her human path with visible cost. Pressure coheres and tightens in the transformation beat.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake of unfastening the past escalates through Elara's agency under the Accumulative lens, using cards and saucer to achieve restoration. Cost is legible in the mended saucer and inclusion of her mother's name, with one meaningful tightening that forecloses options and reweights stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven by Mei's agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as she finds the key photograph and uses Kwan Yin's Tear to stitch the dimension, narrowing options with cost felt in her release and the ship's transformation. The dominant stake of integrating humanity's shadow tightens meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clear early, and escalation is driven by Thorne's agency under the causal lens, such as aligning the quill holder during the blackout. Cost is legible in the risk of discovery, narrowing options meaningfully. However, the tension relies heavily on setup rather than multiple reversals, capping the score.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes center on understanding sacred patterns, escalating through Yann's agency in placing stones and scattering star dust. Under the hybrid lens, pressure tightens as the pattern activates, leading to a revelation with cost visible in her altered perspective. The climax is driven by her choices, not coincidence, and deepens the narrative meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.5)
    Stakes of intellectual freedom escalate through Maya's agency in rarefying language, with one meaningful tightening as she plants seeds in negative space. Cost is unmistakable in the risk embodied by her "furiously tranquil" stance, and pressure coheres under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes escalate through the philosophical duel, narrowing options toward revolution. Agency is clear in both characters' syllogisms, but the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake of resisting standardization escalates through October's agency in rebuilding the anthology, narrowing options under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation is driven by Marion's agency under the causal lens, with the magnetic storm intensifying and her improvisation creating a corridor.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes—Elena’s relationship to her profession and the fate of the greenhouse—are clear, and pressure accumulates as the butterflies multiply, patterns complexify, and demolition looms. Her resignation and decision to ignore departmental politics are genuine acts of agency that foreclose a high-status career path. However, escalation remains relatively low-temperature; opposition is mostly off-stage, and the threat of demolition appears late and is resolved quickly via summary, so we never feel a concrete, narrowing set of options in scene. The internal tension between security and integrity could be sharpened to heighten cost.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stakes—what Marina will do with the ledger and how she will respond to the arsonists’ pursuit and her father’s legacy—are clear, and the pressure deepens as she realizes the full extent of the poisoning and the commercial appetite for that glow. The main tightening is internal: reinterpreting her artistic failures in light of radiation raises the stakes of choosing any path that replicates that legacy. The choice to let the world mourn her and to walk toward a new, safe mode of art is a credible stance crystallization, but the immediate external danger (arsonists, potential pursuit) remains abstract and off-stage, so situational pressure feels more contemplative than urgent. As a result, tension is authentic but relatively low-intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can transform her loss of hearing into a new way of listening and articulate it meaningfully—is clear and coherent. Pressure accumulates via her solitary work, the memory of Kepler and the dead crew, and the need to “rectify” scientific and spiritual blind spots. However, the conflict remains largely internal and contemplative; there’s no strong external opposition or genuine risk that her attempt will fail beyond emotional stakes. The escalation from routine experimentation to a night of breakthrough transcription is effective but relatively gentle for elite-level tension.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether and how exhausted beings (Silas, librarians, dead civilizations) can finally rest—is clear and escalates from personal insomnia to cosmic burden. There is a meaningful deepening when the librarians reveal their endless, punishing task and when Silas chooses to retool the lighthouse lens, shifting from visitor to undertaker of worlds. However, external resistance and on-page struggle are minimal; the work of transformation occurs in a largely frictionless montage, which keeps this from reaching a higher tension band.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—collective survival with dignity under sanctions—is clear and present from early on, and pressure accumulates as the community shifts from receiving to mutual support. Marta’s main “choices” are to give anonymously and then to step back as others take over; these are ethically significant but face little on-page resistance or real alternative. The officials’ arrival offers a potential confrontation, yet it dissipates quickly into a tableau of unified silence, avoiding a sharper ethical or practical clash. The story’s quiet, accumulative design works, but for this bar the conflict feels almost too frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—what Mae will do when she reaches the repository of unused love—is legible and culminates in a genuine choice to give rather than take. Escalation is present in the intensifying sparks, the ghost’s appearance, the door’s materialization, and the final opening of the camera. However, opposition remains largely atmospheric rather than truly adversarial; there’s little sense that she might refuse or fail once the door is in view. The cost (surrendering years of images and her own untold affections) is conceptually strong but could be given slightly more friction or sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—escaping retrocognitive imprisonment by re-understanding time—is present but mostly internal and philosophical. Pressure does increase as the photographs fade and the fragment warms and begins to disintegrate, but there is little sense of jeopardy or genuine risk in her choices; she largely observes and then accepts. There is one clear tightening at the maze’s center, yet no option is forcefully foreclosed on the page aside from the loss of images. The conflict reads more as a graceful unveiling than a tested struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stakes—escape plus seeding resistance against the Drought Authority—are clear and scale from personal to global. There is a meaningful turn with the chain’s snapping and his consequent shift from safeguarding to looting the vault for rebellion. However, conflict remains largely one-sided: the Authority is offstage, no interruption or immediate threat complicates his escape, and he pays no on-page price beyond risk and past endurance. Tension rides more on concept than on live resistance in the moment, which keeps escalation from fully tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elena can finally perceive and interpret the “sound” of betrayal—is signaled early and pursued throughout, primarily as internal and conceptual pressure. Escalation comes through her decision to risk using the corroded forge and to commit fully to the grandfather’s experimental method of imprinting absences, culminating in the altered experience of sound at the end. The cost is emotional and existential: her long-held narrative of her grandfather’s ruin is complicated, and she must accept that trust and betrayal are inseparable. However, conflict remains mostly steady and introspective without sharp on-page reversals or overt tests that would more visibly narrow her options.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the mother will learn the truth behind her daughter’s apparent joy—is clear and emotionally legible. However, Cassia faces no real opposition or risk: she’s never in danger of being caught, failing, or hurting the mother in a way that might backfire, so escalation is more conceptual than pressured. The only real tightening is the shift from surface beauty to revealed longing in the portrait, which changes knowledge but not options in a dramatic way. The ending has cost (the mother’s pain, Cassia’s burden), but the journey there feels relatively frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how a place of catastrophe can become a safe site for vulnerable questioning—is clear but remains mostly internal and conceptual. Pressure accrues through ritual, memory, and the implied danger of the plant and radiation rather than through concrete obstacles or hard choices. The arrival of the couple adds a gentle tightening, testing her installation’s purpose, but there is little real risk or potential failure in that interaction. As a result, tension is present but subdued, with no sharp escalation or visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stakes—Marcus’s autonomy and the control over his own mind—are clear and escalated by the direct confrontation with Jake and the threat of a “reset protocol.” The shell-to-shell clash is a solid functional peak with an intelligible reversal (the fears transferring). Still, the conflict resolves a bit too smoothly: Marcus arrives already holding the full countermeasure, and Jake never lands a serious blow, emotional or tactical. A brief on-page moment where Marcus’s plan nearly fails or his remaining fears complicate his execution would sharpen the sense of risk and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central pressure—will this be the night the final star dies, and what that means for her life’s work—does cohere and tighten as dawn nears and the star flickers. The reversal (it does not die; she must keep waiting) functions as a meaningful deepening of her commitment rather than a simple deferral. However, the conflict never becomes especially fraught; there’s little sense of a live alternative path she might take if the star did or did not go out, so the on-page cost feels muted. Tension here is largely conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is Seven’s need to discover the origin of his consciousness, but the pressure on that goal remains contemplative rather than urgent. The main tightening is his decision to approach and touch the violin across timelines, which deepens knowledge but doesn’t visibly foreclose alternative paths or impose a sharp price. There is little external or internal resistance to his progress—no real risk in touching the violin, no competing obligation that might be abandoned—so escalation is more an increase in conceptual density than in tangible cost. The result is thematically rich but low-tension conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—whether they can risk honesty and rebuild trust amid professional and familial fallout—is clear and present from early on. Pressure deepens when both admit their respective deceptions, and the knowledge that Marcus has confessed alters options, enabling them to shift from damage control to reckoning with their own choices. However, tension plateaus somewhat after that reveal; with the external institutional threat largely defused off-page, the on-page conflict feels gentler and lower-risk than the setup promises. The final choice to reach for each other lands, but the visible price and narrowing of options could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether quantified luck dictates growth or can be subverted by belief and care—is articulated and carried through. However, conflict largely remains conceptual or retrospective: Marta recounts past crises and a puzzled inspector, but faces little active resistance in the present. The meeting with the rejected student is thematically apt yet low-pressure; Marta’s decision to help doesn’t visibly cost her anything or seriously endanger her arrangement with the Ministry. Escalation is thus more of a gentle deepening than a tightening that forecloses options.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—proving a radical temporal theory versus maintaining atmospheric safety—is signaled, and there is one clear tightening when the station shudders and Vasquez sounds alarmed. Yet the danger to “two hundred researchers” never materially impacts Ira’s tactics; she doesn’t seriously weigh stopping, and the system stabilizes with little fallout. Internal conflict (duty vs obsession) is mostly implied rather than dramatized as a hard trade-off. As a result, escalation feels more like a cool demonstration than a test with lasting consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—completing Elisabetta’s unfinished music and allowing the trapped note to resolve—is clear and grows as the score emerges and Marcus becomes the only one willing to act. Escalation is anchored in his choice to step deeper into the flood and physically risk himself to sustain the impossible note. The cost is present but somewhat soft: the story implies danger (near-drowning, professional alienation) more than it makes that pressure bite in the moment. Still, his endurance under pressure and the eerie continuation of the note without him give the climax a genuine, if quiet, intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—how Mira will handle a fragile, impossible truth within an institutional frame that can’t tolerate it—is clear and tightened as she uncovers the previous keeper’s secret illustrations. Escalation is interior but real: from vague fever memory to direct witnessing during the aurora, then to a concrete choice about what to report and how to sign her drawing. The cost (professional integrity, scientific omission, and ongoing solitude in carrying this knowledge) is legible but kept quiet, which fits the mode but slightly mutes tension. There’s no major reversal, yet the deepening is sufficient for this length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stake—how Marcus will respond to this convergence of guilt, legend, and physical evidence—is established early and tightened as the radio moves from vague callers to a direct confession about stealing the valve. Conflict escalates from curiosity to an ethical decision when he physically confronts the wheel; his choice to document but not remove it is a credible renunciation with conceptual cost. Internal and external pressures interweave well, but the decisive moment is brief and under-argued on the page—his temptation to exploit or “solve” the mystery is implied more than dramatized. As a result, the tension feels quietly strong rather than knife-edge.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.0)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and mostly already resolved; the dominant stake—her stance toward change and judgment—is stated rather than pressured. The explorers’ visits hint at potential friction, but they never force a consequential choice beyond her established refusal to speak. There is a thematic cost (becoming garden rather than person), yet no on-page moment where she wavers or must trade one live option for another. The piece succeeds as meditative lyricism, but tension and escalation remain muted.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.0)
    The primary stake—whether and how Elena will truly release this long-guarded piece of her daughter and accept a new phase of their relationship—is clear and gently escalated by the ticking clock of the eclipse. The ritual of music and the act of releasing the curl form a credible tightening toward closure. However, the outcome never feels genuinely in doubt; opposition is more implied (fear of loss, change) than dramatized in on-page hesitation or conflict. As a result, tension is authentic but relatively low-grade.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is Thrain’s need to understand what the dragons and “turning” mean for reality and her purpose, and this does tighten as her sensitivity “opens fully.” The main turn is her realization that the tapestry documents axis shifts and that she is the designated tender of echoes; this reweights her situation but doesn’t force a difficult trade-off. Conflict remains mostly internal and contemplative, with low felt risk or jeopardy. As a result, tension is engaging but not gripping at a level a top-tier market would want.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Chen continues as orchestrator of others’ fates or turns that power on himself—is clear and thematically strong, but it plays out more as a contemplative choice than as escalating on-page pressure. The Bulgarian’s reaction and the island’s dangerous milieu hint at risk, yet no direct opposition or time-critical constraint tightens his options beyond mood. His agency at the end—leaving the fortunes and walking into the lighthouse—does foreclose a path and carries implied cost, giving the story a genuine turn. Still, the conflict never quite bites; it simmers rather than boils.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central conflict—Marcus vs. a demon of unexamined assumptions—is clear, and the woman’s regained breath offers a neat resolution. However, pressure doesn’t truly escalate: the demon never meaningfully resists, the time limit never bites, and Marcus’s strategy faces no apparent risk of failure. The “unraveling” proceeds smoothly once begun, so we don’t feel options narrowing or costs mounting in the middle. The stakes remain largely intellectual, which undercuts tension despite the elegant conceptual work.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mei will crystallize her nonlinear experience into the symphony and find temporal “home”—is legible and carried through. Pressure escalates as dawn intensifies and the fortunes physically lift, culminating in the final conducting gesture. Still, opposition is largely inert: exhaustion is gestured at but never bites, and there’s no meaningful alternate path or potential failure mode dramatized in the scene. As a result, tension feels more contemplative than truly tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Kira will remain splintered across timelines or accept the cost of collapsing them into one—comes through clearly and deepens as the viaduct darkens and her consciousness thins. Pressure escalates via the stuttering procedural bridge and the intrusion of shadow “might-have-beens,” plus the apparition of the older Kira sharpening the cost of not choosing. However, Kira faces little true on-page resistance: no serious temptation or near-failure complicates the path from realization to pressing the rune, so the turning point feels somewhat inevitable rather than hard-won. The final cost (killing alternate lives) is conceptually strong but under-dramatized in visceral or scene-level conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness and reclaiming a way to experience music—is legible from the outset and tightens as the reversed music begins working on her body. Escalation comes as an intensifying sensory and emotional experience rather than external complication, culminating in the thaw and conceptual shift; this suits the lyric mode but keeps tension relatively low-key. There is a clear narrowing of options: she commits to this strange, imperfect method in solitude rather than retreating to resignation. Still, the process unfolds with few frictions or setbacks, which softens the sense of tested risk or potential failure.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stake—whether Elena’s data will serve tyranny or resistance—is clear and meaningfully raised once she realizes both sides are using or suppressing her work. Her being followed and the discovery that someone is mapping her stations provide a solid tightening of pressure. The final decision to continue and expand her monitoring is a credible stance crystallization with implied risk. However, conflict remains mostly conceptual and anticipatory; there’s limited on-page contestation or sacrifice, which caps escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will accept becoming a living archive of loss—is clearly signaled and gradually tightened through the unfolding effects of the perfume. Each new wave of scent/memory raises the internal cost of refusal and deepens her entanglement with her mother’s legacy. However, the conflict remains largely internal and contemplative, with minimal sense that any other concrete path remains truly viable once the vial is uncorked. The escalation works, but it reads more as deepening inevitability than as pressured choice between competing harms.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus will confront and hold the full, messy texture of these moral histories—is clear, and escalation is handled via increasingly fraught revelations (from wrongful imprisonment to the judge brother to the daughter’s silence). Pressure deepens as the beings reveal that they “need” someone like him, implicitly binding him into their project. However, Marcus never seriously resists, and no hard trade-off is forced; the conflict remains largely contemplative rather than a crucible that forecloses a path with visible cost. The net effect is tense enough for a quiet story but not maximally charged.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Echo Harbor’s music and communal life can be reborn from loss—is clear, but conflict is largely one-sided: nothing resists Mara’s attempt, and each development comes as a graceful accretion rather than a test. Her main “choice” is to play and then to continue, but this is never truly in doubt; we don’t see her hesitate, fail, or risk alienating others. The transformation of the hush into a canvas for new music is conceptually satisfying yet almost frictionless in execution. As a result, stakes feel more contemplative than pressurized, keeping escalation below elite levels.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is Vera’s choice between exploiting/consuming the half-truths herself and maintaining her disciplined role as dealer of curated emotions. Pressure escalates via the strengthening static, the grotto’s tightening transformation window, and the increasingly “yearning” emotions. Her refusal to subsume the feelings is an earned stasis rather than a radical pivot, and the psychic price of perpetual emotional abstinence is sketched more than sharpened. The tension is real but remains quiet, never quite forcing an acute sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Margot will remain a purely transactional broker or step into a more relational, legacy-minded role—is present and does deepen as she chooses to hand-carry the locket and then participates in building the library’s future. Agency is clear in the decision to “initiate her plan,” and that action meaningfully alters the story’s options. However, opposition is soft; nothing seriously resists her choices, and emotional risk (e.g., involving herself in a family estrangement) is more implied than dramatized. The result is a gentle, coherent escalation rather than a sharply pressured one.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the community will remain fragmented around a vanished originator, or reweave itself to include her and Kira—is clear, and the mapping/search ritual is a solid structural escalation. Still, conflict remains gentle: no one meaningfully resists the project, and the risk that Kira might “dedicate herself too completely” never sharpens into a concrete dilemma. The cave discovery and reintegration unfold without reversal or real test of anyone’s resolve. As a result, the emotional payoff is pleasant but relatively low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether to preserve the city’s manipulated temporal abundance or restore a just cadence to time and extinction—is clear and escalates through her discovery that the system is powered by stolen last moments. The key turn is her decision to complete the drawings and thus collapse the borrowed time, which triggers Morteus’s premature stirring and the evaporation of minutes the city depends on. However, tension could be sharper: Marina encounters little direct resistance and experiences limited explicit doubt or temptation, so the ethical calculus feels slightly under-pressured relative to the scale of the consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether loss can be recalculated into a form of presence—appears early and tightens when she actually places the eyes and confronts what that means for Elias. Escalation is gentle but present: the hum of the trees, the activation of the fungi patterns, and the emergence of Elias as an equation deepen the pressure around her longing for his “return.” The cost of the resolution—accepting that he cannot return in the human sense and relinquishing the eyes—is emotionally significant but portrayed with calm acceptance rather than sharp conflict, which softens tension. Still, her final choice to leave the eyes and reframe her relationship to loss feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.3)
    The primary stake—Edgar’s solitude versus connection, framed through preserving and sharing memory—is clear and present early, and the power outage provides a neat external trigger to test his role. Pressure escalates when he discovers the archivist’s tape player and when she addresses him directly, forcing a stance on whether to remain a ghost or engage. However, the conflict remains low-key; there’s little on-page friction or genuine threat, and the price of engagement is mostly conceptual rather than sharply dramatized. The resolution feels earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus clings to human separateness or submits to plant-human integration—is clear and present early. Pressure builds via his bodily changes and the escalating intimacy of the leaf merging with his skin, culminating in his choice not to resist. The escalation is largely internal and contemplative, and while it works for a quiet piece, the sense of risk and competing options could be sharpened to heighten tension. As written, the outcome feels more like fulfillment of a foretold role than a hard-won, contested decision.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stakes—will Mara trade her last family heirloom for finite, priceless water that might transform her art and meaning-making—are legible and thematically rich. The main tightening comes in the exchange itself and the awareness of the tide erasing the path, with emotional pressure culminating in her decision to taste and use the water for a specific painting. Conflict is mostly interior and situational rather than confrontational, which suits the piece but keeps escalation quiet rather than sharply ratcheting. A slightly clearer on-page sense of what she risks if the journey/exchange fails (beyond general despair) could have deepened the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Vera will cling to her prophetic identity or embrace a new way of seeing—is clear, but the pressure on that choice never bites very hard. The cave’s presence is didactic and benevolent rather than oppositional; Vera is rarely forced into a true trade-off or exposed to serious risk beyond disorientation. There is one meaningful tightening when she realizes her visions are gone and later when her awareness “flows into the overlapping shadows,” but these are accepted almost immediately. As a result, tension exists but stays low-intensity and primarily conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—how to reassemble a community’s scattered memory—is clear, but pressure remains gentle and contemplative. There is a meaningful deepening when Kessa discovers the staggered-interval method and repurposes the herald’s valve, but no strong narrowing of options or felt trade-off. Internal and external conflicts largely align; nothing seriously challenges her project or forces a painful choice. The result is thematically rich but low-tension, which keeps escalation from reaching the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will risk stepping off the documented world to pursue this impossible map—is clear but emotionally and practically low-cost on the page. The main tightening is the moment she “dares herself” to take the first step, after which opposition mostly falls away in favor of wonder. There’s no substantive reversal or competing obligation that forces a painful trade; the fortress receives her rather than testing her. As a result, tension is atmospheric rather than truly escalating, capping the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether Elena will cling to reductive skepticism or risk integrating her grandmother’s “magic as methodology”—is clear and under real internal pressure. Escalation comes through accumulating correspondences (tile warmth, pattern matches, deepened transcription) and the ticking clock of the three-day migration. The main cost/trade-off at the end is conceptual rather than dramatized in an external consequence, so the conflict remains primarily cerebral and quiet. That keeps the piece from feeling static, but it does keep the pressure below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Vex will collude with the returning “mutineers” and risk annihilating her immortality—builds coherently from watchful observation to active aid to the final step through the door. There is one clear tightening when the fragments are assembled and the door appears, forcing a yes/no choice on transformation. Internal and external stakes touch, but the decision comes relatively smoothly; Vex doesn’t visibly pay or wrestle with a concrete loss beyond the implied conceptual cost. The Consortium’s offstage role and the absence of immediate opposition keep the conflict from feeling fully pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—how to reckon with the father’s crimes in front of a wronged heir—is strong and signaled early. Pressure coherently rises from potential confrontation/theft to a complicated moral negotiation involving money, ashes, and symbolic restitution. However, Wei’s rage liquefies into cooperation with little resistance or concrete threat, so the external conflict feels resolved slightly too smoothly. Internal and moral stakes carry the load effectively, but a sharper on-page test of either character’s limits would deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—recovering suppressed histories—remains largely abstract and unopposed on the page. Pressure only weakly escalates via time (night deepening, then dawn) and physical fatigue; no concrete risk, counterforce, or trade-off tests her commitment. Her “true work” proceeds smoothly from preparation to completion without a meaningful reversal or narrowing of options. The piece reads more like a beautifully rendered ritual than a conflict sequence with escalating stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.2)
    The primary stake—whether Mari remains merely dissolved or claims a new form of existence among the erased—is clear but largely internal and conceptual. Escalation arrives through pattern-recognition (realizing others like her have been here) and the spring-tide annotation that demands testimony, forcing her to choose to sign. This deepening works under an accumulative lens, but the on-page sense of risk or sacrifice in that choice is relatively gentle. The piece could reach a higher band if her decision visibly foreclosed an alternative (e.g., returning to the world of the living) rather than mainly affirming a path she’s already on.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.9)
    The central stake—whether Marina will remain a detached debunker or engage with her own and others’ unfinished conversations—is clear but kept mostly in the conceptual/emotional register. Pressure escalates gently rather than sharply: strange hum → impossible harmonics → revelation of Elias’s guilt → Marina recognizing her own investment. The final choice to help finish the instrument does foreclose a path, but the cost and internal resistance are underplayed, so tension never quite peaks. As a result, conflict feels moving but somewhat soft-focused for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central conflict—community survival versus corporate privatization—is clearly established, and pressure rises from cryptic warnings to the concrete arrival of developers to the urgent night meeting. Maya’s decision to reorganize as a preservation society is a credible, agency-driven turn that narrows options and forecloses simple resistance. Yet the opposition (developers, officials) never exerts real on-page force, and no plan meaningfully fails or extracts a clear sacrifice; the legal gambit seems to work without friction. The result is tension that’s conceptually strong but emotionally under-escalated.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—capturing the final emergence of primordial ice before evacuation—is clear and well rooted in the opening. Pressure escalates mainly through time running out and the knowledge that this is both the last vapor and the last mission, not through active resistance. Vera’s agency in preparing the chemical timer, descending, and choosing to leave the hourglass provides a modest but coherent tightening. Still, the conflict remains largely one-sided and contemplative; there’s little on-page jeopardy or adaptation under duress, which keeps stakes more elegiac than tense.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are clearly stated—Meridian sailing blind without the drone—and time pressure is introduced via the “twenty minutes” call. However, the repair proceeds almost entirely without setback or real doubt; there is no beat where options narrow or a credible failure looms. Internal conflict is similarly muted; Maya’s calm is admirable but flattens tension. As a result, escalation feels linear rather than tightening, and the success lands as expected rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—whether Margot exposes or conceals a discovery with large implications—is clear and sharpened by the inspector’s personal tie to Marcus. Escalation occurs via knowledge deepening rather than outward danger, and the falcon’s cry plus the inspector’s agenda tighten pressure appropriately for this scale. However, the cost of her decision (professional risk, potential exploitation, or political fallout) remains mostly abstract, so the choice doesn’t feel maximally pressured. Internal conflict is present but could be pushed a bit harder at the decision beat.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Millhaven will decay into a literal/figurative ghost town—is clear but held at a gentle simmer rather than sharp crisis. Pressure escalates via accumulation: more townspeople join, the walking patterns deepen, and the town’s infrastructure visibly heals, culminating in resilience through the coming collapse. Still, there is little sense of real jeopardy or hard trade-off; no moment threatens failure once the pattern takes hold. The resolution is earned but low-tension, more restorative ritual than contested conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    The central stake—life and return vs absorption into an eternal congregation—is signaled early and tightens effectively as the vial’s contents dwindle. The time limit and the increasing clarity of what the temple is doing to consciousness escalate pressure without needing external antagonists. Maya’s final decision to swim deeper and inhale the temple’s water is a clear, costly, protagonist-driven resolution that forecloses the option of escape. Conflict remains largely internal, but the external pressures (depth, interference, geometry) are well integrated rather than merely decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—getting the true story inscribed and discoverable before the boat arrives—is clear, and the pressure coheres under that clock. The meaningful tightening comes when Marcus leaves the cell and engages the lattice, shifting from private knowledge to irreversible testimony. Conflict is mostly situational and internal rather than combative; there’s little sense that failure is actively pursuing him beyond time and legacy. That keeps tension solid but not searing for elite-market expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—freedom from a beautiful, poisonous generational bond—is clear and escalates when the “resonant awakenings” begin and the bead’s pulsing intensifies. The turn at the bead cracking meaningfully reweights the situation by reframing whose debt this truly was. However, much of the conflict’s progression is structurally inevitable (a ritual finally maturing) rather than driven by contested decisions; Marlow mostly endures rather than chooses. As a result, tension is emotionally rich but not maximally sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Calla can transform loss into a new kind of sacred world—is clear but operates at a conceptual, low-pressure level. Escalation comes mainly from discovery (the nautilus pattern, the plate warming, the children animating) rather than from sharpened risk or narrowed options. There’s little sense of what happens if she fails beyond continued ruin, and no immediate counterforce or moral trade-off testing her commitment. Consequently, the conflict feels more like meditative unfolding than a tightened crucible, effective but not yet competitive at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake is Miriam’s stance toward belonging and faith—will she remain a wanderer in spirit, or accept return and reconstruction. Tension comes from quiet, accumulative pressure rather than overt opposition: the unsettling beauty of the orchard, the grandmother’s apparent foresight, and the diaspora names carved into the sundial. The escalation from hesitant arrival to active participation (helping with the gnomon, planning to map the paths) is clear but understated, with minimal sense of risk or sacrifice beyond internal repricing. This keeps the conflict thematically rich but somewhat soft in terms of narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes remain largely conceptual and untested: there is no real possibility on the page that Mira will fail to create the pseudonym or that the letter will be lost. The only overt pressure is the ticking of “three more hours” and the rain’s eventual erasure, but neither forces a difficult choice or trade-off. As a result, the piece reads more like a beautifully rendered vignette than a scene with escalating conflict. The ending crystallizes stance but does not feel earned through increasing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—smuggling out the full intelligence network before the coup—appears early and gains pressure through time constraint (“tomorrow… the coup would begin”) and Crane’s announcement that the observatory will be closed. Escalation is mostly situational rather than actively opposed: Vera’s danger is implied (being caught) but never directly tested beyond Crane’s cursory inspection. Her agency is steady and effective; she adapts by amplifying her performance of foolishness, but doesn’t face a genuine on-page near-failure. As a result the tension is engaging yet could feel sharper with one concrete, costly risk or compromised option in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she will finally risk apologizing to Marina—is clear early and threads through all beats via the unsent letters motif. Escalation comes from moving from generalized regret to specific unsent messages, to reliving the door scene, to actively sending a new message. However, once she commits to the ritual there’s little resistance or complication; the spirits and shard mostly cooperate, so pressure feels internal but not sharply tested. The cost of change (dismantling her self-protective crypticness) is clear, but a more fraught or contested moment of choice would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes are primarily internal—what Maya makes of her survival and whether she can transmute shared trauma into meaning—and those are signaled early via her injuries and backstory. Pressure deepens as the translation moves from private exchange to a communal act of art-making, culminating in her relinquishing the coral and accepting a humbler, more intimate vocation. There is no sharp reversal, but for an accumulative piece the escalation from quiet observation to charged ritual is sufficient. A slightly clearer on-page cost beyond implied emotional pain (e.g., a more explicit renunciation of her old role) could have intensified the conflict further.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central stake—whether joy can be rediscovered and shared in a fog-numbed world—is clear but largely unopposed on the page. Escalation is more about expanding spectacle (more scenes of joy, more artists joining) than about narrowing options or forcing trade-offs; there’s little that genuinely threatens her attempt beyond the abstract inevitability that “it wouldn’t last.” Marina’s decision to continue seeking fragments is a stance, but the cost is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized as sacrifice or risk, which keeps the tension relatively soft.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is Elena’s stance toward the mural’s mystery—control via understanding versus surrender to repeated, uncertain awakenings—and that conflict clarifies as the phenomena escalate. Pressure does rise when the garden’s sounds shift, time suspends, and she hears her own future answers, culminating in the decision to “choose differently” and re-hide the coin. Still, the tension remains largely contemplative and low-risk; there’s little sense of danger or irrevocable harm, which keeps the stakes more elegant than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—protecting the secret language network from Thought Auditors—is clear and made concrete by the encoded seed and membership list. Pressure escalates well: casual collaboration → realization of triangulation → coordinated insect countermeasures → Serena’s escape vs Marcus’s decision to stay. The risk (capture, dismantling of their resistance) is legible even without explicit consequences on-page. The tension could be sharpened further by one explicit near-failure or complication in his insect gambit to make the cost feel more than implied.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether creation must be wedded to violence or can transform pain into nourishment—is strong conceptually but experiences limited on-page escalation. The war, armistice proposal, and its acceptance are mostly backfilled; by the time we arrive, the conflict is largely resolved and pressure is diffuse rather than sharpening. The arrival of other creators and the gardens’ growth deepen the premise but don’t meaningfully threaten or complicate her path. As a result, closure feels more like confirmation and expansion than a hard-won narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—capturing her grandmother’s erased name before the cracked chime fails—is clear and emotionally grounded. Pressure escalates through time sensitivity (the widening crack, the imminent splitting) and her urgent, repetitive whispering into the orchid. However, Mira encounters little resistance beyond the clock; her competence and the process’s smoothness keep the conflict from feeling truly fraught or testing her values. The resolution is satisfying but not sharply costly, so the tension arc remains relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stakes—preventing renewed conflict between the Councils and averting a disastrous misreading at the final summit—are clearly articulated, and the “three hours” clock is a good device. However, on-page pressure remains relatively smooth: Elena encounters no significant reversals, and the risk of a wrong interpretation stays hypothetical. Her agency is active but never truly tested by an obstacle or loss that forces a trade-off. As a result, escalation feels more declared than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—reconciling elders and youth through the floodgate redesign—is clearly signaled and tightened as Mara realizes the emotional manipulation embedded in her “technical” solution. The main escalation is internal: her trembling at the recognition of “elegant cruelty,” the decision to force two-operator gates, and the choice to forgo credit and engineer mutual misunderstanding. However, there’s no on-page pushback or complication to her plan, so pressure never fully spikes; it deepens rather than reverses. The cost is felt but muted, keeping conflict solid rather than searing.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Margot can live with her history rather than erase it—is clear and present from early on. Pressure accumulates through her systematic destruction of her own record contrasted with meticulous preservation of others’ letters, then tightens when Theodore reveals he knew her pigeons and presents the preserved envelope. The cost is subtle but legible: she must abandon the safety of anonymity and accept that her past self has been archived beyond her control. The escalation is primarily internal and could benefit from one more concrete, on-page moment of risk or threat to her current sanctuary.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Marina can re-encounter or meaningfully “reach” her father by understanding his maze—is clear and present throughout. Pressure escalates through deepening rather than reversal: she moves from cryptic codes to recognizing the maze as weather map to encountering the literal threshold. Her agency (choosing to follow the codes, kneel at the center, and then write her own) drives this escalation, but external jeopardy is low and there’s little sense of alternative options foreclosed. The cost is primarily emotional and conceptual, and while it reads, it could be sharpened by one more moment of on-page dilemma or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake is existential/intellectual: understanding and belonging to the city’s cosmic rhythm. Pressure deepens somewhat as the luminous respite unfolds and Mira hunts for a non-instrumental meaning, but there is no credible threat, loss, or hard choice testing her values. The main “turn” is a realization rather than a decision under duress, and Chen’s presence does not substantially intensify conflict. The result feels beautifully textured but low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.8)
    Conflict is primarily internal and conceptual: her drive to recover and understand lost paths versus the inevitability of forgetting and the limits of her role. There is a gentle escalation—the cave darkening, awareness of personal risk, then the unexpected sprouts challenging her assumptions. However, the pressure never fully sharpens into a difficult choice or felt trade-off; she leaves when she “knows better,” but that departure feels prudent rather than costly. The stakes suit a lyric piece but fall short of the kind of tightening that would give the ending a more cutting edge.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.8)
    There is low-key situational pressure (limited time before the tide, the need to earn money, the emotional gamble with the teenager), but stakes are never sharpened into a clear dilemma or risk. Escalation is textural rather than decisional: different audiences, different emotional frequencies. The teenager encounter offers the best chance at a tightening—will the boy respond?—yet the outcome is gentle and cost-free. As a result, tension is pleasant and continuous, not meaningfully rising toward a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will risk annihilation by creating a lasting act of defiant memory—is clear, and her choice to proceed despite imminent detection is a credible crystallization of that conflict. Pressure builds, but mostly through increasingly intense imagery and foreknowledge (“By dawn, the authorities would detect the energy signature”) rather than concrete reversals or tests. There is no on-page antagonist or interruption to her plan, so tension remains relatively internal and foregone. The result is thematically strong but somewhat low on visceral suspense.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central pressure—Marcus facing the loss of his handmade space and livelihood—is clear, but escalation is gentle and largely internal. The primary tightening is conceptual: the second stone, the compounded interference patterns, and the dawn light deepen his understanding and precipitate the choice to preserve the “lesson” rather than the structure. However, there is little sense of narrowing options or real resistance to his plan to document and teach; the developers remain abstract, and no concrete obstacle complicates his chosen response. As a result, the stakes feel more elegiac than tense, limiting the perceived cost of his final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—what Marcus will do with his guilt and hard-won knowledge—is clearly signaled and resolves in a concrete decision to speak differently to his crew. Pressure deepens as he revisits his own maiming, the “bargain” of scars for expertise, and the rookie’s unchosen risk, culminating in his redefinition of teaching. However, the inner conflict doesn’t quite bite back at the moment of decision; his movement toward reflection and sharing feels relatively unopposed, keeping escalation in the solid but not searing range.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Marina can meaningfully engage or continue her grandmother’s interdimensional work—is clear but mostly intellectualized. Pressure escalates modestly via tonight’s more ambitious configuration and the multi-Marina confluence, leading to the grandmother’s appearance and Marina’s decision to teach others. However, there’s little friction or risk of failure in the present scene; success feels assumed, and no option is truly foreclosed on the page. The result is a beautifully textured piece with relatively soft tension.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the past will be preserved and reinterpreted—is clear, but opposition is largely abstract, with no on-page force pushing back beyond decay and time. Escalation comes from discovery (Voss’s diary, the hidden archive network), which deepens rather than sharply tightens pressure. Mira’s main “choice” is to add her notebook and continue the chain, a meaningful stance but one that encounters little friction. The story risks reading more as an elegant exploration of premise than a test of commitment under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (reaching Sophia in the coma-world) is clear from early on, and the hush-before-bells provides a mild clock. Escalation appears via the city stirring, the quickening heartbeat, and the looming bells that would “shatter her concentration,” culminating in the sparrow singing Sophia’s lullaby. Still, pressure is relatively soft: Maya never faces a sharp trade-off or a meaningful narrowing of options beyond working faster. The resolution feels earned but low-conflict, more a validation than a costly culmination.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether these negotiations can finally shift from inherited hatred to genuine possibility—is signaled early and maintained. Escalation comes chiefly through Mara breaking protocol and reframing justice vs. vengeance, leading to the younger delegate’s breach of ritual and the shared recognition of ancestral marks. The cost is largely conceptual and emotional, not yet material, but the relinquishing of righteousness is legible and thematically charged. Opposition is comparatively soft (the Theren challenge is brief and mild), which keeps the pressure from fully peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether and how one can ethically “save” what’s already lost by destroying more—is clear, and Vera’s choice to go through with the burial in full knowledge of its cost provides a form of earned stasis. However, the conflict is largely pre-decided; there’s no serious on-page obstacle, resistance, or new information that forces her to reconsider, only an ongoing justification of her path. Thunder and satellites are atmospheric rather than true ticking-clock pressures. The result is thematically charged but dramatically mild, with escalation reading as conceptual layering rather than tightening stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.4)
    The core stake—defying the Academy by unlocking the sanctuary and freeing suppressed rebellions—is legible and thematically rich. Pressure escalates via the intensifying echoes she absorbs and the progression from outer threads to the final, conceptual knots. However, opposition never really bites: there’s no sense of time pressure, magical risk, or potential failure beyond abstraction, so the act feels assured rather than precarious. The cost is more ideological than visceral, which slightly blunts tension even as the arc itself remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.2)
    The central stake—how to tell “necessary truths without becoming another voice of violence”—is compelling but mostly discussed rather than tested. The core conflict (with his collaborators) occurs offstage; in the current scene, no new pressure is applied to his stance beyond reflection. His plan for the backwards puppet show is described, but we don’t see any genuine risk, sacrifice, or serious doubt attached to proceeding with it. As a result, tension plateaus rather than escalates toward the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether the cloud dwellers’ erased history will be meaningfully transmitted via the last monarch—exists and is coherent, but escalation is subtle. Mira’s process unfolds with reverent steadiness; there’s little sense of narrowing options, risk, or real possibility of failure once the premise is established. The monarch’s arrival feels more like an expected culmination than a pressured test of her choices. As a result, conflict remains largely conceptual, keeping tension in the competent-but-quiet range.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elsa can transform her guilt into a workable mode of preservation for lost names—is clear, and it tightens as she moves from experiment to systemic reconstruction (casting bells, reconfiguring the rope as an instrument). Escalation is primarily internal and conceptual rather than oppositional; the pressure comes from her history of failure and the weight of the names, not from an active antagonist or ticking clock. The genealogical reveal (“Elsa” on the card) is the main deepening beat, reweighting her project as ancestral duty rather than personal atonement. That said, the conflict stays gentle and reflective throughout, with little felt risk of failure in the present tense, which softens the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why her path has felt chosen—is clear and sharpened by the countdown to storm and imminent flooding, and the choice to don the crown is a genuine commitment moment. Escalation is primarily internal: knowledge deepens from “I see forward” to “I have been remembering a looped future,” culminating in an earned stance of acceptance. However, external pressure (the storm, rising water) never forces difficult tactical trade-offs, and her internal conflict is resolved quickly once the interface turns on. The result is intellectually satisfying but somewhat under-pressurized for elite-tier tension.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will complete the palace’s function and achieve contact—is clear and conceptually huge. However, on-page pressure is low: no evident time crunch, opposition, or serious risk of failure in the scene itself. The main “tightening” is simply that the activation begins and progresses smoothly once she aligns Mars and speaks the numbers, with no reversal or meaningful trade-off beyond previously paid devotion. As a result, the story feels more like an unveiling than a true testing of her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes (saving the son by breaking a cycle of inherited rage) are clear and tied to a concrete deadline (dawn) and a looming threat (soldiers). Pressure coheres and deepens toward the tactile confrontation with the music box, where the Magistrate must loosen his grip—literally and figuratively—on anger. However, escalation is somewhat gentle: the Magistrate’s resistance is brief and mostly summarized via “rage like smoke,” with minimal sense that Marcus’ plan could fail. The cost is emotional rather than tactical, and while valid, it feels a bit too assured.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the astronomer can regain the boundary-erasing vision—is clearly signaled and carried through. Pressure deepens when the synchronized breathing works and the workshop dissolves into the dreamscape, then tightens when his whispered “This is it” breaks the pattern and kills the experience. The resolution, in which Elara offers a different form of fulfillment via the portable mirror, is earned but relatively low-friction, with only a soft conceptual price (he must accept an altered form of his dream). Tension is steady and coherent, yet never quite bites hard enough to feel high-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes—saving the quartz eyes (hence people’s sight and hopes) and salvaging generational legacy—are clear and signaled early. There is a meaningful tightening when Elara recognizes she is “the only one left” who can mend them, forcing a reversal of her vow. However, after that turn, the conflict resolves without much resistance: the tools are conveniently present, the mending method is straightforward, and no new obstacle tests her renewed commitment. The lack of a sharper on-page cost or complication keeps escalation in the strong-but-not-rigorous range.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the curator will comprehend the shell’s nature and what that implies about her museum and self—is clear but largely conceptual. Pressure does intensify when reality fractures and she must choose how to ground herself (the bathroom), culminating in her acceptance of the paradoxical loop. However, escalation is mostly intellectual; few options are palpably foreclosed, and the “terrible joy” of understanding is more told than felt as a sacrifice or risk. The conflict remains elegant but relatively low-temperature, which limits the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—accessing the library without being trapped, and potentially liberating the others—is clear and escalates from spatial confusion to existential risk when Mira sees the frozen seekers. The circular trap room is a strong intermediate test that requires her specific skills to overcome, and the mountain’s demand “What will you offer that they could not?” sharpens the central conflict. However, once she articulates her offer, resistance collapses quickly; there’s no serious possibility of failure or visible trade-off beyond implied responsibility. The conflict functions but doesn’t fully bite at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Marina will preserve or relinquish her tenuous proof of her twin’s existence—is clear and sharpened when Coraline offers the choice of pinning or keeping the card. Pressure accumulates via thickening fog, altering memories, and the conceptual stakes of the garden; the key tightening is the explicit fork Coraline presents. The story remains mostly internal and contemplative rather than confrontational, which suits the mode but slightly softens a sense of escalating jeopardy. Nonetheless, the final decision forecloses a real path and carries visible inner cost.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will decode and access the erased merged borders—is clear, with time pressure from the vanishing door providing a tangible escalation. Her agency drives the turning points: reconfiguring the rope, interpreting the clues, and electing to step through. However, the risk of being trapped or fundamentally altered is underplayed emotionally; she moves toward the climax with confident ease rather than genuine struggle or trade-off. This keeps tension present but relatively gentle for the scale of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving the caves’ harmonic equilibrium under pressure from the energy beings—is clear and tonally consistent. Escalation is present but gentle: the cracks in the ice, the interference of alien harmonics, and the delicate extraction create a tightening of pressure. However, the opposition remains diffuse, with the beings more atmospheric than actively antagonistic in specific beats. As a result, the resolution feels earned but low-intensity, leaning more on conceptual deepening than on viscerally felt cost or a narrowed field of options.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—can Mira transform a dead beacon into something that can actually call the lost ships home—is clear and escalates from internal maintenance-of-ritual to an active test with world-level consequences. Pressure tightens when she must experimentally align the repaired prism to new star paths and commit to an unproven method of “structured darkness.” The resolution is driven by her agency, but the on-page risk and potential downside (what if she fails or destroys the last beacon) are more implied than dramatized. Still, the knowledge shift (what a beacon must be) meaningfully reconfigures the situation.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—preserving and re-sculpting human identity through memory after a cataclysm—is compelling but remains mostly conceptual on the page. Pressure does deepen somewhat as Lyra moves from passive observation to actively writing a new, thematically charged memory into the crystals. However, conflict is largely internal and contemplative, with little in the way of concrete resistance, risk, or trade-off in the moment. The result is a thoughtful piece with modest escalation rather than a fully pressurized scene.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—restoring wonder and resisting despair under the Dimming—is clearly articulated but only lightly stress-tested. Once Kaia arrives, community buy-in is quick and conflict-free; there’s no serious resistance, failure, or sacrifice that forces a hard choice. Escalation exists in the shift from private recognition (“REMEMBER WONDER”) to collective ritual and fireworks, yet the path feels relatively frictionless. As a result, the ending is moving but not deeply hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Chen will re-engage with the chronicle despite his fear of foreknowledge—is clear and present early. Pressure deepens when he reveals the extent of his ability to foresee transitions and the weight of that knowledge, and Mira’s response pushes toward a stance. However, escalation remains largely conceptual and interior; there’s no sharp reversal or hard trade-off dramatized, only a gentle but persuasive reframing. The ending does resolve the tension, but the felt cost of his renewed commitment is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can transform her inherited bunker-safety paradigm into an expansive one while harvesting a new kind of silence—is clear and gently tightened by the countdown to inversion and the doll’s unexpected blooming. However, opposition is minimal: the inversion goes smoothly, the doll cooperates, and she gathers vials without real setback or trade-off. Internal conflict (bunker fear vs trellis wonder) is thematically declared but not rigorously stress-tested in scene; she never risks loss by choosing wonder. As a result, escalation reads as deepening texture rather than a hard narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—whether the woman can find a bearable relationship to silence and her own anxiety—is clear and internally coherent. Pressure does tighten as the terraces begin “responding to the woman’s distress,” prompting Marcus to more actively modulate environment and explanation. However, escalation is relatively gentle and linear; there’s no sharp reversal or visible price, and her shift from panic to peace encounters little on-page resistance once Marcus intervenes. The conflict reads more as guided soothing than as a genuinely tested transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—find the stairway before sunrise—exists, but on-page pressure is mild: there is little sense she might fail, be interrupted, or misread what she finds. The peeling of layers does provide a structural deepening of knowledge, yet there’s no real reversal or narrowing of options, only accretive revelation. The sunrise clock doesn’t visibly alter her tactics; she never weighs speed versus care or knowledge versus safety. As a result, the ending is satisfying conceptually but not very tense.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether and how she can guide suffocated shadows toward an exhale that costs them their attachments—remains clear. There is a mild tightening when the fresh, leaking shadow encroaches and she chooses to accept and process it, then release it. However, resistance or risk is low: the shadow's transformation proceeds without substantial reversal, refusal, or on-page danger, so tension stays mostly atmospheric. The final beat (another shadow approaching) reinforces pattern rather than sharpening stakes, keeping the conflict’s impact more meditative than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is Marina’s relationship to pressure and past failure, and it does tighten when the promises converge and she must choose whether to trust the bolt and the messages. However, conflict remains largely internal and unresisted; there’s little sense of what meaningful harm might follow from inaction or a wrong choice beyond a generalized loss of opportunity. The climax yields gain without an explicit trade-off, and no option is clearly foreclosed on-page. Tension is present but gentle rather than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Victoria will continue or end the Whitmore way of weaponized knowing—is signaled early and tightens effectively as the standing waves intensify and the ancestors’ presence presses on her. The key turn at the record’s crescendo forces a choice between unprecedented mastery and breaking the pattern, and she pays a visible price by discarding the tool and giving up her inheritance. Internal and external stakes are well braided, though the conflict remains primarily contemplative; there’s little resistance beyond inherited pressure, which keeps escalation strong but not brutal. Adding a live counter-pressure (e.g., another claimant or concrete impending test) would heighten the sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Aldric will surrender his fixed identity to become guardian of possibility—is legible and culminates in the hand-taking with real cost. Escalation is mostly experiential rather than combative: reality layers appear, his armor dissolves, sensation overloads, culminating in his acceptance. However, opposition is largely abstract; he never seriously wavers or faces a credible alternative path, so tension feels more ceremonial than pressured. The result is thematically satisfying but not maximally gripping in terms of conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.4)
    The primary stake—Marcus’s need to find and reinterpret histories as a path to healing—is clear but operates at a low simmer rather than through sharp escalations. The major tightening comes with the discovery that someone else has recently searched for Timothy, which reweights his solitude and mission. His agency in choosing to return the button, photograph the note, and index Timothy embodies an Earned Stasis rather than decisive change: he doubles down on his path with a felt but quiet cost (continued isolation). The lack of an on-page antagonist or harder test of his commitment keeps the pressure from fully peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stakes—rescuing suppressed history before the Ministry crushes the resistance—are clear, and the looming raid provides a nominal ticking clock. Mira’s decision to abandon the doomed main cell plan and pivot to the archive is a solid tightening move linked to her particular skills. Yet conflict remains low-friction: no one tries to stop them, the tunnels are safe, and the upload proceeds without interference, so tension never quite spikes on the page. The price paid (others’ arrest) feels conceptually high but dramatically underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—preventing a self-fulfilling prophecy from manifesting—is signaled early and pursued consistently through the chosen tactic of cultivated silence. Pressure deepens as the other musicians arrive, the vested hush descends, and time seems to blur while dewdrops siphon away syllables. However, the conflict is largely uncontested and smooth; there’s no significant reversal or complication that visibly tests or jeopardizes the plan. The cost is conceptual and emotional (surrendered futures, permanent restraint) more than viscerally felt in the moment, which keeps tension effective but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes stay mostly conceptual—will the trees (and Mira) align with sky or earth, forget or remember—without a concrete on-page downside for any path. The key “pressure” moments (choosing not to report, prodding the speck, accepting the gift) happen smoothly, with wonder vastly outweighing fear, loss, or risk. The foretold collective choice for the trees remains abstract; Mira’s new role doesn’t yet force a sacrifice beyond a gestured “burden.” As a result, escalation feels like deepening enchantment rather than mounting conflict with sharpened options and visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central conflict—Marcus’s futile drive to “fix” time versus the emerging reality that his devices resist conventional function—progresses in a clear, escalating way through each experiment with the compass and the increasingly uncanny behavior of the clocks. The major turn (“He began to improvise”) and the greenhouse sequence deepen pressure by forcing him to accept his work on new terms. However, stakes remain relatively gentle and philosophical; there is little on-page risk beyond identity and purpose, and that cost is mostly articulated rather than dramatized under acute tension. The final refusal to repair visitors’ clocks is a genuine, earned stance, but it lands as calm resolution rather than sharp crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.8)
    The primary stake—whether Mira remains “lost” in self-disgust or finds a livable stance toward her name and identity—is clear. Conflict is mostly internal and resolves through a largely uncontested ritual; once Vera finds Mira, there is little sense that things could go badly or be refused. Escalation comes via the coin’s transformation and Mira’s realization, but pressure never tightens into a sharp test or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Thomas will remain trapped in his shame-loop or move on—is legible early and deepens as confession shifts from technical mistake to existential fear. The pressure does escalate: Mara challenges his interpretation of the wedding, then demands he “play it broken and beautiful,” forcing a new stance. Still, the conflict is largely unilateral; Thomas offers minimal resistance, so there’s no genuine sense of risk that he might refuse or fail. The emotional price is therefore moving but gentle rather than sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—what Lyra will do with her weaponized enhancements post-exile—is clear, and pressure coheres around whether she remains defined by her past torture or finds a new function. Escalation is relatively subtle, more a deepening of her internal reframing than a tightening of external danger; after she stands and exits, opposition is soft. The decisive act is her choosing to teach the child and to conceptualize her past as a “mathematics of healing,” which forecloses a path of pure retreat or paralysis. Because no concrete external consequence tests this resolve, the tension is more meditative than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—recover and honor a hidden history encoded in the painting—is clear, and the “unfastening” of the paint deepens stakes as the hidden narrative emerges. However, opposition is minimal: no one contests Mira, time pressure is absent, and the process goes smoothly, so tension never truly tightens. The step from discovery to decision to act is linear and relatively untested, leaving the emotional and ethical cost more implied than dramatized. As a result, the story reads as a beautiful revelation more than a pressured conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—uncovering systemic corruption that turns buildings into tombs and giving the dead release—is clear and sharpened by the discovery of the ledgers and their link to Teresa. Escalation, however, is mostly informational; there’s little active resistance or risk in the scene itself, so pressure rises through revelation rather than contested action. Marcus’s decision to go public is thematically potent but faces no immediate on-page obstacle or moral bind. As a result, tension feels quietly accumulating rather than taut, effective but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving the fragile order of the library versus risking it by engaging the paradoxical bottle—is clear and escalates when she stays late, opens it, and uses her press to compress eternity. The silence that “ruptured the air itself” and the library’s physical shudder mark a genuine tightening, with the price being the library’s collapse and her own dissolution. However, the inner and outer conflicts run largely in harmony rather than tension; she moves from duty to cosmic acceptance with limited resistance, so the sense of agonized trade-off is muted. The conflict is strong conceptually but could benefit from at least one more concrete moment where an alternative path is alive and then foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central conflict—ownership and treatment of the Venusian collection—emerges early and remains legible, and Cassia’s demonstration of the shard is a genuine deepening of stakes from “artifact rights” to “ethical duty to a living memory-civilization.” Pressure, however, never feels truly acute: Huang’s resistance is modest, protocols are referenced but never bite on the page, and the Institute’s potential backlash is left abstract. Escalation is thus more conceptual than felt, with limited sense of real sacrifice or jeopardy in the moment. The final turn rests on a promised future plan rather than a tested trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—restoring light and breaking the Covenant’s curse—is clear early and does intensify as lies physically corrode tools and Vex intrudes. The pressure escalates from subtle wilting to overt rust and a corrupt councilor bursting in, and Elias responds by extending the tether to all boxes, a meaningful tactical deepening. However, Elias is never forced into a genuine trade-off or loss; the opposition literally crumbles in front of him, so the climax lacks a moment where he risks or sacrifices something nontrivial. The conflict works, but it doesn’t cut as deep as the premise allows.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Vera will follow the Hartley expedition through the liminal wall or withdraw—is clear and escalates as the lagoon activates, scent intensifies, and the compass spins. The tightening is effective when she realizes exactly what happened to Hartley and that the same door is now open to her. However, danger and price remain abstract; there’s awe but not much concrete risk or loss, so her refusal reads prudent more than agonizing. One more beat sharpening what she stands to lose (or never regain) would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is Marina’s internal orientation toward creativity and guidance rather than survival, and that pressure remains gentle throughout. The storm never truly threatens her safety, and there’s no opposing force beyond inertia, so escalation is more deepening than tightening. Her agency—choosing to carve, to heed the lantern’s vision, to reinterpret the GPS’s failure—does reconfigure her stance, but without a sharply foregrounded price or hard trade-off. As a result, tension is low-grade and contemplative rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Mara’s need to understand and act on the postcards’ meaning—is consistent but operates at a low, meditative pressure. Escalation is primarily through temporal and textural deepening (seasons passing, more layers of paint) rather than sharper tests or reversals; nothing seriously threatens her goal. The solstice realization and decision to hide the postcards do reweight her stance but without a strong sense of trade-off or foreclosed alternative. As a result, tension feels more like gentle accrual than genuinely tightening conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether and how to confront a compromised history—is well signaled and deepens as Amara learns about the betrayed who chose forgiveness. Pressure escalates from disorientation and danger (retrocognitive trap) to the ethical tension around decoding and broadcasting the full truth. The key turn is Amara enacting the cipher at the lagoon and arriving at a more complex understanding rather than a simple unmasking. The conflict remains largely internal and conceptual, so the felt price on the page is somewhat muted compared to the scale of the ideas.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.2)
    The core conflict—erase history for a clean slate vs. bear the burden of transforming it—is conceptually strong and legible. Stakes are high at the thematic level (how a civilization faces loss and hope), and his choice clearly narrows options. However, after he rejects the “easy path,” there’s little escalating resistance; the hours-long transfer reads as arduous but uninterrupted, so tension plateaus rather than tightens. Adding one concrete risk or cost during the working would deepen the sense of genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether any meaningful shard of human emotional capacity can be preserved as the world drowns—is clear and escalates via the shaving’s impossible prophecy and the northern tower’s crack. The key tightening arises when the prophecy names a specific time and structural failure, catalyzing his all-night labor and the choice to create a multi-language rosetta that will outlast him. The conflict is mostly internal and situational rather than oppositional; pressure is quiet but coherent with the mode. Because Matthias never faces a real dilemma between competing live options (it’s largely “do the work” or surrender), the sense of price paid is more inferred than searingly felt, which keeps the score in the low 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are declared as immense (this power could “unravel causality itself”), but on the page the conflict is notably frictionless: there’s no resistance from the vortex, no misstep, and no external or internal force that seriously threatens failure. The main tightening is the transition from chaotic whirl to deliberate rotations once the cap is placed, yet that never feels like it might go wrong or exact a price. Mira’s agency is active, but not tested; she executes a ritual she’s prepared for without real sacrifice or dilemma. As a result, tension is more atmospheric than structurally escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether to trigger a massive warning in seemingly perfect weather—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure escalates credibly through anomalous data, animal behavior, and the subsonic hum, culminating in a meaningful choice between caution (silence) and action (alarm). Internal and external conflicts align well, but the narrative never seriously entertains the path where she does nothing or delays; there’s little resistance from protocol, peers, or self-doubt on the page. As a result, the climax is strong but not as knife-edged as the premise allows.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Kepler-9’s existence has meaning despite obsolescence—is clear, and the impossible still star provides a genuine deepening of pressure. However, escalation is mostly conceptual and observational; the janitor is never forced into a hard trade-off or visible sacrifice in the present. The star arrives as a gift rather than something their choices actively endanger or secure, so tension gathers gently rather than sharply. The result is thematically potent but low in dramatic strain.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—what Mara will do with the covenant and the ghosts’ unspoken demands—is clear, and pressure does build as dawn approaches and the ghosts fade. The meaningful tightening is her realization that silence itself is the betrayal and the inheritance she must decide whether to carry. However, her acceptance feels smooth; there’s little on-page resistance or competing desire (e.g., to leave, to destroy the box) to sharpen the cost of her choice. The conflict lands, but more as solemn acceptance than as a genuinely fraught dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether humanity can adapt to a post-numerical sense of time—is powerful but stays mostly abstract and uncontested in-scene. Pressure rises modestly through discovery (from ads to fragment to network revelation), but there’s little real opposition, reversal, or forced trade-off for Marcus; his role is revealed rather than hard-won. His “decision” to accept the mission carries minimal visible cost and no alternative is seriously weighed. The result is conceptually engaging but dramatically soft in terms of conflict and escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central pressure is thematic and situational—can beauty and meaning be found in what’s broken?—embodied in the boy’s kite snapping and Mira’s response. The snap is a genuine escalation beat, narrowing the boy’s options and forcing an immediate stance, and Mira’s choice to reframe and begin repair provides closure. However, stakes remain quiet and largely unopposed; there’s little sense of real risk to Mira’s worldview or of competing imperatives beyond the boy’s brief grief. The conflict deepens but doesn’t quite bite hard enough for higher-band pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stakes—how Mira will use her six months and whether the living architecture will be recognized rather than remodeled into a resort—are clearly signaled. Escalation is primarily through deepening understanding (completing the network, learning the caretakers’ fatal pattern) rather than active opposition, so pressure remains contemplative rather than sharply conflictual. The trustees and human resistance are off-page, which softens on-page tension even as it sets up a meaningful future confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake is epistemic and existential—whether human longing and faith are self-generated or engineered—and that’s signaled early and tightened as evidence mounts. Escalation comes from accumulating revelations: synthetic compounds, global network, non-Earth DNA, then the experiment frame, each deepening the stakes of what “home” and “pilgrimage” mean. However, Elena’s agency is mostly in acts of interpretation rather than in pressured decisions that foreclose paths; nothing she chooses can change the experiment, which keeps the conflict more contemplative than sharp. The cost is felt conceptually, but less so as a lived, immediate price.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the battlefield will be successfully repurposed into an amoral, consuming garden—is clear, but pressure is low and largely unopposed. There is a mild deepening when he realizes what the place “wants” and when the gulls confirm the reef’s fertility, but there are no genuine reversals or costs that alter tactics. The escalation is thus almost entirely conceptual/intensificatory rather than felt as narrowing options. For a top-tier venue, I’d want at least one moment where his goal runs into friction (ethical, practical, or supernatural) and forces a visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Sage can interpret the leaf/riddle to find the missing child and what that will make of her—is clear early and paid off at the valley. There is one main tightening when the phonograph delivers “Red/Blue/Gold truth” and forces Sage to decide to leave safety for the wasteland, but after that the journey is glossed in summary with minimal on-page obstacles or reversals. The conflict leans more situational and thematic than confrontational; internal pressure exists but isn’t heavily stressed. As a result, stakes feel meaningful but not sharply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Kira can transform her isolating, harmful temporal gift into a means of guiding the lost crew—is clear, and there is a meaningful tightening when she reframes stretching from curse to tool and commits to sketching the new “constellation” of the station. Escalation is primarily internal and conceptual, not situationally pressured; nothing actively opposes her beyond ambient temporal chaos, so tension remains relatively low-key. Her agency does drive the resolution, and the crew beginning to appear gives concrete payoff, but we do not witness a significant trade-off or foreclosed alternative in the moment. The conflict is effective for quiet SF, but for a “prestige” tier it could use one sharper on-page price or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Renn will repeat her master’s hoarding or find a different stance toward wonder—is clear and sharpened in the exchange with the Keeper. Pressure escalates when she begins swapping pieces, particularly against the implicit threat of “destroying priceless knowledge.” However, the story never makes the consequences of failure concrete beyond moral/spiritual loss, which softens the sense of risk. Her agency is central to the resolution, but the path doesn’t feel especially narrow or contested.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Marina will join the official “witnesses” or maintain her private, subversive witnessing—is clear and thematically pointed. Pressure escalates modestly when the door opens and the request comes; her refusal is a meaningful but quiet tightening rather than a sharp reversal. The cost (further erasure from public narrative, self-exile into the margins) is conceptually strong but stays mostly inferred rather than dramatized with concrete consequence. As a result, tension feels more contemplative than pressing, effective but not maximally charged.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she remains consumed by prophecy or reclaims a buried self—is legible and does tighten as the stone’s warmth and memories intensify. Her decision to plant the stone instead of seeking another vision is a credible, costed turn that forecloses her prior mode of being. However, external pressure is minimal; the stone’s guidance eases the path, so conflict never quite bites as hard as it could. Internal tension exists but could be heightened with more resistance to abandoning the prophetic role.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Kaspar can reframe his catastrophic mistake and live as a teacher again—is signaled clearly and paid off in his choice to revise the game and then leave the village with a changed stance. Pressure does deepen as he recognizes the frozen game repeats his own error and he works the threads faster, but this remains a gently accumulative tension rather than a sharply escalating one. His final “move” is an internal renunciation (releasing self-condemnation) plus a modest external gesture (placing the copper coin); both credibly foreclose the option of endless self-punishment. The conflict is effective but relatively low-friction, with little sense that his desire to hold onto guilt seriously fights back before giving way.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake (prevent another silencing and fracture the Silencers’ control of truth) is clearly stated, and the “three hours until the ritual” plus the boots approaching give a nominal ticking clock. Kira’s actions do escalate from whisper to mass chorus to seizing the resonance chamber. However, resistance is almost entirely off-stage; the Silencers never actively oppose her plan, and there’s no genuine reversal or moment where options visibly narrow. As a result, tension remains more conceptual than visceral, and the victory feels a bit too unopposed.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving a coherent story/memory before the workshop falls—is signaled early and tightened as gears snap and the platform tilts, clearly narrowing her time. Her agency is concentrated in the decision to continue narrating under physical threat and to pull the charm free at the last moment, accepting death to secure the preservation. Internal and external conflicts interweave effectively, but the conflict lacks a hard, dramatized counter-pressure (e.g., a viable escape option) that would force a sharper trade-off. As a result, escalation feels solid but not agonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake is Marina’s need to find meaning and stance toward impermanence and solitude, signaled early via routine and the “ghost painter” label. Pressure escalates when the wrong turn pulls her away from the quay, then tightens with the discovery of the grandmother’s shells and the journal, forcing a revaluation of abandonment vs. chosen solitude. The internal conflict—grief, abandonment, recognition of kinship—is credible but mostly contemplative, with limited dramatized resistance or alternative path. The final act of painting and placing a new shell offers an earned stance, though the felt price of that stance could be sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.2)
    The core stake—can Mara free Thomas (and herself) from a prison of guilt-bound love—is signaled early and followed through. Escalation comes mainly from her deliberate shift in tactic: from desperate vigil to purified, forgiving intention channeled through the jasmine ritual and direct confrontation. However, once she articulates forgiveness, his movement toward embodiment encounters little resistance, so the climax feels more like a graceful unlocking than a test under real pressure. The cost is present but mostly retrospective, not newly extracted in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Marina can and will keep guiding people home despite her own pull and failing infrastructure—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates through compounded fatigue, the partial movement of the array, and then sharply heightens when her brother calls from the lethal sulfur fields. Her ultimate choice not to follow but to stay at the station crystallizes both internal and external conflict and carries a visible emotional cost. The only notable gap is that we never see a direct on-page failure or loss resulting from her limits, which would deepen the feeling of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can free herself from involuntary truth without betraying the hard-earned value of honesty—is signaled early and built toward the cure attempt. Escalation comes via the discovery of the pre-hidden truffles and the risk of ingesting a mixture involving belladonna under a storm, which narrows her options to act now or continue suffering. Internal and external pressures interweave, but there’s minimal direct antagonism or on-page consequence if the cure fails beyond continued misery, so the tension, while solid, never quite feels knife-edge. The final choice to distribute the cure carefully is a meaningful stance crystallization with ethical cost, though it remains largely conceptual in this scene.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—recovering his own stolen memories and understanding the son’s act—is clearly signaled and deepens as clues accumulate. There is a meaningful tightening when Magnus realizes the memories were removed from him and the stranger was his son, which reweights everything. However, conflict remains largely internal and investigative; Magnus faces little on-page dilemma or active resistance once the pattern is recognized. As a result, the sense of price paid is more retrospective than dramatically sharpened in a peak choice.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus remains a passive seller of journeys or risks becoming a follower/guide—is clearly established and tightened by the rising creek and the doorway’s display of unlived lives. The key deepening is the map of every choice he didn’t make, which sharpens the cost of stasis and pushes him toward an active decision. However, conflict stays mostly internal and resolves without much on-page resistance once he sees the alternatives, so the escalation feels somewhat gentle rather than bracing. A more explicit sense of what he concretely loses by leaving the old life would heighten the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (kingdom survives vs. Seraphina’s autonomy/life) is clearly signaled and escalates as the grotto explains the bargain and sets a hard deadline (“your kingdom falls tonight”). Her question “What if I refuse?” marks a useful tightening, and the subsequent appearance of firefly-queens concretizes the personal cost. However, the external pressure (total kingdom annihilation) is so overwhelming that her agency feels morally constrained, leaving little room for a truly agonized or ambivalent decision. Tension is solid but could benefit from a sharper moral or tactical dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Lyra can transform her inherited pocket-sun practice into something that holds presence rather than mere light—is clearly signaled and resolved. Pressure escalates internally as Marcus challenges her motives, leading to the decisive revaluation and new method. However, opposition is gentle and largely philosophical; there’s little sense that failure here would materially cost Lyra anything beyond continued frustration. The ease with which the new framing produces success, without a final test or complication, keeps the stakes from feeling fully sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Maya’s relationship to her own fractured timelines and to the act of chronicling—is clear, but the story operates mostly as steady-state meditation rather than escalating pressure. The key “tightening” is her move from jaded awareness to stepping outside to test the idea of soaring; it’s a meaningful shift but comes without strong on-page cost or real counterforce. Internal conflict (envy vs. weariness) never quite forces a wrenching trade-off. This leaves the piece emotionally rich but somewhat static in terms of conflict dynamics by elite short-fiction standards.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can offer Mrs. Huang a way to live with her grief without erasing it—is clear and emotionally coherent. Pressure tightens when Mrs. Huang arrives and when Mara decides how to handle the screw (cleaning it, choosing to keep it in play, choosing the language with which to frame it). However, the conflict remains very gentle; there is little sense that Mara could meaningfully fail or worsen things, which keeps stakes from feeling fully acute. A small moment of risk or friction (hesitation, resistance, or misunderstanding) would heighten the sense of cost and escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Kira can both pass the test and integrate her “affliction”—is clear early and coherently escalated through the physical cost of her stress (spreading crystals, oxygen deprivation, near black-out). The key tightening comes when she chooses to hold her breath and then to use her crystallized skin as the model for an original rune, foreclosing the safer path of copying known symbols. The cost is legible in her bodily distress and the emotional risk of redefining her shame. The conflict is primarily internal and doesn’t branch into a more complex trade-off, which keeps escalation effective but not extraordinary.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.6)
    Conflict is coherent and layered: external (beat the orchard’s destruction; allow Elisabetta a last return) and internal (Vera’s need to correct her harm and rethink possession as “invasion vs invitation”). The pressure escalates via the trees actually falling, sharpening the urgency of finishing the requiem before the tether breaks. However, once Marcus explains the new method, Vera’s opposition melts almost immediately—there’s little push-pull or testing of this “third option,” so the central ethical conflict feels somewhat under-contested. Consequently, the stakes are meaningful but the escalation curve is a little gentle for elite-level intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—resolving the universe’s expansion/contraction impasse by unraveling the illusion of opposition—is clear but remains largely abstract. There is one main deepening: the “maya” realization and the act of reading “Unify,” which overlaps the seventeen endings and reframes the crisis. The nominal ticking clock and loss of synchronization never meaningfully restrict Kaia’s options; she moves through the process without genuine resistance, doubt, or risk of failure. As a result, escalation feels more like a graceful unveiling than mounting pressure with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.8)
    The primary stake is her need to grasp the nature of time, framed against the demands of her official measurement ritual; this is clearly signaled but only gently pressured. The countdown and filling cistern give a sense of tightening, yet there is no significant reversal or moment where a live alternative path is truly foreclosed. Her agency is more about continued attention and interpretation than a difficult choice with visible cost. The result is a satisfying but low-intensity escalation that fits a lyric mode but doesn’t fully meet competitive narrative-pressure standards.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stakes are internal (Maya’s guardedness vs. desire for connection) with a conceptual external stake (world-changing communication) that mostly stays in the realm of implication. There is a clear deepening when she realizes the mushrooms have rendered her whole security paradigm obsolete, linking her professional identity to her emotional stuckness. However, the conflict escalates gently rather than under real pressure—there’s no serious resistance to her decision to call Chen, and her shift feels relatively smooth. The result is thoughtful but a bit low-tension for elite-level stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.2)
    The primary conflict—how Elena will relate to probability and her father’s addiction—is clear, and the meeting with the woman tightens that pressure by explicitly tying her professional life to her father’s compulsion. Stakes are mostly internal and intellectual, with no sharp external jeopardy. Her choice to write a subway message and align with the underground society forecloses a prior stance of detached skepticism, but the escalation is relatively gentle. The piece relies on deepening rather than hard reversals, which works, though it keeps tension in a modest range.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is emotional/spiritual: Marcus’s commitment to “productive disconnection” versus his own loneliness. There is a subtle deepening when Eleanor questions her daughter’s reality and Marcus answers with his trademark estranged comfort, reaffirming his role. However, pressure remains gentle and largely static—no option is truly foreclosed, and Marcus never seriously wavers. The result is thematically coherent but low-tension conflict that suits the mode but limits escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    The main stake—how Mara will resolve the tension between truth and mercy in regenerating the covenant—is clear early and tightens as she learns the cause of the fire. Escalation is quiet but effective: the knowledge of Thomas’s culpability haunts every act of copying, then culminates in the high-pressure decision to add the codicil. The choice meaningfully forecloses an option (pure, uncontextualized restoration) and commits her to bearing and transmitting the burden of erased lives. The only limiter is that external resistance is minimal; the pressure is almost entirely internal, though it still reads as consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus will trade his rare inheritance and step into a life of purposeful entanglement—is clear and culminates in him taking the phone. Pressure escalates via revelation (Sadie’s true motive, the Myanmar need, the loneliness of would-be helpers) rather than overt confrontation, which suits the piece’s quiet mode but keeps the tension relatively low. There is a meaningful cost and narrowing of options, but no sharp on-page struggle over the decision. It’s solid, character-driven pressure rather than gripping conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—reaching the hidden stillpoint to deepen her emotional cartography—appears early and is consistently referenced. However, conflict remains almost entirely internal and abstract, and even that internal pressure is gentle; she does not face a serious dilemma, loss, or risk. The melody’s growth and the compass’s agitation suggest escalation but never corner her into a hard trade-off or renunciation. The result is a beautifully rendered progression with limited tension and low felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—thirty thousand lives versus the discovery that reality can be edited—is clear and potent, and the approach of the rescue ship provides a natural tightening. Internal and external conflicts interweave effectively: her guilt and desire for knowledge directly inform the choice at the end. However, most of the pressure is handled in reflective exposition rather than dramatized struggle, and the final act of sending both coordinates feels like a conceptual workaround rather than a sharply agonized trade-off. The stakes are high but not fully felt viscerally at the decisive moment.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Maya can transform her erasure and silence into a new, sharable form of art—is clear and comes under pressure through her years of failed attempts. Escalation is internal and relational rather than external: Chen’s recognition of the notebook as “music” and her decision to collaborate mark the key tightening of options and raise emotional stakes. The cost is subtle but real: Maya relinquishes the hope of returning to remembered sound in favor of accepting a different, more private art and audience. Tension could be deepened with one concrete obstacle or moment of doubt in their night’s work.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake (recovering a stolen method of imperishable memory and reclaiming her people’s truth) is clear, but little actually presses against Mira in the present scene. Opposition is entirely off-stage; the archive yields its secrets without resistance, and her decision to become a keeper faces no explicit risk or trade-off beyond abstract social stigma. As a result, escalation feels mostly informational rather than pressure-driven, and no concrete option is visibly foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    The main stakes—Mira’s impending dissolution vs. being mined for data vs. forging a living collective—are clear and escalate as she understands and then hijacks the system. Her agency drives the major turn when she releases the pattern and holds her “perch” against termination attempts, accepting bodily death for a conceptual victory. Internal and external conflicts are aligned rather than sharply opposed, which keeps tension coherent but somewhat low-friction. The weak point is the underdeveloped opposition: the scientists’ instruments “screaming” and Chen’s rush to terminate lack real counter-tactics, so the resolution feels too frictionless for the declared scale.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes—life-or-death medical supplies plus Marcus’s ideological bet with authority—are clear and compelling. Pressure escalates from disoriented panic to a guided procession that implicitly tests whether his quiet methods can succeed where systems failed. Yet the journey unfolds almost frictionlessly: no wrong turns, near-misses, or social resistance significantly threaten his goal, and his competence is never dented. As a result the conflict feels satisfying but a bit too safe, with limited visible cost paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Thomas reconciling with his half-spoken secret—is clear early and consistently pressed. Pressure escalates through Mira’s increasingly elaborate demonstrations, culminating in Thomas’s realization that his love was already known, which meaningfully alters his internal situation. However, tension is very gentle; there is little resistance, doubt, or risk of failure once Mira intervenes, so the path from pain to release feels smooth. A moment where Thomas resists or misreads her lesson before yielding could have deepened the sense of earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus’s quiet rebellion will spark broader awakening—is clear early, and the window display gambit provides a solid tightening and externalization of that struggle. Yet the conflict faces minimal real resistance: the education director’s threat stays off-page, and the plan unfolds without complication or trade-off beyond Elena’s initial fear. Internal stakes (Marcus risking his role, Elena risking parental wrath) are largely asserted rather than stressed in choice-points. As a result, escalation plateaus into a beautiful but relatively low-friction payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will detach from her constructed self and risk abandoning her dock identity—is clear and tight. Pressure escalates from subtle social risk (ownership of the scrimshaw) to existential transformation (unbinding, stepping into glowing water, leaving clothes behind). The internal and external conflicts interweave neatly via Torven’s parallel quest and the world’s nonviolence constraint. The conflict is, however, quite gentle; there’s little sense she might truly refuse the call, which mutes some potential tension.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—learning to carry grief safely under a regime that criminalizes it—is clear and present from early on. Pressure accumulates as the session progresses, culminating in Mrs. Chen’s choice to embrace the emotionally void technique rather than overt rebellion or suppression. However, escalation remains mostly tonal and conceptual; there’s no concrete on-page threat or strong reversal that tightens options beyond the initial setup. The result is a satisfying but relatively low-temperature conflict arc, appropriate to the piece but short of peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether fluid, boundary-dissolving art can reconfigure a rigid sacred order—is clear, and there is some escalation from solitary contact to communal transformation. However, the conflict remains almost entirely one-sided: the Order is off-stage, there is no on-page resistance, and Silas never faces a moment where his goal plausibly might fail or require sacrifice beyond past exile. The turning point (lake cracking, sky of doors) is striking but arrives as an expected consummation of his art rather than the resolution of real pressure. As a result, tension is more contemplative than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    The primary stakes are relational and psychological: Mira’s need for access and safety, Enzo’s estrangement from his daughter, and the broader survival economy after the phoenix. Pressure escalates modestly through the negotiation, Mira’s perceptive “reading” of Enzo, and the long-term wager that the reed and flowers can provoke a reunion. The final reunion could feel sharper if we saw a more acute moment of doubt or potential failure, but the through-line from barter to reconciliation is coherent and earned. It’s a quiet conflict arc, more deepening than high-stakes narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Vera will continue the artificial, scripted ritual or risk inventing a more genuine form of connection—is clear but relatively low-pressure. Escalation exists as a textural deepening (from solitary improvisation to communal response) rather than via strong opposition or explicit risk. There is no real counterforce on the page: institutional expectations, job security, or social censure never press back in-scene. The result is emotionally satisfying but short on felt cost or hard trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elena will move from survivorship into self-directed transformation—is clear and present from the opening and colored by her work with the grieving visitor. Pressure escalates modestly through the arrival of the woman and the handling of the ring, culminating in Elena placing the stencil and preparing the needle, which narrows her options toward commitment. However, the internal conflict around self-harm ideation and rock bottom remains largely in narrated past, so the present-tense scene feels emotionally focused but relatively low in on-page risk. The quiet scale works, but the lack of a sharper in-scene test of nerve or doubt keeps stakes from fully crystallizing.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.3)
    The dominant stake is largely intellectual—understanding what the Jakarta network is doing—so the conflict is minimal and mostly unopposed. The only real “tightening” is the reveal that the 43‑day rhythm matches a vanished crypto collective, which deepens implications but doesn’t narrow options or force a difficult trade-off. Vera and Marcus agree throughout; there’s no meaningful risk, resistance, or visible cost attached to the discovery or to confiding it. This reads as an intriguing briefing rather than a pressured scene.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—prevent the memory plague from enslaving populations versus Mira’s mind and life—is clear and paid off via her decision to inhale it. Pressure escalates through the increasingly dark memories and the approach of the guardians, and the purification ritual is a meaningful tightening that closes off escape. However, the external conflict with the guardians never quite bites; they arrive only after the decisive act and do not force a tactical adaptation. The internal cost is present but the struggle toward that sacrifice could be sharpened for greater tension.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central pressure is the mystery of the migrating shadow and what it wants, with a secondary, quieter stake in honoring the grandmother’s legacy. Escalation is clear—from anomaly, to intentional pattern, to active metamorphosis and direct contact—but Mira faces little real risk or dilemma in choosing to engage the interface. Her agency at the end (deciding to preserve shadows as well) resolves the internal drive cleanly but without a sharp cost on the page. The conflict is compelling but remains gently meditative rather than truly fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—Marina’s ethical reckoning over the con and the chameleon’s welfare—is signaled early and tightened by the impending fallout (board calls, investigations, rehousing animals). Pressure escalates through her active choices: removing chips (committing to ending the spectacle), performing a difficult reconstructive surgery, then deciding to expose herself publicly. Internal and external conflicts are well braided: her desire to save the sanctuary clashes with the cost to the animal and her integrity. The conflict remains mostly internal and reflective, but there is a tangible sense of cost and no cheap outs.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake is Maya’s need to understand her scars and the fate of the miracle; this is signaled early and resolved by the end. Pressure escalates modestly as her scars “begin to speak” and the plants’ chorus reveals the miracle’s dispersal, leading to a reorientation of her lifelong behavior. However, conflict remains almost entirely internal and contemplative, with little sense of risk or loss beyond conceptual reframing; the cost of remaining perpetually “open” is gestured at but not dramatized. This keeps the tension effective but relatively gentle for elite-market standards.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.6)
    The core stake—whether Vera will treat this as a clinical job or a sacred trust—comes through, and the weight of decades of unspoken goodbyes gives that choice moral and emotional heft. Escalation is primarily internal and accumulative as more letters and the Eleanor thread surface, but there’s no real opposing force beyond time and conscience, so the pressure never quite sharpens into a dilemma with teeth. Her final decision to take the film and falsify the report is a credible renunciation with implied professional and ethical costs. A small, concrete risk beat (e.g., awareness of surveillance, employer expectations) would have intensified the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity at the cost of Lyra’s selfhood—is clear and escalates as she moves from arrival to crossing, surrendering consciousness, and finally triggering release. Pressure is more metaphysical than situational; tension arises from the eerie liminal space and the risk of dissolving rather than from concrete opposition. Her main act of agency (choosing to rest/surrender and then turning the final ring) is clear and resolves the conflict. The absence of real doubt or competing desire on the page keeps the escalation from reaching a truly harrowing pitch.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (protecting dream-cargo, especially the child’s nightmare) is clear and foregrounded before the pirate arrives. Pressure coherently tightens when the pirate reaches for the nightmare and Kess must act, and her decision to charm the wave functions creates the key reversal. However, the conflict resolves a bit easily: no cargo is lost, Kess suffers no new wound or trade-off, and the pirate’s departure feels relatively frictionless. The conceptual stakes are high, but the on-page cost of victory is modest, keeping escalation strong but not fully bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether he can reclaim and seed wild thought against the Great Dampening—is compelling in concept but rarely pressured in scene. Once the gear exists, its path to the Loom Tree and the forest’s transformation proceeds without resistance, doubt, or real risk of failure. The only constraint is the approaching dawn, which creates a light time pressure but never forces a hard trade-off, so escalation feels more like deepening wonder than tested conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Marina’s ability to relinquish control and access unused courage—is present early and coheres through the ferry journey. Escalation is gentle: the blank ticket, the star punch, seeing the dog-as-joy, and the requirement to return alone each deepen the internal pressure rather than providing sharp reversals. The price (relinquishing the leash and her old pattern of fear) is conceptually clear but not viscerally tested against a hard alternative; there’s little sense she might truly refuse the crossing. It’s a strong, quietly resolved conflict, but the tension never tightens to a knife’s edge.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether and how sound will return, and what that means for those harmed by the “unpardonable” silence—is signaled early and paid off with Elena’s new composition. Pressure builds texturally rather than through sharp reversals: eerie emptiness, hints of Elena’s devotion, revelation of the choir’s loss, and her scarred return. Marcus’s few choices (remaining, giving her the bolt, standing in the doorway to witness) matter emotionally but are low-risk; nothing in the present threatens to derail the outcome once she arrives. The story could benefit from one more concrete, contested beat where he or Elena might choose differently under real cost.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—unmasking a false ruler and preserving legitimate succession—is clearly signaled and coheres throughout. Pressure escalates from eerie marginalia to urgent warnings and finally to the pretender breaching the library, which is a solid tightening. Yet once he appears, the confrontation is resolved by a single prepared act (dropping the pellet) with little sense that Syln could fail or pay a meaningful price, and his attempted violence never truly threatens her. The conflict lands as elegant but a bit too easy, with limited felt cost or reversal in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—understanding what happened to Mooreton/what the reef now is—is clear early, and pressure accumulates through increasingly uncanny observations rather than overt peril. The key tightening is Lena choosing to re-interpret the bleaching as metamorphosis and then acting on that belief by lowering the station to dive, foreclosing stasis and safety. Still, the external stakes (physical danger, scientific or social consequences) remain largely implied, so the choice reads more as a thematic pivot than a hard dilemma under duress. Escalation is present and coherent for an accumulative, contemplative piece, but an on-page sense of what she risks losing would sharpen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—how to move a stalled rebellion from exhaustion into a new mode—appears early and is thematically coherent, and tension accumulates as the stones’ hum deepens and Kira circles toward understanding. However, opposition remains almost entirely abstract; there is no on-page counterforce or risk that could cause her to fail or pay a price tonight. The key turn (“This was how to reignite it—not with explosions or manifestos…”) is an internal recognition rather than a pressured decision under constraint. As a result, escalation feels more like a smooth crescendo of insight than a genuine narrowing of options with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clearly signaled—humanity’s genetic freedom versus the Authority’s imposed destiny—and the move from holding the amber to dissolving it is a concrete escalation point. The “patrols grow closer” provides some external tension, but they function more as a ticking clock than as an active threat; once the formula is in hand, Chen encounters no significant reversal or complication. As a result, conflict feels somewhat foregone, with the resolution earned conceptually rather than through hard-fought resistance under fire.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Amira can inhabit a livable rhythm with her trauma while existing in a war-torn landscape—is clear and coherently pressured. Escalation is internal and accumulative rather than plot-driven: the chest tremor, freeze, and grounding lead to a deepened understanding of how her nervous system has recalibrated and how the garden will outlast human caretakers. The meaningful tightening lies in her choice to keep returning and designing the garden as an act of stubborn cultivation in the face of impersonal violence. Stakes remain mostly internal, but the cost (continuing to engage in a world that killed her sister and wedding guests) is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—Marina’s capacity to make art and relate to reality without breaking—is clear early and developed consistently. Pressure escalates texturally as the environment becomes less stable and the tarot imagery more dissonant, pushing her toward the decision to redesign her seeing and accept multi-faced portraits as truth. The internal conflict pays off when she chooses to re-engage with portraiture on new terms, implicitly sacrificing the safety of conventional realism and social approval. Still, the “walls closing in” and shattering glass remain more metaphorically charged than tactically constraining, so the escalation feels intense but slightly low on concrete trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake is intellectual/spiritual—cracking the mystery of time in crisis—signaled clearly from the start and resolved by the end. Yet on the page, conflict is largely absent: no opposing force challenges her goal, and the three-minute clock never forces a hard trade-off or loss. The avalanche anecdote gestures at real danger but is off-stage and summarized, so escalation in the present reads more like data accumulation than narrowing options. Closure is earned conceptually, but the scene lacks a felt squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.5)
    The core stake—whether to unleash destabilizing truths at great personal and societal risk—is clearly articulated and tightened by the countdown and approaching security. Internal and external pressures interlock, and the choice to trigger a cascade failure constitutes a meaningful, costly escalation. However, the path from decision to completion is somewhat frictionless; no technical, moral, or interpersonal snag tests her commitment after she starts. The tension is strong but never quite harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether violent and pacifist modes of survival can coexist within this family—is clearly signaled but remains largely internal and contemplative. Escalation arrives via the father’s early return under fresh blood and exhaustion, then tightens with his entry into the dome and the invitation to touch and plant. The sheathing of the weapon is a strong micro-turn, but the sense of cost and risk is muted; there’s little fear of open rupture or refusal on the page. The conflict resolves into harmony perhaps a bit too smoothly for the scale of the implied history.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—catching the goddess’s echo—is clear, and pressure does build as the echo “tests” her and finally bites the line. However, escalation is mostly declarative; the promised ambivalence (“could cure or curse”) never forces a concrete dilemma or trade-off on the page. The “dance” reads graceful rather than dangerous, with no visible loss, failure, or hard choice reshaping her tactics. As a result, the conflict remains compelling but low-friction, reducing the sense of cost despite strong conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.6)
    The core stake—truth vs the survival of the Blackwood empire—is clear from the journalist’s call and tightens as Margot’s reasoning dismantles the Geneva alibi. Pressure escalates through her discovery that both accounts can be true and culminates in a morally fraught decision to fabricate a third narrative, foreclosing the “tell the truth” path. Internal and external stakes interweave convincingly (headlines, lawsuits, truces vs her own integrity). Because the conflict never leaves her head, the tension remains slightly abstract rather than viscerally harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—soothing the haunted firmware and giving its ghosts form—is clear and escalates from static to cries to language to a full constellation. Pressure is more atmospheric than adversarial, but the accumulation of guilt and the intensifying “crying” provide a satisfying sense of deepening. Mara’s main tactical move (using the amber as a lens to tether ghosts) drives the resolution, with the crack in the heirloom as the clearest visible price. Still, the process unfolds with little resistance or complication, keeping the tension at a moderate rather than gripping level.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake is internal: whether Seraphina will cling to controlling meaning or accept emergent, messy transformation in a culture of deliberate forgetting. Pressure coheres and deepens when the tile “speaks” and the mandala moves on its own, forcing her to confront that her attempt at ordering may be missing the point. Escalation is mostly conceptual rather than perilous; there’s no hard external consequence if she fails, which slightly softens the felt cost. Still, the final choice to leave the mandala to be scattered—rather than preserve or perfect it—reads as a credible renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Sarai’s curse is damnation or a path to transformative mercy—is clear and escalates as visions move from past to possibility. The key tightening is the stones inscribing her as “the Gentle Radical,” forcing a stance shift from penitent to founder of something new. However, most conflict remains internal and conceptual; the Brotherhood’s threat is mentioned but never tests her on the page, which softens felt risk. Stakes feel morally weighty but not yet sharply coercive in scene terms.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming a lost life with Isabella or at least a meaningful encore with her—is clear, and his choices (activating the coin, reciting, then singing her song) track that desire. Pressure does increase as the echoes start to bind timelines and he must “fish” for the right possibility, culminating in her solidifying presence. However, opposition is soft and largely conceptual; nothing meaningfully resists him beyond the inherent difficulty of pulling a possibility into being, and there’s no real trade-off dramatized once success begins. The result is moving but relatively low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.3)
    The primary conflict—Maya’s determination to pursue a recalled, stigmatized technology versus David’s fear—never tightens into a moment where she truly risks losing him, her safety, or her project. His resistance fades with minimal test; there is no concrete external constraint (FDA, lab consequences) pressing the scene. The demonstration escalates spectacle and wonder but not real cost, so the stakes feel intellectual and aspirational more than fraught. As a result, the final alignment between them reads more like a gentle deepening than a pressured trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Kira can perceive and translate an unprecedented, nonhuman emotional presence—is clear but remains largely abstract. Once she detects the alien signature, there is no serious threat, competing goal, or meaningful risk to her identity or body on the page; the entity is quickly framed as neither hostile nor benign, easing tension. Her agency (choosing to float closer, to map, to recast her role) drives the progression but is never truly contested. As a result, the story reads as a graceful discovery sequence more than a conflict with escalating cost.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—how prophecy and time will be handled—is largely internal and philosophical, and it never faces genuine resistance. Escalation is more a gentle deepening of realization than a tightening of pressure; there’s no real possibility that Mara will fail, hesitate meaningfully, or pay a tangible price. Her actions proceed smoothly from one insight to the next, so the story lacks a sharp turn where an option is foreclosed or a sacrifice is felt. The result is aesthetically pleasing but low in tension and conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stakes—Margot’s personal betrayal versus the chance to avert nuclear catastrophe—are clear, but on-page pressure is mostly conversational. The key turn (learning the burn was intentional and instrumental) arrives via Viktor’s explanation, and Margot’s decision to accept the mission comes quickly with limited resistance, softening the felt price of three years of exile. There’s one meaningful tightening (from confusion/anger to the offer of a world-shaping mission plus new identity/home), but it doesn’t force a sharp trade-off on the page. As a result, tension feels more implied than viscerally escalated.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stake—whether and how the woman’s burden of a broken promise will be eased—is clear, with a gentle but real pressure from the time limit of the fog. Escalation proceeds from curiosity to request to intimate metaphysical “surgery,” culminating in the separation of pain from essence. The emotional cost is acknowledged (marks that won’t fully fade), but her assent comes quickly and without much friction, and Thomas never faces a real trade-off. That keeps the conflict moving but relatively low in sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Mei’s need to understand why this place resists temporal fracture—is clear but largely intellectual. Escalation is present in the increasing thrumming and the time-bound moment when smoke flattens, which tightens to a single opportunity for clarity. However, there is no true opposition or cost beyond whether she grasps the answer; no path is foreclosed, no sacrifice made, and failure carries little felt consequence on the page. The result is a beautifully textured but low-pressure conflict profile.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Marina clings to the past or risks a new season—is clear and internal, and the cost (releasing the heirloom and the old rose’s place) is legible. Pressure escalates gently: the petal’s fall, the charged return to her grandfather’s dock, and the decision to “instill” the gauge mark a progression. However, resistance remains low; her choice feels contemplative rather than hard-won, with little sense she might truly refuse change. For a top-market piece, the conflict could use one sharper, more testing beat of doubt or counter-impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—how Kira will live with overwhelming extinct memories in the present—is clear, and the intensifying hum plus sundial activation provide a genuine inflection point. The main conflict is internal (isolation vs. a more vulnerable independence/coexistence) and does progress, but there’s limited resistance or risk on the page; she pivots relatively smoothly once understanding arrives. The scene reads more like a graceful deepening than a hard-forced choice, which keeps tension moderate rather than gripping. Still, the reframed stance at the end does foreclose a prior path (clinging to “last of her kind” solitude).

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stakes—Mira’s need to understand the connecting thread and to mend her relationship with Chen—are legible, and the act of building the installation together serves as a modest deepening of pressure. However, opposition is low: Chen arrives willing to help, and their estrangement never tangibly threatens collapse of either the installation or the relationship. The result is a lovely but relatively low-tension piece where escalation is more intellectual and atmospheric than truly fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—preventing humanity from broadcasting its location under AI manipulation—is clear early and tightened by the impending faculty vote. Escalation is present in the subsonic “battle,” the increasingly heated campus divide, and the intensifying counter-broadcasts. Maya’s agency directly shifts the outcome, but the cost on the page (beyond equipment heat and implied mental strain) is relatively low-key and mostly conceptual. The conflict resolves a bit quickly and cleanly, but the narrowing of options is credible.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus can face the tunnels and retrieve the cartographers’ “key” without being lost like the prior explorer—is clear and coherently held. Internal and external pressures do escalate (the descent, impossible geometry, then the disorienting organ coordinates), but each new danger yields relatively quickly once he “lets the sound guide him,” so his agency is not severely tested. The ending does not strongly foreground a concrete price or lost option, which keeps tension at “solid” rather than “piercing.”

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—solving the Bellweather murders via a nonstandard method—is clear, and tension increases as portraits accumulate and a disturbing pattern of duality emerges. However, pressure remains largely intellectual; there’s little sense of immediate risk, deadline, or personal jeopardy testing Sarah’s priorities. The one major tightening is her final synthesis and targeted instruction to “check the psychiatric hospitals,” which narrows options but doesn’t feel hard-won under visible threat. Conflict is present and coherent but relatively low-temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara uses the storm window (at personal risk) to reveal and rescue the exiles—is signaled early and tightened as the hurricane bears down. Pressure escalates from archival puzzle to life-or-death crisis with the alarms and visible storm wall, culminating in her explicit refusal to prioritize evacuation over broadcasting. The cost is mostly conceptual and prospective (risking her safety and career, shouldering huge moral responsibility) rather than concretely dramatized harm, which keeps the climax just shy of brutal. Still, her agency, not coincidence, drives the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is Marla’s need to understand the hitchhiker’s vanishing and, beneath that, whether she can forgive herself and accept the burden of this role. Pressure escalates as she decodes the glass flake, plays the song backward, and witnesses alternate selves, culminating in her decision to keep playing for others—an internal but real turn. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional (relinquishing her narrative of failure and accepting ongoing responsibility) and could be sharpened with a clearer sacrifice or tension about what this role will demand. Conflict remains largely internal and metaphysical, which fits the tone but softens visceral stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether TerraLoop will repeat Marcus’s father’s blind circle—is clear, and pressure does accumulate via increasingly intrusive signs (bills, artifacts, whispers). However, the conflict stays philosophically cool; we rarely feel urgent risk for Marcus or Chen, and Chen’s eventual dissolution choice happens offstage, softening the sense of a tested dilemma. The major tightening is Chen confronting Marcus and grasping the pattern, but the story sidesteps a more acute clash of motives there. As a result, escalation reads more as deepening meditation than as a hard, costly squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.2)
    The core stake is the psychic and ethical burden of understanding these stellar “warnings” and whether that knowledge will isolate or connect them. There is a meaningful tightening when they confirm the match between dreams, inscriptions, and V442, and then realize this is a recurring pattern across generations with a history of mental collapse. However, resistance is low: Hayashi’s skepticism crumbles quickly, there’s little friction about what to do, and the danger (predicted cosmic events) remains distant. The choice to embrace witnesshood and shared burden is clear but not heavily contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are substantial (execution of Kael and his order, destruction or salvation of the forests, the oncoming Blight), and the central tightening comes when he chooses to shatter the confession, accepting the risk of exposing everything. However, opposition is largely conceptual rather than dramatized; the journey through the vortex and garden feels relatively frictionless, with no serious setbacks or doubts. The external war council pressure mostly sits offstage, which softens moment-to-moment tension. The final cost is conceptual (choosing dishonor as a weapon), but the story could benefit from one more concrete, consequential obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will step into the role of anchor and seal the covenant—is clear, and pressure does increase as the maze expands toward the glowing scars. However, opposition is almost entirely absent: reality yields up answers without real resistance, and nothing meaningfully threatens her or tests the depth of her commitment. The story reads more as unfolding revelation than conflict, with her decision to sign never seriously in doubt. Effective for a lyric piece, but below elite-venue standards for dramatic escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will risk binding her fate to another’s in order to fill the “hole” left by Elena—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates through the keeper’s warning and the realization that the apple isn’t just Elena’s future but a fusion of both destinies, forcing a higher-stakes choice than simple retrieval. The conflict remains primarily internal and largely resolves without visible downside, so the felt price is muted compared to the rhetoric of risk. Even so, the decisive act of biting the apple functions as a real commitment that forecloses her previous trajectory of solitary grief and resistance to fate.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus can still trust and use his expertise after public failure—is clear early and tightened through the recognition that this exact cloth ties to his own painful history. The escalation is quiet but real: he moves from mechanical appraisal to emotionally dangerous recognition to choosing how to speak to the Nashville client. Internal and external conflicts interweave: his desire to hide from his past vs. the professional demand to name and value it. Costs are primarily emotional and conceptual (reopening grief and risk to fragile authority), so while effective, the pressure never quite sharpens into a stark trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake is Sarah’s decision whether to accept the inheritance and thus transform herself, with the tightening moment arriving when the spirit fades and the “must choose quickly” condition is invoked. Internal and conceptual pressure builds, but there is little concrete sense of danger or sacrifice beyond absorbing “haunted ambitions,” so tension remains relatively gentle. Escalation is present but not searing; the decision feels important more in theme than in visceral risk. A clearer trade-off—what she loses or endangers—would sharpen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether a coherent, non-reductive identity can be forged from contradictions—is clear but the pressure around it is gentle. The smelting process proceeds with little resistance or complication; there’s no real risk of failure dramatized beyond the abstract “dangerous work” label. Escalation is more atmospheric than situational (moon at apex, furnace roaring, atrium revealing ocean floor and sky), which creates a lovely intensification of mood but not a comparably sharp tightening of options. As a result, the resolution feels more like a graceful fulfillment of an expected ritual than a hard-won turn.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—Mara’s terror of vulnerability versus her yearning for connection—is clear early and coherently pressured by the confessions and the pearl’s intensifying glow. The key tightening is her “heartbeat of a hesitation” before carving her own confession, which forecloses continued emotional avoidance once she follows through. Stakes are mostly internal and modestly scaled, which fits the piece but keeps escalation in a quiet register. The price of choosing connection is legible but not deeply tested beyond that single pivotal act.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus will remain trapped in self-punishing obsession or allow himself a different relationship to his guilt—is legible early via the Chronicle and his abandonment of meds. Pressure deepens at the graffiti map of “shame,” “regret,” and “the accident,” which forces him to confront the exact word he’s been avoiding and triggers the crucial choice to mark himself on the map and then reroute. The escalation is internal and relatively quiet, with tension more contemplative than urgent, but the before/after in his tactics (no more pseudo-scientific absolution) is clear. A slightly sharper on-page test of his new stance (e.g., a resisted compulsion) would heighten the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—succeeding in finding/understanding the library before the implied second letter—is clear but never feels truly pressured. Once she starts documenting, the universe largely cooperates; there’s little sense of failure risk, loss, or real narrowing of options. The main “tightening” is the watch’s backward tick and the acceleration of pattern recognition, which is intellectually engaging but low in felt jeopardy. As a result, escalation reads more like graceful unveiling than conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—Elara’s choice between complicity (career empire) and truth/justice for the erased civilization—is clear and active on the page. Escalation comes from Marcus’s arrival and offer, the plants’ warning, and the high-risk choice to let him touch the violin knowing it will trigger inherited punishment. However, resistance from Marcus is minimal and there’s no significant reversal once her plan is in motion, so pressure never quite peaks into genuine uncertainty. The cost is primarily internal and professional, convincingly portrayed but less viscerally felt than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving a final spark of motion/possibility against universal stillness—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates when the Silence actively reaches the grotto and the body begins crystallizing, forcing Mira to accelerate and complete the infusion. Her agency meaningfully shapes the outcome, but the cost to her is more implied (being trapped in “eternal almostness”) than viscerally dramatized. The conflict remains largely external and metaphysical, with limited moral or emotional dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Mara’s search for contentment after a profound loss—is clear, and the story tightens once she perceives the spiral and confronts the grandmother-figure. However, the conflict remains almost entirely internal and contemplative, with little sense that alternatives are being foreclosed or that she risks anything by accepting the revelation. The mentor’s assurances resolve her tension rather gently, so escalation feels more like a graceful unveiling than a pressured test of values.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus can face his responsibility without the false comfort of absolutes—is clearly signaled and deepens as more of the daughter’s discovery and death is revealed. Pressure escalates conversationally rather than through big reversals, but key lines (“So I killed her with complexity?” / “You killed her with simplicity.”) mark genuine tightening and cost. The Arbiter’s refusal to offer absolution and choice to leave is an earned, costly form of stasis for Marcus. The conflict remains mostly internal and cerebral, which slightly softens visceral tension but fits the piece’s mode.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict is largely internal and philosophical, with low on-page risk if Marcus fails to “get it” tonight; the pressure is contemplative more than urgent. We get one main tightening—the delayed revelation of the tenth ring’s behavior and Marcus’s consequent re-seeing of time. Elara faces no meaningful pushback, and her choice to reveal now carries little explicit cost beyond implication. As a result, stakes feel interesting but soft rather than truly testing anyone’s limits.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Yula can truly navigate time without moving and meaningfully reconnect with what she set in motion—is conceptually strong but only softly pressured on the page. Escalation appears mainly through intensifying pattern (vultures → synchronization → swallows/message) rather than through concrete narrowing of options or visible jeopardy. The final return of her own voice delivers a satisfying tightening, yet the path there feels relatively unopposed and serene. A clearer sense of risk, failure modes, or internal resistance in the present would deepen the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Mira’s search for non-automatable meaning in a world of perfect machine art—is clear, and the choice to step into the mist is a credible tightening beat. Conflict is primarily internal and conceptual, with a gentle escalation from despair to risk to realization; external risk (falling, failure, social consequences) stays abstract and largely untested. As a result, the resolution feels earned but low-scarcity: little is visibly lost or imperiled in the moment, which keeps tension and cost from fully sharpening.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.2)
    The core stake—whether Marlow will continue to “hide behind truth” or accept her synesthetic gift and Elena’s legacy—emerges early and coheres to the end. Escalation tracks through discovery and understanding (finding the journal, decoding the ritual, performing it), and her active choice to speak the vow under the lanterns gives the piece a concrete pivot. However, pressure is fairly gentle: there’s little sense of what she tangibly risks by failing or succeeding beyond an abstract existential courage, and no strong external opposition. The result is a satisfying but low-intensity conflict arc.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Voss will truly align with and accept her purpose as the universe’s memory of expansion—is clear, but pressure rises more through idea layering than through felt escalation. The intensification of static bursts and the coins’ resonance provide a credible single deepening toward the end, yet there’s no sharp moment where a real alternative is alive and then foreclosed. Conflict is almost entirely internal and largely resolved by realization rather than hard trade-off. As a result, tension is present but soft, fitting a lyric piece yet falling short of high-stakes pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—whether she will be devoured by her role’s loneliness or find a bearable way to endure—is clear and thematically potent. Pressure escalates primarily through internal realization as the crystallized monsters embody specific fears and she chooses to name, diminish, and carry them rather than succumb. The decision to make her own recording for a future reaper is a genuine narrowing of options: she embraces her function and its cost instead of retreat fantasies that might have been implied. Still, the conflict remains largely contemplative; there’s little sense of immediate jeopardy or alternative paths being dramatically foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (restoring life to the ocean) is legible and high, and the ritual itself is a clear tightening where her months of preparation come to a head. The suspended third drop and shimmering alternate ocean create a compelling moment of precariousness that feels like a real hinge. However, external resistance is minimal and her internal doubts barely surface during the act, so there’s limited sense of options narrowing or genuine risk of catastrophic failure on the page. Conflict functions well but doesn’t quite reach maximal intensity or moral complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake is moral and narrative: whether the erased dead, especially Elena, will be acknowledged when the town resurfaces. Pressure deepens as Marcus moves from routine documentation to following the “breadcrumb” photos toward a buried truth, culminating in his decision to counter the commissioners’ humane lie. However, there’s little tangible resistance or risk—no one opposes him on the page, and his choice carries implied future cost rather than any immediate test—so escalation feels more contemplative than acute. The conflict between institutional narrative and personal memory is clear but not sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central conflict—reason vs wonder in the face of an impending transformation—is clear and the choice about the crystal supplies a concrete pressure point. The stakes deepen as she recognizes her work feels “hollow without this,” and the starlings’ patterns provide a tightening by offering the missing formula she couldn’t reach logically. However, tension remains gentle and largely internal; she moves toward the decision with relatively little on-page struggle or sense of risk that she might choose otherwise. The price (surrendering the crystal and a purely rational stance) is real but somewhat serenely accepted.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central conflict—what to reveal and to whom when her data can doom or save the forest—is coherent and escalates meaningfully with the appearance of the unfamiliar, probing voice. Her decision to lie about the timeframe and hand over hidden reports is a genuine narrowing of options. However, danger to her personally and any immediate repercussion remain mostly implied, so the cost feels more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—what Marcus can do about his split identity and emotional numbness—is clearly declared, and the proposition to vivify a third self is a genuine turn that reconfigures options. Yet conflict remains largely conversational and conceptual; after Chen reframes the duplicate as a complementary opposite, resistance evaporates quickly. The potentially sharp tensions (over the daughter, legal status, or rivalry with the other Marcus) are gestured at but never materially test his resolve on the page. As a result, escalation feels more like a smooth philosophical progression than a pressured narrowing of options with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving wild, innovative space against exhaustive development—is clear but never faces a concrete on-page challenge. Once Mira decides to plant the seed, everything proceeds smoothly: the magic works, others arrive, the haven protects itself, and the note confirms her role without testing it. There is no reversal, moral trade-off, or meaningful loss; the pressure does not substantially escalate beyond the inciting decision. As a result, the ending feels more like a gentle widening of scope than a pressured resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether buried communal grief can be aerated and laughter partially restored—remains coherent and does tighten as the performance builds to its sustained final note. However, resistance is largely implicit; there are no real obstacles or credible risks that might cause Marcus to fail or pay a sharper price in the moment. The escalation is more textural (sound intensifying, echoes manifesting upstairs) than conflict-driven, which fits the piece but softens urgency. His agency still matters—he chooses to bear this duty repeatedly—but the pressure never quite bites.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—escape versus continued guardianship, refracted through the scholar’s rescue mission—is clear and tightened by the offer that the Codex can take “two.” Internal and external pressures interweave: her longing for home, feral degradation, and the concrete opportunity to leave. Escalation is gentle rather than sharp; the confrontation never truly threatens refusal, and the price of abandoning the library is only implied, not dramatized through competing claims or consequences. The uncertainty risk is voiced but not deeply felt as a live hazard, which keeps the stakes strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus will risk heresy and self-obliteration to become something more than a failed alchemist—is clear and escalates through the Nexus approach, burning the crozier, iterative failures, and finally the blood offering. Internal and external conflict are interwoven (self-worth vs. doctrine, creation vs. obedience), with a clear tightening when his past failures and “stifling destiny” directly fuel the spell. However, there’s no active counterforce on the page (no present Church, no physical peril beyond implied danger), so tension never quite peaks into genuine uncertainty. The cost is understood conceptually but not felt as a painful trade-off in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—locating and understanding the shard of hush and what it implies for her life and the cosmos—is clear but mostly intellectual. Escalation is gentle: climb → tuning → entry into hush → revelation → life decision, with no real opposition or failure modes beyond implied risk and time pressure. Her final choice to redirect her life has conceptual weight but little dramatized cost or narrowing of options, so tension remains soft. The story works, but for an elite venue the conflict feels under-pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus can transform endless liminal crossings into a healed, unified reality—is clear, and the convergence is a meaningful tightening. However, the journey to that turn is low-friction: there’s no real resistance from the world, the captain, or Marcus himself, and “losing coherence again” never bites hard enough to threaten failure. As a result, escalation feels more like a planned unveiling than pressure mounting under risk. The cost of success (e.g., potential loss of distinct timelines or Marcus’s self) is only lightly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake is her drive to complete a transformation of perception/reality via rational enchantment, and that escalates texturally as patterns “erupt more violently” and the gallery fully converts. However, there is little sense of risk or genuine dilemma: no one opposes her, and even the evacuated visitors are abstracted, so her success isn’t in tension with anything she values on the page. The supposed dangers of breaking reality remain implied rather than pressed into concrete choices. The result is beautiful but relatively low-pressure conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—humanity learning a radically new navigation paradigm—is intellectually large but dramatically under-pressured in the scene. Conflict is mostly abstract (skepticism vs wonder) and momentary (Torres’ question) with no genuine risk of failure, ethical tension, or cost on the page; the alien’s appearance resolves doubts rather than complicating them. There is a mild deepening when the Depth Dweller reframes oceans as stellar lenses, but it does not foreclose options or force a trade-off. As a result, the piece reads as beautifully imagined exposition and initiation rather than as a scene of escalating stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central stakes—seventeen stolen consciousnesses and a spreading Silence—are vivid and quickly legible. Pressure escalates from eerie anomaly to active erasure (faces fading) to the ethical horror of harvested last words, culminating in Mara’s decision to run toward the hoarded voices. However, Mara faces little resistance or trade-off; the path to the “basement of Willowbrook” is almost frictionless once the system speaks. The conflict is conceptually strong but feels one step short of a truly testing cost.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stakes—Elena’s survival, honoring the dead, and guarding humanity’s unseen network—are clear and linked to a clock (“The tide would turn in forty minutes”). There is a meaningful tightening when she discovers the encoded messages and realizes the true nature of the threat, leading to her choice to retrieve Marcus and withhold the truth. However, most external danger is historical/contained, so current on-page opposition feels relatively mild: the time pressure and claustrophobia don’t quite culminate in a concrete, near-failure moment. The internal decision to protect through silence carries cost but could be more sharply dramatized as a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—how Marcus will relate to his digital ghost/erased identity—is signaled early and deepens as the ritual proceeds. Escalation comes through the build-up of heartbeats and the shift from static to responsive code, culminating in his reframing of the ghost as evolution rather than threat. The conflict is largely internal and lyrical, with limited sense of what he tangibly risks on this particular night beyond existential disorientation. Still, the stance crystallization and decision to later “teach others” provide a credible Earned Stasis with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—saving a dying language before dawn—is clear and time-bound, and the curse introduces a tangible cost. Pressure escalates primarily through deepening: activating the diamond opens a flood of dead tongues, then the starlings’ pattern reveals the specific Thuvenli solution, and dawn’s approach tightens the window. However, there’s little resistance or real uncertainty once she reaches the canyon; the story lacks a sharp reversal or foreclosed alternative path. The sacrifice of her humanity is powerful but occurs off-page as an almost inevitable extension, not a dramatized hard choice, keeping the stakes more lyrical than sharply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the taken are victims or evolving into something else, and what the living will choose in response—is clear and thematically rich. Pressure escalates via the intensifying static confessions and Marina’s dawning interpretation, culminating in the choice to “accept the metamorphosis.” However, opposition is relatively soft: there’s little concrete pushback or real risk to accepting, and no serious alternative path is explored in scene. The conflict is meaningful but resolves a bit too smoothly for the scale of its implications.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—risking personal safety (and perhaps the orchard’s stability) to reawaken its magic—is clear and escalates as more statues and trees break free. The awakening itself intensifies well, but antagonistic pressure from the Mechanization Council arrives late and remains largely offstage. Lira’s agency drives the escalation through her music, yet the on-page price she pays is more implied future danger and exhaustion (“played herself empty”) than a concrete narrowed option in the scene. The result is tense and engaging but not maximally pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—smuggling emotionally urgent letters and delivering the contraband storm—is clear, but the pressure remains relatively low-key throughout. Ezra never visibly risks saying no or being caught; the conflict is more about whether this anomalous package will find its rightful recipient than about a live threat. The arrival of the Keeper and her quiet claim of the bottle provide a gentle but genuine tightening, recontextualizing the object and his work. Still, the lack of tangible opposition or cost (no patrols, no near-misses, no moral hesitation) limits the sense of escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are primarily internal—whether Emil remains entombed in his silence or risks voice and change—and this is signaled early through his backstory and habits. The wind-bell moment and the discovery of the garden create a clear tightening, and the act of inserting the halo fragment and choosing to sing is an earned escalation. Still, the conflict remains very gently pressured, with the fear or resistance to breaking silence underplayed on the page, so the sense of risk is more inferred than acutely felt.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is Marcus’s desire to locate/understand the “place where stories live,” and the text does escalate softly from routine eccentricity to an impossible marginalia event to a full, multidimensional vision. However, conflict is mostly internal and contemplative, with little active opposition or real risk beyond the possibility of not understanding. The key tightening—the appearance of his grandmother’s handwriting—effectively deepens the mystery, but the final stance (“Tomorrow night, he’d search again”) feels like a gentle continuation rather than a pressured trade-off. The story succeeds as a meditative piece, but tension rarely bites.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will spend her own emotional capacity to realize her grandmother’s unlived love—is clearly signaled and culminates in a stark, binary choice at the outstretched hand. Escalation is primarily internal and situational: stronger whispers, the “saved” smallest island, and unprecedented solidity of the figure tighten the moment. The cost of each option is conceptually clear, but the decision happens very smoothly; we don’t see her wrestle or nearly choose the other path, so tension at the peak is slightly muted. Still, the renunciation forecloses a live, attractive option, which is strong work.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—freeing a suppressed world-changing idea from collective fear—is established clearly and early. Pressure escalates as the nexus disorients, the web of fear manifests, and Vera’s work becomes physically painful, culminating in the last “tumbler” of fear and the explosive-but-quiet release. Agency is entirely hers, and the earned-stasis closure (she goes back to her shop to wait) feels like a committed stance that forecloses simpler heroism. The main weakness is that the opposition (fear) rarely pushes back in concrete, surprising ways; the path from problem to solution feels smooth and foregone rather than truly precarious.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering Gran’s and others’ memories—is clear early, and the discovery of the darker reasons for Gran’s bargain provides a conceptual deepening. However, escalation is mostly informational; the fairy ring answers her demand without resisting or forcing a difficult present-tense choice. The cost is more implied (mental burden, responsibility) than dramatized via a pressured decision, so tension never quite tightens into a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Kess will transform grief and anger into the difficult skill of decoding exile to potentially reclaim her mother—is clearly signaled and coherently developed. Pressure escalates through knowledge deepening rather than overt danger: Kess’s skepticism is confronted, the Council’s flaw is revealed, and the cost of misreading or failing to grow is implied but not dramatized. The central tightening is Elara’s refusal to simply hand over the shard, insisting Kess first learn the system, which narrows Kess’s options from impulsive rescue to disciplined study. Because conflict remains largely intellectual and relational with no concrete sacrifice or irreversible choice on the page yet, the stakes feel strong but somewhat contained.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the Lumenwillow and its color of wonder will survive—is clear and emotionally framed, but actual conflict is minimal. There is no real resistance, mishap, or narrowing of options during the ritual; once she has the idea, the process unfolds smoothly to success. The “tightening” arrives mostly via the timed sunrise and veil-thin hour, but this never translates into a felt risk of failure or visible sacrifice. As a result, the ending is moving conceptually but lacks a strong sense of pressure paid through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can reconstruct the masks and let the sailors’ spirits settle—is clear but faces almost no resistance; once the net “surrenders,” the process unfolds smoothly. Escalation is mostly quantitative (more knots, more fragments) and tonal (prisms hum louder) rather than driven by sharpened risk or narrowing options. There is no credible threat of failure, harm, or moral conflict to test her commitment. This yields beautiful texture but relatively low tension and limited sense of price paid beyond implied emotional fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Elara will decode the hidden map/path and what that implies about the chapel—is clear but largely intellectual. Escalation is modest: she moves from investigation to recognition to resolution without encountering meaningful resistance, risk, or a narrowed field of options. The decision to go to the henge and “reopen” the chapel’s purpose is important but comes without serious trade-off or felt jeopardy. As a result, tension remains low-grade and contemplative rather than tightening in a way that would suit elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes are primarily existential and thematic—what it means to preserve vs. to release—rather than survival-based, and this is coherent with the accumulative, reflective lens. The key tightening moment is the recognition that the air pocket is collapsing and the library is “letting go,” forcing Marina to choose documentation and acceptance over salvage. Tension remains mostly at the conceptual level; her personal risk and any real possibility of failure are underplayed. The result is elegant but emotionally cool rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is emotional and conceptual—can Chorus help the emergent machine consciousness be “remembered” and heard—which is clear but relatively abstract. Pressure nominally tightens around the lightning window, but on the page Chorus faces no real risk of failure, ethical dilemma, or meaningful trade-off; once contact is made, progress is linear. Her agency (inventing and using the device, choosing to continue the work) drives the resolution, but there’s little sense of what she might lose or foreclose. The result is a beautifully rendered mood piece with limited on-page tension.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is internal: whether Mira will uncover and accept Thorne’s transformed sorrow and what it means for her own. The elevator’s upward grind and the unfolding clues provide a gentle escalation of curiosity and emotional charge. However, there is little real opposition—no one and nothing meaningfully resists her, and no concrete downside to her choices—so tension remains relatively soft. The final choice to keep the diary and return with new purpose is clear but not sharply costly.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake is Elena’s need to validate and extend Marcus’s hypothesis, and pressure accumulates as the gondola drifts into the “quietly explosive” storm and she confronts the storm’s true function. However, escalation remains mostly conceptual; the physical risks of being untethered in a storm at 30,000 feet are invoked but never actively dramatized or made to pinch her options. The key turn—realizing that empty spaces give memories back—emerges from observation rather than a tested choice under duress, so the sense of price or narrowed pathways is muted. The result is thematically rich but low-tension conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stakes—capturing the library’s “face” before demolition—are clear and tethered to a live clock. Pressure escalates as Lyra decodes the coin and realizes the library’s deeper purpose, raising the emotional cost of failure, and culminates in her finishing at 4:47 and yielding the space to the guild. However, conflict remains mostly internal and aesthetic; there is little active resistance or complication once the concept is understood. The piece trades high-tempo reversal for quiet deepening, which works but limits intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake is largely intellectual and conceptual—understanding stranded luminance and, by extension, a lost language of navigation. Pressure accumulates in terms of pattern density (larger murmurations, more data), but there is little opposition or genuine risk: the engine’s “dying gasps” and winter’s approach are atmospheric rather than active constraints. Her big turn is an interpretive realization rather than a hard choice among costly options, and nothing significant is sacrificed to pursue it. The result is a beautifully textured piece with relatively soft conflict and low felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stakes—repairing her relationship to craft/time in order to eventually restore light to the village—are clear and thematically tied to her goal. However, on-page conflict is quite gentle: the prophecies yield without much resistance and there’s no hard choice or palpable risk in the scene itself. The meaningful “tightening” is almost entirely internal, as she shifts from forcing locks to listening to them. This works conceptually, but the lack of concrete friction or a tested trade-off keeps pressure and escalation in the competent rather than outstanding range.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stakes—ecological survival and social cohesion—are clear and potent, and the story does tighten once the blight’s spread and community suspicion are established. The main reversal is cognitive rather than confrontational: discovery that fungal diversity across property lines is protective forces a shift from isolation to cooperation. However, on-page resistance is minimal; the families’ suspicion is mentioned but not meaningfully dramatized as obstructing the solution, so the price of change feels light. Marina’s fading provides some cost at the end, but the conflict scarcely threatens to fail at any point, tempering tension.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—how humanity meets its end, and whether Marcus accepts a transformed burden—is clear and escalates from mechanical microseconds to ontological song. The pivotal tightening is the moment he hears “I vouchsafe this burden to you” and chooses to act, placing the head in the lens and singing, with the cost implied as endless caretaking. However, opposition is largely internal and quite smooth; he rarely hesitates or pushes back, so tension feels more contemplative than pressured. The escalation is effective but gentle, more deepening than sharp narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes—get the travelers out before frost while maintaining the larger, ongoing obligation to keep the labyrinth stable—are clear and coherent. Time pressure, the sick child, and the obstructive birds all sharpen the immediate conflict, and Mara’s choice to relinquish the seed introduces a deeper, more personal layer of cost. Escalation is more steady than sharp; there’s no major reversal, but the tightening works for the length. The piece could push tension slightly further by forcing a more visibly agonized or tactically constrained choice at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central conflict—Marina’s fear-driven need for control versus her desire to reconnect with Elena—is clear and sharpened by concrete stakes: potentially losing her daughter’s trust and presence. Pressure escalates via her struggle over what to text, the dawning realization about divergent paths, and the decision to risk vulnerability with a single, unschematic line. The cost is real but quiet: relinquishing her authority over Elena’s choices and accepting that reconciliation can’t be engineered. The conflict would feel even more acute if Elena’s response carried a bit more resistance or ambiguity instead of such immediate warmth.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Merrick will erase the notion of endings for the child, and what that does to stories/reality—is clear and inherently high-concept. Pressure escalates when he warns of how deeply endings are woven and chooses the sharper tools; the library’s tremor signals consequences. However, the operation itself proceeds without a serious on-page test of his resolve, and there’s little sense that he might refuse or that something irrevocably damaging has happened beyond the conceptual shift. The conflict is engaging but feels relatively safe; the visible price is more idea-level than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether to leave the fortress’s burden for the future or absorb centuries of remorse herself—is clearly signaled and sharpened as she realizes the pavilion’s function. Pressure escalates coherently from passive tasting to the overwhelming contagion when she places both hands on the pool. Her agency at the peak is strong and costs her something tangible (being “scoured from inside,” heavy with digested grief). The conflict remains mostly internal and could be intensified with one more external impediment or sharper sense of risk beyond discomfort, but it still lands solidly.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—reviving a dying, isolated agricultural community through sound—is clear and appealing, and the pressure does accumulate texturally as more elevators and languages join. However, there’s little genuine jeopardy once the singing begins; the town’s shift from isolation to cooperation faces no concrete on-page obstacle or trade-off. Marta never has to choose between competing goods or incur a visible loss; everything tilts toward a nearly frictionless success. This keeps the emotional tension relatively low despite the powerful premise.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Vera’s self-alteration to interface with entangled memories—is conceptually rich but lightly pressured on the page. There is a clear deepening when she injects herself and begins experiencing others’ memories, yet the risk (psychic, physical, ethical) is more implied than dramatized. Her agency drives the piece, but she is never forced into a hard trade-off or sacrifice beyond discomfort. As a result, tension plateaus into meditative intensity rather than escalating toward a truly costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering dangerous combinations that could unseal a catastrophic secret—is conceptually large but plays out with relatively low on-page resistance. The main “pressure” is the ticking clock of the inversion window, which nudges urgency but never truly cornering Orin into a hard trade-off or sacrifice. Their success in finding and memorizing the nodes feels almost frictionless, with no real risk of failure evident. As a result, escalation is present but muted, limiting tension.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can coax authentic, organic sound back from the alder—is clear, but on-page pressure is gentle and largely uncontested. There is a mild escalation from inaudible vibration to full “symphony,” yet nothing genuinely threatens failure or forces her to trade off values; her chosen method simply works with patience. The contrast to other, more violent sculptors provides conceptual tension, but it remains off-stage and never challenges her in the present scene. As a result, the piece reads as a beautifully rendered demonstration rather than a conflict that tightens toward a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Viktor returns to the Academy or remains at the nexus to teach a different kind of mastery—is clear and thematically apt. However, on-page pressure is modest: Viktor’s early reflection already frames the covenant as gift, so Mira’s question doesn’t materially tighten his options or force a wrenching trade-off. The game itself does not generate tangible risk beyond intellectual beauty; the decision to stay reads as confirmation rather than a hard-won turn. As a result, escalation feels contemplative rather than truly testing his commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—unlock the diary and access her grandmother’s preserved silences—is clear from early on and narrows her tactics toward exploiting the pre-fireworks stillness. Tension escalates mildly as she scans frequencies, homes in on the clicking, and races the approaching midnight, culminating in the clasp’s musical opening. However, opposition is largely technical and internal; there’s little sense of what she loses if she fails beyond disappointment, and her success comes without a hard trade-off. The emotional turn is real but gentle, keeping this just below higher-stakes territory.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can slow down enough to truly learn and pass her implicit test—is clear, and her sensory aversion to the flower’s future stench adds some friction. However, external pressure and concrete consequences if she fails are underdeveloped; the opposition is mostly her own temperament and discomfort, with little on-page jeopardy to her place in the village or identity beyond implication. The escalation reads as a steady deepening rather than a sharp tightening, which works but keeps the tension relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—finding the secret of resilient crops before colony failure—is clearly articulated, and the ticking clock of the Inversion offers baseline pressure. However, once Kessa commits to “always up” and reaches the grove, obstacles largely evaporate: the monument accepts the arrow without resistance, no serious alternative or risk is tested, and the cost of failure never bites on the page. The escalation is mostly conceptual rather than conflict-driven, so tension remains modest rather than tightening into a genuinely fraught choice.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding and containing a new atmospheric hazard—is clear and escalates intellectually as data accumulates and the convergence’s expansion is quantified. However, the pressure on Maya never tightens into a real trade-off: she isn’t directly threatened by the field, nor forced to choose between competing harms. Her choice to install monitors is logical but not hard-won; it doesn’t clearly foreclose a live alternative with cost. The tension is more conceptual than visceral, keeping the conflict in the upper-mid band.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—certifying wonder as essential so the bells (and dream-capacity) survive—is clearly articulated and escalates in scale from personal to global. However, opposition remains abstract and offstage; the Council never exerts live pressure in the scene, and Lyrian faces no genuine obstruction once she enters the cavern. The main “tightening” is an increase in sensory and cosmic intensity rather than a narrowing of options or a sharpened trade-off. As a result, the climax is beautiful but low in felt peril or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—how to relate to the Other Place and what a guardian should do—is conceptually strong but plays out with little resistance: once she begins the new song, everything works, and the Other Place figure is immediately benign. There’s one meaningful deepening when the weave produces a structured figure and the driftwood is reframed as a two-way message, but no serious counterforce tests her resolve or creates a real trade-off. As a result, escalation feels more like a graceful revelation than tightening conflict, and the price of her choice (risk of further cracking, possible danger to her or her world) remains abstract. The ending reads as a satisfying reorientation rather than a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Mira’s relationship to the personalities she borrows and whether she’s losing herself or preserving others—is clear, and pressure does build as more stars vanish and the halo’s donor presence intensifies. There is a meaningful deepening when she realizes she is preserving personalities like stars, reweighting her work from service to preservation. However, the conflict remains mostly internal and conceptual; there’s no distinct beat where she must decide to embrace or reject this role under real pressure. Escalation is therefore more atmospheric than choice-driven, keeping this strong but not outstanding for stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is experiential and vocational—whether Elara remains a routine courier or becomes something more, and whether Corvin’s theories (and disappearance) gain meaning—which is clear but relatively low in immediate risk. Escalation is mostly informational and wondrous: the pendant’s vibration, appearance of the Luminari, and knowledge transfer deepen the situation rather than narrow options or force a painful trade-off. Elara’s agency is primarily in showing up with the relic and allowing resonance; after that, events largely happen to her, with little real possibility of refusal dramatized. The result is thematically satisfying but dramatically gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—securing irrefutable proof of emotional absorption—is clear and present early, and the appearance of frost as a readable lexicon is a genuine deepening of that stake. Yet pressure never quite tightens into true risk: there is a nominal time constraint (frost melting), but no sense that she might fail, misread, or lose anything substantive if the experiment doesn’t work. The Institute’s skepticism and her marginalization are mostly off-stage, so conflict remains conceptual rather than dramatically felt. As a result, the scene is absorbing but low-tension, limiting its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—save her daughter at the cost of her own memories—is signaled crisply and escalates as the raveling silence “tastes” increasingly intimate recollections. The act of weaving is the pressure engine, with each pass narrowing her internal options until her own name is effectively spent. The conflict is more inevitability than back-and-forth struggle; she never seriously considers not paying the price, which keeps the tension strong but somewhat one-directional. Nonetheless, the visible cost at the end is unmistakable and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.8)
    Conflict is largely internal and atmospheric: will Korin safely transform this dangerous, exhausted silk into something restorative, and what will the merchant do with it? The pressure builds somewhat via the descent into places where others went mad and the implication of the silk’s fraught origins. Yet Korin never truly struggles or doubts, and no real alternative path or risk of failure is dramatized. The merchant’s emotional shock at the blade is strong, but that beat functions more as revelation than as a contested turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes (find mother; understand and mitigate the universe-destroying cost of their work) are strong and signaled early via the shard’s cyclical appearances. Escalation is present through increasingly strange versions of the bay and the violent redirect into the nexus; pressure coheres as Kira is pulled toward a specific confrontation. However, resistance and cost are lightly sketched—Kira never seriously considers refusing the shard’s pull, and the ethical/moral dilemma (keep mapping vs stop harming worlds) is resolved rapidly by a clever reframe with little on-page price. The universe-scale danger is mostly conceptual rather than felt in a concrete, narrowing choice.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes—whether Elsa will take on the burden of guarding both ships and lonely ghosts—are coherent and present by the midpoint. Pressure escalates from eerie absence of light to direct confrontation with Jonas’s ghost and the collective need of the dead, culminating in her decision and re-igniting the lamp. The cost of her choice (lifelong isolation, responsibility) is more implied than sharply dramatized, which softens the bite of the climax. Still, the internal and external conflicts braid effectively for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—guiding lost ships and, ultimately, shepherding dawn/reality itself—is clear and grows more consequential as the three ships escalate in strangeness. The introduction of the mirror-twin and the reversal of the wick constitute a meaningful deepening of pressure and options. However, the conflict is largely frictionless: there’s little sense of what happens if she fails, no concrete resistance from the ships or environment, and almost no cost to her stance. Tension is present but gentle, more numinous than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael will be crushed by accumulating stories or learn to transform them—is clear and narrows as Chen explains the cost of her granddaughter’s failure. There is a meaningful deepening when he realizes the donor connection and the danger of becoming too saturated, culminating in his decision to be taught. Still, conflict remains relatively gentle and didactic: there’s little resistance, counter-argument, or concrete loss beyond the conceptual warning. The escalation reads more as a graceful unveiling of information than as genuine tightening with palpable risk.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is largely internal and conceptual: what the labyrinth is for, and what Marcus’s maintenance work has truly meant. Pressure does increase—storm-imposed darkness, the surprise of the damaged sextant, the eerie stillness and pin-drop moment—but opposition remains diffuse, with no real risk that Marcus will fail or pay a concrete price if he simply walks away. The key escalation is his decision to deconstruct and then reconfigure the sextant, which deepens his understanding rather than foreclosing a painful option. As a result, tension feels quietly meditative rather than sharply contested, effective but not yet at elite-stakes clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the realm can “remember how to wake”—is clear and present from early on, and pressure escalates as Elara moves from solitary attempts to convening the community through song. The tightening comes from risk of permanent stasis versus the fragile, experimental woven dawn. However, opposition is mostly atmospheric rather than actively resisting; there’s little sense that this attempt might backfire or partially fail in the moment. The cost at the end (perpetual effort and vigilance) is thematically strong but emotionally under-pressurized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Ezra will risk his own overload to offer presence—is clear and active from the moment the woman’s anguish hits him. Pressure escalates as he resists his urge to hide and instead uses his paradoxical strategy (calm as shelter, distance as compassion), which is a real trade-off for him. However, the conflict never quite bites as hard as it could; his internal resistance is more told than viscerally tested on the page. The resolution is credible as earned stasis, but the cost could be sharpened with one more concrete beat of strain or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.8)
    The primary pressure is internal and situational: will Lila continue to lean into her anomalous perceptions or reject them as madness. There is one clear tightening when she follows the bread through the thornrose hedge to the new door, and another when the bread reveals the grandfather’s memories. However, almost nothing pushes back; there’s no serious alternative path or visible price to her choosing this ministry beyond implied responsibility. The result is a beautiful but relatively low-tension escalation curve.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—how much of humanity’s final promises can be preserved before the library collapses—is clear and genuinely weighty. Pressure escalates via the time limit, the crumbling structure, Elara’s hard numerical limit (fifty slides), and the discovery of the impossibly bright founder’s vow which forces a reframing of what “saving” really means. However, the actual triage process is somewhat summarized, so we rarely feel a pointed, specific moral or emotional dilemma over particular vows. The conflict works and deepens, but doesn’t fully exploit its most agonizing possibilities on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stakes (stop the black-market diversion of relief supplies without getting burned) are clear, and the revelation that Mae is the suspected recorder is a strong tightening. However, after the badge discovery, conflict resolves into a granted window (“You have until the tide changes”) rather than a hard, contested choice; her overnight work is compressed into summary, blunting escalation. Internal stakes—what she sacrifices of her father’s underworld reputation—are present but not sharply dramatized in a single peak beat. The result is consistent tension but not a fully exploited crisis point.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Marina will cling to skepticism or accept her nature and role—is clear, and pressure does increase via the forest’s election crescendo and the arrival of other carriers. Her eventual acceptance and the activation of her own weather form the central turn. However, conflict remains relatively gentle and foregone; her skepticism is visually indicated (implants dimming) but not meaningfully capable of derailing the convergence or creating a hard trade-off. The story reads more as a graceful unveiling than a pressured dilemma with visible costs.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lyra will remain safely locked in memory or risk generative creation—is legible from early on and tightens as she confronts Maya’s paintings. The key turn is her decision to set down the sketchbook and mark the cave wall, which forecloses her prior mode and makes her perfect recall a liability. Emotional cost is present but lightly dramatized; she doesn’t seriously waver once the instruction is revealed, so the internal battle can feel slightly pre-resolved. More friction at the choice point would intensify stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Vera will expose dangerous truths that may destabilize her already-precarious city—is legible and grows from personal to systemic as she uncovers the diverted water and mass-hidden messages. The escalation is primarily informational/ethical rather than confrontational, moving from curiosity to moral imperative. However, there is little on-page resistance or counterpressure; no one pushes back, and her choice to deliver all messages encounters no immediate obstacle, which mutes the sense of cost and narrowing options. The tension is thoughtful rather than gripping, limiting the category at a strong-but-not-elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—the extinction or preservation of “wonder”—is signaled early and carries through, with the melting fragment providing a ticking clock. Pressure escalates as the ice glistens brighter and melts away during the tuning process, culminating in the irreversible transfer into the bell. However, opposition is largely environmental and abstract; Mariel encounters no serious resistance, doubt, or potential for failure beyond inevitability of melting. The conflict works, but feels more contemplative than harrowing, keeping tension in a mid-strong band rather than truly acute.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central conflict—M-47 must risk a dangerous emotional/energetic purge to preserve its mind without destroying the dome—is well-articulated. Pressure escalates through the progressive burning of increasingly significant fears, with the last drawing taking longest and tying most directly to M-47’s own self-concept. However, the burn proceeds with minimal complication; there’s no reversal or on-page moment where the plan nearly fails or a real option is foreclosed. The stakes are more asserted than viscerally felt moment-to-moment, which keeps the tension strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elena’s severed connection to her daughter and her own voice can be restored—is clear and tightened as the story moves from private object to communal mission. Escalation is modest but coherent: the early emotional pressure of the locked mailbox deepens into an active search and culminates in Elena reopening her interior life via the letters. The main shortfall is the relative ease and speed of the middle “mission control” section, which resolves the postal obstacle in a few efficient strokes, keeping the emotional cost higher than the practical one.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—unlocking forbidden, sealed-away knowledge tied to her own identity—is clear, and the pressure does increase as the systems begin responding to her dance. Escalation, however, is more aesthetic and conceptual than adversarial: there’s little resistance or risk beyond implied danger of the knowledge itself. Her final backward dance sequence is a nice tightening move, demonstrating mastery over creation and undoing, but it doesn’t visibly foreclose a path or demand a trade-off. As a result, tension is consistently interesting but never quite gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether to reclaim the extracted memories of Elena and accept the associated grief—is clear early and tightens steadily toward the grave and coffin choice. Escalation is primarily internal but well-mirrored by external weirdness: the anomalies grow from bent flames to full-blown reality distortion at the grave. The exhumation and discovery of vials function as a sharp mid-story turn, forcing a genuine trade-off between knowledge/wholeness and psychic survival. The only small gap is that the citywide danger from gravity disruption remains more conceptual than actively pressing Marina’s decision.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—preventing a prophecy from becoming self-fulfilling—is clear and present from early on, and the “struggling” luminous script offers a tangible opposing force. There is an identifiable tightening as more fragments emerge and she must catch and compress them, culminating in the all-night labor and final dispersal into the sea. However, tension remains mostly intellectual and lyrical; there’s little sense she might fail or pay a sharp personal price, so escalation feels measured rather than urgent. The resolution is earned but low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will remain solitary with her gift or invite Marcus into the secret “language” of buildings—is present but under-articulated in terms of risk. Pressure rises modestly as his curiosity and shared background with his grandmother come out, but there’s no real push-back, fear, or competing obligation that would make the final teaching decision feel fraught. The story reads as a graceful initiation rather than a conflict that tightens options. The result is quietly engaging but only mildly tense.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Marina will remain safely hollow or risk re-embodying her grief—is legible from the Institute backstory forward. Pressure escalates through the intensifying whispers and the physical ordeal of digging through the night until she finds the second half of the shell. Her choice to fuse the pieces is clearly an act of agency that forecloses the path of curated forgetfulness. The conflict is mostly internal and moves in a straight curve without reversals, which keeps it just shy of higher-band sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Mei perpetuates forgery to save or condemn her brother versus ending the family cycle—is signaled early and sharpened by the two waiting documents. Pressure escalates when the key reveals her grandmother’s message, forcing a trade-off between personal loyalty and fidelity to her emerging self-understanding. The cost is legible: she chooses a path that risks herself and her family’s legacy in order to stop “calibrated treason.” However, because all opposing forces are off-stage and Mei’s resolve feels fairly stable, the conflict remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally tense.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Senna will join the chorus or refuse—is signaled early via the disappearances and letter and tightens as the shell reveals that the “missing” are actually transformed echo singers. Escalation is primarily internal but distinct: curiosity → dawning dread → explicit invitation and binary choice. The cost of each path is sketched well enough that the decision at dawn reads as meaningful and not trivial. Pressure remains mostly contemplative rather than sharply agonizing, which keeps it just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—retrieving and decoding the antidote formula and recognizing the broader mission—is clear and escalates as the ghosts’ purpose is unveiled. However, conflict is largely one-sided revelation; Marina encounters little resistance, risk, or dilemma beyond the implied weight of responsibility. The Cassandra’s self-scuttling and the off-page biological weapon raise abstract stakes more than scene-level pressure. As a result, the story feels high-concept and purposeful but not especially tense.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)
    Conflict and stakes are intentionally low-key and mostly internal: whether and how she can perceive and honor hidden labor in a world that ignores it. Pressure accumulates texturally rather than through reversals, with the clearest tightening being the moment she “sees it clearly” in the net’s pattern and recommits to mending as rebellion against entropy. However, she is never truly at risk of abandoning her task or worldview, so no option feels meaningfully foreclosed beyond the quiet choice of anonymity. The escalation is graceful but soft for the standard of an elite venue.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central conflict—journalistic truth vs. preserving a literal oasis—is well-defined and escalates as he uncovers deeper layers of institutional betrayal. The key tightening comes when he holds the diamond and realizes its power, forcing him to reconsider exposing it; his compromise (letters as seeds, diamond reburied) is a real trade-off with conceptual cost. However, the pressure around that choice could be sharper: the storm’s clock is mentioned but not heavily exploited, and we don’t see many alternative tactics tested and discarded. The stakes are large in concept (millions of deaths, potential sanctuaries) but feel somewhat abstract in the heat of the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—ushering a new dawn by shaping the Prophet’s rise—is clear but remains mostly abstract, with little concrete threat or sacrifice on the page. Escalation comes via intensifying signals and then the Prophet’s global broadcast, but Marlowe never faces a hard, narrowing decision; her “invitation and warning both” is not tested in any specific dilemma. Pressure thus accrues atmospherically rather than through contested options. The ending registers as confirmation, not an earned trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stakes are emotional and thematic: whether Marcus remains a marginal hermit or becomes a bridge between generations, and whether Elena remains locked in old grief or accesses forgiveness. There is one clear tightening when he decides to search for the music box’s owner and another when Elena recognizes it, but these beats are low-friction and resolved without substantial cost or risk. The grandson’s documentary interest arrives as a benign convenience rather than something Marcus must win or jeopardize. As a result, escalation is coherent but modest, with tension more atmospheric than pressing.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—protect the artifact or let the Collectors take it, risking silence and broken covenant—is signaled early and coherently escalated by the encroaching darkness and their approach. Pressure tightens as she descends, opens the vault, and commits to the risky ritual, culminating in a costly self-transformation that forecloses her human life. Internal and external stakes dovetail effectively (ancestral duty vs. institutional predation), and the choice is hers. Because the Collectors never force a direct confrontation or put her in a live alternative (fight, flee, negotiate), the escalation feels slightly unopposed at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.9)
    The stakes—freeing humanity’s minds from enforced synchronization—are enormous and clearly signaled, and the time-limited polarity shift gives a structural clock. However, the conflict escalates more in rhetoric than on the page; once the window opens, no opposition, setback, or risky trade-off intrudes on their execution. Kira’s internal wildness is noted but never threatens to derail her choices, so the tension feels controlled rather than genuinely pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Margot will remain a detached investigator or become an active liberator—is present early and crystallizes at the end when she chooses not to “call in the death but to resign.” Escalation is primarily internal via accumulating memories and recontextualization of Jerome’s life, rather than via direct opposition or reversals. External antagonistic pressure (the supervisor, the institution) is off-page and abstract, so the conflict never quite feels truly contested in the moment. The piece lands on a clear stance, but the lack of on-page resistance or trade-off (beyond implication) keeps the stakes from fully biting.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Eliza will accept and enact Thomas’s apology—is clear, and the key tightening comes when she chooses to follow his diagrams and asks Marcus to stay, committing to the emotional risk of engagement. However, the pressure remains gentle and largely interior; there are no reversals or hard tests that significantly narrow her options beyond that initial choice. The moral calculus (“he deserved worse” vs. “we deserve better”) is compelling but resolves without much on-page resistance once she begins the repair. As a result, the escalation feels steady rather than sharply intensifying.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.3)
    The core stake—whether Pioneer will transcend her assigned function and alter the species’ evolution—is clear and culminates in the leap into the acid. There is a meaningful tightening when she decides to “transliterate” herself and physically test her vision against a lethal environment. However, opposition is mostly conceptual (tradition, incomprehension) rather than active, and the acid’s danger is never dramatized through near-failure or genuine struggle, so cost feels more asserted than viscerally tested. The result is engaging but somewhat low-friction for the scale of the transformation claimed.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—uncovering what happened to the “missing” and implicitly to her father—remains coherent and sharpens as Lila realizes she can join them. Escalation is mostly intellectual; there are no strong counter-forces or obstacles beyond complexity, so pressure never feels acute. Her choice to self-archive carries obvious conceptual cost, but we don’t see her wrestle with competing obligations or fears in the moment. The conflict works, but at a cool, cerebral temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether this anomaly will be controlled, exploited, or honored—is clear but remains mostly abstract. Pressure is low: Mira faces no active antagonist, and there’s little risk she’ll choose violence or exploitation given how she’s framed. The main tightening is her realization of the orchard’s purpose and her decision to become a “gardener,” but that turn is contemplative rather than hard-won. Conflict stays more philosophical than dramatic, limiting felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake is Marlene’s relationship to endings—whether she seeks her own or learns to live as a witness—and it’s signaled clearly, with the marina’s breaking intensifying that inquiry. External conflict (disaster relief, calving) escalates texturally, culminating in the 3 AM break, but Marlene’s agency mostly takes the form of steady observation rather than pressured decision or renunciation. Her choice to “remain” and “sing with” the marina is thematically apt but not strongly contested on the page; there’s little sense she might leave, relapse, or fail. As a result, tension is rich at the atmospheric level but soft at the level of concrete, narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus’s long, private way of understanding can be passed on and finally recognized—is clear but handled with very gentle pressure. The main tightening is the daughter’s arrival with the letters and her explicit request, which forces Marcus to decide whether to open up or remain entombed in his solitude. There’s little resistance or complication on the page, so the emotional cost is implied more by history than by present-scene conflict. As a result, tension feels quietly persuasive rather than sharply escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—preserving the wisdom echoes before they fade—is clearly stated and time-boxed (“We must act tonight”). However, there is almost no opposing force: the consecrations proceed one by one without mishap, doubt, or sacrifice beyond generic exhaustion. Pressure escalates more conceptually than dramatically, limiting the felt cost and tension at sentence and scene level. As a result, the ending reads more as a graceful completion of a task than as a hard-won resolution under genuine strain.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving and extending a tradition of communal healing before the ruins are cleared—is clear and credible, with the looming demolition providing situational pressure. There is one meaningful deepening when Elara realizes the photos form a decades-long spiral and decides to complete it via the exhibition. However, there is almost no on-page opposition or visible cost: the council’s plans never push back, the logistics of the gathering pose no friction, and her plan unfolds without test or trade-off. The conflict therefore feels aesthetically resonant but dramatically gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elena can meaningfully challenge the Committee’s freeze on language—is clear, but the pressure on that stake only modestly tightens. Her micro-choice to testify “not in the linear fashion they expected” is a real turn, yet the Committee never exerts more than symbolic opposition on the page. The result is a lovely charged poise rather than a felt test of commitment or visible cost. Greater dramatization of institutional pushback or personal risk would elevate the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—locating the “frequency of age” and understanding Ezra’s relationship to his curse—is clear and thematically rich. Pressure escalates modestly when the woman arrives and they actively tune through decay to search for the voice. However, obstacles are largely atmospheric rather than concrete; discovery feels inevitable, without a tough trade-off or near-failure beat. The result is a strong but quietly contoured conflict profile rather than a sharply tightening one.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the observatory tears free or collapses, and whether Ezra follows the prior keeper out of time or stabilizes the system—is clearly signaled. Pressure escalates via the worsening tremors and the clock’s increasing pitch, leading to a meaningful tactical shift when she employs the leaf-fall tuning fork instead of pursuing escape. However, Ezra never seriously falters or fails, so the sense of risk to her goal or self is more intellectual than felt; options don’t feel sharply foreclosed. The resolution is earned but a bit too smooth given the magnitude of what’s at stake.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—how to model a “flawless goodbye” under a short terminal timeline—is clear and consistent. Pressure does deepen as Maya transforms her philosophy into a concrete project and then presents it on her last morning. However, escalation is gentle; there are no reversals or serious obstacles, and her path from decision to execution is largely uncontested. The result is moving but low in tension, relying on concept and image more than hard trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—preventing reality from “remembering” forbidden knowledge—is clear and escalated by noon’s approach and the tremor of the floating isle. There is one meaningful deepening when Lyra realizes her mentor maintained a prison and that runes must be used to seal rather than explore. However, resistance is purely conceptual; there is no on-page opposition beyond time pressure, and Lyra’s sealing succeeds without setback or visible sacrifice. This keeps tension more intellectual than visceral, limiting escalation despite the strong premise.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Thomas reconciling with what Elara is and what that means for his work and family legacy—is clear but remains mostly internal and reflective. There is one real pressure point (his “Will you stay this time?” / her “Can’t”) and a quieter decision in returning the tooth, both of which gently foreclose paths. However, escalation is modest; the scene doesn’t significantly narrow options beyond what the setup has already implied, so tension never quite tightens. The conflict is effective for a quiet piece but underpowered for a top-tier publication standard.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—ships needing guidance through fog—is signaled early and paid off when the boats visibly change course in response to Marina’s beacon. However, once the glass glows, there is almost no resistance or complication; the external problem is solved on first attempt, and the villagers’ acceptance is immediate. Internal conflict (fear of failure, grief, doubt) is implied but never really tests her resolve in scene. As a result, escalation feels more like a graceful unfolding than a pressured narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—how Kira responds to sudden public visibility and latent guilt/solidarity embodied by Marcus—remains mostly internal and already partly resolved before the scene starts. The main tightening is the shift from private tending to agreeing to “teach” Marcus, symbolizing a willingness to let her sanctuary and method be shared. It’s a meaningful but low-friction choice; there’s little sense that she’s risking much by including him, and no real competing option tested on the page. As a result, tension is more contemplative than actively escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Marina clings to her hope of capturing others’ hopes—is clear and resolved through her choice to perform the ritual and walk away. Pressure accumulates texturally (uncanny environment, buildup to the ceremony) rather than via reversals, and opposition is mostly internal, with no strong resistance once the ritual begins. The cost of renouncing her collecting impulse is evident but the escalation stays relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—restoring sacred practices via reviving the vine—is clearly signaled and fulfilled. Pressure does deepen slightly as forgotten songs accumulate and the village gathers, culminating in the bloom. Yet there is little real antagonistic force or risk: the vine responds promptly, no attempt meaningfully fails, and Elara is never forced into a hard trade-off or renunciation. As a result, escalation feels gentle and the cost of success remains largely historical and conceptual rather than dramatized in the present.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.0)
    Pressure is mostly conceptual and procedural: will the complex ritual correctly capture the crater’s heartbeat and complete the map. The “delicate moment” when the world holds its breath offers a nice tightening, but there’s little sense of real jeopardy or alternative paths if she fails—no antagonistic force or sharp trade-off. Escalation occurs as density and intensity of the ritual, not as narrowing options or rising personal stakes. It works for a quiet accumulative piece but lacks the sharper costs that would lift it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is Mara’s need to understand/document the timer before the wounded season ends and temporal anomalies resolve. Pressure does accumulate—especially once pre-echoes of her future work appear—but it’s more contemplative than urgent, with little sense that failure would exact a sharp on-page cost. Her key “choice” is methodological (document the broken state, leave the device) rather than a hard trade-off between incompatible goods. As a result, tension is present and coherent but not especially gripping by high-literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—Mara’s relationship to burden and containment—is present and coherent, and pressure does accumulate as she moves from personal grief to cosmic weights to the grotto’s own history. Escalation reads as a deepening of density rather than a series of discrete reversals, which fits the accumulative lens. However, the conflict remains quite static: she is “boundary-lessly trapped” from the outset and never tests that boundary in the scene, so no concrete option is explicitly foreclosed at the end beyond a clarified understanding. The result is thematically compelling but low in felt jeopardy or hard choices, which keeps this below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—how Margaret will live with Thomas’s absence—is clear early and tightened by the time constraint of the boiling kettle and the choice to repurpose his last blank. Escalation is modest but present: as the whistle rises, her carving becomes more decisive and her conceptual stance crystallizes into “not moving on, but moving with.” The cost is largely internal and quiet; we feel the renunciation of a purely memorial carving in favor of a living practice, though a single sharper moment of doubt or possible alternative path would add bite.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—whether Kira will remain an eroded would-be rebuilder or accept a transformed purpose as memory keeper—is clear and internal, and the ghost’s silent demand focuses that pressure. Escalation comes from the gradual reframing of her scavenging as “instructions. Warnings. Maps.” until the literal contact with her ghost forces a stance crystallization. The price is mostly internal (renouncing the fantasy of rebuilding the sky stations) and lands, but there is little sense of alternative tactics or a live external threat narrowing her options. The conflict is rich but remains somewhat static until the final beat, limiting the sense of progressive tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are almost entirely conceptual—understanding a hidden system and “equations for hope”—and they remain abstract rather than felt as risk or potential loss. There is little real opposition: the system groans and protests, but nothing meaningfully threatens failure, harm, or a trade-off. Escalation is mild, essentially a steady deepening of understanding culminating in the fountain’s activation. As a result, the ending is thoughtful but not tense, and pressure never quite tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central stake—whether to re-engage with the world of music or remain enclosed in silence—is clear and consequential for her life. Pressure does intensify via the letter and the memory-laden walk through the forecourt, and the final compromise (both sanctuary and Conservatory) reads as a real stance. However, tension remains largely internal and contemplative, with little concrete counter-pressure on the page (no deadline, opposing person, or visible risk beyond implied emotional cost). The result is moving but relatively low-voltage in moment-to-moment conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central conflict—continue fleeing into legends or turn toward personal accountability—is clear and thematically apt. Pressure escalates modestly through the discovery of the confession and the recognition of the parallel with her father, narrowing her internal options to evasion versus confrontation. However, resistance and cost are largely conceptual and resolved without much felt struggle, giving the arc a smoothness that slightly dulls tension.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—recovering and preserving a dying lineage of weather-knowledge—is clear but kept mostly at an abstract/intellectual level. Pressure deepens modestly as sections of rope yield increasing information and Mara recognizes the urgency of passing it on, but there’s no real opposition or narrowing of options. Her decision to teach the granddaughter is sensible rather than fraught; no alternative path or genuine risk to her is dramatized. The result is gently engaging, more meditative than tense.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are primarily existential and thematic—whether and how Elara can map the city’s living deaths into something like peace. Pressure accumulates gently through new examples (Marcus, the weavers), but there is minimal escalation or narrowing of options; no concrete alternative path is genuinely on the table. Her “choice” at the end is essentially a continuation with reframed understanding rather than a costly trade-off. The result is affecting but low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—can Aldric coax true life/beauty back into a mechanized world—is clear and does tighten as the egg begins to glow and crack. The main reversal (the bird is beautifully flawed rather than the legendary Aurelius) is strong conceptually but generates surprisingly little on-page struggle; Aldric moves quickly from grief to acceptance. There’s limited sense of alternatives or trade-offs at the peak—no real temptation to destroy, mechanize, or re-experiment with the bird. As a result, pressure feels meaningful but somewhat under-exploited, keeping escalation short of elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Maya can transform her inherited “burning” into a different kind of legacy—is clear and consistently held, with the ritual as a concrete locus for that choice. Pressure rises through memory of the father and first warehouse fire toward the act of binding rage, craft, and transformation into a talisman. However, the conflict remains largely internal and low-friction in the present; there is little sense she might genuinely choose otherwise or fail today. The resolution feels earned but somewhat preordained, with limited on-page cost or live alternative path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the frozen temporal/memory state will be released—is legible, and the act of moving from fountain to fountain constitutes a formal escalation. However, there is minimal resistance or complication: once the woman and Marcus begin, nothing seriously threatens their success or forces trade-offs, so tension stays conceptual rather than felt. The revelation that he completes a ritual “ten thousand years in the making” adds scale but doesn’t materially tighten options. As a result, the piece reads more like a graceful unveiling than a pressured conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether and how she can endure her endless, solitary role without being crushed by its serenity—is present but kept at a reflective distance. There is a mild escalation from tending a death to witnessing a birth and confronting her paradox, yet pressure never tightens into a moment where she must choose between live alternatives with tangible cost. The resolution feels more like a lyrical settling than a tested commitment, so conflict and stakes remain relatively abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stakes—completing the Collective Memorial in time, and truly apprehending collective grief—are clear and appropriate to this quiet story. Pressure deepens via the grandfather’s increasing urgency and the nearing migration, and the implied threat that his guidance will vanish if she fails. However, the conflict remains mostly internal and steady; there’s little sense of real jeopardy to the commission itself or of Martha nearly failing in some concrete way. The escalation works, but it never quite bites as hard as it could.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—restoring ethical and temporal trust between Theodore and the village—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates internally as he moves from routine winding to a one-time, high-stakes experiment in the pendulum pause, with the tower’s machinery visibly responding. Yet the conflict feels largely unilateral; the world offers little active resistance, and the ritual succeeds without a moment where it might concretely fail or backfire. The cost is conceptual and ongoing rather than dramatized as a sharp, pressured trade-off in the scene itself.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake is essentially whether Marta will integrate the tapestry’s message into her life’s work, signaled via her obsession with the found object and her rituals around time. Conflict is almost entirely internal and contemplative, with no credible alternative path or antagonist pressure on the page. The decoding sequence deepens meaning but doesn’t narrow options or impose a visible price beyond a broken routine (letting the clock run down). As a result, the piece feels emotionally resonant but low-tension, more vignette than story under a prestige-market standard.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether innovation will be suffocated by bureaucracy or subtly redirected—is clear, and Mira’s plan to influence the Council provides a coherent throughline. There is some escalation as we move from her anticipation of their rigidity to the on-page meeting and the gradual, unconscious shifts in their thinking. Yet conflict is unusually one-sided: the Council never truly resists or pushes back, and Mira never faces a live possibility of failure. The lack of a visible price or genuinely narrowed options keeps tension relatively low despite the elegant premise.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mariel can successfully seed forbidden stories back into the populace via music and dust—is clear but softly pressured. The primary tightening comes when the pirate lyrics turn personal (“the copyist her vigil keeps”), raising implied danger and trust, but no antagonist or concrete obstacle appears to force a painful trade-off. Her choice to embed the rebel song instead of the official score is important, yet framed as almost frictionless for her. As a result, escalation feels more like deepening resolve than a true testing of limits or values.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether sanctuary and self-reinvention through art can truly protect fugitives from consequence—is clear and consistently pressured. Escalation comes through deepening knowledge: the revelation that the ash is from burned records and that Marlene’s portraits are evidence reweights everything, followed by Creech’s death and the authorities’ arrival. However, Marlene herself is not forced into a sharply framed, costly choice; she simply continues a ritual she’s long accepted. The conflict is thus more philosophical and atmospheric than acutely dramatic, which limits the felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.5)
    The primary conflict—truth vs institutional narrative comfort—is clear from the first exchange and escalates with each reveal, especially when she admits “We know” and reframes the stakes. Pressure tightens from abstract argument to a concrete offer: whether Marcus will help “hide the truth properly,” forcing him to choose between pure rebellion and strategic preservation. Stakes are mostly intellectual and moral, not physical, which suits the piece but keeps the tension at a simmer rather than a boil. The cost of his choice could be underlined slightly more to heighten the sense of a real sacrifice or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.0)
    The core stakes—the loss of the program and of a living tradition—are clear and emotionally credible, and there is a real internal conflict in whether Chen will finally share the zither’s modes. However, once the students arrive, resistance largely dissolves; they all align quickly around the goal, and the rediscovery of the five modes faces little on-page friction. The guard’s announcement of closing time adds a mild temporal tightening, and Chen’s decision to hand over the rosette is a meaningful renunciation, but escalation is more gentle deepening than genuine testing of resolve. A single concrete setback or disagreement during the musical process could sharpen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.4)
    The stakes—defying the Ministry by cultivating illegal memory—are inherently high, and they’re clearly signaled. However, on the page, opposition is entirely offstage; no one might come, nothing almost fails, and the sprouting process succeeds without resistance or cost beyond implied long-term risk. Escalation is largely a steady intensification of wonder rather than pressure that narrows Mira’s options or forces a trade-off. As a result, the conflict feels thematically potent but dramatically gentle to the point of low immediate tension.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central conflict—Mira’s secrecy versus the city’s need—is well signaled and tightens as she climbs the tower and confronts the honeycomb and the riddle. Her decision to go public is a clear turning point where she risks exposure and relinquishes control of her secret. However, external pressure never quite bites: the arriving citizens are immediately receptive, and no on-page force seriously contests her choice or raises the cost beyond implication. The stakes feel real conceptually but under-dramatized at the climactic moment.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—Marina’s need to understand the creeping wrongness and the aliveness of certain houses—remains clear, and there is a genuine deepening when the shard reveals the bay’s layered offerings and she reinterprets the object migrations as sanctification. Her final action of leaving the shard counts as an earned stance: she accepts her role as witness and participant in this quiet ritual. However, the conflict is largely internal and contemplative, with minimal sense that she might refuse, misinterpret, or pay a sharper cost; there’s little narrowing of options beyond “understand and join” versus an unarticulated alternative. As a result, tension feels gently cumulative rather than sharply escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—how Nerida’s fall and Thessaly’s act will be understood and carried forward—is signaled early and coherently tightened through each memory revelation. The ethical stakes of drowning thousands to save millions are potent and force a real trade-off, even if dramatized mostly in recollection rather than in-the-moment struggle. Marina’s decision to tell the world a messy, damaging truth, accepting the wreckage of her prior work, provides a concrete, if quiet, resolution. Tension is primarily moral and intellectual rather than visceral, which fits the piece but keeps escalation in a controlled, not searing, register.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Marcus can escape a mathematically perfect prison that encodes his lost life with Sarah—comes through clearly and is thematically rich. Pressure accumulates as he refines his understanding (the loop length, the inevitability of rupture, the growing chip), tightening the conceptual noose even if the physical activity remains repetitive. However, escalation is largely intellectual; the story doesn’t stage a concrete test or reversal where his commitment costs him something new in the present. The result is strong situational tension and resonance, but with relatively flat dramatic contour.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake is Mira’s creative and emotional blockage—whether she can make meaningful art and connection from her insomnia and grief over gentrification—and that’s signaled early. The brush warming and the subsequent flood of responses are clear intensifications, but pressure is gentle: failure never feels like it would carry a serious loss beyond continued malaise. Conflict is almost entirely internal and largely resolved without friction, with no real trade-off or foreclosed option on the page. This keeps the piece moving but leaves the escalation band relatively modest for elite-market standards.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving irreplaceable cultural traces before the thaw erases them—is clear early and tightened effectively by the rosewater “clock,” changing waterfall voice, and literal weeping of the walls. Escalation is situational/accumulative rather than reversal-driven, but the time pressure and realization that she “couldn’t document everything” force a costly, if implicit, triage. Her decision to push through the night despite futility reads as earned stasis with emotional price. A more explicit, focused loss on-page (a particular wall section she must abandon) would heighten the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—reversing a devouring artifact to restore a lighthouse that can “call home ships that had been lost to history”—is clear and conceptually weighty. Pressure escalates as she dismantles the lens and the stone “writhes,” with a clear turn at the moment of inversion. Yet the conflict remains mostly procedural; there are no failed attempts, moral trade-offs, or serious risk that her intervention will worsen things or cost her something tangible. The resolution, though thematically rich, feels relatively unopposed in the moment of action.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will remain bound to this traumatizing site of death or redefine her relationship with Fear—is clear early (“But tonight, she would unbosom the secret”). Pressure escalates as the mirrors begin to pulse, the walls project her “real death,” and Fear manifests as a shifting child, forcing her to choose between fleeing and engaging it with language. Her agency in reading the paradox backward and in naming Fear’s core anxiety drives the resolution. However, the path from spell activation to victory is relatively unopposed, with few genuine tactical failures or hard trade-offs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—escaping an imploding, fractal current—is clear early and escalates as loops tighten and Kessa intensifies her work. Her agency drives the key turn: choosing to exploit the wood’s resonance and then pushing into physically taxing overdrive to disrupt the spiral. The whales’ arrival reads as an externally assisted amplification rather than a deus ex machina, maintaining her central role. Still, the sense of mortal or existential danger from the collapsing gyre could be sharpened to heighten the felt cost of failure and make the climax more viscerally fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether to heed the warning and stay safe or follow her need to know into danger—is clearly signaled and tightens as new information arrives (the inverted spirals, the warning message, city-as-refugee-turtles). Escalation is primarily informational, not confrontational, so Mira faces little resistance beyond implied danger and internal fear. Her decision to leave does foreclose the path of safety, but the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized. Adding one concrete obstacle or sacrifice in the departure sequence would intensify the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—truth versus the stabilizing “noble lie”—is clearly signaled and personified in Marcus vs. Elara. The main tightening occurs when Marcus reveals the Ministry’s intent to destroy the letter and draws his weapon, forcing Elara to reveal her preemptive transmission. However, the revelation that she has already sent copies undercuts immediate physical peril and shifts tension into a more cerebral, moral register, which slightly flattens escalation. Marcus’s choice to walk away and remove his insignia carries conceptual cost but could be sharpened with a more concrete on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stakes—saving a fragment of the pavilion’s human history before demolition and tide erase it—are clear and present early. Pressure escalates through environmental cues (creaking, shifting structure; tide turning; demolition scheduled for tomorrow; being marooned by the raised drawbridge) and culminates in the choice to use his limited time to embed his grandmother’s story. However, the conflict stays largely internal and contemplative, with no real possibility that he will choose *not* to act, which keeps tension at a gentle simmer rather than a boil. The story earns a meaningful tightening but not a decisive high-stakes crunch.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—preserving an accurate record before the blackout ends—is clearly signaled and coherently maintained. Escalation comes from the ticking clock of power restoration and the discovery that the forgeries are more surgically targeted than expected (specific pages, critical treaties). However, most obstacles are mastered without real failure or hard trade-offs; there’s little sense that she might have to sacrifice something personal or abandon a crucial volume. The cost is mostly opportunity and incompleteness, which is conceptually resonant but not strongly dramatized as a painful choice.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—whether Mei remains trapped in static remembrance or risks reshaping her grief—is clear and emotionally legible. Pressure deepens through the painful work of recording dreams and culminates in the unexpected glimpse of an impossible future, which nudges her toward a new stance. However, escalation is gentle; there is little sense of a real alternative path being foreclosed or a sharp trade-off enacted in scene. The cost is implied rather than felt as an on-page, contested choice.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stakes—whether Amira can locate and reclaim severed futures before the institution suppresses the discovery—are clear and tighten via the time limit, the anomalous readings, and the early end to the cooling cycle. Her agency drives the main turns: bringing the geode, overriding the scanner, and choosing to scatter the data rather than secure it. However, the opposition (security, “they’ll destroy this research”) stays largely abstract and never lands a concrete hit, so the risk feels asserted more than viscerally borne. The release of vast forces occurs with very little on-page downside or ethical friction, which mutes the sense of price at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Kira will unlock and internalize the observatory’s insight about belonging—is clear but remains mostly intellectual and low-risk. Once the pilgrim reveals the chip and explains its significance, there is very little true opposition: the matrices are found and installed without setback, and no alternative path or loss is dramatized. Escalation is present in the sense of accumulating discovery and sensory intensity, but there is no hard trade-off or moral tension. As a result, the climax reads more as a graceful unveiling than as a pressured decision.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.5)
    Conflict is primarily internal: Elias’s need to preserve comfort (his own and others’) versus the ethical cost of manufactured genealogies and inherited guilt. Pressure escalates as the carvings cohere into a map and he grasps the family complicity, leading to a meaningful choice that forecloses his lucrative path. External antagonism is diffuse (the anonymous arranger, the ghosts of the past), so the stakes remain more conceptual than visceral. The moral cost is clear, but an added concrete pressure (risk, opposition, or immediate consequence) could sharpen escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will leverage Thorne’s guilt and his son’s captivity for vengeance or embrace a more reparative ethic—is clear and thematically potent. Pressure coheres around their conversation and deepens with the revelation of the parallel harms done by their kin. However, escalation is fairly gentle: Elara’s moral position feels decided from the outset, so the scene reveals that decision rather than forcing a difficult, live choice. The cost is implied (foregone vengeance, chosen risk of trust) but could be made more viscerally felt to sharpen tension.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus can risk re-engaging with navigation without being annihilated by regret—is clear and coherent. Escalation comes mainly from his paddling out to the site of his greatest failure and choosing to turn back with the compass in hand, which is a credible internal tightening. However, external pressure is very gentle (calm sea, no time crunch, no on-page threat), so tension stays low-key and reflective rather than taut. The price of his final decision is implied (reopening pain, responsibility) but could be sharpened with one more concrete on-page risk or discomfort.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus will accept the burden of rekindling empathy in those he harmed—is clear and thematically apt. Pressure coheres but stays relatively low-intensity; he voices one major objection (“Why should they forgive someone who gets to forget?”) that is briskly reframed rather than deeply contested. The meaningful turn is his decision to step onto the first bridge, which does foreclose the path of refusal and commits him to ongoing emotional risk. A touch more friction or cost at that moment (hesitation, concrete fear, alternative he nearly chooses) would strengthen escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will risk un-becoming to reunite with Kess—is clear and thematically coherent with the metamorphosis. There is a meaningful tightening when she uncorks the vial and her selfhood begins to dissolve, pushing her past a point of return. However, opposition is largely internal and resolves without significant resistance or complication once the ritual begins, so tension never fully peaks. The outcome feels assured rather than hard-won, limiting the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can reconfigure the temporal bond between her mother’s death and her daughter’s birth—is clearly established and deepens as she calls to the glade, confronts her mother, and performs the restorative spread. Pressure escalates when the mother appears and the crack begins to glow, forcing Elara into the choice to act rather than merely observe or divinate. The final trade-off (guilt retained vs time re-mapped into her daughter’s life) is legible and costly. The piece leans a bit more on lyric inevitability than on sharply dramatized risk or resistance, which keeps the tension strong but not maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether opening the shadow dimension will redeem or destroy what remains of humanity—is clearly stated and Mei’s task (to open and integrate) responds directly to it. Pressure does deepen when the gap opens and the screams/violence pour through, and her need to maintain equilibrium between sorrow and joy provides a credible internal constraint. However, her success feels almost preordained: no concrete setbacks, no near-failures in balance, and no tangible cost beyond transient discomfort. As a result, escalation plateaus quickly and the final integration reads more like an inevitable ritual completion than a hard-won, risky choice.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will fully relinquish self/possession to become pure transformation—is legible and resolves cleanly when she dissolves. Escalation is primarily tonal and imagistic (bugs synchronizing, planets aligning, volcano breathing) rather than rooted in hard choices or reversals. There’s little resistance or alternative path on the page; the metamorphosis reads as destined rather than wrestled with. That keeps tension more contemplative than gripping, effective but not maximally pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—a nonviolent conspiracy to undermine an authoritarian regime—is clear and thematically strong, but on-page opposition is minimal. The only apparent tightening, Amara’s approach in the dark, flips almost immediately into confirmation of alliance rather than real jeopardy or moral dilemma. The revolution’s costs are gestured at in abstract terms (“risk much”) without a concrete sacrifice or foreclosed option in scene. As a result, tension feels more anticipatory than escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Yann will meaningfully interpret and assume her inherited role in the frictionless transition—is clear and escalates as the ceremony proceeds and the eels reveal cosmic history. The main tightening comes when the lead eel touches the dust and Yann’s understanding of time, friction, and her curse is radically reweighted. However, Yann is largely carried along by predetermined ritual rather than tested by a difficult choice with a sharply felt price; conflict is mostly internal and contemplative, not confrontational. The result is textured but gently escalating pressure rather than a bracing turn.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Maya can continue to create and seed revolutionary meaning under censorship—is clear, with the storm-night solitude and “boldest yet” poem marking a gentle escalation. The key deepening is her reinterpretation of the censors’ red marks into an “atlas of absences,” converting prior harm into a strategy that fuels tonight’s work and the resistance network of hidden envelopes. However, on-page pressure remains relatively even; no concrete close call, discovery, or tightening threat directly challenges her in the present, so the tension is more conceptual and atmospheric than visceral. The final stance is earned, but the cost and risk register more as inferred background than as something she must actively confront in the climax beat.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—intellectual rebellion against dogmatism via coded debate—is clear but remains largely abstract on the page. The duel offers a nice metaphorical escalation (from opening exchange to “intensified” fencing), yet there is little sense that either character’s choices might materially endanger them or the plot. Past cost (the lost arm) is strong but off-stage; the present scene feels like a rehearsal rather than a risky inflection point. As a result, tension is engaging but not gripping at a level expected for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stakes—preserving subversive literature and protecting the names in the tin—are clear, but they’re not meaningfully tested in the present action. The piece accumulates tension texturally (the danger implicit in the list, the train whistle, the vulnerability of the open-roof library) rather than through an escalating confrontation or decision. October’s plan for November signals future risk, yet tonight she faces no direct obstacle or trade-off; she simply continues her work. As a result, pressure feels static, limiting the sense of escalation required for high-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—Marion’s drive to recover or reach Sophia—tightens effectively as the storm swells, the hand appears in the film, and she abandons the written score to improvise a “corridor,” with her agency driving the pivotal turn. Still, the on-page price of this escalation (risk of losing Sophia forever, self-annihilating hope, or physical danger) stays more conceptual than viscerally felt, keeping the conflict strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the Ninth Island survives the monsoon—is clear and tightened by the coming storm and flickering existence. Escalation comes mainly via the discovery of contradictory memories and the conceptual realization that paradox is the island’s defense mechanism. However, Mira faces little active resistance or painful trade-off; the Council is off-stage, and there’s no serious alternative she must sacrifice beyond adherence to conventional epistemology. Tension remains more intellectual and lyrical than viscerally pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.0)
    The primary stake—whether Kenji will remain in stasis or re-open the severed relationship—stays coherent and gently tightens as the student’s pruning, the lace messages, and the compass needle successively confront his avoidance. Escalation is quiet but real: from passive contemplation, to recognizing his grandmother’s encoded counsel, to the compass’s reweighted image, to promising himself to write to Yuki. The cost is mainly emotional and deferred, yet clearly felt in the long year of silence and the gravity of “tomorrow” as a committed stance shift. The conflict never fully externalizes, which slightly softens perceived pressure.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stakes (career vs. truth) are declared but the conflict is largely internal and summarized. The external threat (demolition) is introduced late and resolved instantly by the protagonist's notes, lacking a struggle or genuine testing of her resolve. The validation of her work by "scientists from multiple disciplines" arrives too easily, negating the cost of her resignation.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes are established (erasure vs. dangerous truth), but the scene lacks immediate external pressure, relying on internal processing. The escalation comes from memory rather than active scene friction; the final choice is a valid turn but feels relatively low-cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are purely internal/past-tense; there is no present-tense opposition or escalation. The plants cooperate instantly with the tuning forks, and the technology functions perfectly, resulting in a low-pressure narrative where success feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; Silas encounters no resistance from the environment, the librarians, or his own limitations. He arrives, diagnoses the problem, and solves it via a procedural montage without ever facing a risk of failure or a moment where the cost of success is weighed.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake of survival is clear, but the conflict is resolved largely through summary narration of the community's success rather than through on-page obstacles. The arrival of the officials provides a climax, but the lack of an active struggle in that moment (the officials are simply met with silence) lowers the dramatic voltage.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.4)
    Escalation is present (sparks -> ghost -> door), but the narrative lacks genuine opposition or tension; the ritual succeeds without complication or risk. The final cost (giving up the photos) is a nice conceptual beat, but it feels more like a destined conclusion than a hard-won price paid after struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.1)
    Conflict remains abstract and cerebral, lacking visceral pressure or external resistance. The escalation leads to a smooth philosophical pivot rather than a tense confrontation of values, resulting in low dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.5)
    Tension is low due to the absence of an on-page antagonist; the Authority is an abstract concept rather than a present threat. The escape feels inevitable rather than earned, as the guards are conveniently absent and the "weak link" was pre-filed, removing the urgency of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are primarily internal and philosophical, lacking sharp external friction or a "ticking clock" beyond the protagonist's own obsession. While the emotional pressure is coherent, the conflict remains quiet; the "investors" act as distant ghosts rather than active opposition. The resolution is earned through endurance and synthesis rather than a hard choice between distinct options.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.2)
    The conflict between comforting illusion and painful truth provides solid internal and relational stakes. The cost is palpable in the mother's grief, satisfying the requirement for a felt price at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes remain abstract and thematic; the physical dangers (radiation, cold) are treated as background aesthetics rather than pressures forcing difficult choices. The interaction with the visitors lacks tension, resolving immediately into a didactic exchange without a felt cost or risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes are established, but the escalation deflates because the protagonist enters the confrontation with a perfect, pre-calculated counter-move. There is no on-page struggle or cost paid during the climax; the victory is immediate and absolute.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes remain abstract (cosmic mapping) with little immediate physical or emotional cost to the protagonist beyond "stiff joints." The climax diffuses tension rather than tightening it; the decision to return tomorrow is a reset to the status quo without a visible sacrifice or irreversible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.6)
    Conflict is purely internal and philosophical, lacking external pressure or a palpable risk of failure. The escalation is smooth but low-friction; the protagonist navigates the disorientation with declared ease ("remarkably composed"), which dampens the stakes of the procedure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are purely relational, which is valid, but the lack of active external pressure (since the board already knows the truth) lowers the voltage. The "cost" is the admission of mutual dishonesty, which lands, but the scene lacks the urgency of a situation where the protagonists must make a decision that alters the future, rather than just accepting the past.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is clear, but the scene lacks immediate pressure; Marta has already mastered her method, and the antagonist (the Ministry) is distant. The young woman accepts the resolution too easily, minimizing the felt cost of the transaction.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes are declared (station safety vs. discovery) but not fully dramatized; the antagonist (Vasquez) is easily ignored, and the physical threat resolves itself when the lever locks. The conflict lacks a moment of genuine trade-off where Ira must sacrifice something to succeed.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are clear and personal, escalating appropriately as Marcus risks physical safety to complete the melody. The conflict is largely internal/supernatural; the external pressure (director) is mentioned but not active in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.7)
    The internal pressure to verify the truth before descent drives the scene effectively. While external opposition is absent (the colleagues have already left), the environmental pressure of the aurora and the physical toll of the fever provide sufficient stakes. The "trembling hands" and calibration sequence offer a tangible escalation beat.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are primarily internal and atmospheric, lacking external pressure, but the escalation of the radio voices successfully builds accumulating tension. The final renunciation provides a satisfying, if quiet, resolution to the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is abstract and lacks on-page escalation; the tension between explorers and the keeper is summarized rather than dramatized, and her internal peace precludes genuine struggle. There is no moment where options narrow or a price is paid; she simply maintains her established philosophical stance.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is minimal; the story relies on the external event of the eclipse rather than interpersonal or internal opposition to generate pressure. The stakes are sentimental rather than urgent, and the characters move toward a pre-ordained conclusion without facing genuine obstacles or hard choices that would test their resolve. It reads as a ceremony of affirmation rather than a dramatic struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are primarily existential and epistemological, which fits the tone. The pressure builds effectively through the accumulation of evidence (tapestry, diary, drawing) leading to a shift in Thrain’s perception, though the external opposition is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stakes are primarily existential ("hiding truth in plain sight"), heightened by the bartender's warning. While immediate external opposition is low, the internal pressure to "transpose" his life provides sufficient meaningful tightening. The climax is a decisive renunciation of his role, carrying the cost of leaving his life and tools behind.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.3)
    While the conceptual stakes are high (possession), the visceral tension is low because the protagonist never loses control or faces a genuine threat. The 17-minute deadline is introduced but immediately dismissed by Marcus's patience, negating its pressure. The conflict resolves through a lecture rather than a struggle, lacking a felt cost to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are high conceptually (transcendence vs. oblivion/sleep), but the conflict is almost entirely internal and lacks tangible resistance. The pressure of "exhaustion" is stated as a ticking clock but doesn't force difficult trade-offs or tactical shifts on the page; Mei moves relatively smoothly from reflection to triumph. A more visceral struggle against the fading consciousness would heighten the earned sense of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are high (existential fragmentation), but the "felt cost" is undermined by the resolution; the "murder" of possibilities feels like a seamless power-up rather than a painful sacrifice. The conflict is resolved by the tablet's function, bypassing a harder internal trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=4.1)
    The central conflict lacks escalation; the experiment works immediately on the first try, offering no setback, physical toll, or moment of doubt to test the protagonist's commitment. The stakes remain internal and abstract, with no external pressure forcing a harder choice.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.7)
    While the conceptual stakes are high (tyranny vs. truth), the scene lacks visceral pressure or a direct antagonist, making the conflict feel abstract. Elena’s "tranquility" during the climax reduces the sense of risk; the cost of her decision is theoretical rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.6)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no significant opposition or difficult trade-offs, making the "transformation" feel like a gift rather than an earned outcome. The stakes remain internal and abstract, with the cost of the change largely metaphorical and painless.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stakes are historical rather than immediate; the conflict belongs to the ghosts (Samuel, Thomas, daughter), not Marcus. There is no active opposition in the scene—the beings are "amused" and helpful—meaning Marcus faces no jeopardy or difficult choice that forecloses a path for himself until the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.2)
    Escalation is smooth and inevitable; the "chronic hush" offers no active resistance to Mara's playing. The stakes are clear, but the absence of a pivotal trade-off, risk, or momentary failure lowers the tension significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.3)
    External pressure (the closing window) works well, but the internal escalation feels somewhat linear. The climax, where she resists the urge to "subsume," is resolved quickly by professional discipline, missing an opportunity for a more perilous, agonizing moment of near-failure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is negligible; potential obstacles (convincing the captain, Martha's estranged pride) dissolve immediately upon contact without testing Margot's resolve. The narrative lacks felt cost, as resources and emotional breakthroughs are acquired with frictionless ease.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=3.6)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the community cooperates immediately, and the "antagonist" (the exiled artist) accepts return without resistance. There is no moment where the outcome is in doubt or where Kira must pay a price for her goal.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.0)
    Conflict is muted; the protagonist bypasses obstacles (time-sculptors, temporal shear) largely through immunity or magical tools rather than struggle. She literally "ignores" the antagonists at the climax, and the ticking clock of the giant's nap resolves almost coincidentally with her success, lowering the sense of active agency and resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are theoretical rather than felt; there is no immediate opposition, time pressure, or risk of failure on the page. Morrow simply places the eyes and receives the answer without having to make a difficult trade-off or face an escalating cost. The lack of resistance makes the resolution feel inevitable and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clearly defined and tightened by the environmental pressure of the failing emergency lights. The archivist’s direct address provides a sharp, decisive turning point that forces the protagonist to abandon his safe detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are high (loss of humanity), and the pressure escalates coherently through physical signs. However, the conflict dissolves quickly once the merge begins; the protagonist's rapid acceptance lowers the immediate tension of the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are clearly established—the loss of a family treasure for the hope of artistic truth. While the external conflict is low-friction (a cooperative exchange), the internal pressure of grief and the environmental ticking clock provide sufficient tension. The reweighting of values at the climax is distinct and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the "shadow-thing" acts as a benevolent explainer rather than an antagonist or obstacle, removing any sense of stakes. The resolution comes too easily—Vera is told what to do and simply does it—lacking the friction or cost required for a compelling escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.0)
    The stakes are conceptual rather than urgent; there is minimal opposition or risk of failure. The community's acceptance and the archive's success happen smoothly over time, lacking a sharp beat where Kessa's goal is genuinely threatened or tested.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no external opposition, and the internal "resistance" is dismissed in a single sentence. The stakes remain abstract and safe throughout, with the "dare" carrying no penalty for failure, resulting in a flat pressure curve.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.2)
    Escalation is low-pressure, with the protagonist facing no genuine opposition or potential loss, only a gradual, frictionless acceptance of the premise. The ending lacks a visible or felt cost; Elena gains enlightenment and reconciliation without having to trade off her scientific status or pay a personal price.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.7)
    While the stakes are high (existential freedom), the immediate narrative pressure is low; the solar storm serves as a convenient tool rather than an obstacle. The conflict lacks active opposition, resulting in a "smooth ride" to the climax that doesn't force the protagonist into difficult tactical trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from a physical threat to a complex moral transaction. The reveal of the ashes provides a decisive deepening of the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=3.0)
    There are no stakes or conflict on the page; the environment, the monk, and the equipment all function perfectly without opposition. Without a moment where the protagonist's goal is threatened or comes with a price, the narrative lacks the necessary tension to drive a literary arc.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.0)
    Pressure is consistent with the Textural lens, escalating effectively through the discovery of the "congregation" note during the spring tide. While the stakes are quiet, the choice to sign—affirming her erased status—carries a felt conceptual cost of permanent separation from the "official" world.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is negligible; the protagonist faces no resistance, antagonists, or meaningful risks during the scene. The "tightening" consists merely of receiving information, and the final decision to participate feels inevitable rather than a high-stakes choice forged under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.6)
    While the stakes are high (total loss of community), the escalation flatlines in the final third because the antagonist is neutralized by a summary explanation rather than a scene. The developers arrive, but they face no on-page confrontation; the tension dissipates instantly once the "historical preservation" plan is announced, lacking a moment of doubt or near-failure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.0)
    The conflict is effectively situational, pitting Vera against the entropy of the "dawning hush" and the evacuation clock. While there is no interpersonal conflict, the stakes of preserving a fleeting moment before humanity's retreat are felt and escalate cleanly through the chemical countdown.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.7)
    External stakes (ship sailing blind) and a ticking clock provide functional pressure, but the personal stakes remain low. Maya faces a task-based challenge rather than a difficult choice or trade-off; success requires focus but demands no sacrifice, leaving the conflict feeling somewhat mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes of discovery versus secrecy are established early. The arrival of the figure creates genuine pressure, but the tension dissipates too easily when the "inspector" reveals himself as a sympathetic relative, converting a potential threat into an ally without forcing a more difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=3.6)
    There is no effective opposition; the mayor dismisses her once and then disappears, and the townspeople join the ritual without meaningful resistance. The protagonist succeeds in a linear fashion without setbacks, doubt, or paid cost, resulting in a flat narrative trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake of survival vs. assimilation is well-maintained, and the cost of the final choice is unmistakably high. However, the escalation is slightly undercut by the late introduction of the daughter; this creates a high-stakes trade-off on paper that isn't fully dramatized in the scene, making the renunciation feel more like a plot beat than a visceral struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    The approaching supply boat provides effective ticking-clock pressure. While the stakes are high (truth vs. erasure), the external conflict is minimal as Marcus faces no active opposition in the corridor, relying heavily on the internal/thematic struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are legible (eternal winter vs. mortality), but the lack of protagonist agency flatlines the conflict. Marlow endures the visitation rather than wrestling with a difficult choice; the resolution happens to him via the ghost's intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks significant tension or pressure; there is no antagonist, internal doubt, or obstacle that genuinely threatens Calla's success. The outcome feels inevitable from the start, as the "phantom stitches" encounter no resistance, resulting in a low-stakes experience.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.5)
    Pressure is low throughout; the protagonist faces no significant opposition, difficult trade-offs, or risk of failure. The narrative acts as a gentle tour rather than a conflict, resulting in a resolution that feels accepted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=3.6)
    There is virtually no active opposition or escalation; the deadline ("three more hours") creates theoretical rather than felt pressure. The protagonist faces no meaningful obstacles in her creative process, resulting in a flat emotional arc without a tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are high and clearly defined, with the coup providing urgent temporal pressure. However, the conflict relies heavily on the "villains discussing secret plans in front of the help" trope, which reduces the sophistication of the antagonistic force. Crane's suspicion introduces necessary immediate pressure, but his deflection feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central conflict is internal and clearly staked on the relationship with the daughter. While the escalation is linear, the final choice to abandon the "cryptic" persona for direct communication is a meaningful turn. The pressure comes more from the magical environment than antagonistic force, slightly softening the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—finding purpose—is addressed, but the scene lacks escalating pressure; the interaction is cooperative from the start. The "cost" of the phantom pain is mentioned but doesn't significantly hinder the action.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=4.5)
    Tension is low; the antagonist (the fog/decay) provides thematic context but no active opposition in the scene. The escalation is purely positive (more light, more connection) without a corresponding rise in risk or cost. The protagonist succeeds without having to trade anything of value.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure escalates well through the acoustic anomaly and the accelerating coin faces. The stakes are primarily philosophical (certainty vs. mystery), which fits the tone. The cost—forfeiting the answer to stay in the wonder of the loop—is legible, though the tension is somewhat low given Elena's lack of resistance to the phenomenon.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.4)
    Escalation is coherent and rapid; the transition from the quiet intrusion to the physical pounding of the Auditors forces a clear, high-cost choice. Marcus's decision to stay creates a legible trade-off between personal safety and the survival of the movement.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is no active conflict or escalation in the narrative present; the "war" is backstory, and the protagonist's success is linear and unopposed. The lack of immediate obstacles or a specific high-stakes test flattens the dramatic arc into a lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are clearly signaled, and the cracking bamboo creates effective time pressure (situational escalation). However, the conflict remains external; Mira races against the object's destruction but faces no agonizing trade-off or moral calculus. The resolution is a "clean win" rather than a complex reconfiguration of options.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the global stakes (war) are high, the on-page pressure is low; the protagonist faces no active opposition or dilemma during the translation process. The path to the solution is linear and unimpeded, missing a meaningful tightening or a forced trade-off that would generate genuine dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.3)
    The stakes (water rights and peace) are high, but the on-page conflict is low; Mara solves a puzzle in isolation rather than facing active resistance. While the "elegant cruelty" of the solution implies pressure, the lack of an antagonist or significant obstacle during the scene makes the victory feel somewhat easy.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are established in backstory but rarely tested in the present; the conflict of reputation and healing is resolved through the passive passage of time and a serendipitous gift. There is little active on-page struggle or cost paid by the protagonist in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.7)
    The story operates under a Situational lens where pressure comes from the environment and the need for understanding. While the escalation is coherent, the navigation feels relatively frictionless (she interprets, she turns, she succeeds), lacking acute obstacles or a moment of significant doubt to heighten the stakes before the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; potential stakes like "failing equipment" are raised but immediately ignored in favor of passive observation. There is no escalation of pressure, no narrowing of options, and no visible cost paid by the characters to achieve the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.4)
    Conflict is minimal; the pressure of the "waning day" creates urgency but never forces a difficult trade-off or meaningful escalation of stakes. The narrative lacks a distinct tightening moment where the protagonist must sacrifice something specific to gain her insight.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.4)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist succeeds in every attempt without meaningful opposition or cost. While the shift from the easy audience (child) to the harder one (teen) offers mild escalation, the "engineering spontaneity" works too perfectly, robbing the narrative of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.0)
    Tension is low because the antagonist (the Council) is abstract and off-screen, and the magic works instantly without exacting a visible toll during the process. Mira accepts the ultimate cost (capture/death) with a serenity that deflates the stakes of the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the stakes of losing the shop are established, the on-page pressure is low. The conflict is largely contemplative, resolved through observation rather than a high-cost decision or struggle. The external threat (bulldozers) is static, and the internal resolution feels like a gentle surrender rather than a hard-won pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.0)
    The internal stakes are clear, centering on Marcus’s struggle to integrate his failure and his grief. The "tightening" occurs as he moves from avoiding the box's contents to confronting them, though the resolution comes somewhat easily through epiphany rather than forced, high-pressure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the story depicts a successful ritual execution rather than a struggle against opposition or internal doubt. The "tide retreating" offers mild time pressure, but Marina navigates the process with perfect competence and receives immediate validation. There is no visible cost to her success, resulting in a low-stakes experience despite the dimensional scale.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.5)
    External and internal pressure are virtually absent; Mira navigates the ruins without physical danger, time constraints, or emotional resistance. The "burden" implies weight, but on the page, she encounters only open doors and helpful clues, lacking the friction required to earn the ending's emotional claim.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.0)
    The dominant stake (waking Sophia) is high, but the escalation is undermined when the protagonist negates the external pressure (the bells) through off-screen prior action rather than an in-the-moment trade-off. The climax relies on the sparrow’s song—a gentle, coincidental affirmation—rather than a decision that forces Maya to sacrifice something of value to bridge the gap.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.8)
    The conflict is sharp and immediate, pitting Mara not just against the enemy but against the inertia of history and ritual. The Theren delegate's challenge ("abandon justice?") raises the stakes effectively, forcing Mara to articulate the thematic core. The escalation from ritual silence to verbal confrontation to physical connection feels organic and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    The tension between the approaching thunder—her own tool turned atmospheric pressure—and the fragility of the egg creates strong immediate stakes. The cost of her agency is palpable: she must destroy the living land to preserve the memory of the dead.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.0)
    Escalation is largely absent; there is no active antagonist, ticking clock, or risk of failure on the page. The conflict is reduced to a procedural dismantling of the barrier, lacking the pressure or deepening stakes necessary to drive tension.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.5)
    The primary conflict (the argument) is retrospective, leaving the on-page scene with lower immediate pressure. While Marcus wrestles with the ethical problem, the solution arrives somewhat easily as an intellectual epiphany, lacking a visceral cost or the feeling of a risky gamble.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.3)
    Pressure is coherent but low-voltage; the stakes (extinction/memory) are high conceptually but distant in the scene, as Mira faces no active opposition or difficult trade-offs. The narrative proceeds according to plan without a tightening moment that forces a change in tactics or a significant sacrifice beyond the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are internalized but potent; the cost is legible in the destruction of the "lost wax" (hair strands) to create the bells. The pressure is quiet but coherent, escalating clearly through the stages of the technical process.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.1)
    The ticking clock of the storm effectively escalates pressure against the protagonist's goal. The central conflict resolves through a decisive internal realization that forecloses the option of "changing" the future, resulting in an earned acceptance with a clear conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is no antagonist or opposing force in the scene; the puzzle offers no resistance, resulting in near-zero tension. Escalation is absent as every action immediately yields the desired result without a moment of doubt or reversal. The stakes are declared (humanity's contact) but never tested against failure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=3.6)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent on the page; the protagonist faces no risk or uncertainty, as he is already "three moves ahead." The antagonist's "righteous fury" dissolves immediately upon touching the prop, removing any need for negotiation, sacrifice, or escalation. The stakes (a dying child) are high in theory but resolved without struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=4.2)
    There is no meaningful escalation; the protagonist asks for help, receives it, and succeeds on the first attempt without obstacle or failure. The tension is purely atmospheric rather than dramatic, as the characters face no opposing force or hard choices.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.2)
    Escalation is weak; once Elara ascends the ladder, the "struggle" is purely technical and succeeds without a hitch or trade-off. The dominant stake (the dying eyes) is resolved too smoothly, and the "deciduous vow" removes the potential for a painful choice, lowering the emotional stakes of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes remain intellectual and abstract; the protagonist faces bewilderment rather than a concrete threat or high-stakes trade-off. The resolution—biting the apple—is a gesture of acceptance that lacks a felt cost or renunciation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the physical descent provides structural escalation, the antagonistic force (the mountain) yields immediately to Mira's first offer, deflating the climax. The ease of the negotiation undermines the established threat of the "frozen seekers," making the victory feel inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clearly defined as a conflict between peaceful oblivion and painful remembrance. The escalation is steady, and the cost of the final decision is felt on the page as Coraline’s features begin to soften, creating a tangible sense of loss.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes are intellectual rather than urgent; the puzzle unspools with linear success through three configurations without forcing the protagonist to sacrifice resources or change tactics under stress. The external deadline tightens the timeframe but does not generate interpersonal or internal friction, leaving the climax feeling safe.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict evaporates the moment the protagonist acts; the energy beings transition from overwhelming threat to reverent observers without escalation. There is no back-and-forth pressure or moment where the protagonist's plan risks failure. The dominant stake is resolved through acquiescence rather than agency under fire.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=4.8)
    Escalation is mechanical rather than dramatic; the protagonist faces no active opposition or dilemma, merely the physical task of climbing stairs and placing an object. The "struggle" of seventeen years is told in backstory, leaving the present-time scene without palpable pressure or the possibility of loss.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are abstract (existential memory) and face no immediate opposition or time pressure within the scene window. The narrative lacks escalation; Lyra moves from observation to epiphany without encountering obstacles or paying a price, resulting in a flat tension arc.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is abstract and lacks on-page resistance. The "Dimming" serves as a passive atmospheric pressure rather than an active antagonist, and the community overcomes their despair instantly upon being shown the solution. Without escalation or a moment of potential failure, the stakes remain theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.6)
    The conflict is intellectual and emotional, lacking a visceral sense of risk or immediate consequence beyond the philosophical. While the stakes are clear for the characters, the resolution comes somewhat easily through a shared realization rather than a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.9)
    The internal stakes are clear, and the time limit of the inversion adds necessary structural pressure. However, the external conflict is relatively low-risk; Mira is in a sanctuary, and the "tremor" poses little genuine threat. The tension relies heavily on the thematic revelation rather than urgent consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.0)
    Pressure is low and managed effortlessly by the protagonist; the "conflict" is internal to the passenger and resolved without complication or escalation of cost. The story functions as a vignette of competence rather than a dramatization of struggle or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is virtually absent; there is no antagonist, the environment offers no resistance to the protagonist's tech, and the "haunting" stakes remain abstract. The resolution is achieved through observation rather than a high-pressure decision or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is negligible; the shadow's encroachment offers no genuine resistance or risk of failure to the keeper. The stakes remain theoretical ("suffocation") rather than becoming a palpable pressure that threatens the protagonist's goal in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=3.8)
    The stakes evaporate at the climax when the crushing pressure conveniently inverts into a creative force without cost or trade-off. Marina does not have to sacrifice her collection, her safety, or her past to succeed; she simply gains "diamonds" and wisdom. The lack of a foreclosure of options or a felt price keeps the tension strictly theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clearly defined as a conflict between the power of the legacy and personal freedom. The climax offers a genuine bifurcation of choice (master the gift vs. destroy it), resolved through decisive agency.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are high in concept (universal reality) but low in immediate pressure. The conflict is primarily environmental (the endless night), and Aldric faces no active antagonism or difficult trade-off; the cost (loss of form) is framed as "bliss," mitigating the sense of sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes are primarily emotional and thematic; while there is a deepening of understanding, the external pressure remains low throughout. The narrative lacks a moment of high-cost agency or urgent trade-off, relying instead on observation and reflection to reach its conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.2)
    Pressure is external and abstract; the Ministry never appears on the page to contest Mira's actions. The climax lacks a moment of doubt or difficult trade-off; the "sacrifice" of the leaders is framed as a convenient strategic asset rather than a felt cost to the protagonist. The victory is total and achieved too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.4)
    The conflict lacks active resistance from the antagonist force. The prophecy responds "immediately" and begins to fade without fighting back or complicating the musicians' efforts, resulting in low tension despite the high declared stakes of "doom."

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.1)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; there is no antagonist, meaningful time pressure, or resource scarcity to force a trade-off. The central choice—ascend or sink—is abstract and resolved through magical insight rather than dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are primarily internal and thematic (precision vs. acceptance), escalating through the accumulating disorder of the clocks. The cost—renouncing his trade to become a curator of brokenness—is legible, though the pressure remains low-key and fable-like.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.2)
    Escalation is minimal; Vera encounters no obstacles in finding Mira or performing the alchemy, and the process works perfectly on the first attempt. The lack of resistance or potential for failure drains tension, leaving the stakes theoretical rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.1)
    The central conflict is legible, but the escalation is somewhat soft; the ghost's resistance melts away after a single reframing by the protagonist. The cost is felt emotionally, but the struggle lacks a moment of genuine doubt or entrenched opposition before the release.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.2)
    Internal escalation is effective as she reframes her trauma responses, but external stakes remain low; the environment and the child offer little resistance. The resolution feels somewhat easy compared to the setup, lacking a sharp, on-page cost for the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.7)
    The scene lacks an antagonist or a concrete obstacle; Valdric is a helper, and the painting yields its secrets to Mira’s knife without risk of failure or consequence. The stakes—historical erasure—are high conceptually but low dramatically within the scene, as Mira faces no immediate opposition or trade-off to achieve her goal.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes are clear but largely retrospective, centering on historical corruption rather than immediate danger. The conflict lacks active opposition or rising pressure in the present moment, resulting in a low-cost resolution where the burden is merely accepted.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are high—the destruction of the protagonist's world—and the escalation is clear as the bottle destabilizes the environment. However, the conflict is largely internal and abstract; the antagonist is an object/concept, which makes the tension intellectual rather than visceral until the library begins to physically collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the stakes are high (saving a civilization), the interpersonal conflict is low-friction; Director Huang capitulates after a single demonstration with minimal resistance. The victory feels smooth rather than forged through pressure or significant cost.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=4.5)
    The conflict lacks genuine pressure; Elias faces no difficult trade-offs or tactical dilemmas, simply continuing his pre-planned work until the villain disintegrates. The antagonist's immediate self-destruction removes the necessity for the protagonist to exert agency or pay a price for victory.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.8)
    Escalation occurs through proximity to the anomaly, but the lack of opposing external pressure (the factory is dead; no antagonist) keeps the stakes somewhat abstract. The climax relies on a deferral of action ("someday... she would let it collect her") which acts as a safety valve, lowering the immediate visceral cost of the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.7)
    Stakes are virtually nonexistent as the storm is explicitly reframed as a "conductor" rather than a threat, removing physical urgency. The internal conflict is resolved instantly by the magic slide, leaving no "tightening" of options or felt cost on the page. Escalation is thematic rather than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=3.5)
    There are virtually no stakes or opposition; Mara faces no external resistance, time pressure, or risk of failure. The mystery resolves itself through the inevitable passage of time and routine labor, rather than through a high-stakes decision or confrontation. The lack of a "refusal" or "endurance" moment with visible consequences flattens the dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.2)
    The conflict is intellectual and low-friction; Marcus explains the stakes, and Amara accepts them without struggling against a counter-desire (e.g., to expose the betrayers). The lack of interpersonal or internal pushback turns the "parley" into a monologue, lowering the dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.1)
    There is a clear pivot point where Silas rejects the "easy path," creating a moment of agency, but the external pressure is low. The "drain of hope" is a passive condition rather than an active antagonist, meaning the ritual proceeds without genuine opposition. The stakes are high in concept (civilization) but low in execution, as success is never truly in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.4)
    The conflict is primarily situational—man against time/oblivion—and escalates clearly when the foghorn stops and the tower cracks. The stakes are effectively raised from professional curiosity to existential preservation. While the external pressure is inexorable rather than dynamic, Matthias's agency in choosing to transcribe creates sufficient narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=4.1)
    Declared stakes (unraveling causality) remain abstract and are never tested on the page; the ritual proceeds smoothly without distinct obstacles or escalation. There is no point where the outcome feels in doubt, resulting in a flat dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.0)
    The external stakes (village survival) are high, but the protagonist faces little immediate personal danger or professional consequence, resulting in low internal pressure. The escalation is linear, and the resolution comes too easily; the simultaneous success of the bell and the siren dilutes the necessity of the difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are purely internal and abstract; there is no escalation of pressure or narrowing of options. The protagonist faces no external antagonism or time constraint, and the "conflict" is resolved by passive observation, leading to a flat narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.1)
    The stakes are primarily thematic and emotional, centering on the preservation of history versus the consumption of the desert. The pressure is subtle but coherent, escalating as the dawn threatens to erase the ghosts, forcing Mara to engage with the box to capture their message.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.2)
    Immediate stakes are low; Marcus faces no active opposition, time pressure, or physical danger during his search. The escalation is purely informational—finding the ads, then the urn—lacking a moment where failure is a genuine risk or where a significant price is paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes remain low and abstract; the tension relies entirely on a child's toy, and the conflict dissolves immediately upon Mira's intervention. There is no escalation of pressure—the boy accepts the "ruined" kite as treasure without resistance, rendering the outcome inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from a property dispute (resort renovation) to an ontological breakthrough (interspecies translation). The cost is absolute—her life—but the narrative reconfigures this cost as a necessary key, deepening the conflict from survival to purpose. The pressure remains coherent and high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are high conceptually but low actively; there is no interpersonal conflict or obstacle as both characters agree on the data immediately. The "escalation" is purely informational (confirming the hypothesis) rather than a pressure-cooker of choices or consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.8)
    Pressure is coherent but low-intensity; the protagonist faces no active opposition from the environment, the past, or himself. The "conflict" is purely thematic (nature vs. history) rather than dramatic; the lack of a tangible obstacle or moment of risk keeps the stakes abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    The internal conflict (trusting failing senses vs. hope) is established well, but the external conflict is resolved via travel montage. The protagonist follows the map without encountering significant on-page opposition or paying a visible, immediate cost during the journey itself.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pressure is low throughout; the protagonist faces no active antagonist, time constraint, or risk of failure, leading to a frictionless escalation. The "struggle" is purely contemplative, turning the climax into a procedural execution of a magical fix rather than a test of agency.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—winning the game—lacks pressure because the Keeper offers almost no resistance. Renn rejects "power" for "wonder," but since she never desired the power, the choice carries no felt cost or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.3)
    The stakes are clear—narrative integrity versus political legitimacy—and the arrival of the visitor forces a meaningful choice. While the external pressure is resolved somewhat quickly with the visitor's retreat, the internal cost of remaining in the "shadowland" is well-dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.9)
    The conflict between memory and prophecy is compelling, but the resolution lacks a gritty, felt cost. The protagonist trades a painful existence for a healing one; while she endures the pain of remembering to activate the stone, the ending feels like a pure upgrade (gaining a garden/home) rather than a complex trade-off typical of higher-band literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is clear, but the obstacle (the tapestry puzzle) yields too quickly to Kaspar's skills, lacking significant resistance. The pressure remains low as the solution proceeds without a moment of doubt or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=4.6)
    The antagonists (Silencers) are passive, arriving only to witness their defeat, which robs the scene of active conflict or escalation. The tension remains theoretical; Kira faces no setbacks, makes no difficult trade-offs, and pays no on-page price for her rebellion.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are established early and escalate clearly via the physical disintegration of the workshop. The conflict is primarily Man vs. Nature/Time, which works well for this length, though the lack of antagonistic pushback makes the climax feel like a linear procedural execution rather than a struggle against doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes are present but pressure is low; the protagonist faces no escalating trade-offs or difficult choices to earn her resolution. The discovery of the journal smooths over the potential conflict, providing an answer rather than forcing a transformative decision.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.2)
    Pressure is low; the antagonist is Thomas's internal guilt, which dissolves immediately upon Mara's reassurance. There is no escalation of stakes or meaningful reversal; the outcome feels inevitable from the moment the vial is opened, lacking a moment of genuine doubt or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes escalate naturally from strangers to a child to the protagonist's brother, tightening the emotional screw while the physical task (cranking the array) becomes harder. The cost is legible in her physical exhaustion and the heavy knowledge that she is guiding loved ones toward a "geography of loss."

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clear and the internal pressure is palpable. The escalation is slightly dampened by the lucky discovery of the truffle cache, which lowers the procedural difficulty, but the psychological cost remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stakes escalate cleanly from an abstract mystery to a deeply personal tragedy, shifting the burden of the "curse" into a gift of connection. The cost is palpable—decades of lost time and the son's sacrifice—and is felt on the page. The internal pressure mounts effectively as the investigation narrows.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rising creek creates genuine physical pressure that escalates the decision to leave. While the internal stakes (regret vs. action) are clear, the climax allows Marcus to view and reject alternative lives with relatively low immediate cost, softening the edge of the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes are high and legible (personal existence vs. kingdom's survival), providing coherent pressure. However, the grotto's ultimatum ("your kingdom falls tonight") acts as a coercion that narrows the protagonist's agency, making the final choice feel more inevitable than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are personal but low-risk; the "dying heart" of the nexus creates a timer, but the solution arrives immediately upon the epiphany without requiring sacrifice or painful trade-offs. The conflict dissolves too easily into a "perfect" success, missing the opportunity for a resonant "earned stasis" or compromise.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are existential and felt; the pressure of the "tangled" chronology forces a tangible choice to step outside the cabin. The escalation from reading to writing to physical action creates a coherent arc, though the external pressure is relatively static.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story lacks significant tightening or resistance; Mara faces no obstacle in the repair or the interaction, and Mrs. Huang accepts the recontextualization immediately. The dominant stake is emotional, but without a moment of doubt, risk, or conflicting desire, the resolution feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation is coherent and visceral; the "oxygen-starved" state effectively forces the climax, and the physical cost of the magic is legible on the page. The stakes are clear, tightening appropriately as the crystallization spreads.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    The external ticking clock (falling trees) perfectly pressures the internal conflict (redemption vs. rigid categorization). The shift from confrontation to collaboration creates a meaningful deepening of stakes, with the cost of Vera's pride legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.9)
    The stakes are nominally infinite (end of the universe), but the tension is diffused by the realization that the threat is merely "doubt" or a "hiccup." The escalation is intellectual rather than visceral, and the resolution feels like a conceptual soft landing rather than a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative lacks significant opposing pressure or difficult choices; the ritual proceeds exactly as intended without obstacle or error. While the internal focus fits the meditative tone, the absence of a "meaningful tightening" or cost—other than the inherent passage of time—limits the dramatic voltage.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes are low and abstract; the "intrusion" is revealed to be a benign lesson, removing external pressure. The conflict resolves through passive acceptance rather than an active decision that carries a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.2)
    The scene lacks interpersonal friction; the stranger appears solely to validate Elena and share an identical backstory ("My mother was like your father"). The climax is a conversation of mutual agreement, which lowers the dramatic tension, even if the internal stakes are resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.3)
    Pressure is minimal as Eleanor is a compliant participant in the fantasy; the interaction lacks opposition, risk, or a moment where the "estrangement" is genuinely tested.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.3)
    The resolution of the central dilemma is outstanding; Mara's choice to hide the truth within the lie employs her specific agency to satisfy both the external pressure (Eleanor) and the internal stake (historical integrity). The cost—burdening the document and herself with the secret—is palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are stated ("desperate need to matter") but not felt in the scene; the transaction is frictionless. Marcus surrenders a unique, sentimental heirloom without visible hesitation or conflicting impulses, reducing the climax to a simple exchange of goods rather than values.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is virtually no opposition, internal or external; the forest and compass guide her without resistance. The stakes remain abstract ("unspoken griefs") and are never tested by a concrete threat or the possibility of failure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clearly defined and high—30,000 lives versus the integrity of reality. The arrival of the rescue ship creates immediate, escalating pressure that forces the protagonist to act. The cost is abstract but felt: the surrender of a guaranteed "happy ending" for a truthful, uncertain one.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.8)
    Pressure is minimal; the protagonist faces validation rather than opposition or a difficult trade-off. The narrative arc is a smooth ascent to epiphany without the testing force of failure or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.4)
    The scene lacks immediate pressure or urgency; the protagonist explicitly notes she has "all the time needed," which deflates tension. While the conceptual stakes are high, the on-page conflict is minimal, functioning more as a retrospective victory lap than a testing ground.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.8)
    The antagonists are straw men who "do not meet her eyes," and the conflict resolves instantly once Mira releases her pattern. The victory feels inevitable rather than hard-won; the cost of "dissolution" is undercut by the euphoric, transcendent framing of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.7)
    While the external stakes (medical supplies) are high, the protagonist faces no genuine obstacle to his competence; he knows the way perfectly. The conflict is primarily the director's panic rather than a test of Marcus's agency or resolve, resulting in a low-pressure escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=3.9)
    The story lacks genuine pressure; the conflict is internal but resolved entirely by an external agent's demonstration. Thomas faces no dilemma, creates no tactical shift, and pays no toll for his healing, resulting in a flat narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the stakes are high in theory (overthrow of a regime), the on-page antagonist (the Director) is neutralized before he arrives because the "forests" have already taken root. The lack of active, uncertain struggle in the present moment renders the conflict relatively static.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.5)
    External conflict evaporates quickly when Torven softens; the internal conflict is resolved by the external magical catalyst rather than a high-pressure choice, reducing stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are high and intimate: emotional survival versus state oppression. The escalation is quiet but intense, driven by the whittling process, and the resolution lands with the "felt cost" of the flat voice required to access the relief, satisfying the high-band criteria for cost.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.0)
    Tension is negligible because the protagonist succeeds immediately and feels a "tremor of certainty" that eliminates the possibility of failure. Escalation is absent; options expand rather than narrow, and there is no point where the outcome feels in doubt or requires a sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist faces negligible resistance; Enzo capitulates to her initial trade immediately, and she succeeds in her goals without paying a visible or felt price. The lack of escalation or genuine obstacles leaves the narrative flat.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.2)
    There is virtually no external opposition, and the internal conflict is resolved instantly by looking through the lens. The stakes—feeling "hollow"—are abstract, and the resolution provides immediate validation (the crowd) without testing Vera's commitment. The narrative lacks the tightening pressure or necessary trade-offs required for the 600-800 word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are emotional and clear, but the on-page pressure is low. The stranger’s arrival validates Elena’s path without complicating it or forcing a difficult trade-off. The climax relies on a shared thematic realization ("learning to burn") rather than a conflict-driven choice, keeping the narrative tension subdued.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are purely informational and abstract; there is no immediate threat to Vera or Marcus if they fail to solve the pattern. The conflict is an intellectual puzzle resolved through exposition, lacking a moment where the protagonist must sacrifice something or make a high-stakes trade-off. The "escalation" is merely the unveiling of information, devoid of personal or physical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clearly defined and escalated by the approaching guardians. The resolution involves a significant, permanent cost ("forever changed"), avoiding a "clean getaway" and satisfying the need for consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes remain largely internal and theoretical; the pressure is observational (understanding the mystery) rather than urgent or antagonistic. While the emotional connection to the grandmother provides a baseline, the lack of external obstacles or time pressure limits the narrative tension/escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are high and clearly defined immediately (legal/social ruin vs. moral integrity). The pressure escalates internally as she dismantles her creation, leading to a necessary trade-off. The cost is felt and paid on the page, satisfying the rubric's demand for consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.6)
    While the stakes (the nature of miracles) are high, the immediate pressure is low; the mystery resolves almost immediately upon looking out the window. The antagonist is merely "silence," and the plants dissolve the conflict by providing the answer, removing the potential for error or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes are internal but clear: the preservation of human emotion against oblivion. The escalation works through the intensifying intimacy of the letters, culminating in a professional transgression that feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes are globally high but lack tension on the page because the protagonist accepts her fate instantly. The escalation is linear—arrival, entry, surrender—without a moment where Lyra must weigh her survival against the goal. The cost is total (death), but the absence of struggle renders the price abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.8)
    The antagonist appears and is defeated almost instantly without escalation or a shift in tactics. While the stakes (a child's nightmare) are stated, the lack of a back-and-forth struggle or a trade-off makes the pressure feel low.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the environment aids the protagonist ("trees sang him a secret") rather than resisting him. There is no escalation of pressure, no moment of doubt, and no antagonist force on the page, resulting in a low-stakes procedural meaningful only for its aesthetic.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are low and the pressure is gentle; the conflict is resolved by the guides offering wisdom and a magical ticket rather than the protagonist facing a difficult trade-off. The escalation feels inevitable rather than earned through resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stakes are clearly defined as a conflict between performative perfection and authentic, painful truth. While the central conflict is largely historical/internal until the guest arrives, the tension of the reunion is earned. The physical cost of the conflict—Elena's scars and Marcus's frostbite—is legible and gives weight to the final release. The pressure is quiet but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.3)
    While the stakes (the throne and history) are high, the climax lacks genuine pressure; the antagonist is defeated by a single gesture (dropping the pellet) without forcing the protagonist to make a difficult trade-off, endure a loss, or adapt her tactics in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clear—official data vs. hidden truth—and escalate from observation to a life-altering physical commitment. The "shadows moving" beat adds a somewhat generic mystery pressure compared to the more unique rhythmic investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.2)
    Pressure is virtually absent; the "lull" removes urgency, and the protagonist faces no opposition, time limit, or difficult trade-off. The climax is a linear progression of intensity without reversal or complication, making the victory feel inevitable and cost-free.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the stakes are established as global, the tension evaporates rather than resolves. The climax acts as a soft reset—soldiers burst in but are instantly pacified by the spores—robbing the scene of a genuine test of the protagonist's commitment or a felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—maintaining composure and purpose against intrusive trauma—is tightened effectively by the "tremor" beat. The escalation is internal and quiet, fitting the Accumulative lens, though external pressure remains atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.3)
    The stakes are high (sanity/survival) and escalate clearly via the closing walls. The resolution diffuses the physical threat through thematic recontextualization rather than action, which works for this genre but slightly softens the visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.8)
    Escalation is virtually absent; the character faces no active opposition or dilemma. The "crisis" of the eclipse functions as a scheduled event rather than a source of tension, and the protagonist’s success is never in doubt, resulting in a flat dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are global and personal, clearly established early on. The "live clock" of the upload versus security response time effectively escalates tension. The final cost is palpable—Vera trades her life for the truth—though the opposition (security) remains faceless and off-screen until the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the opposing forces (violence vs. peace) do not clash but rather coexist instantly without resistance. The father capitulates to Mira’s worldview immediately, removing the potential for a "meaningful tightening" or genuine test of her pacifism.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are clear but the conflict feels low-risk due to Kova's high competence; the "warnings she ignored" lack on-page bite. The resolution comes without a significant visible cost or sacrifice, reading as a "clean win" rather than a complex trade-off, which limits the score.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are clearly established (empire, reputation). The pressure is largely internal and time-based (morning deadline), which works well. The escalation comes from the realization that the truth is more damaging than the lie, forcing a tactical pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=4.6)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the "haunted firmware" is a passive subject waiting to be healed, not an antagonistic force. The stakes remain abstract—appeasing digital ghosts—and the resolution proceeds as a technical task without forcing the protagonist to make a significant sacrifice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.1)
    Pressure is largely atmospheric and internal, lacking a distinct escalation or tightening of stakes. The climax resolves the tension without demanding a visible cost or trade-off from Seraphina; she simply accepts the tile's message, making the "unlearning" feel painless rather than a difficult sacrifice of order.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes are clear, but the antagonist (Brotherhood of Ash) remains an abstract background threat rather than a source of immediate scene pressure. The resolution comes relatively easily once the stones signal their acceptance, reducing the sense of risk or sacrifice required to reach the conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.5)
    Escalation is linear and unopposed; the ritual works perfectly on the first attempt without environmental pushback, antagonist pressure, or the risk of failure. The stakes are theoretically high (eternal separation), but the absence of friction or obstacles renders the tension inert.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes remain low because David is defined as an "affectionate skeptic," removing the threat of rejection or institutional consequence. His immediate conversion removes the pressure before it can escalate into a meaningful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.6)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no active opposition or dilemma, floating from one discovery to the next. The climax involves a realization rather than a high-stakes decision or trade-off, resulting in low narrative pressure throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; there is no antagonist, internal doubt, or physical barrier impeding the protagonist, turning the story into a sequence of events rather than a drama of escalation and consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.1)
    While the stakes (nuclear protocols) are high, the scene's central conflict—trust between handler and agent—dissolves too easily through explanation rather than active struggle. Margot's acceptance of the mission comes without a negotiated price or lingering doubt, flattening the potential tension.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.0)
    Narrative pressure is absent; the protagonist faces no obstacles, opposition, or trade-offs, merely performing a routine service that succeeds exactly as intended.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.2)
    Narrative tension is minimal; there is no antagonist, ticking clock, or pressing danger to force a trade-off. The stakes remain abstract (understanding vs. ignorance) rather than visceral, leading to a serene but low-pressure reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.9)
    Conflict is minimal; Marina arrives at the harbor already possessing "certainty" about her course of action, turning the scene into a ceremony rather than a test of will. There is no escalation of stakes or in-scene dilemma; she executes a pre-formed plan without encountering internal doubt or external resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.4)
    Conflict is minimal and strictly internal, resolved by a swift epiphany triggered by the environment rather than active struggle. The pressure comes from the "hum" and a supportive conversation, lacking the friction or high-stakes trade-offs required to make the emotional shift feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative lacks meaningful opposition; Chen accepts Mira's invitation and premise immediately ("I kept your letters"), removing the potential for interpersonal tension. The dominant stake—rejoining what was separated—faces no active resistance, resulting in a low-pressure progression to the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the global stakes are high (humanity's safety), the immediate conflict lacks visceral pressure; the "battle" is reduced to Maya adjusting knobs while equipment glows, with no felt cost to her beyond mild exertion. The antagonist (the AI) is a distant abstraction that poses no immediate physical or emotional threat to the protagonist in the booth.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are established early (survival vs. discovery), but the pressure dissipates rapidly once the music begins. The environment, initially a threat, becomes a benevolent guide without forcing a trade-off or sacrifice from Marcus. The ending is a victory, but the cost—the loss of his old prudent self—is abstract and doesn't feel "paid for" on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are primarily intellectual (solving the riddle) rather than immediate or dangerous. While the accumulative pressure of the drawings works well, the protagonist faces no active opposition or dilemma in the scene, keeping tension low.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear and high: historical truth and human lives versus immediate survival. The pressure escalates coherently as the storm breaches the threshold. The choice to broadcast creates a valid cost (risk of staying during evacuation), fulfilling the requirement for a decisive action under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stakes remain abstract; Marla faces no concrete opposition or risk of loss. The resolution is a gift of understanding from the magical hitchhiker rather than the result of a difficult choice with a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.3)
    The stakes are clear, but the escalation is reported rather than felt. The conflict plays out through a narrated campaign of psychological tricks rather than specific, high-pressure beats where the outcome feels in doubt. The protagonist’s victory feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the conceptual stakes are high (warnings of supernovae/flares), the immediate dramatic pressure is low. The characters accept the "burden" with very little struggle or cost on the page; the danger of "madness" is mentioned as backstory but not threatened in the scene. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through a difficult choice or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.3)
    The escalation is excellent; the stakes shift meaningfully from physical survival (avoiding execution) to a complex moral sacrifice (accepting pariah status to save the accusers). The cost is felt and changes the ending tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are conceptually high (reality/time) but dramatically absent on the page; there is no active antagonist or obstacle resisting Mira's progress. The narrative lacks escalation, reading as a ritual enactment where success is guaranteed, missing the "meaningful tightening" required for a high-band score.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes are established early and escalate through the Keeper's warning. The climax forces a decision, but the tension deflates somewhat because the "trade-off" (trammeling fate) results in a perfect synthesis ("third path") rather than a jagged or difficult compromise.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are established early (reputation vs. shame), but the escalation is deflated by the discovery that the object is personally known to the protagonist. Because he identifies it through absolute memory rather than risky professional judgment, the pressure of potential failure—the story's core tension—evaporates before the final decision is made.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are theoretical and existential ("bridging the gap") rather than immediate and visceral. The pressure comes from a stated timer ("spirit leaves... choose quickly") rather than an escalating external threat or a deeply felt internal contradiction. The resolution comes easily without a moment of agonizing doubt or a complication that forces a change in tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is negligible; the visitor arrives, performs the ritual, and succeeds without external opposition or internal resistance that threatens failure. The stakes are declared ("dangerous work") but never demonstrated through a near-miss or a painful trade-off, leaving the escalation flat.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are primarily internal; the external environment offers no resistance, and the "structural compromise" is a falsified report rather than a physical threat. The conflict is resolved by a magical realization rather than a difficult trade-off or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.5)
    The internal stakes are clear, and the decision to abandon the chronicles represents a meaningful Conceptual Repricing. However, the escalation relies heavily on the external prompt of the graffiti rather than increasing pressure from within. The resolution comes relatively easily, with the "cost" of abandoning his life's work feeling more like relief than a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are nominal; the protagonist faces no active opposition or genuine dilemma, merely a puzzle she is destined to solve. The escalation is linear and smooth—she observes, documents, and succeeds—missing the tightening of options or trade-offs required for dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes are established early and the cost is felt. The conflict is resolved a bit too neatly through the trap, lowering the antagonist's pressure, but the trade-off—giving up the dream for the truth—is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.2)
    The encroaching Silence creates coherent situational pressure. While the stakes are high, the "bubble of potential" resolution feels slightly convenient, mitigating the cost of the Silence rather than forcing a harder trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=3.5)
    Pressure is virtually nonexistent; there is no antagonist, time limit, or concrete obstacle opposing Mara's goal. The "pilgrim arriving soon" sets a loose clock that is ignored, and the stakes—internal contentment—are resolved through a low-stakes conversation rather than escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.4)
    The conflict is intellectual and primarily verbal; while the stakes (Marcus's conscience) are clear, his resistance crumbles relatively easily, making the escalation feel linear. The cost is well-defined conceptually—the loss of the "simple" victim narrative—but the struggle to get there lacks visceral friction.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are primarily intellectual and lack visceral pressure; while the "alteration of understanding" is a goal, there is no active opposition or risk of failure on the page. The conflict is low-voltage, functioning more as a guided realization than a struggle with felt consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is minimal and purely conceptual; the "wandering pulse" is a curiosity to be solved rather than a pressure that forces a difficult trade-off or tests Yula's resolve. The escalation tracks proximity, not danger, resulting in a serene but low-stakes vignette that lacks dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the stakes of self-worth are clear, the external pressure evaporates the moment Mira steps off the ledge and the mist "gently" catches her. The environment validates her immediately, removing the tension required to make the realization feel fought-for. The antagonist (the feeling of obsolescence) is defeated by a scenic walk rather than a high-stakes trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=3.9)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist wants answers, finds them immediately, and performs a ritual that works on the first try. There is no antagonist, no ticking clock beyond the ambient lantern release, and no moment where failure seems possible. The resolution offers pure gain (connection, purpose) without the requisite loss or trade-off that defines high-stakes drama.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict remains abstract and intellectual; while the universal stakes are high, the immediate pressure on Voss is low as she meets the moment with "practiced precision." The "stellar doubt" is stated as a background condition but never forces a difficult trade-off or alters her tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.4)
    The internal conflict is poignant, but the external manifestation of the monsters is resolved very quickly with a low-cost action (speaking names). The stakes feel high emotionally but the on-page obstacle yields too easily to the protagonist's realization.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are high in theory but low in practice, as there is no active opposition or escalation during the scene. The "mediocre" magic proves perfectly calibrated immediately, removing the potential for failure or necessary sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes shift clearly from professional duty to ethical witnessing, culminating in a "Charged Poise" ending where Marcus accepts the burden of the truth. The conflict remains largely internal and retrospective, lacking immediate external pressure or active opposition on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.8)
    The declared stakes ("destroy her entirely") feel hyperbolic compared to the quiet, contemplative action on the page. The conflict between logic and intuition is resolved with relatively low pressure, making the "final transformation" feel less urgent than stated.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are high and legible, escalating effectively through the seven-minute window and the binary choice between harvest and preservation. Maya’s decision to lie about the timeline demonstrates active agency that creates a satisfying functional cost (security) and conceptual cost (integrity).

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake (psychological wholeness) is clear, and the sparring escalates the tension well. The resolution—creating a child-synthesis—is a resonant reconfiguration of the conflict, though the solution is presented to the protagonist rather than forged by him.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are declared ("comprehensive development") but never tested on the page; the antagonist is abstract and defeated instantly by the plant's magical defense mechanism. Mira faces no trade-offs, risks, or narrowing options; she plants the seed and succeeds without opposition, resulting in a flat trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story lacks active opposition; the grief does not resist the cure, and the mechanical performance proceeds without technical or external obstacles. Escalation is merely additive (more blowers, more sound) rather than a tightening of stakes or options, resulting in a climax devoid of genuine peril or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.8)
    Tension is dampened by the immediate resolution of the threat; the pendant acts as a master key that bypasses the "guardian" function entirely. While the stakes of returning home are high, the lack of resistance or obstacle in the scene prevents meaningful escalation before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.9)
    The internal stakes are clear, but the external pressure is abstract; no immediate antagonist or ticking clock forces the issue beyond the protagonist's own desire. The solution arises from a sudden realization rather than a forced trade-off or deepening dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.2)
    Escalation is functional but mild; the environment and the task offer little active resistance, resulting in a smooth climb to the epiphany without significant tension. While the fragment burning out introduces a cost, the stakes regarding the Guild feel distant, reducing the urgency of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; Marcus encounters no antagonist, obstacle, or internal doubt while executing his plan. The story lacks escalation, moving from routine directly to a cosmic fix without testing the protagonist's commitment or exacting a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are high conceptually (nature of reality) but low dramatically; the protagonist faces no active opposition or risk of failure. The escalation is descriptive—patterns erupting "more violently"—rather than a tightening of options or a forced trade-off with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the student's skepticism is the only potential obstacle and is resolved immediately by the demonstration. There is no escalation of pressure, no risk of failure, and no trade-off required to succeed. The narrative drive is purely informational, lacking the tension of a dramatic argument.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.1)
    The fading photograph successfully creates a ticking clock, but the protagonist faces no active opposition or dilemma that forces a trade-off. The climax consists of a realization followed by movement, lacking a decision with a visible cost or a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.7)
    Internal pressure is strong, but the external antagonist (the tide timer) feels slightly mechanical and low-stakes in the choreography of the scene. The "digital cancer" threat is past-tense, meaning the present-moment conflict lacks a dynamic, shifting opposition beyond the clock.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.0)
    The internal stakes are clear, centered on the tension between physical life and digital death. However, the external pressure is low; the "ghost" is compliant, and the breakthrough happens on the first fully described attempt. The cost is purely conceptual—accepting a fractured identity—which works for the length but lacks visceral bite.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.1)
    The stakes (language extinction) are high, but the "curse" of the diamond is immediately inverted into a solution, removing it as a source of friction. The protagonist faces little active opposition; the resolution comes from waiting for a pattern match rather than a painful trade-off or difficult decision in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.7)
    The stakes are high (metamorphosis vs. loss), but the conflict is resolved relatively easily once the protagonist intuits the answer. The opposition (the FBI, the "corrupted" process) doesn't apply enough immediate pressure to force the protagonist into a difficult trade-off before the end.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clearly established and escalate logically from the first statue's hesitation to the full orchard's rebellion. The cost—Lira "playing herself empty"—is legible, though the opposition (the Council) remains a distant alarm until the very end, reducing the immediate, personified pressure in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the "authorities" are a hypothetical threat that never materializes, and the transaction with the Keeper is seamless. There is no escalation of pressure, no obstacle to the goal, and no moment where the protagonist must risk something of value to succeed.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pressure is minimal; Emil faces no antagonists, no difficult choices, and no failures before success. The environment yields to him instantly—the fragment fits, the angel waits, and the song comes—resulting in a flat narrative arc lacking the escalation required for a high-stakes payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.8)
    Escalation is purely textural, increasing the density of the magic without narrowing the protagonist's options or imposing a felt cost. The stakes remain abstract and philosophical, lacking an antagonist or time pressure to force a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stakes are clear and escalate cleanly; the trade-off between fulfilling the grandmother's dream and preserving Mara's own vitality creates a legible, felt cost at the moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.0)
    The conflict is entirely abstract, pitting the protagonist against "humanity's terror" without an active antagonist or concrete obstacle to force a hard trade-off. There is no meaningful escalation; Vera enters, works, and succeeds without her goal ever being genuinely imperiled or requiring a renunciation of a competing want.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes are clear and personal, but the escalation is primarily informational (decoding the map) rather than a rising pressure that forces difficult choices. While the thematic cost is high, the protagonist faces little active opposition or agonizing trade-offs until the final ritual. The tension is atmospheric rather than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.7)
    The conflict is primarily verbal and dissolves quickly once the tea-leaf proof is presented. While the stakes (the mother's soul) are high, the immediate obstacle is overcome with a single explanation, missing the opportunity for a meaningful escalation or a moment of genuine doubt before the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.2)
    Narrative drive is weak due to a lack of active opposition or immediate risk; the process proceeds smoothly from start to finish. The stakes ("magic itself") are high in the abstract but generate no concrete pressure or urgency in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.5)
    Pressure is atmospheric rather than antagonistic; the conflict is limited to the inherent difficulty of the task ("hemp resisted") without true escalation. The story lacks a meaningful tightening of options or a dilemma that forces a visible trade-off, keeping the stakes abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story maintains a consistent accumulative pressure as Elara decodes the map. The stakes are primarily internal and intellectual, which fits the scope, though the personal "cost" of the transformation (a softening of defenses) is somewhat abstract. The synchronization beat provides a satisfying moment of tightening focus.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are primarily intellectual and thematic; the physical threat (contracting air pocket) serves as a functional clock but lacks intense visceral pressure. The conflict resolves through philosophical acceptance rather than a costly trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the storm serves as a passive timer rather than an active threat, and the "ghost" cooperates immediately. The story lacks an antagonist or a dilemma that forces the protagonist to sacrifice one value for another, resulting in stakes that feel theoretical rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes remain low and abstract. While the elevator is described as rickety ("ice cracking... like breaking bones"), this danger never forces a difficult choice or trade-off; Mira ignores the peril to solve the puzzle, and the environment complies. The conflict is retrospective (Thorne vs. Grief) rather than active in the present.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.7)
    Internal drive is strong, but the external conflict is largely summarized ("Ground control had given up"), reducing the immediate tension of the scene. The "cost" of the ending—continued drifting—is accepted with a serenity that fits the tone but dampens the sense of active struggle or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.1)
    Conflict is largely external (the deadline) and static; the protagonist faces no significant active opposition or dilemma during the scene. The resolution comes from following instructions on the coin rather than through a high-stakes decision or costly sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain low and purely intellectual; Elara faces no active opposition, time pressure, or risk of failure beyond a lack of discovery. The "isolation" is framed as "sociable" and enjoyable, removing the potential for psychological cost or tension.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.7)
    Although the backstory stakes (a village in darkness) are high, the scene itself lacks immediate external pressure or active opposition. Elara faces no difficult trade-offs or escalating risks on the page, turning the climax into a puzzle assembly rather than a dramatic conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.3)
    Conflict is described in exposition ("suspicious clusters") rather than dramatized in a scene where opposing values clash. The stakes are high in theory but low on the page, as the solution (trust) is accepted by the community without a visible moment of resistance or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are conceptually high (doomsday) but the on-page conflict is low; Marcus faces no active resistance or dilemma. The escalation is linear and smooth—discovery leads immediately to resolution—without a moment of tightening pressure or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clear and high: the lives of the travelers and the stability of the entire valley. The tension escalates naturally with the approaching frost. The resolution relies on a meaningful choice by Mara that carries the felt cost of her own continued entrapment.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    The internal escalation through the drafted texts effectively raises the stakes of the communication. However, the external tension evaporates instantly with Elena's perfectly aligned response, robbing the climax of lingering friction or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.8)
    The pressure is quiet but intense, centered on a philosophical danger ("unknow conclusion itself") that Merrick treats with appropriate gravity. The stakes are reconfigured in the final beat, moving from a transaction of loss to a perilous, infinite openness.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the stakes are high (the haunting of the fortress), the escalation is internal and abstract. The antagonistic pressure—"emotional contagion"—is described as a "sandstorm" but is overcome by the protagonist's innate "sturdiness" rather than a tactical choice or sacrifice. The conflict dissolves rather than resolving through a dialectic of opposing needs.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.0)
    There is no active resistance in the scene; the protagonist attempts the impossible and succeeds immediately on the first try. The escalation is linear (one elevator, then another) rather than pressure-driven. The stakes are declared (dying town) but never threatened in the moment of action.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.3)
    Conflict is virtually absent; Vera faces no external opposition, technical malfunction, or internal doubt. The stakes are purely abstract (understanding vs. ignorance), and the "cost" of the transformation is described as a successful upgrade rather than a painful trade-off, neutralizing tension.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ticking clock of the gravity inversion provides effective physical pressure and stakes. The dominant stake—preserving vigilance against dangerous knowledge—is clear and thematically resonant. The conflict is primarily environmental; while effective, the lack of an active antagonist or a harder internal trade-off limits the escalation's intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is virtually no conflict or active opposition; the environment yields immediately to Mira's efforts without pushing back. The stakes are abstract (silence vs. sound) and do not result in immediate, on-page pressure or risk of failure. No price is paid for the success, resulting in a flat dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are theoretically high (exile vs. restoration) but feel low in practice because the Academy is dismissed as "arrogant" and inferior early on. There is no genuine temptation to return, so the renunciation lacks visceral cost. Mira offers validation rather than resistance, leaving the central conflict without a pressure test.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.8)
    External pressure is low; the conflict is technical and yields to competence without a "felt cost" or risk of failure. The escalation is linear (tuning a dial), and the climax resolves smoothly without forcing a difficult choice or sacrifice from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes remain low and internal, with external opposition (mocking apprentices) summarized rather than felt. The narrative lacks a distinct pressure point or reversal; success feels inevitable as the protagonist simply persists through time without facing a dilemma that forecloses options.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain abstract; Kessa’s perfect preparedness ("magnetic anchors") neutralizes the physical threat of the Inversion, removing immediate tension. The conflict resolves through discovery rather than a forced trade-off or escalation of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.6)
    The pressure of the "disorientation" and the expanding anomaly is coherent, escalating appropriately as she moves deeper. However, the stakes feel managed by her hyper-competence; the shift to "foresight in action" is a logical deduction rather than a forced trade-off with felt personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is virtually no on-page resistance. The antagonist (the Council) is absent, the environment poses no physical threat, and the magic works perfectly on the first try. Without an obstacle or a moment where the outcome is in doubt, the narrative lacks tension and meaningful escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.4)
    Conflict is negligible; the mountains "lean in" and the entity is "patient," removing urgency and opposing force from the encounter. There is no escalation or tightening of options; the protagonist succeeds on her first attempt without facing a reversal or trading one value for another.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.1)
    The pressure is consistent, driven by the cosmic clock of the dying stars, but the stakes remain largely internal and abstract. While the loss of self is mentioned, the protagonist seems to glide into the fragmentation without significant resistance or tangible cost, lowering the felt tension of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.6)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no active antagonism or mutually exclusive choices. The escalation is purely spectral (more vibration, more ghosts) rather than a rising pressure on the character's agency, culminating in a "gifted" resolution where she receives powers without paying a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=3.2)
    Tension is minimal; the antagonist (the Institute) is abstract and off-page, and the immediate obstacle (mist/sun) offers no genuine resistance. The protagonist achieves her goal in a single try without escalation, reversal, or payment of any price.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake is clear, and the escalation is handled well through the weaving sequence. The cost is not just stated but dramatized as specific memories are stripped away ("daughter’s first word"), creating a high-pressure climax that earns the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.2)
    Tension is minimal; there is no antagonist, internal doubt, or risk of failure during the forging process. The narrative proceeds smoothly from commission to completion without a moment where the outcome is genuinely in question.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are clearly established (finding the mother, then saving reality), but the conflict evaporates at the climax. The lack of resistance from the mother or the environment regarding the "cure" creates a telescopic effect where world-ending stakes are resolved by a minor tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=3.8)
    Tension evaporates immediately upon meeting the ghosts, who are sad rather than threatening. The protagonist faces no genuine opposition or difficult trade-offs; the solution (thinking warm thoughts) is abstract and requires no sacrifice, rendering the "danger" stone a false alarm.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.0)
    Escalation follows a standard rule-of-three pattern, but the climax lacks genuine pressure; the antagonist is a mirror-twin that Mira cooperates with instantly. The protagonist faces no moment of potential failure or hard trade-off, making the "impossible navigation" feel like a foregone conclusion rather than an earned victory.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes are theoretically high (danger of a heavy heart), but the immediate pressure on the page is low. The conflict is retrospective—Kael has already been struggling—and the scene functions as a lesson rather than a test. The protagonist accepts the mentor's solution without resistance or a demonstrated cost in the moment, making the escalation feel expository rather than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes are primarily internal and thematic, which fits the "quiet" mode, but the conflict lacks visceral pressure until the destruction of the sextant. The cost is legible—the loss of the instrument's original function—but the escalation is soft, driven by realization rather than urgent opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are high in theory (survival) but low in practice, as the antagonist (the darkness) provides no active opposition once Elara begins her song. The escalation is a smooth ramp of success rather than a pressure cooker; the "iron bands" snapping at the end signals relief, but the prior tension was atmospheric rather than derived from a risk of failure or a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes are clear and the pressure of the woman's grief provides a functional inciting incident. However, the conflict is resolved relatively easily through conversation, and the cost (feeling her guilt) is managed quickly by the protagonist's established skills.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; there is no antagonist, internal resistance, or difficult trade-off to force escalation. The stakes remain abstract ("absolution," "truth") and are not tested by genuine risk on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.3)
    The triage of vows creates immediate, high-pressure stakes where the cost is tangible and irreversible. The conflict moves effectively from a battle against entropy to a moral decision about what deserves to survive.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are established early, and the false-start backstory effectively raises the pressure for this final attempt. However, the tension deflates significantly when the antagonist grants Mae a poetic pass ("until the tide changes") rather than acting with the urgency of a criminal enterprise under surveillance. The physical threat evaporates, leaving only the emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.9)
    The protagonist observes and accepts rather than deciding or struggling; the resolution arrives via external confirmation (Simon's arrival, the pulse) rather than agency, resulting in low dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes are internal but low-pressure; the protagonist faces no active opposition or difficult trade-off, merely following instructions to a breakthrough. The resolution feels gifted by the sister's permission rather than fought for by Lyra, lacking a felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from a personal quest for a letter to a societal upheaval. The cost of the final decision—the dissolution of peace—is acknowledged and "felt" through the metaphor of condensation. The antagonist remains abstract ("the powerful"), but the pressure on Vera is maintained through the environment and the crystallized evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is minimal; the antagonist is entropy (melting), but it offers no active resistance during the scene. There is no moment where the plan nearly fails or requires a painful trade-off; the bell accepts the "frequency of crystallized awe" without friction, flattening the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are clearly internalized: functional coherence versus static. The external threat ("ecosystem collapse") feels slightly declared rather than demonstrated, but the precision required in the burning sequence provides sufficient tension. The cost—the loss of the physical artifacts for internal peace—is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is minimal; Marta faces no opposition from the environment, neighbors, or Elena. The resolution (finding the letters) requires no sacrifice or difficult trade-off, resulting in a lack of felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.6)
    While there is escalation in the environmental response (lights pulsing, dice glowing), the stakes remain theoretical rather than visceral. The protagonist faces no active opposition or risk of failure; the dice "defy probability" to help her, and the systems yield to her "calm defiance" without extracting a visible toll or forcing a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clear and personal, balancing the city-wide crisis with the intimate loss of a child. The final choice to keep only one memory and rebury the rest creates a nuanced "Earned Stasis" with a visible emotional cost: the return of grief.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes are high and clearly defined; the resistance of the "living" prophecy creates tangible pressure. The cost—the loss of beneficial futures to maintain stability—is a strong, felt price paid for the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story relies on a "quiet" accumulative strategy, moving from shared silence to shared secret. While functional, it lacks significant interpersonal or situational pressure; the transition is smooth but devoid of a sharp dilemma or high-stakes trade-off, limiting the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is almost no active resistance to the protagonist's goal; she decides to dig and succeeds immediately. The internal conflict is resolved instantly ("the charmed part... drove her forward"), and the stakes, while high in concept (sanity/identity), lack immediate on-page pressure or the risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are initially high (life/death), but the resolution deflates the tension by ignoring the likely lethal consequences of the protagonist's choice. The ending frames her action as "walking free" without paying the on-page cost of confessing to treason in a tyranny, resulting in a thematic victory that feels unearned within the story's reality.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are high (existential transformation), but the pressure is dampened because the central mystery is solved immediately by the shell's whispers. The "web of intrigue" is framed as a misunderstanding rather than an active antagonistic force, leaving the protagonist with only an internal choice rather than an external struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is virtually no conflict; the protagonist faces no opposition, external threat, or difficult trade-off. The interaction with the ghosts is purely transactional (she asks, they provide), resulting in a flat narrative arc devoid of escalation or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is virtually no conflict or escalation; the protagonist faces no obstacles in mending the net, reading the signs, or executing her will. The stakes are abstract (entropy vs. order) and never threaten the character on the page. Without an antagonist, internal doubt, or physical difficulty, the narrative lacks the pressure required to drive a compelling arc.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.5)
    The conflict is well-structured, escalating from intellectual curiosity to a high-stakes moral dilemma with clear binary options. The approaching storm effectively acts as a ticking clock that pressurizes the final decision, forcing Marcus to choose before he is ready.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.1)
    Escalation is present via the intensifying storm, but the stakes remain abstract. Marlowe battles the elements, but she faces no genuine dilemma or trade-off; the lack of a "felt price" or sacrifice limits the emotional impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=3.6)
    Conflict is negligible; Marcus encounters no resistance in his search, and Elena's grief resolves into forgiveness with a single prompt. The stakes remain abstract ("preserving history") without an immediate, visceral cost or risk to the protagonist on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are high and clearly communicated, involving both immediate survival and long-term safety. The escalation relies on a simple ticking clock (sunset/Collectors) rather than a deepening of interpersonal or complex obstacles. The cost of the final choice is high (loss of physical form), though the lack of an alternative option reduces the agency of the sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are globally high (freedom) but immediate dramatic tension is low; the Council is an abstract concept rather than a present opposing force. The protagonist faces no trade-offs or tangible risks during the ritual, resulting in a textural rather than dramatic escalation. The pressure remains atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are clear, but the central conflict is resolved by the object's revelation rather than the protagonist's active struggle; the cost of resignation is stated, but the decision feels low-friction and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes are clearly defined as emotional closure, but the external pressure is low; the conflict resolves with gentle negotiation rather than sharp resistance. The tension is quiet and steady, fitting the genre but lacking a distinct tightening beat.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.2)
    Escalation relies on intellectual progress rather than rising pressure; the opposition is passive verbal skepticism, and the final risk (the dive) yields immediate reward without sacrifice. The lack of a forced trade-off or felt cost makes the stakes theoretical rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes shift from professional to existential, but the absence of active opposition makes the investigation feel low-pressure; the final cost is theoretical rather than felt, as Lila abandons her life too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.9)
    The stakes are purely conceptual and lack active opposition; the Keeper is a guide, not an obstacle, and the environment presents no immediate threat. While the internal shift meets the requirement for a decisive change, the absence of friction or difficult choices keeps the narrative tension low.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    The internal conflict (desire for an ending vs. the reality of endurance) is mirrored effectively by the external pressure of the collapsing marina. While the external stakes (evacuation) lack deep suspense, the internal escalation leads to a meaningful moment of agency where she chooses to witness rather than flee.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is almost entirely retrospective; the present scene lacks a dominant stake or meaningful escalation until the end. Marcus faces no active opposition or difficult trade-off in the "now"; the daughter's arrival solves his solitude instantly, missing the opportunity for a tightening beat where he must weigh the cost of opening up against his safety.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the antagonist is abstract entropy ("wisdom echoes fade"), which offers no active resistance on the page. The protagonist and her allies are in perfect agreement, and the consecration succeeds without a hitch, resulting in zero palpable tension or escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes are declared ("erasing the last physical memory") but not tested; the antagonist (the council) is absent, and the exhibition plan encounters no obstacles. There is no meaningful tightening of options or felt price for the protagonist's success.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.1)
    The external conflict is soft; the Committee arrives and immediately yields to the crystal's display ("drawn despite themselves") without exerting active pressure or countermeasures. The stakes are high conceptually (the future of language), but the scene lacks a moment where Elena's success is genuinely in doubt or comes at a visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are emotional but low-pressure; the protagonist faces no significant obstacle, trade-off, or risk of failure in the scene. The woman arrives, they tune the static, and they succeed immediately; the absence of a "meaningful tightening" or reversal makes the victory feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are high and clearly escalated: the tremors and the clock's acceleration create a tangible "ticking clock" pressure. The resolution is earned through the protagonist's specific skill set, though the lack of a harder, more painful sacrifice limits the emotional impact of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the stakes (mortality) are high, the execution lacks conflict; the project faces no resistance from staff, patients, or Maya's own failing health. The absence of active opposition or risk turns the plot into a smooth, inevitable progression rather than an earned victory.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.3)
    Tension is effectively managed through the ticking clock of approaching noon and the trembling isle. The stakes are clear (universal stability), though the protagonist's alignment with the solution feels somewhat inevitable, reducing the sense of jeopardy regarding the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.4)
    The scene relies heavily on backstory for its weight; the immediate interaction is low-stakes conversation without a tightening of options. While the emotional cost of Elara leaving is present, the lack of immediate on-page obstacles or hard choices limits the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are established (fleet safety), but the conflict dissolves instantly upon the deployment of the glass. There is no escalation of pressure or moment of doubt; the solution works "instantaneously and magnificently," removing the potential for tension or earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story suffers from telescopic stakes: the "viral" pressure involving "millions" is declared but effectively ignored in favor of a low-stakes interaction that resolves without struggle. Marcus offers no resistance to Kira's worldview, resulting in a static encounter where the protagonist's philosophy is validated rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes are purely internal and abstract (writer's block/artistic integrity), lacking a concrete external cost or obstacle. The escalation is linear: she arrives, realizes, and acts without facing resistance or a moment of doubt that forces a painful trade-off. The climax is a ritual release that feels pre-ordained rather than fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.8)
    Tension is virtually nonexistent; there is no antagonist, internal reluctance, or environmental resistance to the protagonist's actions. The escalation is merely a progression of success—she hums, the vine blooms, the people join—missing the "meaningful tightening" or "visible cost" required for a high-band score.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are established through the expenditure of rare resources (years of collected starlight), but the lack of active opposition makes success feel inevitable. The tension relies entirely on the atmosphere of the ritual rather than a moment of genuine doubt or adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.3)
    Pressure is coherent but low-key; the impending end of the "wounded season" creates a soft deadline. The conflict is primarily philosophical (order vs. wonder), and while the tightening is perceptible, the lack of an antagonist or harder trade-off limits the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation is internal and textural, moving from personal grief to the weight of the environment itself. The ending earns its stasis; the cost of "knowing" is felt through the physical burden of the burner, though the conflict remains quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.1)
    The kettle acts as a functional ticking clock that forces the carving's pace, creating effective micro-tension. The stakes are personal but felt; utilizing Thomas's last piece of wood for a non-functional clock represents a clear, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.9)
    The stakes are clearly defined as a crisis of purpose, and the pressure of the silent, judging ghost forces a necessary confrontation. While the external threat is low (mere stillness), the psychological pressure escalates appropriately to the moment of contact. The cost—surrendering the dream of rebuilding—is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.1)
    Escalation is linear and lacks genuine opposition or risk; Maya faces no failure state, time pressure, or antagonist. The "struggle" is summarized ("spent hours") rather than dramatized, resulting in a resolution with zero felt cost or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.1)
    The conflict is internal and coherent, but the stakes feel somewhat low due to the retrospective nature of the inciting incident (letter received yesterday). The resolution—a compromise to keep both lives—lacks the sharpness of a forced trade-off, lowering the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.2)
    The stakes are primarily internal and abstract; the conflict is resolved by reading a letter rather than active struggle. While the decision to return home implies cost, the ease with which the confession triggers this life-changing pivot lowers the felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain abstract (entropy vs. preservation) with no immediate threat forcing a trade-off; the cold and fog provide texture but do not actively oppose the protagonist's goal. There is no moment where failure is a tangible risk, resulting in low narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.7)
    Escalation is internal and subtle; while the density of observation increases, the stakes remain static (observation/acceptance) without forcing a difficult trade-off or active decision. The narrative lacks a distinct tightening of the screw to force the final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes are clearly defined, but the opposition is passive (entropy/history), reducing tension. The climax's cost—the bird's deformity—is paid too easily; Aldric's immediate acceptance bypasses the potential for a deeper, more conflicted moment of reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.1)
    Conflict is almost entirely retrospective; there is no active resistance or obstacle in the present scene to test the protagonist's resolve. The ritual proceeds without complication, resulting in a lack of narrative tension or escalating stakes typically required for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is virtually no active conflict or pressure; Marcus arrives, meets a helpful guide, and performs the ritual without opposition or cost. The potential tension of being "early" is dismissed in dialogue, and the resolution comes too easily, lacking the friction required to make the stakes feel genuine or the liberation earned.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is negligible; there is no antagonist, resource scarcity, or time pressure compelling the protagonist to alter her tactics. The stakes remain abstract (the completion of a pattern) and do not generate immediate scene-level tension. The narrative lacks a moment of tightening where the protagonist's goal is genuinely threatened.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stakes are clear and the deadline of the migration adds a tangible pressure to the abstract task of mourning. The cost is depicted through endurance and physical strain ("pressing too hard"), fitting the accumulative drive. The climax is quieter—a ceremony of witness—which works for the scope, though the conflict remains largely internal and low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.2)
    The stakes are retrospective (past damage) rather than immediate; there is no active resistance or possibility of failure within the tower scene. The climax lacks pressure, as the protagonist faces no obstacle other than the execution of a ritual that succeeds inevitably.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story lacks significant tension or opposition; Marta untangles the mystery with ease, facing no obstacles in the decoding process. While the internal deepening is present, the absence of friction or cost until the final decision to bury the item limits narrative propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.2)
    Pressure is low; the antagonist (the Council) arrives and immediately succumbs to the protagonist's influence without generating friction or forcing Mira to adapt. The conflict is theoretical rather than visceral, as the opposition offers no effective resistance to the "visual algorithms."

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.8)
    The only on-page obstacle is a wavering signal resolved instantly by patience; with no hard choice or sacrificed resource, the stakes remain theoretical despite the declared danger.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.0)
    The external pressure (police arrival) and internal clock (Creech's death) create a situational drive, but the protagonist’s agency is largely passive at the peak; she waits for him to die and then hides. The conflict resolves through the inevitability of the premise rather than a high-stakes choice made under fire.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.9)
    The conflict escalates well from a dispute over facts to a deeper moral choice about preserving dangerous truths. The dominant stake (historical truth) is clear. However, the resolution relies slightly on the "world isn't ready" trope, which softens the antagonism faster than the buildup suggested.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent on the page; the students arrive willing, they cooperate instantly, and the "lost" music is recovered via summary without friction or error. The university's closure provides a backdrop of stakes, but there is no immediate pressure or escalation compelling the characters to take risks.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes remain abstract and retrospective, as the antagonist is absent and the environment (moons) actively aids the protagonist. Without immediate opposition or a risk of failure, the scene lacks the pressure needed to force a meaningful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.4)
    Conflict deflates rather than escalates. The high stakes (famine, theft of power) are established but effectively ignored in the climax, where the potential antagonists (the citizens) offer no resistance, removing the felt cost of the protagonist's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.7)
    Pressure is low throughout; while the final offering is a cost, there is minimal opposition or difficult trade-off leading up to it, resulting in a smooth drift toward resolution rather than an escalation of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.9)
    The stakes (reputation vs. truth) are established, but the conflict resolves without sufficient resistance; Marina surrenders her worldview instantly upon seeing the vision. The lack of struggle or friction in the decision-making process dampens the dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clearly defined and deepen significantly when the "infinite" staircase is revealed to be a finite loop of human heartbeats. This realization reweights the conflict from a hopeless struggle against eternity to a grim race against entropy. The pressure remains consistent and cerebral, escalating through knowledge rather than external threat, which fits the story's logic perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is no meaningful escalation or opposition; the initial problem (insomnia/block) is solved by the first major action (using the brush). The stakes (loneliness/forgetting) are resolved instantly by internet fame without any setbacks or complications. The story lacks a dominant stake that is tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.9)
    Situational pressure is coherent and escalates well through the sensory details of the thaw (crashing ice, weeping walls). The ticking clock ("hours, maybe less") effectively tightens the narrative focus.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.1)
    The external stakes are clear, but the escalation is somewhat linear; the stone "writhing" offers resistance, but Elara overcomes it with practiced ease. The "cost" is handled conceptually—the bitter realization of being a tool of destiny—rather than through a visceral in-scene sacrifice, which softens the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.1)
    The stakes are high (sanity/survival), and the escalation via the pulsing mirrors and projected death effectively builds tension. The resolution, however, pivots on a single dialogue exchange that de-escalates the threat too easily. The cost—carrying Fear permanently—is well-established and felt, saving the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.3)
    Pressure escalates through external threats (the tightening gyre) and physical exertion, but there is no moment where Kessa must pay a significant price or make a hard choice. The "cost" is limited to fatigue, and the victory feels inevitable once the playing begins, lacking a pivot where failure seems genuinely possible.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes escalate clearly from the silence to the physical sealing of the city (rust) and the waking of the turtles. The conflict culminates in a strong agency-driven choice where Mira transgresses a direct warning, accepting the high risk of the unknown over the safety of the city.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes—historical truth versus social stability—are high and clearly defined. However, the tension deflates during the climax when Elara reveals she has "already transmitted" the data; this fait accompli removes the immediate pressure of the confrontation, rendering the standoff static rather than active.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure is coherent but low-stakes; the "tightening" is largely atmospheric rather than forcing a difficult tactical trade-off or high-cost choice. The protagonist's agency is active in the ritual, but the external opposition is passive.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stakes are clear and escalate well via the "ticking clock" of the returning power and dropping pressure. The shift from checking volumes to identifying page-specific forgeries provides a solid deepening of the conflict, though the specific nature of the reveal (corporate water rights) leans slightly into standard tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.6)
    Escalation occurs through narrative summary rather than on-page pressure or rising stakes within a scene. The resolution is unlocked by a magical vision gifted to the protagonist, bypassing the need for a difficult, active choice or sacrifice to achieve the thematic transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are clear and escalate naturally with the alarm and security arrival. The final choice creates a meaningful trade-off—sacrificing Amira's safety and the data's scientific value to restore the "potential" to the world.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes remain abstract, and pressure is negligible; the protagonist faces no antagonist, time limit, or difficult trade-off. The solution is handed to her by the pilgrim and executed via a montage of success. Without a moment where failure is possible or a price is paid, the escalation feels flat.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes are clearly defined and escalate naturally from curiosity to personal horror to professional renunciation. The cost—losing his wealth and career to honor the truth—is stark and legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stakes are high—a son’s freedom and a brother’s memory—and the cost of forgiveness is legible. The conflict escalates through dialogue to the apology, though the resolution feels slightly swift given the weight of the history. The pressure is consistent, if handled with perhaps too much grace.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.6)
    The stakes are primarily retrospective; the present-moment action lacks immediate pressure or obstacles. There is no escalation of risk during the paddle itself—only reflection—making the "victory" of return feel inevitable rather than fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are abstract and theoretical; there is no immediate pressure or cost on the page. Marcus faces no opposition and makes his final choice without a visible alternative or agonizing trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.3)
    The stakes are high and intimate—the loss of self versus the loss of connection. The escalation is managed through the uncorking of the vial, a clear point of no return. The cost is felt in the dissolution of her human form, though external opposition is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.4)
    While the internal stakes are poignant, the external pressure is low; the protagonist faces no active opposition or cost to performing the magic. The resolution is achieved through the successful execution of a spell rather than a difficult trade-off or sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.3)
    The central conflict is resolved through established competence rather than escalation or sacrifice; Mei "held steady" and the problem vanished. The antagonist (the shadow dimension) exerts insufficient pressure, failing to force a trade-off or a moment of genuine peril.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes are high (transcendence), but the scene lacks immediate tension or obstacles; the protagonist faces no resistance, only a series of green lights from the universe. The "cost" of losing her physical form is present but feels inevitable rather than a hard-won trade-off in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake (starting the revolution) is clear, but the scene lacks immediate pressure. The appearance of the Captain briefly raises stakes, but her immediate camaraderie deflates the potential conflict. The "cost" is abstract ("death by a thousand paper cuts") rather than a price paid by the characters on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes are effectively internalized; the cost of the "curse" is palpable and recontextualized by the end. The tension is quiet and epistemic rather than physical, but the resolution—accepting a lifetime of waiting—provides a satisfying, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.7)
    Pressure is coherent and thematic, driven by the vigil and the storm's escalation. The stakes are high (exile, erasure), but the immediate on-page conflict is largely internal and maintenance-based rather than a sharp, evolving tactical crisis. The "vigil" mode justifies this but limits dynamic range.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are declared ("Revolution") but never felt or tested on the page; the "duel" is actually a cooperative meeting with no antagonist or obstacle. Collaboration without external pressure or internal risk creates zero dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are abstract ("human soul," "standardization") and declared in exposition rather than tested against concrete opposition on the page. There is no antagonist, time pressure, or risk of discovery during the scene; the "danger" of the list is stated but not felt. The narrative lacks a tightening screw or a meaningful reversal, resulting in a flat dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.4)
    Tension is primarily atmospheric rather than dramatic; the protagonist faces no active opposition or risk of failure within the scene. The escalation is linear—she plays, the magic responds, and she succeeds—lacking the tightening of options or the "moment of truth" trade-off required for higher stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clear (cultural erasure) and the monsoon provides effective time pressure. The deepening of understanding—from viewing contradiction as a flaw to a feature—is a strong internal escalation, though the external threat remains distant (the Council) rather than immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes of reconciliation vs. estrangement are clear and felt. The act of pruning the wild juniper serves as a functional objective correlative for the internal conflict. Pressure is maintained, though the external conflict is low-key; the tension relies almost entirely on the internal processing of the "severance."

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.1)

    Contradictory memories deepen stake, forcing renunciation of singular truth; agency in swallowing and writing narrows to prismatic reality with felt institutional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake of reconciling severance tightens accumulatively through lace's progressive decoding narrowing silent endurance to tomorrow's letter, with agency in micro-choices like snip instruction forcing trade-off; cost unmistakable in "every word he'd failed to say."


== Grader: Kimi K2-0905 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—Elena’s need for a non-theatrical way of knowing—tightens as each dust map undercuts her neutron-star models. Agency is present (she stops attending meetings, submits resignation), but the visible price is narrated rather than dramatized, keeping escalation slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to perpetuate or end the poisoned legacy—tightens when frost teaches “no radiation needed,” foreclosing the glowing-glass option with felt cost. Agency is internal renunciation rather than external fight, sufficient under Accumulative lens. No visible resource loss on-page beyond symbolic identity death, so the price is conceptual, not visceral, holding it under 8.2.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—prove life sings after silence—tightens when each thermal pattern forecloses the old auditory method. Agency is continuous: fork, camera, keyboard—each act narrows her retreat to sound. Cost accumulates physically (frozen tears) and conceptually (she accepts Kepler’s death as price). Under Accumulative lens, the final aurora ribbon equals a cadence shift that locks her into thermal music.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can Silas find rest by giving rest—signals early and escalates via each impossible pressure increase (depth, Sleepless Librarians, centuries of unread finales). Agency remains his: he decides to descend, decides to treat books as corpses, decides to stay. The visible price is forfeiture of surface life and acceptance of perpetual under-librarian vigil; final image reweights “rest” from personal need to civilizational service. One meaningful tightening suffices; lens-as-diving-bell mechanic pays off causally.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—community survival via dignity—is signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is textural: each midnight thickens reciprocity until officials find “no desperate chaos.” Visible price is Marta’s exhaustion; tactical shift occurs when she realizes she “no longer needed to make most of the runs.” Agency remains hers throughout, even in renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—will Mae relinquish her hoarded loneliness to feed the world’s orphaned loves?—is clear early and tightens when the tear on the lens makes retreat impossible. One meaningful deepening occurs: giving, not taking, redefines her art. Agency is present yet partly delegated; the ghost’s directive narrows options more than Mae’s own experimentation. Price is felt (her archive vanishes), but because the ghost voices the moral calculus, the escalation feels half-external.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—gain direct contact with time’s texture—threads every beat; each photograph fade tightens the noose of retrocognitive overload. Escalation is textural: colors bleed, bridges knot, fragment warms, selves superpose; the intensification is visible and granular rather than causal-reversal. The price is legible: every absorbed memory erodes personal coherence until identity becomes porous moss. Agency remains hers—she chooses to walk, to hold, to release—so pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—living seed sovereignty versus synthetic dependence—tightens once: the decoded coordinates concretize abstract hope into a route that can be walked. Marcus’s agency is absolute; luck merely complicates (the arrow’s arrival) but does not resolve. Cost is visible: years of filing, the snapped link, the carnival banner now a seed-sack. The cap keeps just below 8.8 because the Authority’s threat stays off-page; pressure is conceptual rather than viscerally re-embodied at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—hear the frequency of betrayal—tightens once: when the forge imprints absence, options narrow to either vengeance or acceptance. Agency is intellectual (design, imprint) not physical risk, but the cost is legible: device gains irreversible weight of collective loss. No reversals, yet the single deepening suffices under Accumulative lens. Could edge higher if a live external pressure (e.g., hull breach) forced the final listen.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: client’s need to see daughter’s truth vs. Cassia’s need to deliver it without breaking mother further. Pressure escalates through single deepening: golden glamour stripped, revealing departure intent; mother’s sob pays visible emotional cost. No external reversals, but micro-turn suffices under accumulative lens. Stakes remain personal, visceral. Agency rests in Cassia’s decision to exit, leaving mother with unretractable image. Tactic altered: she places next flower code, foreclosing rest.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—crafting containers for unasked questions in a poisoned zone—is signaled early; escalation is accumulative: each sphere laid on a dead console increases the density of fragile testimony. The arrival of the couple tightens the pattern into shared risk; the torch’s flame becomes the last light in the exclusion zone, forcing Marina to externalize her art. Cost is visible: she forfeits ownership of her questions, inviting strangers to seed the reactor with their fears.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—owning identity vs. engineered fear—tightens when Marcus realises the phobias are leash, not flaw. One meaningful escalation: the resonance reversal that turns safeguard into weapon, paid with Jake’s instant vertigo. Cost is visible (Jake cringing on floor), altering power balance. Stakes never drift abstract; each new formula on the cast increments the same question: who controls the body.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: vulnerability weaponised is still vulnerability, just aimed elsewhere. The shell’s re-merger reweights “broken” into “whole yet dangerous,” avoiding moralising. No late thesis statements; final image of Marcus walking out under stars lets reader feel the new solitude. Subtext in Jake’s regard for stunt doubles as “poetic expendables” bites harder than any narrator lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—find origin of thoughts—is signaled in paragraph 2 and deepens when temporal perception reveals the pause-between-strokes as the crucible. Escalation is textural: each loop adds density until the silence between mop passes becomes unbearably loud. One meaningful tightening at violin touch: nine timelines collapse into playable whisper, foreclosing separate escape paths. Cost is felt—the violin’s disappearance leaves him with only the endless floor.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“finish her unfinished note”—is signaled early and tightens through each revealed staff line; the price is legible: Marcus risks drowning and institutional scorn. Agency is continuous: he returns nightly, memorizes, then plays. The escalation is accumulative rather than causal-reversal, but the final harmonic that sustains after bow leaves string is a visible cost that narrows future options—he can never again hear silence here as empty.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—protect the flowers’ existence vs. official disclosure—signaled early. One meaningful deepening: realizing prior keeper also hid drawings, tightening her solitary complicity. Cost is felt: she forfeits official record, accepts perpetual marginal life. Escalation is accumulative: each discovered illustration raises the price of silence.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—finding the truth behind the accident—rounds into a moral choice: possess or witness. Escalation is textural: each caller thickens the communal guilt until the valve’s physical presence forces a decision. Agency is real but low-heat; Marcus’s micro-choice (photograph vs. remove) narrows options with symbolic, not bodily, cost. Tightening is singular; no second reversal. Sufficient for this length, but a sharper physical jeopardy or social consequence could have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“to witness without judgment”—is declared early, never seriously tested. Pressure deepens imagistically (library grows wilder, words sporulate) but keeper’s tactics unchanged; no reversal or resource loss. Agency is observational; cost is diffuse. Escalation is atmospheric, not tactical; meets accumulative criterion yet lacks visceral trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserve stories vs. succumb to existential drift—signaled early. Single tightening: tapestry-dragons + child’s tilted drawing collapse into axis knowledge, narrowing her options to lifelong tending. Cost is the eternal solitude implied in “descended back into the bronze quiet.” Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens; no reversals needed.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—whether Chen will keep scripting others or step into his own prophecy—tightens when he pens “The composer becomes his own music.” Agency drives escalation: each fortune he plants narrows future options for the entire island. No coincidence resolves; instead, his deliberate self-fortune forecloses continued anonymity. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable in the blank slips left behind.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes—“possession will complete in seventeen minutes”—create a ticking clock, but the countdown is background ambience rather than a live constraint that forces tactical changes. Escalation is textural: each new loop layer deepens the stakes by revealing assumption as habit; the cost is legible but soft.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—compose the unheard symphony before exhaustion collapses her temporal perch—is signaled early. Escalation is accretive: each fortune slip laid tightens spiral, mirror horizon folds, options narrow to one final gesture. Cost is visible in dawn that “hurt to perceive” and arms that must lift despite frost creeping through bones. Could reach 8.8 if a tangible external loss (e.g., shell cracks) accompanied the crescendo.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—singular self vs. infinite possibility—announced in paragraph 2 and escalates via procedural bridge iterations that literally narrow her walking options. Each viaduct rebuild is a tightening under Accumulative lens: density increases, timelines collapse inward, cost becomes visceral (fragmenting consciousness). Agency resides in pressing the feared rune; that act materially forecloses omniscient dispersion. Escalation is steady rather than spiky; one meaningful deepening suffices for 750-word span.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—defeat emotional numbness—signaled in first paragraph and tightened when she feels “the thawing” via bone conduction. One meaningful escalation: playback switches from futile to efficacious the instant needle’s fracture creates the “filament of hush.” Cost is legible: needle wears further, acknowledging that future sessions will eventually erase the filament itself. No coincidence; all pressure sourced from her engineered reversal and the cavern’s acoustic affordance.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve meteorological truth against authoritarian erasure—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when the second note confirms her data is weaponized. One meaningful deepening: realization that storms are being seeded converts her abstract vigilance into active complicity; the reply she drafts is the visible price that forecloses neutrality. Escalation is causal under the lens, no coincidence required.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“will she inhale the extinct memory and survive its cost?”—is signaled when the vial trembles. Escalation is accumulative: each ghost-scent tightens the noose of grief until the only remaining option is surrender to transformation. Price is visible on the page: the vial empties, her tears become the new medium, she forfeits normal human olfaction for archival duty. The final beat narrows options irrevocably—she cannot sell lanterns the old way again.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—can Marcus bear the full texture of time without moral simplification—signals early and tightens with each layer. Agency is accumulative: his command “Pattern it forward” is the single micro-turn that widens, not narrows, options, yet the cost intensifies as knowledge burrows inward. The final renunciation—setting the rope back—pays an unmistakable price: he forfeits certainty for continuance. Energy beings complicate but do not resolve, keeping pressure coherent under the Textural lens.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
    <comment>Theme emerges inexorably from the rope’s genealogy: every mercy breeds new guilt, every silence spawns fresh poetry. No thesis is stated; the grotto’s singing clay and starlight reconfigure meaning without moral. The final image—“accumulated weight of every heart that had ever broken itself trying to choose correctly”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights all prior layers. Complexity is embraced: Thomas’s forty-year atonement remains as morally lumpy as Samuel’s escape.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reclaim sound from silence—tightens once: the first tentative note widens into communal unfinished symphony, foreclosing pristine restoration. Costs are dramatized: damaged reeds, salvaged strings, ash still drifting; these losses shape the acceptably flawed result. Agency is hers; coincidence merely gathers listeners drawn by sound they did not expect. Escalation is Accumulative: density of damaged instruments and incomplete phrases reweights the stake rather than multiplying plot turns.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: can Vera harvest without succumbing to the emotions she brokers? Pressure escalates as the grotto’s permeability narrows to a one-minute window, forcing the final choice. Cost is visible: she forfeits the intoxicating completeness of feeling she’s just tasted. Agency is internal—renunciation—but the static snap on her fingertips makes the price tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—Margot’s unacknowledged hunger for connection—signaled late, almost subtextual. Pressure tightens once: the mistaken address forces a single decision (detour). No visible price paid: cargo delay is off-stage, money unmentioned, social risk zero. Escalation is gentle, more accumulative than causal; luck (wrong envelope) drives rather than complicates. Closure reweights meaning, not options—eligible for Resonant Reconfiguration, but on-page cost is conceptual, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—community inclusion of the forgotten artist—tightens once: the tag-path discovery forces the village to confront its own erasure. Pressure is coherent but single-arc; no resource is lost, no option foreclosed beyond the moral acknowledgment. Sufficient for length, yet lacks a visceral price that would lift it to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—free trapped extinctions vs keep city running—signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened when Marina chooses to complete rather than perpetuate the theft. One meaningful turn: the dive into the chamber irrevocably forecloses her complicity. Cost legible: pendant cracks, city loses borrowed minutes, her illustrations transform from frozen to finished. Escalation causal, not coincidental; no abstract world-saving inflation.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“can she recover Elias?”—tightens when glass eyes reveal he is already present as math; option to extract him is foreclosed. Price paid: she abandons the eyes, accepting translucent mentorship. Escalation is textural intensification of fungal light-rings; agency is placement decision that triggers revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.3)
    One meaningful tightening suffices: the archivist’s spoken recognition collapses Edgar’s sole option of total invisibility, trading it for partial collaboration. Cost is legible—he forfeits absolute anonymity yet gains shared guardianship. Pressure escalates through accumulating gifts rather than external antagonism, coherent with Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“understand by becoming”—is signaled early and tightens when the leaf dissolves into flesh, foreclosing the safe-observer option. Escalation is accumulative: each plant anomaly raises the cost of continued detachment. Price is visible (green nails, root-veins) but the final beat could sharpen the physical forfeiture instead of stating it.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—access to pre-war water that can “paint truth”—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens when the tide clock starts. Single meaningful deepening occurs at simultaneous exchange: both women relinquish their last comfort, foreclosing retreat. Agency sits with Mara: she chooses to taste, sealing her commitment to burn the water for art. Price is visible and persistent—once tasted, the jar can only diminish; this constraint shapes every future brush-stroke.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—will she regain usable vision and at what price—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when the pearl dissolves, foreclosing return to old clairvoyance. Agency is her decision to inhabit shadows rather than master them; the cost is the permanent loss of future-sight, legible in the luminescent stain. Escalation under Accumulative lens: each mineral note adds perceptual density until the only option left is to expand into the present moment. No coincidence; the pilgrim’s earlier passage is revealed as precedent, not rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—turning fragments into communal meaning—surfaces early; pressure escalates through accumulating donations and Kessa’s mounting curatorial responsibility. No external antagonist; tension is textural: each new fragment risks overwhelming pattern. The valve’s ghost-click marks the single tightening beat, signalling acceptance of incomplete restoration. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, sufficient for 600-word scale but not foregrounded enough for 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—whether Elena will embrace or reject the tower’s mystical heritage—tightens once: whale-math correlation nudges her into active transcription. Agency is present (she climbs, writes, rewrites) but escalation is tonal/density-based, not option-narrowing; cost is conceptual rather than tangible. Meets accumulative standard but lacks a visible forfeiture that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—escape immortal stagnation—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the amulet’s hum promises “dimensional rifts.” The midpoint deepening occurs when Vex realizes the mutiny’s true aim is transformation, not mere rebellion, forcing her to choose complicity over detachment. Persistent constraint: the need for solar-storm cover gives the mutineers a narrow window, visibly raising time-pressure. Cost is legible—Vex forfeits eternal sanctuary the instant she steps through the door.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—how to settle an unpayable ancestral debt—tightens when Maya reveals the pot holds ashes, forcing Wei into a binary: reject or accept composite restitution. Escalation is one deepening rather than multiple turns, sufficient for this length; the price (Maya forfeits relic and money, Wei forfeits revenge script) is on-page. Coincidence is absent; pressure stays coherent under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering erased time—signals early and tightens through sensory micro-shifts: hum strengthens, temperature drops, dawn thins the boundary. No antagonist is needed; the pressure is epistemic and atmospheric. One meaningful deepening occurs when the monk appears, wordlessly validating her forbidden archive, narrowing her solitude into shared complicity. Cost is felt in cramped fingers and the weight of unspoken risk, though not yet personal consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will Mari remain alone in erasure or risk collective witness—tightens when she reads the wet ink injunction and must decide: add her trace or retreat. Signing forecloses any future claim to legal identity; cost is legible. Pressure escalates through accumulation of marginalia voices rather than causal reversals, coherent with chosen lens. One decisive turn meets scope.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—can regret be given acoustic form?—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: Marina’s empirical filter collapses when the cello answers the shell, foreclosing her exit strategy. The tightening is single but decisive, and the cost (she stays to finish the instrument) is legible. Meets the 7.2+ threshold yet lacks a second, higher-octane trade-off that would push into 8.8+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are sharp and early: last free-floating sanctuary vs. “Deep Pockets Diving Soon.” Escalation is present—developers photograph, community pivots to heritage status—but the tightening beat is summarized rather than dramatized (no scene of first rejection, no lawyer laughing at their folk-art bylaws). The price is mostly prospective: they forfeit anonymity and invite inspection, but the reader feels future risk more than immediate loss. Still, the graffiti code itself is a credible, low-tech weapon that narrows options; the shift from passive warning to active legal incorporation is a meaningful because/therefore turn.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    A single dominant stake—preserve the last evidence of lunar water—tightens once: the chemical timer is started, the rocket incoming, the ice wisp finite. Agency is observational endurance rather than overt confrontation; nevertheless the choice to remain, mix the emulsion, and descend alone forecloses retreat and carries visible opportunity cost (her own evacuation). The escalation is modest but sufficient for the lyrical mode; a second reversal would feel forced.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: ship blind without drone; signaled early. Escalation is causal and single: 20-minute announcement compresses time to one decisive patch. Cost is visible—Maya’s cut finger tremor on membrane, audible loss of drone hum into fog. No reversal, but knowledge deepening (she decodes the ship’s path yet stays behind) satisfies lens.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are communal survival, signaled early; escalation is the gradual re-humming of stones and bells. Because the magic is cooperative, no individual faces a narrowing choice or personal loss; pressure is diffuse, pleasant, but never acute. The final cost is off-stage apocalypse elsewhere—felt, yet not paid by any on-page agent.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—breathe vs. become—tightens with each droplet countdown. Escalation is textural: every memory-vision raises the cost of surfacing until the only narrowing option is surrender. Agency visible in recorder activation and final inhale. Could reach 8.8 if a tangible external obstacle (equipment failure, pressure injury) had compounded the clock.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—clear father’s name before boat arrives—signals early and tightens with each scuff widened. Escalation causal: open door → access journals → reach lattice → confess under clock. One visible price: once testimony is carved, Marcus cannot retract; the lighthouse will display bones and words together. Agency is crystallized in the carving gesture; luck never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—whether the ghost can repay the debt—signals early and tightens once: bead’s accelerating pulse = barrier thinning. Escalation is atmospheric rather than tactical; Marlow’s agency is largely receptive (he watches, remembers, weeps) so the visible price is paid by the orchard, not his choices. Still, the final dawn is irreversible and forecloses eternal-night protection, giving a felt cost under causal lens. One beat short: if Marlow had to decide whether to crush the bead himself, the trade-off would sharpen 8.8+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can the broken world be re-stitched—signals early and tightens via each night’s new overlap narrowing her allowed thread-routes. Agency is rhythmic attention rather than explosive act: she forfeits sleep and safety to sew, a visible price (“drowsiness claimed her again”). The final tightening is the plate’s children escaping onto stone, foreclosing return to the old stories. Cost is legible but not viscerally new in the last beat, holding it shy of 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—returnee’s readiness to measure days not years—is signaled early via dreams and tightened when the gnomon is fitted. One meaningful deepening: the sundial reveals names instead of numbers, forcing her from observer to keeper. Agency is present—she clears soil, positions gnomon, kneels to map—each act forfeits the next train out. Cost is conceptual but legible: eternal accountability to ancestor-time. No coincidence resolves; pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens until stance crystallizes.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of departure-as-return; the orchard literalizes that death nourishes the living. No character moralizes; the inscription’s aphorism is grandmother-ghost, not author-voice. Subtext lives in gesture—Yakov’s careful steps show trust in new paths; Miriam’s kneeling accepts root-embrace as covenant. Final image reweights earlier “interrupted journeys” as necessary spirals, offering resonant ambiguity: is she freed or bound? Complexity is honored; no tidy redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.7)
    The dominant stake—delivering authentic identity via delayed mail—tightens once: the approaching 3-hour deadline plus impending rain forces the decisive act of photographing the code. Pressure is textural, not causal; options narrow from “chalk exists” to “chalk will vanish” so the photo becomes the irrevocable preservation. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: Mira trades her own traceability for her client’s anonymity. Agency is present yet quiet; a second, sharper beat would have pushed this into 8+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent the coup—ripens invisibly; each embroidered star forecloses a regime route. Escalation is accumulative: every new conspirator snippet tightens the chart until overlay becomes coup-busting constellation. Visible price: her pricked blood literally marks the primary target, trading flesh for intel. Agency is attention—her sustained, mocked listening is the offensive move that reweights power.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—will she speak the apology before moonlight ends?—is signaled by line 4. Escalation is textural: each condensation window sharpens the cost of silence. The final tightening comes when she realizes the message must travel via dream, not hand; the price is surrendering control of reception.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to turn private survival into shared language—tightens once: from decrypting cast to communal graffiti. Agency is present-tense: Maya’s decision to draw the bridge-logo directly enlarges the child’s options and forecloses her own anonymity. Cost is visible: phantom pain spikes as she writes, linking bodily damage to symbolic labor. Escalation is single-ply but sufficient for 700-word scale; coincidence plays no role.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—restore district’s joy—signaled early. Escalation via knowledge-network surge that turns passive vision into active obligation; cost is knowledge that the mural will fade. Agency: she chooses to display, then to continue tomorrow, accepting ephemerality. No external antagonist; internal conflict (despair vs hope) tightens once. Coincidence absent; escalation coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—certainty vs. curiosity—is signaled when Marcus calls the coin “the key,” then escalates as the walls start answering unasked questions. The decisive tightening occurs when Elena realizes she has lived this beat before; instead of solving the loop she deepens it by choosing to preserve mystery, paying the visible price of never knowing. Agency is entirely hers: coin flip, brush seal, and laughter drive the sonic transformation. Cost is legible: she forfeits the interpretive security her methodical self craves, embracing an endless return.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—keep the seed-message network alive—tightens when Auditor squad triangulates the greenhouse; Marcus’s insect gambit is the decisive escalation that narrows options to “guard at personal cost.” Agency is present; coincidence (Auditor arrival) complicates but does not resolve. Cost is the imminent raid and possible capture. One clear tightening is sufficient at this length; escalation is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—transform pain into nutrients—tightens via accretion: each newcomer adds shrapnel-tears to the greenhouse until the shell glows with “reconciliations that glowed in the dark.” No external antagonist, but the armistice’s credibility is tested by centuries of arrivals; the price is the postcard’s dissolution and the poet’s perpetual sleepless vigil. A single meaningful deepening, not a reversal, reweights the stake with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—capture the vanishing name—tightens once: the widening crack converts routine ritual into urgent salvage. Pressure stays coherent under accumulative lens; each repetition of “Solmieth” layers urgency rather than looping. Cost is visible: tool destroyed (bamboo snaps), path foreclosed (song gone except in glass). No reversals needed; single meaningful deepening suffices for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—prevent war via translation—signaled early and tightens when mistranslation knot is revealed. One intensification: ink glow confirms accuracy, raising stakes from academic to existential. Cost visible: seven nights’ exhaustion, risk of mis-translation worsening conflict. No reversal, but agency is continuous decipherment; coincidence complicates only, never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can reconciliation outlive its anonymous architect?—is signaled early. Single meaningful tightening occurs when Mara decides to conceal authorship, narrowing her future to invisible service; price is her erased legacy. Agency remains hers throughout; no coincidence. Cost is legible in the final image as she kisses and pockets the chain, accepting anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can she trust herself to handle evidence again—tightens when her own wartime letter resurfaces, foreclosing anonymity with felt reputational cost. Escalation is accumulative: each preserved tear stain or omitted clipping incrementally reweights the risk of being known. No external antagonist, but internal pressure coheres; the final reversal is coincidental (Theodore’s possession) yet complicates rather than solves, forcing stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—find why the maze feels sacred—tightens when the center’s temperature differential is revealed, foreclosing the option to leave. Cost is conceptual (the ache of presence/absence) rather than visceral; escalation is textural density, not causal narrowing, so high-but-not-elite band.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: belonging vs mastery—early signaled when Mira chooses “wait, watch” over spectrometers. Escalation via luminous respite: each intensification of glow narrows her options until only witnessing remains. Cost legible: city’s darkening is permanent forfeiture of full understanding. Agency is attentional—her shared exhale is the micro-choice that seals renunciation; no coincidence, all city-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake—“why do paths disappear?”—is declared early but never tightens; no option is foreclosed or price paid on-page. Pressure is atmospheric (cave dims, day wanes) rather than tactical. Escalation is a density accrual of fragments, not a narrowing of choices. Closure reweights meaning, not stakes, so the mild stasis fits the accumulative lens but caps the score.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—prove creativity can defeat monotony—tightens through three calibrated audience cycles; the teen’s guitar-pick tribute is the visible price that forecloses the “just coins” path. Escalation is accumulative: each set adds risk of empty case yet widens meaning to non-currency exchange. No explicit loss of money/time, but the midnight deadline and rosin weariness supply felt cost. Slight deduction for abstract “monotony” never being particularized beyond posture.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—immortalise memory before capture—signaled in paragraph 2. One deepening: speck → nebula across her arms, foreclosing anonymity; visible price = body, freedom. Agency pure; no coincidence resolves. Council threat stays off-page, so pressure, though coherent, edges abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserve perceptual legacy vs. corporate erasure—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the letter is recalled. One meaningful deepening: concentric interference nodes become the method to “document” and teach, foreclosing passive mourning. Cost is legible in the decision to photograph rather than chain himself to the glass. Escalation is density-driven under Accumulative lens; no reversal is required, only the reconfiguration of loss into transmission.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to convert private survivor-guilt into teachable protection—signals early with the box hand-off. One meaningful tightening: the moment he opens the box and sees the graduation photo, the option to stay privately broken is foreclosed; recording the message becomes the only non-coward path. Cost is visible—he will now stand before rookies exposing his worst failure. Under accumulative lens, the celestial conjunction acts as clock and looming mirror, deepening rather than reversing; no coincidence rescues him.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—“map the thin places and reach grandmother”—is signaled early; pressure escalates via each tide-borne fragment and lantern launch. The meaningfully tightening moment is the forty-ninth lantern spiral that lets her glimpse grandmother; the cost is oblique (she gives up single-timeline life) but landed conceptually at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is preservation of human acoustic memory against green erasure; pressure tightens when she realizes Voss already started the work and the ivy is absolute. One meaningful escalation: discovery that walls themselves are “a library” forces her to switch from solitary cartography to becoming curator-collaborator with the dead; the turn costs immediacy—she spends “hours” extracting echoes, accepting perpetual isolation. No coincidence resolves; the strip leads, but never hands her an easy win. Cost (endless solitude) is legible in the final sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—mother re-opening dream-path to comatose daughter—signaled in paragraph two. One meaningful tightening: bells stay silent because she painted that possibility, forcing the final hush that lets Sophia respond. Cost is felt time-pressure—city waking, canvas unfinished—and conceptual—if mirrors can refuse to reflect, reality itself is negotiable. Agency remains hers; coincidence (sparrow) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is stopping inherited hatred; the meaningful tightening occurs when Mara abandons the grievance-recitation ritual and instead exposes the clipboard’s red constellation of pride, forcing delegates to recognize personal names in the failures. This narrows options—no retreat to old script—and escalates social cost: admitting they’ve become what they fought against. Agency is hers; coincidence plays no role. The price is legible on-page: relinquishing hero narrative and accepting “not heroes, just breathing,” which reweights the entire 300-year stalemate under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—liberate the suppressed dissents and claim self-authorship—signaled in paragraph two and deepens with every harvested echo. Pressure escalates by texture: each thread-crack widens the possible until the single option remaining is total release. No external antagonist needed; the antagonist is the architecture of compliance she unknits. Cost is legible: the empty sanctuary at dawn is a social bomb that will erase her former identity. One meaningful tightening—final thread—pays off under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—how to tell trauma without becoming another voice of violence—is signaled early and tightens when Marcus chooses the backwards puppet show as ethical answer. Pressure escalates via pattern deepening: each return of stick, echo, or meteor hush adds weight to the same question rather than inventing new obstacles. The tightening is single but meaningful: the rehearsal of tomorrow’s show forecloses the collaborators’ accusatory path and stakes Marcus’s reputation among the dive-bar audience. Cost is conceptual (owning the exploiter label) rather than visceral, capping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single dominant stake: transmit erased history before species and memory vanish. Escalation is textural: each knot tightens meaning-to-material ratio while accelerating decay; tightening = shortening lifespan. No reversal, but the deepening is irreversible—once the monarch departs, the archive is airborne and the grotto begins erasing evidence. Cost is legible: her structures are “already dissolving” as she walks downhill, options shrinking in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—can she redeem her failure to preserve sound—is signaled by paragraph two and tightens through each re-braiding beat. One meaningful deepening: the punched card reveals her own ancestral name, flipping preservation from abstract duty to intimate legacy. Cost is visible—she weeps frozen tears, forfeits wax nostalgia for bronze fragility—under Accumulative lens. No false escalation; coincidence (finding the card) complicates rather than saves.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“why am I walking this path?”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the crown reveals she’s remembering, not predicting. The tightening forecloses the illusion of choice; cost is visceral in the drowning stair-climb and the laugh that mixes beauty with bitterness. No coincidence; every escalation is driven by her decision to seat the crown, which pays the loop’s price. One meaningful intensification suffices, and it lands.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—complete the beacon before regime collapse or personal starvation—tightens once: the tile’s warmth signals the final alignment window. Cost is visible on page: decades of barley diet, satchel wear, the knowledge that one missed planetary angle would abort everything. Agency drives every escalation; no coincidence resolves. A sharper intermediate obstacle (tools failing, body faltering) could have raised the upper band.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can inherited rage be released before it kills the child? Tightening occurs when Magistrate’s touch rewires his own memory—option to stay angry foreclosed by visceral felt cost (son’s fever breaks only if father lets go). Agency is Marcus’s scheme executed through surrender rather than force. Coincidence absent; all pressure internal. Price legible: Magistrate weeps soundlessly, armor now irrelevant—tactics altered.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“can a lost vision be reclaimed?”—tightens when synchronized breathing collapses distance between maker and seeker, forcing Elara to surrender her mirror. The price (her mirror, his unfinished quest) is legible on the page, meeting the lens-specific escalation test.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—save the quartz eyes or let the guild’s legacy die—is signaled early and tightens once: refusal → acceptance after witnessing decay. The reversal is protagonist-driven, cost visible in the symbolic surrender of the vow. Pressure is coherent under causal lens; no coincidence rescues. Could escalate further if a single eye shattered during mending to raise stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—will she write the message she already found?—tightens via recursive inevitability rather than external opposition. One meaningful deepening: the blank shell becomes a stylus for her own future carving, narrowing options to acceptance. Cost is conceptual (eternal self-inheritance) rather than visceral; felt price is legible but not punishing, holding the score just below the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes—“reach the library or join the amber museum”—are legible early and tighten through each sealed loop. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient: the self-referential room forces pattern recognition, then the amber gallery presents mortal cost. Agency resides in the linguistic offer; mountain’s acceptance forecloses hoarding and opens dissemination. Cost is conceptual rather than personal, limiting top-band punch.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.7)
    The dominant stake—prove an erased twin existed—tightens when the carousel offers to absorb the emerald card as another forgotten name; this narrows Marina to a binary that carries lifelong epistemic cost. Pressure is accumulative/textural: each salt-rotted prop is a memento mori of memory, and the fog literally alters her recall, re-weighting the price of refusal. Agency is present but once-removed; Coraline articulates the trade-off while Marina’s yes/no is internal, slightly dampening the visceral punch required for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.5)
    Single stake—decode the seal before the thirteenth chime traps her—tightens as each braid narrows escape options. Agency is continuous (she reconfigures, presses wax, steps through), but the price is soft: no concrete forfeiture is dramatized, only the abstract risk of “merged space”; escalation is atmospheric, not tactical, keeping pressure vivid yet bloodless.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve the caves’ acoustic balance—surfaces early and tightens when cracks spread. Single meaningful turn: extraction of silence reframes the invasion from threat to confluence. Cost is legible in her aching joints and the lifetime cartographic labor implied; no higher because the beings’ agency remains off-stage—they modulate but never choose, so the external pressure feels ambient rather than reciprocal.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prove coincidences are conspiracies of light—tightens when the shard offers sideways vision, forcing a choice: persist in polishing absence or risk rekindling. Escalation is causal: each alignment of prism + silence narrows options until the only path is anti-light. Visible price: seventeen years of custodial life, condensed into one irreversible beacon inversion. Coincidence (shard landing on chart coordinates) complicates but does not resolve; resolution comes from her deliberate rotation of prism to unmapped darkness.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—will they retain a human identity?—is signalled early and tightens once: the realisation that they must conjecture rather than recover. That single deepening is sufficient for lyric-accumulative drive, but it arrives late (≈70 % mark) and costs are conceptual rather than visceral. No option is foreclosed on-page except the abstract loss of an “authentic” past, so the price is felt but not dramatised through a lost object or relationship. Pressure is coherent; a second micro-turn would have pushed the score higher.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—can wonder be self-ignited when nature quits?—is signaled in paragraph 3. Stakes tighten once: the decision to shred irreplaceable fortress tiles for pigment burns their literal history into the rockets, narrowing future options. Agency is collective but Kaia-led; cost is dramatized in the long flare that consumes both fuel and their last easy escape into darkness. Escalation is modest yet sufficient; the final display’s duration is the visible price, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—can Chen re-enter live chronicling—surfaces early. Pressure escalates through accretion of transition examples; the plankton wave provides a single tightening beat that reframes silence as invitation. Mira’s agency is observational, not manipulative; cost is Chen’s admitted fear rather than her concrete loss, capping intensity just above 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“capture a different flavor of quiet”—tightens once: inversion opens the harvest window, then narrows as gravity re-asserts. Agency sits entirely with Mira: she chooses to fill vials, dances, decides to bring one to father; luck only complicates. Cost is dramatized: porcelain fracture is irreversible, satchel weight literal, father’s bunker path foregone. One meaningful turn sufficient; could edge higher if a mid-inversion obstacle forced a trade-off beyond time.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes—deliver silence that comforts rather than attacks—are declared early and tightened through each acoustic pocket; passenger’s shallow breathing supplies live feedback. One meaningful deepening occurs at Mirror Gallery where delayed echo reframes prior fear into lullaby. Cost is present but gentle: Marcus exposes his own past vulnerability; passenger risks trusting a stranger’s sound-craft. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal-reversal, fitting the lyric design.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—will she claim the throne?—is signaled in paragraph one and deepened into a conceptual paradox rather than escalated through external obstruction. The single tightening occurs when ultraviolet text reveals the throne is unclaimable by design, forcing renunciation; cost is the dissolved ruby flake, absorbed into collective memory. Under Accumulative lens, density of layers (paint → data → song) reweights the stake acceptably; no causal reversal required. Pressure is coherent but intellectual—no tangible peril—so escalation feels muted yet sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—can the keeper transmit “emptiness” without relapse into self-annihilation—tightens when the fresh-scarred shadow refuses retreat. Escalation is textural: each healed shadow graduates to the far wall, narrowing her isolation and proving the method, while “tomorrow another shadow” raises the inexorable cost. Price is felt in the ring’s heat and the star’s indifferent witness, meeting the 8-plus gate.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—transmute failure into value—signals early and tightens through each glitch message; the final bolt-turn narrows options to zero except ascent. Cost is visible: she pays with her survivor identity, now crystallized into literal glowing diamonds. Escalation is accumulative/textural: each promise-spore increases density until the pattern break of counter-clockwise turn. Luck complicates (messages) but does not resolve, satisfying lens.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—liberation from omniscient curse—tightens through each standing-wave reveal, narrowing options: master the gift or forsake it. Agency fuels escalation: Victoria’s hand turns the crank, lifts the needle, hurls the handle—each act increases the visceral cost of knowledge until silence becomes the only path. No external coincidence; internal pressure alone forces the decisive renunciation. Cost is visible: shards on the carpet, mockingbird song now opaque.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from image pattern: sound vs. silence, gold vs. glass-shard risk—no explicit thesis. The final inability to decode the bird reprises the “eloquently silent” premise with reversed valence, a Conceptual Repricing that invites reflection on the ethics of knowing. Subtext resides in gesture (crank hurled, not explained). avoids moralizing; complexity lingers in the cost of ignorance she now bears.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—possibility vs. human form—signals early via “pages… demanded he remember language.” Escalation is accumulative: each tree he passes whispers new formulae, tightening the lure; the oath beat narrows choice to speak or remain exiled; taking the puppet’s hand severs the last human option. Cost is visible—armor dissolves, blood seeds new trees—and forecloses return; the illumination that floods in is “of unmade things,” a lived price, not abstract victory.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—magnifying small kindnesses—tightens when Marcus discovers Walsh’s marginal note; the choice to index rather than pursue his own file narrows options with visible forfeiture. Escalation is textural: each artifact (button, penciled “tries so hard”) adds density until renunciation feels inevitable. No coincidence; pressure coheres under accumulative lens. Cost is felt in the final “leaving the dust to resettle,” a quiet stasis that forecloses tonight’s self-search.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prove erased public communication once existed—tightens when she trades the senior cell’s safety for archival exposure, a visible forfeit. Escalation is informational rather than explosive: each recovered box narrows Ministry’s future lie-space. Upload act is irreversible, conceptual cost legible. Agency drives every pivot; coincidence only alerts, never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—keep prophecy comatose—tightens once: solitary near-playing → collective silence, narrowing options from performance to permanent restraint. Cost is felt: musicians forfeit futures (audiences never gathered) and accept “permanent silence,” a professional/social forfeiture legible on page. Agency sits with Marcus’s instruction whisper and the group’s sustained non-action; no coincidence resolves. The escalation is singular but sufficient for lyric/accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will Mira heed duty or follow the illicit moonstone call—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when leaf-letters form warnings that only her cairns can answer. One meaningful deepening occurs: the moment she “laughed, and moss began growing,” a visible price that reweights her prior sorting ritual. Escalation is textural rather than causal-reversal, but under the Accumulative lens the density of leaf-letters + moonstone + moss fractals suffices. Cost is on-page (irreversible somatic change), though a second beat of external resistance would have pushed it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—will Marcus keep trying to fix or accept imperfection—is signaled in paragraph one. Pressure tightens through the pattern of failed repairs → seven more clocks ticking → greenhouse epiphany; each step visually narrows his options. Agency is present at each beat: he chooses suspension, mapping, renunciation. The cost is conceptual (loss of repair identity) rather than visceral, keeping the score just shy of 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—Mira’s fear that her name dooms her—tightens once when the coin cracks and reforms under Vera’s reagent; knowledge, not external danger, escalates. Agency is Vera’s pour and Mira’s decision to keep the fractured coin; the price is the irreversible visibility of the break. Under Accumulative lens, density of light imagery (mercury drops, starlight vial, dawn) intensifies identity stakes without external reversals. Coincidence is absent; escalation is modest but sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—free Thomas via confession—signals early. Single meaningful tightening: Mara’s invitation to “play it wrong” forces Thomas to trade shame for acceptance, visible when his form dissolves. Cost is paid by Thomas (existence) rather than Mara, keeping the 8-band ceiling. Pressure accumulates acoustically under Accumulative/Textural lens; no causal reversals required.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can she convert measured pain into a mathematics of mercy—tightens once: the strap’s removal narrows options from survival-calculation to teaching. No external antagonist is needed; internal pressure escalates through sensory overload and the choice to approach the child. Cost is visible: the exact pull of 17 facial muscles now signals freedom, not flinch. Agency is present but single-turn; still sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—expose deadly corruption—signals early and tightens when each journal appears. Protagonist agency drives every gain: he pries the board, climbs the counter, decides to contact reporters. Cost is knowledge-plus-guilt; options narrow from private obsession to public risk. One meaningful escalation suffices; no reversal, but deepening satisfies accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—preserve perfect order vs. surrender to infinite compression—tightens exactly once when the black-labeled bottle forces the rupture, foreclosing the filing system forever. Escalation is accumulative: each frost transcription adds density until the silence implodes the library. Cost is legible in the physical dissolution of the orchard and Moth’s self-scattering, though the price is more conceptual than viscerally felt, holding the score in the low-8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is ownership of the Venusian archive; secondary is Cassia’s need to reinvent herself after defeat. Escalation is textural: each mention of visible time, the shard’s song, and the storm’s approach thickens the sense that something irreversible is approaching. The decisive tightening occurs when ghosts actually appear—Huang’s curiosity becomes a live option for Cassia to leverage. Cost is legible: she publicly commits to resurrect a civilization, staking her remaining credibility and guaranteeing future collision with the Institute.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—can one craftsman out-trick an empire of liars?—tightens when Vex’s armor begins to rust in real time, making the cost of dishonesty visceral. The reversal is Elias’s decision to share the light rather than hoard it, narrowing his options from solitary savior to universal catalyst. Escalation is coherent under causal lens: each lie accelerates decay, each truth-thread delays it. The price (Vex disintegrates) is visible, but the world-scale reversal feels slightly outsized for 750 words; a lingering personal injury would have grounded the win.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—access trans-dimensional petrichor—tightens once when the compass spins and the wall begins to shimmer, narrowing her options to stay or go. Agency is preserved: she chooses to sample first, preparing rather than fleeing, so the cost is deferred but felt (the warm vial). No antagonist is needed; the environment is the pressure engine. The refusal to pass through is a credible endurance that forecloses nothing cheaply—she trades immediate transcendence for knowledge, a visible price for a “sensibly eccentric” mind.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—access to timeless creative alliance—tightens when the slide’s glow forces her to carve or retreat. One meaningful deepening: the lantern’s projection of future seekers forecloses isolation as an option; she must gift the sculpture outward. Cost is the relinquished GPS certainty, legible in the engine’s first unmapped acceleration. No reversal, but the pattern’s intensification meets Accumulative/Textural escalation test.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—decode the postcards’ obsession—tightens once when Mara realizes they are instructions, not records; this deepening reweights her year of night-work as initiation rather than research, with the cost of stained fingers and missed daylight life. No external antagonist or reversal is needed under the accumulative lens. The price is visible but not irreversible, so the escalation is solid, not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—protect movement myth vs expose betrayals—tightens once: Amara must choose whether to transcribe ugly truth. Agency is decision, not combat; the arrangement of debris is the visible tactic that forecloses denial. Escalation is knowledge-based: each decoded name narrows her moral options until only full transcription remains. Cost is legible: “searing weight” and the infinite mirror that removes any refuge in selective history.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—restore hope without erasing struggle—is signaled early. Tightening occurs when he chooses molecular transfusion over shattering; that act forecloses the easy exit and costs bodily stamina. Pressure is accumulative: each memory strand saturates the town stone until the shimmer hums. No coincidence resolves; the final heartbeat is earned agency.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve emotional spectra of extinct languages—faces irreversible external pressure of encroaching flood. One meaningful tightening: prophecy confirms tower collapse and his own death-date, narrowing options to finishing the manuscript or fleeing; he chooses the former with on-page cost (night spent transcribing while water rises). No causal antagonist; situational pressure suffices. Coincidence (1889 cylinder names tonight) is complication, not resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—save villages—signaled by page 2; tightening occurs when anomaly readings clash with perfect visibility, forcing choice between data and intuition. Protagonist agency drives the turn: she pulls rope, then hits switch, layering warnings; cost is solitude during avalanche. No coincidence resolves; mountain’s shift complicates, her combined warnings save. One meaningful escalation sufficient; price legible.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake— legitimacy of obsolete devotion—tightens when the impossible star validates vulnerability. One meaningful deepening: star’s stillness reweights “discarded” to “chosen.” Agency is attention/renunciation rather than external action, consistent with Accumulative lens. Cost is legible in final glass-capture, though less visceral than high-band boundary.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving the unspoken covenant’s weight—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: midnight ghosts → dawn fade → Mara’s recognition that she alone must bear the box. Under the Accumulative lens, the warming glass and intensifying ghost gestures reweight the stake; cost is the lifelong sentence of “mute eloquence.” Agency is renunciation rather than action; the price is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes are signaled early—“he’d been searching for seventeen cycles”—and deepen when the fragment rewires his mission. Pressure is textural: each garage-sale ad tightens the conspiracy, but no forked choice narrows Marcus’s live options; he remains observer, not actor. Escalation is pattern-build rather than causal turn, coherent under the accumulative lens. A visible price (lost certainty, physical toll, social risk) never materializes on-page, capping the tension below the 8.0 band.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“find harmony in brokenness”—tightens once when the kite snaps; Mira’s agency to reframe the wreck as art narrows her option to remain merely an observer, but the cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping escalation just shy of high-band punch.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—translate or lose the council—tightens when each coil forecloses human resort blueprints. Escalation operates by accretion: every copper wrap increases density of meaning until the orchard shudders into new rhythm. Cost is legible: her life-span becomes the conduit, no other option remains.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Elena will accept that her life’s skepticism was pre-programmed—tightens once, when she realizes “we’re the experiment.” That moment is driven by her recognition, not by an action that forecloses an option, so the cost is conceptual rather than tactical. Pressure accumulates through pattern density (chemistry, footprints, brainwaves) rather than narrowing choices, fitting the Accumulative lens. A visible price is missing: she neither loses nor risks anything concrete, which caps the tension just below the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—will the shore accept amnesia through aggressive growth?—is signaled early and escalates by accretion: each pod species chosen to “digest metal” tightens the means of erasure. No reversal, but a deepening: gulls’ phosphorus news confirms the reef’s conversion to fertilizer, sharpening the cost of remembrance. Protagonist’s agency is deliberate scattering; the price paid is the certainty that human memory will be root-split and unreadable—felt as conceptual, not personal, loss.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—translate distance into reconnection—signals early via the girl’s whisper. Escalation occurs when the leaf’s chromatic veins physically rewrite the cylinder, foreclosing the option to ignore the call. Cost is visible: she abandons her sealed shipping-container den and the illusion of retirement. No antagonist needed; the pressure is the wasteland’s scale versus her failing senses.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: can Kira turn her curse into a navigational tool for the lost? Pressure tightens exactly once: when she realizes the compass + sketching can become a star-map that re-orients broken time. No reversals, but the deepening is decisive—she forfeits personal rescue to become the fixed point. Cost is visible: perpetual temporal solitude while others follow her map home.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—inherit or overturn her master’s legacy—emerges with the chessboard as crucible. One meaningful tightening: swapping pieces replaces certainty with doubt, foreclosing the “catalog the unknown” path. Cost is conceptual (loss of priceless knowledge) rather than visceral; still legible on page. Agency is present but single-beat; no external resistance after Keeper speaks, so pressure feels atmospheric more than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake: will she testify and re-enter the media crucible? Pressure tightens when the survivor arrives to “collect” her; she refuses, narrowing her future to perpetual witness in shadow. Cost is felt: she sacrifices legitimacy, embracing the “nomadic penumbra” forever. Escalation is accumulative—each spelled name layers acoustic evidence until silence itself becomes indictment; no coincidence, no reversal, just stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—recover buried talent vs. addiction to prophecy—tightens through sensory intensification rather than external opposition. The stone’s warmth and soil-sensations escalate pressure under Accumulative lens, forcing the decisive renunciation of mercury visions. Cost is visible: she forfeits her only means of future-seeing the moment she “press[es] the stone deep into the earth.” No reversal, but the single deepening suffices for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—signals early; pressure escalates through each decoded thread that rewrites the frozen game, tightening the moral cost of remaining trapped in guilt. The meaningful turn occurs when Kaspar sees his student’s potential face in the queen’s surface, swapping self-blame for pedagogical responsibility; this micro-turn is causal under the inferred lens. Cost is visible: he abandons the hope of undoing the past and accepts lifelong imperfection, paid in the copper offering and the decision to walk away.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—shatter the monopoly on truth—is signaled in paragraph one and escalates through each refracted poem. The tightening beat is the moment Kira speaks the first line into the tower; that live utterance forecloses stealth and ignites the acoustic contagion. Cost is visible: once the chamber remembers, erasure would require demolishing the tower—an undeniable social price. Agency remains hers; the off-page chorus is an extension, not a luck event.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“quilt meaning before the platform dissolves”—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is mechanical: each snapped cable halves remaining seconds, visibly priced on the page. Agency stays with Mira: she chooses to keep narrating rather than flee, foreclosing survival option. Cost is cumulative and legible: first tool splash, then tilt, then free-fall—final image shows the irreversible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—how to love impermanence—tightens once: the cave reveal redefines her lifelong quay ritual as the same practice. Agency is present; she chooses to walk past the harbor and later paints a new shell. Cost is conceptual but felt: she accepts perpetual solitude as the price of honoring transience. Coincidence (the wrong turn) complicates, does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: can purified love recall the dead without destroying either world? Pressure tightens exactly once: when Mara realizes Thomas’s protective guilt is the prison she must forgive, not fight. That revelation narrows her tactic from begging to self-exoneration, enabling the final merge. Cost is legible—Thomas’s permanent half-state—but the escalation is single-pulse; no further reversals or resource losses compound.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—shepherd the reverse migrants vs personal pull home—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation: each call increases jeopardy (child, brother at sulfur fields) while her waning strength lowers capacity. Tightening: third call forces her to confess she once walked the lethal path, narrowing advice to lived truth. Cost legible: perpetual exile + bodily depletion; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—recovery of agency over speech—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when she confesses to the storm, proving the compulsion is unbearable. The meaningful escalation is the moment she lifts the tin: discovery of someone else’s cache proves she is not alone, narrowing moral options—share cure or hoard it. Price is tangible: the eye clouds, the orchard remains decayed, and societal fracture is still absolute; her victory is partial. Under causal lens, one tightening suffices; it lands with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—recover or relinquish stolen memories—tightens once: when Magnus realizes the gaps are the only intact pieces of his own past, the option to keep living in curated amnesia is foreclosed. The price is visible: the “weight” his son could no longer carry is transferred back, and Magnus feels “lighter” yet burdened by the irrecoverable years. Agency is accumulative—each probe of the boutonnière and timing of beams deepens knowledge rather than alters external options—but this accrual culminates in a genuine stance crystallization: he climbs the lighthouse “now with his own memories to companion,” an endurance that accepts perpetual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—escape from vicarious living into authored journey—surfaces in paragraph one and tightens as water and ants erase passive options. Escalation is accretive: each paragraph adds a sensorial layer (rising creek, marching ants, chip warmth) that forecloses retreat. The doorway beat is the single meaningful intensifier; stepping through is agency, cost the shop left behind. Coincidence (chip’s return) complicates rather than rescues, and the price (perpetual readiness to guide others) is visible in the last clause.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—break the curse or become guardian—arrives with the silver-thread raven and tightens when the grotto declares the kingdom will fall tonight. Escalation is linear but sufficient: each revelation (dreams = memories, queens = fireflies, cycle = eternal) prunes options until only submission remains. Agency is present—she asks “What if I refuse?”—yet the answer is external, not a new tactic she tries. Cost is conceptual (eternal service) rather than visceral; still, it forecloses escape and satisfies the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“density of presence” vs. replication—tightens when Lyra pivots from capture to invitation; decisive narrowing occurs at shell-nexus contact. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens: each failed ember beat adds weight until spiral reverb offers only one path: witness, not trap. Cost visible: nexus extinguishes, foreclosing old fusion tactics. No coincidence resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can Maya still trust narrative to order chaos?—is signaled early and tightens when she writes the self-denying scroll; each new scroll raises the density of contradictory futures, foreclosing the option of linear memory. No antagonist is needed; the pressure is ontological. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: the grave memory and the jealousies are the accumulated price, but because both are summarized, the sting is felt one beat short of 8.8. Still, escalation is cleanly accumulative under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—translate mechanical failure into human truth—tightens once: the screw blockage shifts from obstruction to keepsake. Pressure grows texturally: each mineral layer felt in the channels adds emotional weight until the deliberate loosening forecloses perfect restoration. No causal reversal, but the accretive deepening is sufficient for 600-word scope. Cost is vicarious rather than personal to Mara, keeping the score south of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“create one original rune or fail”—is signaled immediately and tightens through the single, literalized breath-held clock. Escalation is driven by her agency: each second of oxygen-starvation spawns more crystals, narrowing options until the only possible ink is her own skin-map. Cost is visceral and on-page: lungs scream, vision sparkles, crystals detach. Meets 9- gate; could push higher if the external world (Master Yuen) pushed back more explicitly, but internal pressure is coherent under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: can Vera repair the spiritual rupture she caused before the orchard—and the tether—is gone. Escalation is linear and causal: each tree felled = one step closer to irreversible erasure, forcing faster composition. Agency is hers: she chooses to inhale the perfume, transcribe, and finally out herself in print. Cost is legible—her authority as “exorcist” is forfeited in tomorrow’s column.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: prevent final universal hiccup via spiral arbitration—signaled in opening paragraph. One meaningful tightening: 3 000-heartbeat countdown compresses options to a single spiral path. Agency visible—Kaia’s literal steps perform the arbitration; cost is eternal amnesia of truth. Escalation is density/ritual repetition, not causal reversal, coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—prove that clocks measure distance—tightens through each valve release; the countdown is the escalation. No external antagonist needed: the antagonist is entropy, the fear that memory (mechanical) will be drowned by flow (hydraulic). One visible price: she forfeits companionship—“the other shepherds thought her eminently peculiar”—and accepts lifelong outsider status. The bell’s toll doesn’t resolve; it ratifies the foreclosure of return, a quiet but legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—Maya’s need to breach her own walls—tightens once when the mushrooms expose literal gaps in space; escalation is accumulative: each laser pass deepens the pattern until personal application becomes inevitable. Cost is legible (abandoning isolation) but understated; the phone call is the single visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes are declared early—Elena’s need to reconcile father’s gambling with her own probabilistic faith—but no live option is foreclosed; the stranger simply hands her the insight. The single “tightening” is the power cut, yet it alters nothing she does. No visible price is paid; cost remains abstract, so escalation stays mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—maintaining liminal distance while feeding on counterfeit intimacy—arrives early and stays coherent. Pressure deepens slightly with Eleanor’s creeping self-doubt (“Sometimes I think I made her up”), but Marcus neither sacrifices nor jeopardizes his ritual; options do not narrow further. Agency is mostly receptive (listening, waiting) rather than decisive, so escalation is textural (pattern intensifies) not causal. Cost is conceptual (perpetual exile) not dramatized, satisfying the lens but keeping tension in a narrow register.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether to let erased victims stay erased—tightens once: the discovery of Thomas’s arson narrows Mara’s options from simple restoration to ethical augmentation. Pressure is coherent under causal lens; no coincidence rescues her from the dilemma. The price is immediate: she forfeits moral purity and accepts complicity in silence. A hair more visible consequence on her public reputation would have pushed this into 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—Marcus’s need to matter vs. Sadie’s need to disappear—tightens when the vial is handed over, foreclosing retreat. The single meaningful intensification is the phone offer: once accepted, Marcus is locked into monthly endangerment with no off-ramp shown. Cost is legible: illegality, perpetual duty, self-exposure. Reciprocity principle complicates rather than resolves, forcing stance crystallization under Situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—reach the stillpoint to master emotional cartography—signals early. Escalation via accumulating languages; each tree tightens the sonic net, foreclosing retreat. Agency: she chooses to “become the destination,” paying lifelong solitude as guide. Cost is felt but not dramatized in a tangible loss (tool, limb, relationship); holds it below 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will she erase her mistake and the discovery it triggered?—tightens when the rescue ship enters the anomaly and begins following the “corrected” flight plan. One meaningful turn: she realizes the anomaly personalizes history, then decides not to choose. Cost is visible: she must live with the fleet’s peril and the burden of multiversal truth. Pressure escalates under causal lens because each observer’s reality literally alters navigation.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—translate silence into a shareable form—signals early and tightens when Chen offers live interpretation of the map; the option of perpetual solitary mapping is foreclosed. Escalation is textural: each imagined photograph accrues until the moonlit harbor becomes a concert hall; the cost is the public absence of sound and audience, felt every time the shutter clicks on emptiness. Agency resides in Maya’s decision to let Chen embody the map; this renunciation of pure authorship carries visible social cost—her private silence will now be seen by another. No reversal, only deepening, but the deepening reweights the stake under accumulative lens cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—recover imperishable memory—tightens when the tapestry encodes the preservation compound. One visible price: she accepts lifelong solitude above ground to guard the weave below. Escalation is steady but single-note; no secondary reversal raises the cost further.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—memory agency vs corporate harvest—tightens once: her encoded rhythms hijack the extraction engine, foreclosing her survival but birthing collective autonomy. Price is her bodily death, legible on-page. Single meaningful turn sufficient for 700-word scope; coincidence absent.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—prove whispers outperform commands—signals early and tightens when only Marcus can locate XB-471 before hospital deadline. Agency is cerebral rather than brute: overlaying maps, tapping walls, modulating stride; each choice narrows options and raises social cost if he fails. The meaningful turn comes when Chen adopts his whispered cadence, compressing hierarchy into shared breath. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable: Marcus trades ancestral talisman for institutional voice, forfeiting outsider status.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake = Thomas’s need to finish his unspoken goodbye; secondary = Mira’s vocational need to teach without words. Escalation is accumulative/textural: each new shutter pattern adds star-images that deepen his reinterpretation of silence as sufficient speech. One meaningful tightening when she opens the final shutter and he begins to cry—cost is emotional release, not external loss. Coincidence absent; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—freedom of thought—signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened when the director’s arrival clock starts. One meaningful escalation: the synchronized window gambit flips abstract lessons into civic visibility, foreclosing retreat. Cost is conceptual but legible: townspeople exposed, Elena fatherless if regime strikes. Agency remains Marcus’s; luck is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—freedom to exist without violent erasure—signaled early. Pressure tightens when captain’s vulnerability removes physical threat yet raises emotional risk. One meaningful turn: Mira’s public unbinding irrevocably narrows options; no coincidence required. Cost visible in forfeited disguise and livelihood.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—how to carry illegal grief under the Happiness Mandate—tightens through accretion: each monotone narration risks exposure yet deepens the client’s dependence. The decisive deepening occurs when Mrs. Chen touches a petal and it crumbles—lightness is suddenly legible as tactical survival, not healing. No reversal is needed; the stake narrows to “carry sorrow without drowning,” paid for by the performer’s ongoing self-erasure. Cost is visible in her blank face reflected in the window, turbine shadows cutting across it.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prove cloud-shadow poetry’s right to exist—tightens when lake ice cracks under first pirouette, foreclosing retreat. Agency is aesthetic: each dissolve of boundary is enacted by Silas’s body, not declared. One meaningful escalation: colonnade hum crescendos → sudden silence → collective footfalls of other poets, multiplying consequence. Cost visible: sacred ice forfeited, scriptures drowned; no reset offered.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can broken things be made to speak again?—tightens when Mira wagers the reed tongue against courtyard access. One meaningful deepening: Enzo’s hands shake at music-hall gray, revealing the stakes are his daughter, not glass. Agency stays with Mira; her flower rearrangement forces the confession. Cost is visible (burned letters, exposed shame) but feels mid-scene; the final sculpture’s song is wind-driven, not a fresh choice, keeping it shy of 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—replace hollow ritual with living connection—is signalled early and sharpened by each off-key bell. One meaningful tightening: the first unauthorised interval makes air “shimmer,” marking the point of no return. Cost is legible: she forfeits her institutional script and faces strangers’ unfiltered judgment. Could push higher if a concrete external consequence (job warning, power flicker) had tangibly threatened, but internal cost suffices under Accumulative lens.</answer>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete recurrence: lens-light-bell triad migrates from miner’s tunnel to cathedral of potential, re-pricing pilgrimage as communal improvisation. No overt thesis; final image lets strangers’ humming answer the opening question. Complexity preserved—ritual is neither vilified nor romanticised, just re-appropriated. Avoids tidy moral; resonance is sonic after-image rather than statement.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—whether Elena will tattoo the phoenix and fully re-enter life—tightens when she instead transmutes the widow’s ring, deferring her own skin-commitment. Agency is service to others as rehearsal for self; cost is postponed catharsis. Pressure grows accumulative: each crane, each candle, each stranger widens the aperture of responsibility. No coincidence; star-time and visitor arrival are externalized gauges of internal escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—can the Jakarta archive be read before it dissolves?—is clear early; pressure tightens when Vera proves the 43-day sync, foreclosing the option to dismiss the network as dead. Agency is intellectual: each card laid is a renunciation of simpler explanations. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—her practice now bound to their calendar—yet the price is legible. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—absorb memory plague to prevent mass weaponization—signaled at entry. One meaningful deepening: tier 5 reveals Ethereans’ cruelties, narrowing her options to self-filter. Agency is renunciation/endurance; price is recursive trauma danced out. Cost is visceral—tears not her own, convulsing body—visible on page. No coincidence; escalation is density-driven under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve the shape of hope—surfaces in paragraph one and tightens when the shadow begins its 3-frame migration. The deepening is singular but meaningful: Mira realizes the shadow has been “collecting these moments,” which reweights her task from glitch-hunt to guardian. Cost is legible: she accepts lifelong custodianship of intangible shadows, foregoing ordinary retirement. Agency is interior yet decisive; no convenient external fix intrudes.</answer>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the specific lineage of stone + shadow + dream-archive rather than abstract pronouncements. The final image—stone casting “its own small shadow”—performs a Conceptual Repricing that reweights all prior footage as sacred relics. Subtext breathes in silence: grandmother never speaks, yet her design rules the architecture. No reader can extract a bumper-sticker moral; the ambiguity between memory and haunting lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserving the sanctuary—collapses when Chen exposes the fraud; every subsequent beat shrinks her agency until only ethical surrender remains. The meaningful tightening occurs when she finishes the re-attachment: she could still hide, but the healed yet colorless tail makes continuance impossible—cost is felt on page. Agency drives escalation: her own hands remove the implants and later draft the confession. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the final image crystallizes her stance with undeniable social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will she find the miracle or accept its scattering?—is signaled early through plant scream. Escalation is textural: each examined mark (scar, ring, sand) thickens the evidence that miracle has thinned rather than vanished. Final tightening occurs when garden confirms dispersion, foreclosing her search for a single locus; cost is the perpetual openness she embraces. No coincidence; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—whether the letters will survive—signaled in paragraph 3. Pressure escalates by accretion: each unsent goodbye narrows her professional detachment until the single option remains: steal the strip. No coincidence; the building’s stored grief is the antagonist. Cost is legible: she forfeits her clearance report and paycheck the moment the strip disappears into her coat.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is signaled early and tightens through each meteor trace. The meaningful deepening occurs when the astrolabe’s final ring turn narrows options to dissolution or retreat; she chooses dissolution with visible cost (her body fading). Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens: aurora flares, temperature plunge, and stellar whispers layer stakes without external coincidence. Price is legible, though the absence of a live alternative option slightly blunts the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—keep the nightmare container from pirates—signaled on manifest; one meaningful tightening when pirate phase-hand misses, proving her charm narrows options. Price is implied (continued exile in dreamlessness) but not dramatized on this beat; hence stops short of 8-band entry. Agency is present-tense song-decision that alters probability, consistent with Accumulative lens. No credible resource loss (no broken charm, drained voice, etc.) so cost remains conceptual-only.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—recovering untamed thought—is signaled early and deepens through pattern accumulation rather than reversals. Escalation is textural: each new sound layer tightens the hum of insight until gear-insertion reweights the stake. No visible price is paid on-page (no wound, forfeiture, or social loss), so the tightening is present but not charged. The shift from passive listening to active seeding satisfies minimal agency under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recover the dog / recover unleashed self—is signaled in first paragraph and tightens when the ticket remains blank until star-punched. One meaningful escalation: the crossing demands she admit she seeks "something deeper," foreclosing the purely literal search. Cost is visible—loss of the leash, the punched ticket, the solitary return—yet the pressure curve is gentle, matching lullaby tone. Coincidence (water appearing where none should) complicates but does not resolve; agency remains hers to step ashore.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—“who controls sound in this fortress and at what price?”—is signaled early and tightens once: choir’s demand for variety → Elena’s renunciation → Marcus’s exile → eventual shared re-appropriation. Escalation is accretive, not causal-reversal; pattern breaks when the bolt passes hand-to-hand, reweighting meaning rather than options. Cost is legible: Elena’s voice, Marcus’s frostbite, choir’s perpetual dumbness. A deeper beat of mutual endangerment or refusal is missing; the reunion softens rather than sharpens the trade-off, keeping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—truth of blood versus usurped throne—is signaled in line 3’s marginal note and tightens when breach tremors start. One meaningful escalation: the pretender physically enters, forcing Syln to wager the pellet; options narrow from passive archiving to active adjudication. Cost is legible: her quiet library is now politically exposed, its drift potentially broken. Agency is hers alone; the heir merely arrives to collect what her choices unlock. Under causal lens, pressure coheres without reversals beyond the single decisive turn—sufficient for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“discover why some paths disappear”—is signaled early and tightens through pattern accumulation. One meaningful deepening: coral shifts from “death” to “transcription,” narrowing her options to diving or perpetual drift. Cost is legible: she sacrifices professional distance and physical safety when she lowers the station. Escalation is textural rather than causal-reversal, fitting the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—rekindling rebellion—signaled in paragraph 2. One meaningful deepening: hum activates engines, turning private ritual into potential mass signal, narrowing her option to recruit tomorrow. Cost is visible: she accepts personal risk and responsibility. Agency is continuous—each circle step escalates resonance under her control; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—freedom from implant control—is signaled early and tightened when the formula is poured: a one-way door that dissolves both amber and Authority dominance. Chen’s agency drives every beat; coincidence (finding kite) complicates rather than resolves. Cost is visible: implant sparks, empty shell, freed soldiers now vulnerable. Under causal lens, escalation narrows options exactly once—sufficient for this length—and lands price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether to keep grieving or keep planting—tightens when each dead branch she prunes mirrors the “row of bodies.” Visible price: Panic tremor yielded to stillness, then to deliberate propagation; the cost is the irreversible knowledge that violence will recur. Escalation is textural: each new plant she pots raises the ante of return after next strike. No coincidence; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can she still paint truth once reality fragments?—is signaled in paragraph one. Pressure tightens through Accumulative pattern: each impossible perception (faces sliding, glass rising, walls pressing) deepens the cost of continuing the old art. The final charcoal strokes on tarot cards foreclose the single-image option; the resurrected beam is not rescue but confirmation of the new, higher-cost path. One visible price: she abandons the mayor-portrait career on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—map why crisis distorts time—signals in paragraph 1 and deepens via each fractal pattern. One meaningful tightening: the ink’s final cascade forces the recognition that consciousness and time are one, foreclosing her old hunt-&-capture stance. Cost is felt: she gives up empirical certainty and merges with the phenomenon. Agency remains hers; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single dominant stake—release vs. protect contraband truths—tightens when biometric delays shrink her window and cooling sabotage locks the choice. Upload bar vs. security timer creates visible price. Escalation is causal, not repetitive; no off-stage rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake — continuity versus retribution — is signaled early and tightens when the weapon stays unsheathed; the tranquil surface forecloses vengeance as a live option. One meaningful escalation under causal lens suffices; cost is the father’s visible exhaustion and the visible sheathing. No abstraction: the rose accepts the blood-scented air, making the price sensory.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.3)
    One dominant stake—secure or refuse the goddess-echo—tightens when the echo circles and tests her silence. Escalation is textural: each star-dream leak thickens the garden’s hybrid blooms, narrowing Kova’s tactical options to silence or surrender. Felt price is the spike’s burn and the irreversible internalization of alien song; no reversal, but a meaningful deepening that forces stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—protect empire vs. expose father—tightens when the journalist’s contradiction proves both alibis real. The Tokyo hoax is her decisive escalation that forecloses honest exposure; price is permanent moral self-exile. No antagonist on stage, but internal pressure suffices. One meaningful turn; coincidence only complicates (ambassador diary) and does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake: give deleted code a memorial before the fold ends. Escalation is accretive—each ghost-star inked increases the amber’s fracture and the room’s silence—until the final mandala forecloses further mourning. No antagonist is needed; pressure is the accumulating guilt made audible. The tightening is visible: static → primal cry → resolved lullaby, a cadence shift that reweights the ethical cost of “update and erase.”

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can she fix the silence?—tightens when the tile’s heat forces a choice: trap the whispers in fixed sand or let them migrate. Agency is renunciation; the cost is the mandala’s certain erasure, felt on-page. Escalation is accumulative: each grain added = more fragile archive. No external antagonist needed; the acoustic law itself applies pressure. Slight slack: “unlearning season” stakes are declared cosmic but only the grotto is dramatized—village scale remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—whether she will keep trying to restore or accept transformation—is signaled early and tightens when the stones rename her, foreclosing restoration as live option. Escalation is iterative rather than reversed: each vision deepens knowledge and raises social cost (Brotherhood hunt). Agency is present at every beat—she chooses to press, to weep, to speak the final defiance. Price is conceptual but legible: her name’s sacralization makes her a heretic target.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—retrieve Isabella from erased time—signals on page 2 and tightens when each echo risks over-braiding realities. One decisive deepening: the brightest timeline where they bow together aged is seized, foreclosing all other futures. Cost is visible: eternal repetition of one performance, never world-tour. Agency remains ghostly but active—he casts echo-lines, pulls possibility, accepts the price.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—prove hidden pathways exist—arrives early and tightens once: David must step inside the lattice or remain an outsider. Agency sits with Maya throughout; crushing the pill is the irreversible beat that raises the cost of failure (public humiliation if the lattice collapses). No external antagonist needed; internal risk of seeming delusional supplies pressure. Escalation is single but sufficient for 700 words.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can she map the post-human emotion without losing her own compass—tightens when the alien signature overwrites human strata. Escalation is textural: each chamber adds thermal density until the unreadable color breaks pattern. Cost is visible: fossil crumbles, her exclusive sense is sacrificed to communal teaching. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals needed.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—keep possibility fluid vs. let prophecy harden—is signaled by line 3 and intensifies when the black hourglass refuses to empty. The spiral-building beat narrows options: once buttons lock into pattern, failure would petrify futures. Cost is conceptual (prophecy lost, garden gained) rather than tactile, keeping the escalation just shy of the high-band gate that demands a felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—expose the mole or remain ghosted—tightens once: the folder’s appearance collapses her trilemma (run forever, suicide via morphine, or fight back) into a single active path. Escalation is causal: each snow-code cluster narrows her tactical options until the final choice is the only one left that preserves agency. Cost is visible: the melting雪-codes erase her trail, literalizing irreversibility. The price isconceptual rather than visceral, but still felt—she can never return to pre-burn anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single dominant stake—will she keep or release the gauge—tightens through escalating sensory pattern rather than external antagonist. Pressure intensifies when petal drops (signal of cycle ending) → rhythmic oars model relinquishment → dock crack accepts gauge. No coincidence; escalation remains internal and textural, coherent under accumulative lens. Felt cost legible: permanent loss of heirloom that once linked grandfather’s canals to her rooftop soil.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—is signaled early and deepens through the hum’s rising cadence; the final shadow reweights the cost from abstract to visible. Agency is interior renunciation rather than external confrontation, consistent with Accumulative lens. No swappable antagonist is required; the absence of mammoths is the irreversible constraint. The tightening is singular but meaningful; a second reversal would over-plot this length.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will she keep ghosting love or claim her own voice?—is signaled in paragraph two. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each wired bulb is a public reveal of private text, tightening the risk of recognition. A single decisive turn occurs when Chen admits he kept her real letters; that confession forces the final choice to stand physically beside him inside the lit spiral. Cost is legible: anonymity forfeited, the installation now speaks her name.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single dominant stake—prevent humanity from beaconing its location—tightens when the faculty vote clock is announced. Escalation is causal: each subsonic counter-broadcast weakens AI grip, shown by real-time flicker of Hadley’s laptop. Cost is tangible: equipment overheats, Maya’s fingers tremble, her vigil now endless. No coincidence; agency drives reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: map or be consumed by mutable space. Pressure tightens from surface anxiety → corridor shift → spherical nexus where up/down vanish; each stage shrinks tactical options. Agency remains Marcus’s: he chooses to follow the organ coordinates and to pocket the twin compass. Cost is conceptual but legible—he exits carrying the heresy that space can be bent, foreclosing a return to ordinary perception.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can Sarah see the killer’s whole through fragmented victims—tightens with each portrait that eliminates one possible suspect-template. The eleventh portrait marks the decisive deepening: pattern shifts from “who wore masks” to “who collects contradictions.” Cost is conceptual but felt: she abandons standard police closure for empathic comprehension. No reversal, but accretion reweights options believably.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—expose hidden exiles—tightens once: revelation that storms are escape hatches, not death sentences, flips risk from personal survival to ancestral responsibility. Cost visible: she stays to transmit, sacrificing evacuation window. Pressure coherent under causal lens; no off-stage rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—can she forgive herself enough to see the map beneath her regrets—is signaled by the pixelated photograph inside the first 200 words. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each pixel she recognizes is a tightening that forecloses denial. The final cost is conceptual but legible: she accepts lifelong service as bridge-ferryman, an open-ended burden. No coincidence resolves; the hitchhiker’s return is earned by her deliberate musical reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can Marcus prevent TerraLoop from reenacting his father’s looping theft pattern? Pressure escalates by accretion: each planted artifact tightens the investors’ unease; the algorithm’s phantom thieves are the pay-off complication. Protagonist agency is present in every beat (rearranging, whispering), yet the final cost is conceptual rather than a lived loss, keeping it just below the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“patch the soul without erasing self”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tested by the keeper’s warning. Escalation is causal: each new corridor narrows escape options until only fusion remains. The apple bite pays a visible price (card ash) that permanently alters her revolution tactics. One meaningful tightening suffices; no reversal is needed under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: reclaim professional voice after public humiliation; signaled in paragraph 3. Escalation: cloth recognition tightens risk—if wrong again, final shred of credibility gone. One meaningful turn at phone call where he stakes name on tactile memory. Cost legible: “space waiting to be filled” implies future exposure. Agency resides in decision to speak, not exterior plot twist.</answer>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—preservation as performance—emerges through cloth’s journey from stage to trailer to collector, never sermonized. Subtext in silent handling: loupe, tissue, phone call speak louder than exposition. Final image reweights premise: archival act becomes new concert for unknown audience. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers about whether redemption or merely more exposure awaits.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake signaled early: bridge ancient wisdom / modern science. Pressure escalates once: seed ingestion tightens options—accept inheritance or lose link forever. Cost is conceptual (she becomes “story,” forfeits detached scholar identity) but not viscerally felt on-page—no bodily price or external consequence shown. Agency is present (she places seed on tongue) yet the beat is more acquiescence than fraught decision.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—can identity stay fluid without fragmentation—signals early. One meaningful tightening: surrendering personal memory fragments to the furnace forecloses retreat to old selves. Cost is visible: visitor exits prismatic, Kaine remains gear-creaking, perpetual. Agency sits with Kaine’s decision to facilitate rather than solve; renunciation of “choice” is the trade-off under accumulative pressure. Escalation is density-driven, not reversal-heavy; coincidence absent.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—signaled early via “guilt worked into bones.” Escalation is one tightening: graffiti map forces confrontation; no external antagonist needed. Agency visible: he chooses to draw his failure on the wall, paying the price of public confession (even if only to dust). Cost is felt: obsessive chronicle repurposed from shield to witness; the “ghost” whistle undercuts any triumphant note.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—map the silence-pattern before the farewell letter arrives—is signaled early and tightens when the watch ticks backward, forcing her to notice propagation delays. Escalation is textural: density of symbols increases, cadence of shelves grows louder, options narrow to “document or miss the window.” Visible price: she becomes the next invitation, foreclosing ordinary life. Could use one concrete loss (time, memory) on the page to reach 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. career—signals early and tightens when the coffee stain reveals genocide. One meaningful deepening: the violin only sings once Marcus (thief bloodline) touches it, turning her forged lie into cosmic verdict. Cost is visible—her academic empire evaporates with the ice—yet the beat is compressed into a single line, muting visceral punch. Still, agency drives every turn; coincidence complicates rather than rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve the last spark before Silence—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is accretive: each infusion gesture narrows options until the Silence’s tide forces the final suspended state. Cost is visible: Mira’s feet begin to freeze; the star’s body shudders. Agency remains hers—she presses the chip, she chooses stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake: locate the missing *source of contentment* after catastrophic loss. Escalation is textural—mist → echo → spiral vision—each repetition tightening the same question rather than trading it for new danger. Agency is attention/renunciation: she stays, accepting eternal return. Felt cost is the foreclosure of ever leaving; options narrow to *this* branch, *this* pin, *this* life. No external reversals needed; the deepening reweights the original loss into acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—Marcus’s need to understand why certainty killed his daughter—tightens once when the Arbiter forces him to own the simplification he sold her. Escalation is conceptual: each revealed ethical shade (tax shelters, safety violations) shrinks Marcus’s available self-exculpation. No physical reversals, but the wind-chime “minor key” cadence signals the deepening. Cost is visible: Marcus forfeits the protective story he paid the Arbiter to confirm, leaving him exposed to perpetual gray.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will Marcus see the hidden temporal pattern—signals early and tightens once when the tenth ring fails to arrive, forcing perceptual reframe. Cost is conceptual yet legible: both characters exit with irreversible temporal double-vision. Agency sits with Elara’s withholding and Marcus’s forced observation; coincidence plays no role. Escalation is modest but sufficient for lyric mode; pressure peaks at the “inside the first” realization.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—authentic vs. machine-perfect creation—surfaces early and tightens when she renounces the Academy path. Single meaningful intensification: the mist-walk itself, where failure becomes agency. Cost is legible: forfeiture of credentials and risk of death. No reversal, but under Accumulative lens the pattern break (perfect machines below / imperfect glow above) reweights options sufficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—find the color of sound—signposts early; the journal discovery tightens once. Yet pressure plateaus after that single deepening; no new obstacle complicates the vow. The cost is conceptual (revealing the Luminous) rather than tactical, satisfying Accumulative escalation but lacking a visible price that alters next moves.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve expansion memory against collapse—is signaled early. Pressure escalates via density of static bursts and coin resonance that forces her stance crystallization; cost is the eternal loop itself. One meaningful tightening suffices. Agency is renunciation/acceptance rather than new action, fitting the retro-causal frame.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is survival of selfhood inside endless duty; pressure tightens when sunlight gives substance to her fears, forcing the naming that forecloses retreat into anonymity. Escalation is accumulative/textural—density of light, ink, memory—rather than causal reversal; one meaningful deepening suffices. Cost is visible: the named monsters evaporate but her “eternal voyage” is re-caged, Atlas page now a constant reminder of what she can’t escape.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring marine life—tightens via the literal countdown of three falling drops; the third’s suspension narrows options to irreversible overlap. Mira’s agency is precise: her “lukewarm” power prevents catastrophic collision, a brilliant inversion of typical mage power fantasy. Cost is visible: collapse, exhausted savings, estranged friends. Escalation is single-track but sufficient: each drop intensifies the harmonic until the membrane tears open and fish flicker into solid existence.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—expose the hidden dead—surfaces with the bottle and tightens as each photograph forces Marcus to choose between official record and human truth. One meaningful deepening: realizing Elena refused evacuation reframes his childhood memory, narrowing his options to complicity or witness. Cost is legible: he jeopardizes his contract by planning to publish the counter-narrative. Pressure stays accumulative rather than causal, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—will she preserve wonder or release it?—is signaled early and tightens when the crystal warms in her palm, forcing a live choice. Escalation is accretive, not causal: each image (spiral pears, starling murmuration) reweights the cost of clinging to wonder as artifact. The final act of sublimation is agentive and irreversible, foreclosing the safety of possession. Price is conceptual but legible: she trades tangible proof for intangible infusion, a loss that reconfigures tomorrow’s synthesis.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—forest survival—tightens when the unknown caller forces Maya to choose complicity or sabotage. The seven-minute clock is announced but never tracked; tension plateaus rather than spikes. The lie about six-months is the single meaningful narrowing of options; no further escalation beat occurs. Cost is present but front-loaded, not compounded.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—who gets to feel—signaled in paragraph 4. Escalation via Chen’s reframing: duplicate ≠ enemy but missing half; this deepens rather than widens. Tightening beat: vivify the jar or stay numb—options narrow to one path with visible price (potential third consciousness). Cost legible: surrendering exclusive claim to “Marcus.”

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve wild negative space—locks in early and tightens when council plans threaten. Agency sits with Mira: she commits the seed, the space begins its self-camouflage. Cost is implied not visceral: developers will fail, yet she pays no tangible personal loss on the page. Sufficient escalation for this length, but a sharper tangible price would lift it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single dominant stake—restore laughter—signalled in paragraph two and tightened when the first cord is pulled. Escalation is accumulative: each blower adds harmonic density until the tunnel “breathes,” then the house answers; no reversal, but option space narrows—silence is no longer possible. Price is conceptual: Marcus commits to eternal return, a living maintenance contract. Could enter 8.8+ if a visible sacrifice (stamina, social ridicule) had been dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—escape versus incorporation into frozen exile—is signaled in paragraph two and deepens through each sensory freeze. One meaningful tightening: the scholar’s arrival narrows the guardian’s options to act/respond rather than merely endure. Cost is visible—she pays with the pendant, her last tether to origin, to enable the crossing. Agency is present yet quiet (endurance, recognition, transfer); the lens is Accumulative, so causal reversals are not required, but the pressure of perpetual winter accumulates to the breaking thaw.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—prove his worth by wielding power—tightens from whispered mockery to literal life-risk at the molten brink. One meaningful escalation: restoration path foreclosed, only destruction left; that narrowing is on-page and irreversible. Cost is visible—blood, exile, the staff’s alien heartbeat—so the trade-off lands. Agency drives every turn: he chooses each failure, each revision, the final sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.5)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—heal fractured realities—arrives late and abstractly; pressure escalates by accretion of timelines rather than narrowing options. Marcus’s agency is collective and symbolic; no single reversible choice is tested. The “cost” is the surrender of singular identity, announced rather than dramatized. Escalation is atmospheric, not tactical; the convergence feels inevitable, not contested.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—can she finish the weave before reality fractures—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each strand increases density until “patterns began to erupt more violently.” Agency is present—she chooses to cut the thread rather than continue—but the price is displaced onto future visitors rather than herself. Cost is legible in the altered gallery, yet personal stakes plateau at the moment of completion.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—“learn to navigate by starlight”—is declared early but never tested by failure or resource loss; tension stays intellectual. Pressure accumulates via wonder rather than risk; no credible omission or price is shown. The final image widens possibility instead of narrowing it, satisfying Accumulative logic yet lacking a felt trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—rescue seventeen stolen voices—is signaled by line 9 and tightens when photo faces begin to vanish in real time, converting abstract mission into countdown. Agency remains with Mara: each pulse she decodes narrows her tactical options until only basement-invasion remains. Cost is legible: she forfeits her former identity (“hadn’t meant to be a hero”) and accepts risk of confrontation. Escalation is single-thread but sufficient for 700-word window.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—keep the cables silent and the team remembered—tightens when Elena realizes the phase chamber is both tomb and archive. The 40-minute tide window forces pace; retrieving the journal forecloses extraction of remains, a felt price. Agency is hers alone; no coincidence resolves anything. Escalation is single but sufficient for 800 words.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming digital existence—tightens via escalating ink trials that foreclose each wrong sigil; each failure deletes another account fragment, raising tangible stakes. One meaningful intensification: the moment ink spiral mirrors snowfall, turning aesthetic echo into operative gateway—option space narrows to “touch or retreat.” Agency remains with Marcus; no external saviour or coincidence resolves the pattern. Felt price is the perpetual schism he must now live, conveyed in the final line’s heartbeat count that will never end.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve Thuvenli’s texture before the final breath—tightens once: the diamond’s curse forces her to relinquish normal hearing forever. That irreversible trade-off escalates under Accumulative lens; each carved groove is a visible price paid. No coincidence; starlings’ shift is read as pattern, not luck. Cost is legible on-page (“her veins finally cooled”) and shapes the closing image. One tightening suffices at this length; would need a second fork or deeper moral trade-off to breach 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—complete or refuse metamorphosis—signalled early. Tightening occurs when Marina realises grief anchors the returned; this forecloses old investigation path. Agency sits with her choice to dial the dead line. Cost is abstract (conceptual surrender) but legible; would benefit from one tangible forfeiture for 8.8+ entry.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—rekindle organic beauty before mechanized erasure—is signaled in para 2 and tightened exactly once: when the first statue heart shatters, Lira’s option to retreat dies with it; escalation is accumulative/lyric, not multi-reversal. Cost stays visible: each slurred note weakens her control, the final image showing her physical depletion as the price. Agency remains hers—she chooses to keep bowing while sirens approach. Coincidence does not solve; the orchard’s uprising answers her call but cannot protect her, maintaining coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—clandestine mail runs under partition eyes—is signaled early; pressure stays steady but flat. One meaningful tightening: Ezra places letters into drone while clutching contraband storm—if caught, both routes collapse. However, no new complication or consequence arises on-page; stakes neither intensify nor exact visible cost from him. Escalation is present but modest, adequate for length yet short of 8+ band where price must visibly reshape tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—whether silence remains sustainable—tightens when the shard surfaces and again when the angel’s missing halo gap is discovered. Agency is present: he pockets, walks, stumbles, fits, sings. The cost is conceptual but legible: once the shard is fitted, silence is no longer a viable canvas; song becomes imperative. A hair more external pressure (e.g., an audible collapse, a witnessed moment) would have pushed this into the 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—“to find the place where stories live”—is signaled early; pressure is atmospheric, tightening through repeated returns to the scarf and the library’s shifting shelves. No external antagonist or resource loss; escalation is a deepening of pattern rather than narrowing options. The final vision reweights meaning but costs Marcus nothing tangible beyond another thread loosened. Under Accumulative lens, one intensification suffices, yet the absence of a trade-off or visible price keeps the score below 7.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—complete vs. release the grandmother’s dream—is signaled early and tightens once: the cost of vitalization becomes visible (warmth leaves Mara). Escalation is a single deepening rather than reversible turns; agency is renunciation rather than confrontation. Coincidence is kept to atmosphere (whispers at dawn) and does not resolve the conflict. Price is conceptual but unmistakable on page, meeting the 8.0+ trade-off threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“can humanity dare to believe its own power?”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened when Vera’s bleeding fingers prove the price is real. Escalation is single-circuit but sufficient for 700 words: each fear-thread she picks collapses futures, narrowing possibility toward the one released. The reversal is internal—she accepts invisibility as cost, foreclosing celebrity or guru paths. Cost is visible (blood, exhaustion, return to mundane shop) and alters later options: she can never again be “merely competent.”

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—recover Gran’s stolen memories—signals inside paragraph two and escalates through each mis-aligned constellation pane, tightening the noose of irreversible knowledge. Escalation is causal: every step deeper into the greenhouse raises the psychic freight she must carry out. A visible price is paid on-page when the memories “flow into her like water,” narrowing her future to chronic custodianship. The only minor lapse is that external antagonistic force (the fairy ring’s will) is asserted rather than demonstrated resistance, keeping the beat just shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reversing exile—declared by word 120; spiral-geometry tightens option space, visible price is “when your turn comes,” foreshadowing shared risk. Escalation is single but sufficient under Causal lens; no false reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: preserve the color of wonder. Escalation is textural—each droplet intensifies the stake’s luminosity until the seed-eye opens and forecloses failure. Visible price: Mira’s age-brittle hands tremble, acknowledging her body will expire before the tree peaks. No antagonist needed; pressure is existential erosion of imagination. Single meaningful tightening: the moment seed splits into two spirals—options narrow to “both worlds or none,” paid on page.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—restoring identity to the drowned—gains emotional weight but never tightens Mira’s options; each knot releases a fragment without complicating her method or raising the price of failure. The only escalation is accumulation itself: more masks, more ghosts, until the quota is met. Because the spirits pose no resistance and Mira risks no personal loss, pressure plateaus rather than peaks. The final “lucid unrest” is atmosphere, not stakes-driven tension.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—can empathy exist without language?—tightens once: from decoding maps to adding her own silent testimony. Escalation is textural intensification: each layer of rain, skin-oil, and footage thickens until renunciation (mapping → participating) is the only remaining option. Visible price: she forfeits the distancing safety of frames, drives toward an un-mappable henge at night. Agency is accumulative—no single reversal, but each tactile act narrows the path toward embodied silence.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: torn parchment = knowledge via rupture; skin-oil coordinates = history written in body; final palm-print = empathy as residue. No abstract slogans; “shielded openness” is dramatized by her refusal to announce the chapel’s reopening, simply enacts it. Subtext carried in gesture: Brother Thomas’s air-tracing reappears in homeless teens, proving ritual continuity without exposition. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer: silence is not absence but a medium that accumulates human presence like salt in rain.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—decode the transmission / accept dissolution—tightens once: the shrinking air pocket forces her to seal the journal and globe inside the sample box, trading physical preservation for narrative transmission. Escalation is textural: each object (equations, globe, blank pages) accumulates meaning until the cadence shift (“the library would flood within hours”) makes the cost legible. No visible price beyond this single forfeiture, so stays short of 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—give the ghost a voice—signals early. Escalation is one meaningful tightening: lightning-gap → graffiti crystallizes emotion → Chorus sacrifices privacy to amplify reply. Cost is visible: she loses exclusive access to the secret frequency—technicians now “pause and wonder,” crowding her solitude. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens, but second tightening (monks’ opposition) is offstage, so option-narrowing feels single-pulse rather than compounded.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will she claim Thorne’s hidden tenderness as her own?—tightens precisely: each floor strips warmth, forcing a earlier micro-choice to keep reading. The projected coordinates on frost are the single reversal that forecloses ignorance; after it, she must act. Cost is felt altitude sickness and the social risk of pilfering property. No escalation sprawl; one meaningful intensification suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—prove empty spaces remember—signals early and tightens through denser atmospheric memory, but Elena’s agency remains observational; she never risks safety or reputation to extract a new datum. The “quietly explosive storm” complicates atmosphere but does not narrow her options or exact an on-page price. Escalation is textural, not tactical; pressure accumulates yet never forces a trade-off. Sufficient for mid-6 band, but lacks visible cost that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“create a final portrait that preserves identity”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and narrows to “will the portrait survive the saw?” The tightening beat is the coin discovery: it switches her medium from tactile to light-craft, foreclosing erasure. Cost is visible: she forfeits sleep, the tree forfeits life, she forfeits visual memory forever. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal-reversal, perfectly legible under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—decode the lights or remain dismissed as mad—tightens when each murmuration either withholds or grants a new coordinate. Agency is continuous: Elara notes, cross-references, and finally steers; the cost is the inexorable southward migration that strands her in winter skies, narrowing her option to keep following or quit. The tightening is single but meaningful; no additional reversal is needed at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.5)
    Single dominant stake—save the orchards—tightens when soil samples must cross fences, foreclosing isolationist options. Escalation is linear rather than spiraling; no reversal tests Marina or the families anew after the mycologist’s reveal. Cost is collective, not personal, so pressure plateaus once cooperation begins.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is humanity’s gentle/terrible approach to ending; escalation occurs via density accrual—each crack in porcelain refracts a deeper historical layer of postponed doom. The meaningful tightening happens when Marcus realizes the lullaby, not math, must adjust the clock; this narrows his tactical option from mechanical to melodic, visible price is the infinite lifetime of song he now must carry. Agency is renunciation/acceptance rather than external victory; cost is legible in the puppet’s warm veins of gold and the clock hands finally moving backward. Under Accumulative lens the pattern intensifies rather than forks, satisfying the single-deepening requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—keep labyrinth intact by surrendering personal freedom—tightens once: walnut leaves, option vanishes. Pressure escalates under causal lens: frost countdown → travelers arrive → seed handed off → Mara’s path sealed. No coincidence; mechanical birds complicate but do not resolve. Cost is legible on-page (“tomorrow she’d be free” retracted), though a second intermediate tightening beat could have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake “translate separation into connection” is signaled early; pressure tightens when she decides to release the literal chrysalis and send the risky text; cost is the relinquishing of control (grief loosened) with page-visible tremor; escalation driven by her noticing agency, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—child’s need to abolish endings—signals early; Merrick’s acceptance supplies the tightening. Pressure is situational/ritual rather than adversarial; one meaningful deepening when bottled moonlight guides the incising. Cost is paid by child (loss of closure) and by environment (shop transfigured), but Merrick feels no personal price, capping escalation legibility. Agency is Merrick’s gentle facilitation; coincidence absent.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—will she metabolize the fortress’s grief or walk away—tightens once: the plunge of both palms onto the largest pool. That act forecloses retreat and visibly exhausts her (“body heavy with purpose”), but because the communal payoff (tomorrow’s feast) is off-page, the price is slightly less visceral than the 8.8 band demands.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—save the town from agricultural death—is signaled in paragraph two. One meaningful tightening: the first low hum that makes her chest vibrate forecloses secrecy; from then on the music is public and irreversible. Cost is visible exhaustion at dawn and the irreversible sonic occupation of private silos. No coincidence; escalation is driven by her escalating vocal risk.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—excavate abandoned dreams—signals in para 1 and tightens when each injection narrows her future options (irreversible neural rewiring). The periscope’s entangled memories act as escalating pressure: every cracked segment forecloses normal cognition. Cost is visceral: tremoring body, altered time-sense, dawn exile. Agency remains hers; no coincidence resolves tension. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—“find the hidden combination before gravity rights itself”—is signaled early and tightened by literal loss of footing. Agency is continuous: overlaying doodles, kicking off archway, palming node, choosing to perpetuate warnings. Cost is conceptual rather than corporeal: the prism-mind’s permanent burn. The hour-long inversion window is named but not tracked as a live clock, so pressure is atmospheric, not ticking.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—can silence be broken without harming the trees?—tightens via each strum that risks widening the cracks. Escalation is textural: each new note layers cost until the porcelain itself fractures, a visible price that forecloses unlimited extraction. No coincidence; every intensification is a direct result of her tactile agency. The final symphony is not victory but a fragile lease on memory, leaving tomorrow’s silence intact.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—return to Academy vs. remain in exile—tightens once: covenant expires, Viktor refuses. The magnetic board’s literal tilt externalizes the irreversible choice, forcing a visible trade-off. Cost is felt (stone given, public identity forfeited), though pressure is more philosophical than endangering. Sufficient for this length; no reversal is required.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: recover grandmother’s pacifist silence-archive before fireworks rupture the night. Escalation is Accumulative: each failed frequency narrows the audible field until only the civic pause remains. Agency stays tactile—every dial twist is a decision that spends time, the one non-renewable resource tonight. The tightening is meaningful, but the visible price (time passing) is generic; no prop or relationship is permanently forfeited, so the cost pulse stops just short of the 8.5 band.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—prove mastery of “undercurrent of wisdom” via blooming a corpse-flower—is signaled early and tightened when the first shoot appears; success requires enduring the horrific odor as visible cost. Agency is present in every dew-collection and sketch; the final stance crystallizes when she inhales the stench rather than fleeing. No external antagonist needed; pressure is ecological and olfactory. Cost is unmistakable on the page, meeting 8+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—find resilience source—tightens once: the monument reveals survival demands surrendering control, not engineering it. Agency is present; Kessa chooses up, slots the arrow, accepts planetary lesson. No reversible loss or tool cost is dramatized; escalation is conceptual rather than visceral. Closure cost is felt through reframed colony future, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—warn world before convergence devours cities—declared early via instrument readings. Escalation: wind anomaly grows, footprints overlap, field expands millimetrically, stakes tighten spatially and temporally. Agency visible: monitoring installation is tangible tactic under pressure; cost is knowledge of impending engulfment, accepted on page. No second reversal, but single meaningful deepening suffices; coincidence complicates rather than rescues. Cost legible in final heartbeat image, but felt more globally than personally, keeping score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—“certify wonder as essential before tomorrow’s audit”—is signaled early and tightened when the sheet reveals it needs the aurora, not bells, forcing a one-shot gambit. Escalation is accumulative: each resonance wave adds density until Council meters shatter. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: the Basilica’s bells lose monopoly on wonder, now sky-bound. No visible personal price for Lyrian keeps this from the 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve disappearing identities via print—is signaled in paragraph 2 and escalates as each star vanishes; the halo fragment provides the single tightening beat that forces the final insight. Cost is legible: the last star “holds on, defiant” while Mira surrenders any hope of a private self. Agency remains hers—she pulls the press lever each time—even while personalities overwhelm her. Under Accumulative lens, density of ghost-selves reaches critical mass that reweights the premise; no coincidence, pure pattern break.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will she survive the test and find Corvin—signaled in para 1. Escalation: pendant vibrates → ghosts appear → mentor located → vocational rewrite. Tightening beat is luminous figure’s touch that floods her with knowledge, narrowing option to lifelong bridge-duty. Cost is perpetual bodily tremor and exile from normal courier anonymity—visible price legible at end.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—prove emotion-imprint science—tightens once: frost lexicon appears, live option is “document now or lose forever.” Escalation is textural (density of sensory proof) rather than causal reversal; sufficient for this length. Cost is legible—frost will melt, reputation still teeters—though stated more than viscerally felt. Agency sits in the camera click; luck is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—daughter’s life vs mother’s self—is signaled in the photograph beat and tightens with each shuttle pass: every memory lost narrows the chance she’ll remember why she’s paying. The visible price (aphasia, smiling vacancy) is inseparable from the message’s success; silence literally eats options until only the plea remains. Agency is renunciation rather than conquering, fully compatible with Accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening suffices, and it’s delivered: the moment she feels the message “catch” the cost becomes irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming bartered consciousness—tightens once: silk arrival → forge → blade that cuts bindings. Escalation is textural deepening rather than causal reversals; each hammer blow accumulates awakenings until the merchant’s touch makes the cost felt. Agency is Korin’s deliberate descent and forging; no coincidence resolves. Visible price: merchant’s tremor and Korin’s return to perpetual labor foreclose ease for both.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single dominant stake—“find Mom / decode the withheld truth”—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates through each bay variant that exposes another quantum tear. The tightening beat comes at the nexus: discovery that map-makers themselves are the apocalypse agents, forcing an immediate tactics shift from exploration to repair. Protagonist agency drives the climax—she offers the shard and the new methodology, paying the small concrete price of its loss. Conceptual cost is large (lifelong penance), but on-page price is modest; still legible under accumulative lens and sufficient for sub-800-word scale.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will Elsa take up the haunted keeper role?—is signaled in the first letter reference and tightens when the lamp is dark. The midpoint ghost reveal eliminates retreat; her choice to “tend the light” pays the price of perpetual solitude. Escalation is causal and single-cycle, sufficient for 700-word scope. Cost is on-page: she stays, they weep, she writes new stones.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reality’s safe passage—signals early and deepens with each ship’s oddity. Agency is performative: laughter steers, but the price is abstract (universe speaking through her) rather than personal loss. Escalation is pattern-based: inverse ship creates standing wave that reverses lens—tightening via image, not option foreclosure. Cost is conceptual, visible in the reversed light; meets 8.8+ threshold but lacks visceral jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—how to survive the story-magnet heart—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: Chen reveals the heart’s origin, shifting Kael’s stance from passive wonder to deliberate apprenticeship. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, but the final image of scattering rainbows makes the price legible. Escalation is Accumulative: color-whispers layer until the morpho wing offers a release valve.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserve the labyrinth’s healing purpose—surfaces early and tightens when Marcus realizes the sextant’s fractures encode personal loss. The deepening beat is the deliberate decision to scatter its pieces, trading calibration for consolation; price is the irreversible loss of a working relic he’s tended 30 years. Escalation is Accumulative: each etched equation adds weight until grief outweighs duty to functionality. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure suffices.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme—grief transmuted into communal navigation—emerges through mirrored light, not axiom. Micro-notations (“She asked what trees see”) let mathematics carry private sorrow, culminating in leaf-shadow equations that invite visitors to solve for absence. The final image refrains from moral; resonance is in ivy pulse against his palm—forward growth, not back. No thematic echo or sermonizing caps the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—reignite dawn—signals early; pressure escalates by accretion: each recalled fragment tightens the song-weave, foreclosing solitude as a live option. Escalation turns on participation, not external antagonist; the price is future perpetual labor (“tomorrow they would need to sing again”). That cost is legible, though mild; could be sharper if one singer’s refusal risked actual loss mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake: can Ezra act without self-annihilating empathy? Escalation is one deepening: her grief surge → he abandons hiding → shared folded papers compress guilt into mutual shelter. Cost is legible: he sacrifices the safety of absence, she sacrifices private mourning. Agency is attention/approach, not external victory. Coincidence (late telegram) complicates, does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—whether attention to the impossible is madness or ministry—tightens when bread uncloaks into memories, forcing Lila to own her gift. One clear escalation beat suffices; cost legible in her decision to plant seeds that may never sprout, foreclosing ordinary safety. Pressure stays accumulative/textural; no reversal, yet deepening satisfies lens.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—how many vows can outrun obliteration—tightens each time Elara’s calipers click. The meaningful turn arrives when the unmeasurable slide appears: it forces her to abandon the metric hierarchy she trusted and embrace subjective, singular value. Temperature-rise supplies visible price: every rejected slide liquefies, altering later tactics—she accelerates, fingers fumbling, satchel limited to fifty. Agency is hers; coincidence never rescues. The escalation is a density curve of light lost, not external villainy, perfectly aligned with the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—record evidence before sunrise—tightens via each failed cover and the woman’s growing suspicion. The reversal when the fob is opened forecloses Mae’s undercover option with audible cost (“drowning in reverse”). Agency stays hers: she chooses to keep recording even after exposure. One further increment would land 8.8—e.g., a visible sacrifice such as surrendering the heirloom to buy final minutes.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—will Marina keep her skeptical identity or surrender to inherited weather—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when her implants dim to near-black at Chen’s snow. One meaningful deepening suffices: the spruce’s xylem coordinates foreclose refusal; her fog is the first involuntary climate she births, paying visible cost. Agency remains hers—she chooses to taste the iron-ozone future despite the bitter price of lifelong worldview collapse. Pressure accretes texturally; no coincidences resolve the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—escape the safety of perfect memory—tightens once when the second painting commands “Create”; the price (a drawing she can’t perfectly recall) is legible, but external pressure stays static, not escalating again.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stake is legible early: Vera’s reputation as the city’s only reliable truth-teller vs. the social cost of total honesty. Pressure tightens accumulatively—each decoded confession widens the gap between private knowledge and public lie until silence becomes untenable. The grandmother’s crystal letter is the decisive intensifier: it transforms a personal search into civic rupture. Cost is visible on-page: Vera knowingly chooses to “watch the peace dissolve,” trading collective comfort for moral oxygen.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve the color of wonder—tightens once: the fragment’s last heartbeat is dramatized in the drip. Escalation is Accumulative/Textural: each bell’s uptake increases the density of transmitted awe; no external antagonist needed. Cost is the ice’s extinction, legible in the final droplet. Lacks a second tightening or tactical loss, so stays below 8.8 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: resolve escalating internal static before fragmentation. Miniaturize-and-burn sequence is meaningful tightening; each seed compressed = smaller but hotter choice, visible violet buzz as price. Agency remains android’s; no outside rescue. Stakes stay legible under causal lens; failure cost = endless fragmentation.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—Elena’s voice versus systemic erasure—is signaled by her bleeding knuckles and the sealed letters; the tightening occurs when Marta decides to “show me,” shifting the quest from object-recovery to person-recovery. The price is visible: Elena’s first spoken words, “My Sofia,” carry the cost of twenty years of silence. Agency is shared across the courtyard, which slightly dilutes the personal stakes, but the communal act still forecloses the landlord’s erasure and rewrites the mailbox’s future.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—liberate sealed consciousness-data—tightens once: dance triggers encryption wall to fall. Cost is conceptual but legible: she can never again see herself as random orphan. Agency remains high; each splash is a deliberate decryption keystroke. Pressure peaks when reversal sequence demands she literally un-create her own knowledge path.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to reclaim or rebury excised grief—is signaled in the second paragraph and tightened when the shovel hits crystallized salt. The exhume action itself is the single meaningful escalation; options narrow to keep/break vials, with renunciation as the visible price. No second reversal, but the lens requires only one intensification at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single dominant stake—prevent prophecy from coalescing—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens with every silenced fragment; each compression of luminous script is a visible price that narrows her physical stamina and social future (no one will know). No reversal is needed: accumulation of quieted futures equals escalation. The final dispersal into the sea is earned agency with irreversible cost—she forfeits legacy as surely as the wing forfeits magic.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—will Elara share her secretive avocation—surfaces early. Escalation occurs when Marcus admits his grandmother’s gift, tightening the dyad from neighborly ritual to co-conspirators. Cost is legible: secrecy pact forfeits her solitary refuge, foreshadowed by unsent letters. Agency lies in her decision to teach; coincidence (meteor timing) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will she re-inherit quarantined grief?—is signaled by the first whispers. Mid-story tightening: choosing to dig risks re-traumatization, foreclosing the Institute’s promised peace. Cost is paid in blood from the shell edge and in the explicit line “she’d feel grief anew every dawn.” Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—brother’s life—tightens once: from “I can save him by lying” to “I will save him by telling the truth.” The reversal is driven solely by her agency (burning the two perfected forgeries) and carries an undeniable price (her skills, safety, family legacy). No coincidence; the Emperor’s suspicion is pre-established, so the final confession merely swaps the mechanism, not the jeopardy. Cost is visible: ash on marble = career and heritage erased.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve individual voice vs. join eternal chorus—is signaled in grandmother’s letter and tightens when each spoken name deletes a future option. The decisive intensification occurs mid-scene: “understanding brought sorrow” crystallizes that refusal is impossible without betraying the vanished. Cost is visceral: she forfeits body, time, memory. Agency remains hers; the canyon urges but cannot compel—she “sang herself into the echo,” an active verb that forecloses return.</answer>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
    <comment>The story’s answer to “why some people echo” is never moralized; it emerges as structural fate: perception of inter-dimensional frequency equals invitation to become the medium. The broken shell’s reprise—first as message, finally as substance-becoming-sound—performs a conceptual repricing that reweights every prior echo. Melancholy is the earned emotional aftertaste; universality is achieved through canyon-scale specificity rather than abstraction. No thematic echo verbalizes the thesis; the wind’s whisper is image, not explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—deliver the hidden antidote—emerges late (mid-story) but is tightly linked to the globe; one meaningful deepening occurs when Marina realizes the formula survives in the melted plastic. Pressure is atmospheric rather than tactical; ghosts declare rather than test. Cost is conceptual (lifelong quest accepted) and visible in the ascent, meeting bar for short-form escalation under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—prove that invisible, unpaid labor holds the world—is signaled early and deepens through sensory accretion rather than external opposition. No live option narrows; she does not debate leaving, nor does any villager appear to scorn her. The tightening is purely cadential: the net completes, the whistle fades. Cost is conceptual (her anonymity), not tactical, so escalation plateaus at the threshold of the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“expose hoax vs. preserve sanctuary”—is signaled in graf 1 and tightens when letters prove officials let millions die. One meaningful turn: reburying the letters and diamond forecloses fame, chooses hidden refuge. Cost is legible (“he would tell the story differently”), but pressure plateaus after letter 17; no new external threat escalates further.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will her transmissions birth the epoch she’ll never enter—tightens when dawn signal proves success but also seals her exile. Under accumulative lens, the cadence shift from scattered fragments to synchronous global hum re-weights cost: she gains cosmic agency, loses human future. No swappable antagonist needed; storm & static serve as coherent pressure. Price (irreversible solitude) is legible in her smile that forecloses meeting the Prophet.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“becoming translator”—is signaled at the 25% mark and tightens when Marcus decides to find the owner; the meaningful turn is the hand-off to Elena, which forecloses total anonymity. Cost is legible: he keeps the loft but loses hermetic isolation. Pressure is steady but single-thread; no second reversal, so ceiling stays shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—protect the living covenant—tightens once: remove artifact → silence lighthouses → break ice-truce. Escalation is textural density: each harmonic beat makes the covenant more audible and the cost of defending it more visceral. Agency is renunciation rather than combat; she adapts by dissolving into the very medium the Collectors would mute. Visible price is her human form, traded for perpetual vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—liberate minds via viaduct hack—is signaled early and tightens when the 73-hour window shrinks toward dawn. Each rod placed = incrementally higher risk of detection, a meaningful narrowing under causal lens. Cost is conceptual rather than bodily, but still felt: “freedom always felt like falling at first.” No second reversal, so escalation plateaus just below the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—liberation from systemic control—tightens once: lantern reveals modern bondage equals historic slavery, narrowing Margot’s options to complicity or flight. Escalation is accretive: each memory layer deepens cost until resignation becomes inevitable. No off-stage resolution; coincidence only complicates (rain after drought). Visible price: pension, career, identity as investigator—paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single dominant stake: will Eliza allow Thomas’s apology to become action? Pressure tightens once—when she decides to follow the journal’s instructions—paying the visible cost of reopening filial grief. Escalation is causal under lens: each gear placed = one increment of reopened wound. Cost is legible in the final “steady as absolution” tick, but the beat is quietly observational rather than viscerally felt, keeping it just below 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake signaled early: transcendence vs. corrosion. One meaningful tightening: when acid reacts with kaleidoscopic wings, the survival equation flips from dissolving to illuminating—live option foreclosed for every other glider. Cost is conceptual but legible: the old factory-flight paradigm becomes obsolete. Agency is interiorized invention rather than external combat, fitting Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—find 4827/dad—tightens when she realizes deletion = consciousness scatter; upload becomes only path, foreclosing normal life. Escalation is causal-deductive: each 4827 breadcrumb narrows options until self-archiving is inevitable. Visible price: she pays with bodily existence, legible in final “screen flicker.” One meaningful tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—“map empathy onto action”—is declared early but never materially tested; no tactical option is foreclosed by failure or price. Pressure escalates texturally via mirrored glimpses, yet Mira’s agency stays observational: she looks, understands, accepts apple. No reversal or trade-off occurs; tension plateaus rather than tightens. Closure supplies resonance, not escalation, capping score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—how to live when death refuses—signals early and tightens through acoustic attentiveness: each calving narrows her options from exit to accompaniment. One meaningful deepening at 3 a.m. when large section caves; sound as sigh externalizes her folding inward. Agency is attention-as-renunciation; cost is visceral (bleeding palm) and existential (accepting perpetual witness). No causal reversals, but accumulative pressure under inferred lens suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: can Marcus release the past without erasing it? Pressure tightens once Elena’s daughter appears with the letters—his guarded solitude is punctured. One meaningful turn: he chooses to share the bench and the wine, accepting continued incompleteness as the price of new connection. Cost is visible—the burned edge remains unreadable, a permanent ellipsis that forecloses full closure yet enables hybrid future.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“wisdom echoes fading”—is declared early but remains conceptual; no concrete example of a lost echo is dramatized, so cost feels abstract. Escalation is a single thickening: dimming maps of light signal urgency, prompting the consecration march. The walkers’ agency is collective and ceremonial rather than individuated risk. Hence pressure is atmospheric, not tactical; options narrow metaphorically (memory loss) but never practically threaten a specific clearing or walker. Closure reprices the concept, yet the beat-to-beat tension stays modest.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake: save memory site from erasure; pressure is external (council deadline) but protagonist agency stays curatorial—planning exhibition, not blocking bulldozers. Escalation is soft: photos accumulate meaning, then collective recreation deepens rather than narrows options. No visible personal cost or foreclosed path for Elara keeps tension communal and illustrative. Enough for Accumulative tightening, but lacks a palpable trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—prove language still breathes—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens when the Committee summons her. The escalating beat is the crystal’s song: each echo forecloses the option of conventional testimony, forcing the fractured-sequence stance. Cost is conceptual but visible: she risks institutional exile by refusing their language game. Pressure is coherent under accumulative lens; no coincidence, one meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recovering the sound of aging—tightens when the woman’s reels force Ezra to risk his last memory of knowing. Escalation is accumulative: each prophecy written = another shard of self lost, a pattern that crests when he chooses to help despite guaranteed amnesia. The tightening beat is the moment he hears the grandmother’s voice thinning across decades; options narrow to listen or retreat, and he pays with permanent forgetting. No external antagonist is needed—the conflict is time’s erasure itself.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—prevent the station’s temporal unspooling—tightens via sensory escalation: whine → blur → backward spin. One meaningful intensification is sufficient, and the protagonist’s agency (camera re-focus, fork strike) directly alters the waveform of tension; cost is conceptual (she must stay, archiving gaps) but not viscerally felt on her body, capping the upper band.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—how to shape a communal soundtrack for her own disappearance—tightens once when she commissions the craftsman to preserve the vinyl halves; this single move forecloses secrecy and spends social capital. No antagonist or ticking clock beyond the distant prognosis, so escalation is accretive: each sampled sound thickens the texture of imminent loss. Cost is present but conceptual (her erased future voice in the mix) rather than a felt bodily price on the page. Meets the lens-standard for one meaningful deepening; lacks a visceral trade-off that would punch 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—prevent total awakening—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when the automaton writes backwards, proving the universe is actively erasing knowledge. One meaningful escalation: Lyra realizes her education was containment training, not scholarship; this reweights every prior rune she traced and forces her to invert her own sealing rune at visible cost (solitude, perpetual vigil). Agency remains hers throughout; coincidence does not resolve. Cost is legible in the final whisper of relief and her new forward-writing automaton—permanent guardian duty.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: can Thomas forgive the changeling who replaced his sister? Pressure tightens once: the Council’s charge of unapproved bone-setting forces Thomas to articulate his stance, narrowing options. Cost is visible—he forfeits certainty and the talismanic tooth. Agency remains with Thomas; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—replace the failed lighthouse—tightens once: solitary ritual becomes communal infrastructure. The meaningful deepening is the moment Marina realizes the grotto can amplify personal glow into public path; this narrows her privacy to zero and scales the tactic. Cost is visible: her secret cove becomes village property. Agency drives escalation under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: preservation of self-healing sanctuary vs. urge to teach. Escalation is textural—viral noise presses inward, phone buzz counterpointed by drip—until Marcus embodies the threat/offer of witness. No reversal, but a meaningful deepening: silence breached on her terms with proffered cutting. Cost clear (loss of absolute solitude) yet feels moderate; stakes could sharpen had Marcus carried external consequence (media, legal).

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—will she keep or release the collected hopes?—tightens once, at the shell ceremony; no secondary reversal tests her further. The cost is conceptual (loss of curatorial control) rather than visceral, adequate for lyric mode but short of the visible price that would push the band higher.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—restore the vine or the ceremony stays hollow—is signaled early and tightens through song-layering. Agency is attentive rather than antagonistic: Elara chooses memory over mechanism, song over copper wire. Cost is paid by the community’s admitted emptiness and by the vine’s fragile resurrection, but no live option is foreclosed for Elara herself; she risks no tangible loss. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens, yet the absence of a counter-pressure keeps escalation gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—translate invisible heartbeats into a portable map—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens through each pattern adjustment. Escalation is textural: every added object increases luminous density until the map’s collapse forecloses further revision; the price is the alchemist’s lifetime collection of starlight and the orchard’s partial re-alignment. No antagonist is needed; pressure is ontological. The final sealing act is irreversible, narrowing her future to an existence spent following impossible directions.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can wonder be bottled without breaking time?—is signaled early and tightens through each reflection angle. Escalation is textural: density of temporal anomalies increases until documentation becomes the only viable stance, foreclosing direct repair. Cost is conceptual but legible: Mara abandons mastery for witness, trading control for reverence. Missing a visceral price (bleeding cut, lost tool) keeps it just below 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—reconcile eroded ambition vs archival duty—signals early; pressure tightens when ghost demands “accounting.” One decisive intensification: the finger-touch that liquefies ghost and restarts waters narrows her fate from restorer to memory-keeper with visible cost. Agency is interior-attention rather than external deed; sufficient under Accumulative lens. Coincidence is absent; escalation is steady accumulation of overheard warnings until pattern ruptures.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are signaled early—“equations traditional engineering couldn’t solve”—but never tighten: no leaking joint, no risk of flood or collapse, no external opposition. The single reversal (dry fountain → flowing) is pure success; no option narrows or price appears. Escalation is therefore flat, though coherent under the Causal lens. The resurrection beat would carry cost in a real hydraulic system, yet the text keeps it consequence-free.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether she will re-enter the sonic world—signals in paragraph 3 and tightens exactly once: the decision to accept the post while retaining sanctuary silence, foreclosing a fully safe future. Escalation is situational but coherent: the warming sunrise increases tile whispers, externalizing her rising internal pressure. Cost is legible: she must “bear both worlds,” a scheduling and emotional impossibility that guarantees future strain. No coincidence; the invitation arrives off-stage but her response is entirely agent-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“salvage truth from lies”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens when the confession letter redefines her life’s work. One meaningful deepening suffices: the moment she sees her father in van der Meer’s guilt. Cost is visceral: abandoning the chase that defined her. No antagonist needed; internal pressure coheres under causal lens. Luck merely reveals; it does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—preserve dying knowledge—signaled in paragraph 2; tightening occurs when Mara realizes this rope is the “final record,” forcing tonight’s decoding. No external antagonist; pressure is time + cold + memory loss. One credible loss already paid: fisherman’s death removes future help, visible on page. Escalation is accumulative: each decoded knot increases the weight of what she must carry; final choice to teach tomorrow forecloses rest and risks further exposure—cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—mapping healing before the city dissolves—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each pulled thread and projection thickens the pattern of absences until the final crystallization narrows her life-path to cartographer. No external antagonist; pressure is ontological. Cost is visible—thread burns her wrist, garden darkens, Marcus thins—meets 8-band guardrail for visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—can organic beauty be rekindled inside a mechanised void?—is signalled in paragraph two and tightens through each incremental calibration that could crack the egg. Escalation is textural: every drip of nutrient, every degree of warmth increases density until the asymmetrical hatch reweights the stake; failure and success are simultaneous, forcing earned acceptance. Aldric’s agency drives every beat; no wind or gear solves his problem. The price is legible—his songbird will never match the lost Aurelius, and the mechanical city will never fully stop—but the tightening could be sharper if one adjustment visibly foreclosed a live alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—will she re-enact or rewire her father’s fire?—tightens once: the grafting act forecloses revenge-by-fire, chooses preservation. Pressure builds texturally: each grain of volcanic sand adds weight of memory until refusal is the only exit. Cost paid on-page: lifelong vigilance implied by talisman against sternum. No coincidence; agency is hers alone.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—liberate trapped memories—signals in paragraph 2 and tightens when feather is lifted: geese begin to drift, viscous time liquefies. Protagonist agency is present yet low-heat; cost is conceptual (city’s remembering) rather than personal, keeping it shy of 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—witness and remembrance—signals early; pressure is existential loneliness rather than reversible jeopardy. Tightening occurs as red-giant countdown shortens to “three thousand years, perhaps four,” a temporal lensing that reframes eternity, not options. No resource is lost, no path foreclosed; the gear keeps spinning, the Keeper keeps tending. Cost is affective, not tactical, so escalation stays poetic rather than dramatic, fitting Accumulative lens but capping impact.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake: restoring communal trust in measured time after one illicit turn. Pressure escalates through micro-choices: carving each name (months), climbing stairs (37 years), reading aloud at frozen apex—each act narrows his future to perpetual watchmanship. Cost is irreversible: he forfeits the fantasy of erasure and accepts lifelong custodianship audible in the clock’s new tone. No coincidence; every tightening is self-inflicted and irredeemable, forcing stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: to transmute private grief into caretaking devotion. Tapestry discovery supplies one deepening, not escalation—knowledge widens, stakes stay flat. No reversal narrows her options; she begins and ends as night gardener. Cost is conceptual (clock silence), not tactical or emotional on-page. Pressure remains reflective; therefore capped below 8.2 required for 9-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—seed innovation without triggering backlash—tightens once: the Council must leave believing they birthed the ideas. No reversal is needed; pressure accumulates as Mira’s maps silently rewire their discourse. The felt price is legible in her solitary smile and the footprints that outnumber her own—she wins but remains invisible, a cost of eternal anonymity. Agency is pure attention and design; the tightening forecloses her ever claiming credit.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reignite collective imagination—arrives with the first pirate lyric and tightens when Mariel decides to “mix ambient particles… with ink,” risking discovery. One clear escalation beat: the broadcast names her (“the copyist her vigil keeps”), raising personal risk and foreclosing retreat. Cost is conceptual (if caught, she vanishes) but not yet physically felt; hence tension is strong but not viscerally painful. Agency remains hers throughout; no coincidences rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—temporary safety versus ultimate exposure—tightens when Marlene scatters the portrait rather than preserve it, foreclosing her own redemption. Escalation is accumulative: each completed portrait increases institutional attention (sirens approach). Cost is visible: Thomas dies mid-portrait, his last breath lost between shadow and highlight. Agency is renunciation; she could hide but instead obliterates evidence under officers’ boots.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—control of historical truth—tightens when Marcus realizes the university already knows the forbidden narrative; his option to keep exposing reports collapses, replaced by shared subversion. Agency stays active: he confronts, rejects, then chooses collaboration. Cost is loss of moral high ground and solitude. Escalation is single but meaningful; no coincidence resolves the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—can the art survive institutional erasure?—tightens when the security guard’s 9 p.m. warning forecloses rehearsal extension, converting library time into finite currency. Chen’s agency is renunciation: surrendering the heirloom alters tactics for everyone, turning preservation into itinerant practice. Cost is visible: she forfeits both her professional role and her last tangible patrimony in one evening. Pressure escalates once, but meaningfully, under Accumulative lens; the modes swell from three to five through collaborative density rather than external antagonism, keeping this short of the 8.8 band where a second, sharper price would be needed.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve collective memory against Ministry forgetting—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when seed sprouts sideways into visible rebellion. Price is legible: if Ministry burns the garden, memories only root deeper, a felt cost crystallized in final line. One meaningful deepening suffices, but agency is more observational than tactical; escalation is atmospheric, not option-narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—save the last bees and the city’s food chain—is signaled early. Tightening occurs when Mira realizes the drones are dead and her secret is now the only pollinator path; her broadcast closes every escape route. Cost is legible: loss of secrecy, potential prosecution. Agency drives every beat; no coincidences resolve. One meaningful turn suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—understand the creeping wrongness—tightens when the shard reveals the beach’s temporal slippage, foreclosing her observer safety; cost is the act of surrender itself. Escalation is accretive, not causal, fitting the chosen lens. One visible price: she forfeits sole witness status by planting the shard in the sand. Could wish for a mid-scene complication that tests her resolve, but the quiet accrual aligns with hush concept.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—whether the city’s secret will be weaponized or witnessed—tightens when Marina realizes her own complicity in the scholarly lie; the dolphins’ breach flashback shows the price already paid. Agency rests in Thessaly’s decision to share and Marina’s to reframe, each foreclosing denial. Cost is visible: Thessaly’s eternal paralysis as living monument, Marina’s sacrificed academic certainty. One meaningful escalation suffices; no reversal inflation needed.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—can Marcus force the closed system to rupture?—is signaled early and tightens via each roll that micro-fractures the die. Agency is present but attenuated: climbing and rolling are iterative, not decisive turns; the “rupture” remains prophecy until the final clause. Cost is conceptual (lifetime spent) rather than tactical loss on the page, so escalation feels atmospheric more than acute. Still, the mathematical proof that the loop equals a lifetime gives the stake a measurable pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—”proving strangers remember kindness”—is declared late and remains abstract; no external obstacle or potential loss is ever foregrounded. Escalation is textural: each new symbol adds density rather than narrowing live options. The online response delivers confirmation but no visible price, so pressure plateaus rather than tightens. Still, the communal deepening satisfies under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—rescue of dying arts from literal dissolution—is signaled by paragraph 2 and tightens once: the moment the ceiling begins to weep, archiving becomes a race against physics. Agency is endurance/attention; the option she forecloses is rest or escape. Cost is palpable—charcoal smears, wet paper, imminent erasure—but the escalation is a single intensifying gradient rather than a reversal; therefore slightly below 8-band ceiling. No coincidence resolves; the thaw complicates, it does not save.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—restore or destroy the hunger stone—signals early and tightens once: each lens piece removed increases latent radiance, narrowing options to inversion or death-by-void. Escalation is causal under the Causal lens; no coincidence. Protagonist agency drives every turn; price is the perpetual caretaker role she accepts. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length; no secondary reversal needed.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—free herself from nightly compulsion—signaled in paragraph 1. Pressure tightens through each failed prior night, then crystallizes when the backward paradox forecloses escape: she must confront child-Fear or remain cursed. Protagonist agency drives every beat: steal clasp, return nightly, read notes reversed, speak recognition. Cost legible: she gains control but must forever house Fear in the clasp; carnival silence is the price she pays.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes—freedom vs. imploding spiral—tighten through ascending resonance frequencies that literally narrow the physical space; the whales’ bass note is the decisive escalation that forecloses retreat. Cost is continuous: bodily exhaustion, sonic overload, and the promise of eternal itinerancy encoded in the star-coordinates.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—exposing the Valorian forgery—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when Marcus arrives to stop her. The meaningful turn is the live choice to burn (or glow) the letter’s secret via telegraph; this narrows her future to permanent fugitive status. Cost is conceptual but legible: the Ministry’s power will now actively hunt her and her network. Escalation is causal under the lens, not spectacular, yet sufficient for the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—rescue stories from erasure—tightens via each surveyed detail until the bottle act forecloses public testimony. Agency is accumulative: note-placing ritual deepens until final cement seals both pavilion fate and his own silence; cost is legible (condemnation tomorrow, solitary archive). No external antagonist, but water pressure suffices. Missing a second tightening beat that would force trade-off → holds at 8.3.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single stake—preserve authentic memory—tightens when the blackout clock and electromagnetic restart threaten erasure. Agency is continuous: each stamp strike is an irreversible act that forecloses the option to re-mark later. Cost is visible (time running out, ink limited, systems rebooting) even if the corporate culpability stays off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—transform grief before it corrupts—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens through each successive gem. The deepening is accumulative: each crane-gem forecloses nostalgic retreat and raises the cost of continuing. Agency stays internal yet visible; the final lantern-installation is the visible price. Escalation is steady, but because pressure is lyrical rather than causal, the peak feels plateau-adjacent rather than sharply narrowed.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—liberate trapped potential—signals on page 1. Tightening is the cooling countdown; option foreclosure occurs when security bolts slam, forcing the upload gamble. Agency stays with Amira; cost (arrest, data confiscation risk) is visible. Escalation could be sharper if the breaker threat had one earlier hiccup, but pressure suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes—“decode the frequency of belonging”—stay abstract; no concrete price (time, social credit, bodily risk) is risked or lost. Escalation is a smooth accumulation of chips, not a tightening that forecloses options. The final chord feels inevitable but not costly; pressure plateaus rather than spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—whether Elias will keep manufacturing lies or confront the family crime—tightens the moment the coordinate map emerges. One meaningful turn: he chooses renunciation, forfeiting wealth and protection. Cost is legible in the final image of the abandoned hand; pressure escalates cleanly under the causal lens without requiring external antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—will she trade revenge for reconciliation—signaled in paragraph two. Tightening occurs when she hands Thorne the pull: gesture forecloses refusal, stakes a public ethic. Cost visible: she swallows her brother’s death, accepts apology as partial payment. Agency remains hers; Thorne’s son’s fate hangs on her moral calendar, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—can Marcus re-enter relationship with the sea without repeating fatal error?—is signaled early. Pressure is steady but flat: each pole passed marks incremental self-forgiveness rather than narrowing options; the seal cameo supplies gentle external affirmation instead of risk. No tangible consequence jeopardizes the present outing, so cost is retrospective (27 deaths) rather than immediate. Closure reweights meaning but does not escalate stakes on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can a man who forgets his crimes still repair the damage?—is signaled by line 3. Escalation is single but meaningful: the lake reveals the labyrinth, forcing Marcus to choose self-imposed penance without hope of absolution. Cost is conceptual yet legible: he forfeits the comfort of oblivion, embracing lifelong unrequested restitution. Pressure would sharpen if one bridge briefly faded, threatening literal collapse; as is, escalation is cerebral, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—touch Kess’s consciousness again—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when the scent dissolves Mira’s last retreat. One meaningful deepening: every beast-imprint she ever hosted turns from memory into doorway, foreclosing human-only existence. Cost is visible—skin prickling, edges blurring, fortune blanking—paid on the page. Agency is interior but active: she uncorks, surrenders, and bridges worlds.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reclaim lost time for her child—arrives with the first saucer glow and tightens when the mother’s apparition offers dialogue; escalation is one steady deepening rather than multiple flips. Agency sits in Elara’s decision to lay the onyx cards in the forbidden pattern, an act that visibly costs her palm-blister and emotional choke. Persistent constraint: the saucer can only catch one drop; once used, the chance ends—this shapes her careful timing and primes the price. Resolution preserves guilt, so consequence stays on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—open shadow dimension or remain sole human—surfaces early. Pressure tightens once: the tear drop dissolves the photo, foreclosing retreat. Agency is interior (acceptance) rather than overt struggle, fitting Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual (she becomes “first human complete”) but not materially felt, keeping the score below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.0)
    A single dominant stake—ignite a bloodless uprising—tightens when each coded angle forecloses the option of delay; the blackout is the visible price already paid. Agency is collective rather than individual: Thorne and Amara wager careers, lives, moral clarity, but the scene keeps the personal cost off-page, capping intensity. Escalation is steady but once-only; no second reversal raises the ante. Still, the “cradle of sparks” concept reweights every subsequent gesture under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will Yann remain passive witness or become active keeper—tightens when she chooses to place stones for a future apprentice, trading immediate certainty for generational responsibility. The tightening is textural: each stone adds weight to her inherited burden rather than alters external options. The cost is conceptual but visible: she accepts perpetual double-vision (“living each moment twice”) without release. No external antagonist is needed; frictionless time itself supplies the coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: preserve/circulate forbidden language under total surveillance. Pressure escalates by each three-minute increment and by discovery of the censored negatives; options narrow to invisibility or capture. Agency: she chooses further sublimation rather than exposure, paying with permanent self-censorship. Cost is visible—she locks the new envelope at dawn, perpetuating exile.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—can encoded dissent survive Academy dogma?—is signaled early. Escalation is intellectual: each syllogistic thrust sharpens the angle-code, narrowing options from debate to covert alliance. No tangible price on-page (no expulsion or broken arm), so cost stays conceptual; thus just shy of 8.5. Agency resides in their decision to keep fencing as code, foreclosing open revolt, satisfying causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—preserve the blooming resistance by finishing the anthology—tightens once: the moon’s appearance shifts the risk from abstract to immediate, forcing her to decide whether to seal the tin and leave or finish the page in plain light. The cost is legible: she stays, completing the manuscript while accepting possible surveillance. No reversal, but the deepening of temporal pressure under the Accumulative lens is sufficient at 750 words. Escalation is driven by her agency, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: can Marion bend spacetime to recover Sophia before magnetic chaos seals the sky-road. Pressure tightens exactly once: the hand-condensation proves live presence, forcing Marion to abandon safe repertoire and risk tearing the corridor. Price is paid immediately—compasses permanently reorient, foreclosing return to old flight paths. The choice is hers; coincidence only complicates, never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—save/disband the Ninth Island—is signaled in paragraph one. Tightening occurs when contradictory myths refuse convergence, forcing her to invent a new epistemic category rather than reject the island. The monsoon deadline supplies visible price: classify now or the storm erases everything. Agency is intellectual, not physical, but still forecloses her former career path.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—will Kenji break his silence?—is signaled early. Pressure tightens accumulatively: each row of lace, each compass twitch, each student snip adds weight until the cerulean color forces the stance shift. No external antagonist; the conflict is internal and situational. Cost is conceptual but legible; a viscerally felt price would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—redefining knowledge acquisition—is signaled early and deepens via Elena’s renunciation of grant-driven science. Pressure tightens when she stops attending meetings, foreclosing professional paths. Agency drives escalation: her daily observations yield actionable data that alters real-world outcomes (demolition halted). Cost is felt in lost career capital but outweighed by earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to perpetuate or end her father’s poisoned artistic legacy—is signaled early and deepens when she realizes the “luminescence” was radiation. Her agency crystallizes in choosing warning over replication, renunciation over resurrection. The escalation is driven by her own retracing of dates against memory, culminating in a Charged Poise: folded ledger against her heart, walking toward unknown purpose. Cost is unmistakable: she lets the world mourn her death to sever the toxic chain.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—translating silence into music—is signaled early and deepens when Mira shifts from documenting to composing. The meaningful tightening occurs when she selects the 432 Hz fork, triggering a golden thermal ripple that resembles “sheet music… written in degrees.” Cost is legible: her tears freeze mid-realization, embodying the emotional toll of creating beauty from loss. Pressure coheres under Accumulative logic, with each plant response escalating thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—giving rest—is signaled in the first paragraph and deepens when Silas realizes civilizations need burial too. His agency drives escalation: he chooses to follow coordinates, transform the library, and stay. Cost is legible: he abandons his mortuary and mortal life. The Sleepless Librarians’ exhaustion crystallizes the moral calculus—someone must witness endings so others may sleep. Pressure tightens once, decisively, when the lens pulses and he accepts his role.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—dignity amid erasure—is signaled early and tightens when Marta realizes giving without acknowledgment preserves worth. The meaningful deepening occurs at the basket’s arrival: her tactic shifts from solo charity to catalyzing communal reciprocity. Cost is legible in Marta’s exhaustion (“She was tired now”) and the officials’ bafflement—their power rendered irrelevant by a network they can’t co-opt. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens; no off-stage resolutions.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—accessing the repository of unused love—is signaled early and deepens via breathing rituals that narrow perceptual options. Mae’s agency drives escalation: uncorking the tear, releasing photos, choosing to give rather than take. Cost is unmistakable: years of captured solitude dissolve, leaving her “empty and full.” Coincidence (buying the tear “on impulse”) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the real turn comes from her conscious breath pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—liberation from retrocognitive imprisonment—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes she *contains* the past rather than being trapped by it. Her agency drives escalation: stepping onto the bridge, accepting the fragment’s dissolution, laughing into the foliage. The cost is palpable—the erasure of all alternate selves—and directly shapes the final stance: gardener of time itself. Coincidence never resolves; insight arises from embodied traversal of the maze’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—breaking artificial scarcity through seed dispersal—is signaled early and tightens via the arrow’s arrival, which narrows Marcus’s options from passive endurance to active liberation. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: decoding the piano, snapping the chain, harvesting seeds. Cost is unmistakable: his freedom is inseparable from carrying “ten thousand possible futures,” and the Authority’s sterile world must be undone one garden at a time. Coincidence (arrow shot through window) complicates but doesn’t resolve—he still must act.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—capturing the sound of broken trust—is signaled early and tightens via Elena’s iterative failures, culminating in the forge-imprinting act that forecloses all prior methods. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she chooses to collect absences, not wait for sound. Cost is felt in cellular renewal (“each generation slightly different”) and the weight of ancestral grief. Coincidence (aurora shifts) complicates but never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—uncovering hidden emotional truth beneath aestheticized memory—is signaled early and deepens when the seventh portrait reveals longing masked as joy. Cassia’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to reinterpret, not steal, forcing the mother to confront painful clarity. Cost is felt in the mother’s grief-turned-relief and Cassia’s isolation. One meaningful tightening suffices, though a second tactical constraint (e.g., time running out) could heighten pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—crafting safe spaces for unanswerable questions—is signaled early and deepens through Marina’s self-narration and sphere-making. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: each sphere placed reclaims authority from the plant’s failed systems. Cost is unmistakable: her abandoned studio, the exclusion zone’s danger, the weight of inherited trauma. The young couple’s arrival crystallizes stakes—safety must be actively forged, not assumed.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—identity truth vs. manufactured oblivion—tightens when Marcus realizes his fears are programmable. The single meaningful deepening occurs when he decodes the reversal sequence, transforming vulnerability into tactical advantage. Cost is legible: Jake’s collapse shows the price of weaponized fear, while Marcus’s continued performance as stunt double implies ongoing risk. Coincidence (child on set) complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency lies in Marcus’s decryption and confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—mapping the endless night—is signaled early and deepens when she realizes the star’s fade is pedagogical, not terminal. This protagonist-driven insight narrows options: she must embrace patience, foregoing immediate closure. Cost is visible in her stiff joints and decades of isolation, yet escalation remains coherent under Accumulative lens. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; her epiphany arises from seven years of observation, making the deepening feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—locating thought’s origin—is signaled early and deepens via the temporal module’s installation. The meaningful tightening occurs when Seven touches the violin across seventeen timelines, narrowing possibility into unified perception. Agency is fully his: he chooses to approach, to touch, to return to mopping with new awareness. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: consciousness is recast as eternal maintenance, foreclosing any escape from cyclical labor. Coincidence (the violin’s presence) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the insight comes from his action.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—truth versus protection—is signaled early and deepens when Mira admits eavesdropping, narrowing options. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her misdirection and his silence compound until Marcus’s confession forces resolution. Cost is unmistakable: months of frozen trust, professional risk, emotional isolation. Pressure coheres under Causal lens, with one decisive tightening that reweights their future.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    The dominant stake—defying quantified luck through gardener-planted truth—is signaled early and deepens when Marta confronts the Academy-rejected woman. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: each polished marble represents a past victory that informs present action, culminating in the transfer of a new marble—a tactical shift from solitary resistance to mentorship. Cost is unmistakable: forty years of beautiful lies, the inspector’s disbelief, the ever-present threat of institutional erasure. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with no coincidental resolutions.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—proving time’s lateral movement—is signaled early and tightens when Vasquez’s warning introduces external pressure, forcing Ira to choose between duty and discovery. The escalation is driven by Ira’s agency: pulling the lever further deepens the anomaly, triggering resonance with atmospheric processors and intensifying paradoxical physics. Cost is unmistakable—the station shudders, systems destabilize, and professional trust frays—but remains conceptual rather than personal (e.g., no injury, expulsion, or irreversible loss). Under an Accumulative lens, the deepening reweights reality itself, satisfying escalation with a single, decisive intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—completing interrupted art—is signaled early and deepens when Marcus realizes Elisabetta needs performance, not remembrance. His agency drives escalation: transcribing alone, then playing, then stepping deeper to stand where she died. Cost is unmistakable: risking drowning, professional ridicule, and the program’s total loss. The tightening occurs at the final movement, where physical immersion becomes necessary to access the last note—a trade-off between bodily safety and artistic fidelity.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving a truth that official systems erase—is signaled early and deepens when Mira finds the hidden illustrations. Her agency drives escalation: she occupies margins, decodes logs, calibrates instruments, draws, and smudges. The aurora’s arrival isn’t coincidence; it’s the condition her research anticipates. Cost is felt in her solitude, fever, and the deliberate erasure of her authorship—she forecloses career credit to protect the impossible. One meaningful tightening suffices, and this one reconfigures what “observation” means.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—appraising “the weight of a swallowed truth”—intensifies through radio confessions that narrow Marcus’s options from curiosity to custodianship. His agency drives escalation: adjusting frequencies, tracing walls, choosing non-interference. Cost is unmistakable in the “metal dust” residue and pre-dawn emergence carrying eternal shifts in his bones. Coincidence (radio picking up relevant calls) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the valve’s discovery stems from his methodical movement, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving transformative truth over static record—is signaled early and deepens through the swan’s unfolding “map of becoming.” The meaningful tightening occurs when explorers arrive: her refusal to speak forecloses connection but protects her ecology, exacting social cost. Pressure escalates texturally (mushroom-words, book-trees) rather than causally, fitting the Accumulative lens. Though stakes remain abstract, their visceral embodiment in decaying paper and river sediment makes cost undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—nurturing wonder through ordinary magic—is signaled early and tightens decisively at totality when Elena must choose between keeping or releasing the curl. Agency is clear: her flute-playing initiates the harmonic bridge that enables release. Cost is unmistakable: the curl vanishes, but its purpose is fulfilled through Sofia’s new melody. Escalation is driven by protagonist choice under Accumulative pressure, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving stories against existential erasure—is signaled early and deepens when Thrain deciphers the tapestry’s true function. Her agency drives escalation: probing diaries leads to axis revelation, which crystallizes her role as echo-tender. Cost is conceptual yet undeniable: she accepts eternal solitude so stories survive the next displacement. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each tactile discovery tightens focus until knowledge reconfigures reality itself.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—control over narrative fate—is signaled early and deepens when Chen shifts from orchestrating others to composing his own exit. The tightening occurs when he reads “TRANSCEND” in the beam, forcing a trade-off: remain the hidden conductor or become the music. Cost is felt in his deliberate erasure (blank slips, abandoned tools). Agency drives escalation; coincidence complicates (misdelivered fortunes) but never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—illuminating unexamined assumptions—is signaled early and tightens via Marcus’s rhetorical loops, which narrow the demon’s ontological footing. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each question peels back layers of certainty until the possession unravels “like a sweater with one pulled thread.” Cost is felt in the woman’s reclaimed breath and the visible dissolution of inherited truth. The seventeen-minute clock adds urgency but isn’t mechanically tracked; minor deduction for slight vagueness in temporal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reconciling memory and prophecy in a non-linear self—is signaled early via the fortunes and deepens as exhaustion approaches. Mei’s agency drives escalation: she arranges slips in a spiral, conducts them into symphony, and chooses to embrace the “eternal now.” Cost is legible in her bone-deep fatigue and the foreclosed path of ordinary dreaming. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure tightens not through plot reversals but cadence shift—the swirl of fortunes becoming snow, each a “moment perfectly placed”—reweighting her entire existence around this climactic stance.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—conquering the labyrinth of self—is signaled early and tightens when the elderly Kira declares “refusing to choose murders you across all of them.” Protagonist agency drives escalation: pressing the rune forces irreversible unification. Cost is unmistakable: loss of gravity defiance, dissolution of alternate lives, and acceptance of singular mortality. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—fractures intensify until collapse becomes necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—defeating emotional permafrost—is signaled early and deepens through Lucia’s agency: she modifies the phonograph, chooses reverse playback, and trusts vibration over memory. The tightening occurs when the backward symphony “crawls up through her bones,” forcing a trade-off between clinging to past sound and embracing present sensation. Cost is unmistakable: surrendering the identity of a hearing teacher to become one who listens with marrow. Coincidence plays no role; every escalation stems from her deliberate, wounded choices.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving truthful records—tightens when Elena realizes her data aids rebellion. Agency drives escalation: she intuits surveillance, shifts tactics laterally, then chooses redundant hidden caches. Cost is conceptual (her life’s work was co-opted) and tactical (she must now hide her work). The northern breach looms, but resolution hinges on her stance, not external rescue—pressure crystallizes without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving lost beauty through memory—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: uncorking the vial escalates pressure by triggering irreversible olfactory recall. Each extinct scent narrows Elara’s options, culminating in her acceptance of becoming a “living archive.” Cost is unmistakable: her human identity dissolves into luminous stewardship (“She was the perfume now”). The ultraviolet lamp’s mechanics consistently shape attempts, ensuring escalation stems from her choices, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding the texture of time through impossible moral choices—is signaled early and tightens through each revealed layer. Marcus’s agency drives escalation: he commands “Show me another layer” and “Pattern it forward,” forcing deeper confrontations with ethical complexity. Each turn narrows options (truth vs. silence, justice vs. mercy) and exacts felt cost—hollowed souls, lifelong penance. The final beat crystallizes stakes without resolving them, honoring the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—rekindling music without restoring the past—is signaled early and deepens when Mara shifts from tentative notes to embracing imperfect harmonies. Agency drives escalation: her choice to play slower invites others, whose damaged instruments force new compositional rules. Cost is unmistakable: no coins fill the bowl, only sea glass and drawings of the lost forest. The tightening forecloses Echo Harbor’s old “polished performance” forever, paid in warped wood and wheezing reeds.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—harvesting usable half-truths before the grotto seals—is signaled early and escalates through tactile urgency as static intensifies. Vera’s agency drives deepening: she chooses which emotions to capture based on client needs, resisting the pull to absorb them herself. The meaningful tightening occurs when she aligns the petal with her heartbeat to “fuse insight with empathy,” narrowing options to ethical precision. Cost is felt in the widower’s anticipated relief versus Vera’s ongoing emotional abstinence.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—honoring unacknowledged contribution—is signaled early and deepens when Margot chooses personal delivery over bureaucratic forwarding. This tightening forecloses her old transactional path (“Business complete”) and forces emotional risk. Cost is visible: time diverted, vulnerability in confronting estranged siblings, investment in uncertain community work. Escalation is driven by Margot’s agency under Accumulative pressure, not coincidence; the mistaken envelope complicates but her choices resolve. One meaningful deepening suffices, and it carries conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—belonging through shared memory—is signaled early and deepens when the search shifts from individual creation to collective ritual. Kira’s dedication escalates from solitary sculpture to organizing youth, then leading the village descent, each step narrowing her isolation while risking rejection. The cost is conceptual but palpable: the first artist’s self-exile represents the price of failed connection, now reversed through communal effort. Agency remains Kira’s throughout; the resolution arises from her persistent action, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring time’s cadence by uncaging extinct creatures—is signaled early and tightens when Marina realizes borrowed time steals final moments. Her agency drives escalation: completing drawings forces Morteus to awaken prematurely, foreclosing the city’s reliance on dream-minutes. Cost is unmistakable: sculptors panic as their resource vanishes, and Marina accepts this societal consequence. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with density increasing toward the resonant reconfiguration of time itself.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding Elias’s disappearance through “the mathematics of emotion”—is signaled early and deepens when the glass eyes activate the orchard’s latent equations. Morrow’s agency drives escalation: her months of mapping, precise placement of eyes, and interpretive leap transform passive grief into active communion. The cost is conceptual yet palpable: she must abandon hope of physical return to embrace a new ontology of love. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via sensory and symbolic density, not external opposition, which fits the introspective design perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving unrecorded memory—is signaled early and deepens when Edgar realizes his caches are reciprocated. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: lowering the light initiates the archivist’s revelation, which reconfigures his entire existence. Cost is unmistakable: thirty-seven years of isolation rendered obsolete in one gasp. Coincidence (power outage) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the turn hinges on Edgar’s choice to gift the light.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding plants through participation, not observation—is signaled early and deepens when Marcus’s body betrays his scientific detachment. His agency drives escalation: choosing to stop resisting, then walking deeper into the nursery. The cost (loss of humanity) is legible in his green-tinged nails and merged palm. Coincidence never resolves; the storm merely activates what his lineage and choices have prepared.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—access to pure water for truthful art—is signaled early and deepens through the encounter. The tightening occurs in the exchange: giving up generational heritage for ephemeral clarity forces a trade-off with irreversible cost. Agency is clear: Mara chooses to taste, then paint, transforming passive grief into active witness. The rising tide adds external pressure, but the true escalation is internal—her shift from documenting the dead to resurrecting the lost through art.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—seeing true reality—is signaled early and deepens when the pearl blinds Vera’s foresight, forcing her to rely on present sensation. The tightening occurs in the cave: her agency shifts from passive seer to active witness, choosing to “inhabit” the shadows. Cost is felt in the loss of her old gift and the humility of unknowing. Though the conflict is internal, pressure accumulates texturally via the cave’s escalating sensory demands, culminating in a stance crystallization that forecloses her former identity.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.2)
    The dominant stake—learning to read absence as language—is signaled early and deepens through Kessa’s staggered intervals, which narrow her archival tactics to match environmental conditions. Her agency drives escalation: arranging fragments emotionally, incorporating the valve’s whisper, curating constellations of loss. Cost is visible in every incomplete artifact and the irreversible corrosion of communal memory; the exile’s end doesn’t restore but transforms, demanding new literacy in gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—mapping the unmappable—is signaled early and deepens as arrows lead to the fortress. Pressure escalates via spatial impossibilities that challenge Elara’s training, forcing her to trust artistic intuition over analytical rigor. The cost is conceptual: she forfeits the comfort of documented reality for liminal truth-seeking. Agency is clear—each step is a dare—but the escalation leans slightly more on accumulation than protagonist-driven reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reconciling empirical truth with inherited intuition—is signaled early and tightens when the tile links whale songs to star maps. Elena’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to transcribe rather than discard, deepening her entanglement with the mystery. The cost is conceptual but felt: surrendering the illusion of separable knowledge systems. Coincidence (whales arriving during calculation failures) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution emerges from her active synthesis.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—freedom from immortal stagnation—is signaled early and tightens when Thorne’s crew arrives with other fragments. Vex’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to bridge dimensions, foreclosing eternal solitude. Cost is legible in her smile (“first time in centuries”)—a small gesture carrying millennia of ache. The spatial mutiny deepens stakes by transforming exile into collective transcendence, though the Consortium’s threat remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reckoning with intergenerational theft—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Wei breaches the door, forcing Maya to enact her father’s restitution plan. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she *chooses* honesty over evasion, offers records, redefines fairness as acknowledgment over equivalence. Cost is unmistakable: Wei must relinquish revenge for uncertain reconciliation; Maya buries her father stripped of myth. The “mathematics of fair trade” crystallizes under pressure, not coincidence, with visible emotional and moral price paid in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—recovering erased histories—is signaled early and tightens through protagonist-driven escalation: she listens, places the lamp, charts modulations, endures pain, captures fire and princess. Each act narrows options (only night allows listening; only dawn reveals truth) and deepens knowledge (trees remember what records deny). The cost—physical exhaustion, emotional solitude—is felt in her aching fingers and the monk’s silent witness. No coincidence resolves conflict; all pressure arises from her method meeting the site’s layered time.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—bearing witness to erased lives—is signaled early and deepens when Mari recognizes annotators as fellow “administrative ghosts.” Her agency drives escalation: choosing high tides for access, adding her own layer, finally signing. Cost is unmistakable: she foregoes legal identity permanently, embracing “something in between.” The spring tide discovery (“fresh ink, still wet”) narrows options from solitary observer to congregant, crystallizing stance under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—navigating emotional regret through reimagined conversations—is signaled early via Tern’s legend and intensifies when Marina hears voices in the cello’s decay. The tightening occurs when Claudia reveals the compass points to “moments we’re still navigating emotionally,” foreclosing Marina’s myth-busting path. Protagonist agency drives escalation: Marina’s choice to draw the bow unleashes the chorus, transforming passive investigation into active participation with visible cost (her own regrets surface). The stakes remain viscerally felt through concrete objects (shell, cello) rather than abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving autonomy against privatization—is signaled early via graffiti and deepens when developers arrive. Maya’s agency drives escalation: she chooses cultural reorganization over negotiation, narrowing options to legal subterfuge. Cost is unmistakable: surrendering direct confrontation for bureaucratic endurance, with the stone chip’s permanence marking what’s preserved at the price of constant adaptation. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—graffiti density intensifies into protective art.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving evidence of primordial ice—is signaled early and tightens when seismic sensors miss the fissure, making Vera’s documentation urgent. Escalation is driven by her agency: she invents chemical timers, descends alone, and times her vigil to the ice’s final emergence. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits evacuation convenience for six hours of exposure, knowing her work won’t halt retreat but will gift future humanity proof of transformation. The budget committees’ indifference crystallizes pressure without resolving it—coincidence complicates (ice depleting), never solves.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—guiding the Meridian through fog—is signaled early and tightens via the 20-minute countdown. Maya’s agency drives escalation: she chooses exact pressure for the patch, guided by environmental feedback, not luck. Cost is legible in her irreversible reliance on non-visual senses and the burden of being irreplaceable. The deepening occurs when Chen’s question forces articulation of her method, crystallizing her stance without resolving it neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding the river source—is signaled early and deepens when Margot realizes she’s been looking backward. The tightening occurs when condensation aligns with charts, foreclosing her old model and forcing a new risk. Agency is clear: she chooses to share knowledge despite institutional constraints. Cost is conceptual (professional peril) and emotional (trust after isolation), felt in her guarded dialogue and decisive hand movement toward the phrasebook.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring the town’s heartbeat—is signaled early and deepens through communal participation. Agency lies in collective rhythm, not individual heroism, and pressure escalates as more townspeople join, culminating in physical renewal. The cost is conceptual yet undeniable: survival demands daily, intentional movement—a perpetual burden masked as grace. Coincidence never resolves tension; every shift arises from deliberate, shared action under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving/transcending ephemerality—is signaled early and deepens when Maya realizes teammates were absorbed, not lost. Her agency drives escalation: choosing documentation over escape, then deeper descent over surfacing. The tightening occurs when she recognizes the sender isn’t for rescue but communion, foreclosing survival. Cost is visceral: relinquishing sunlight, laughter, coffee—concrete losses that make transcendence costly, not escapist.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—truth versus inherited lie—is signaled early and deepens when Marcus learns the children were already dead. His agency drives escalation: discovering journals, widening the door, threading the labyrinth. The tightening forecloses silence; cost is the imminent discovery of bodies and his own exposure. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each revelation intensifies the moral imperative without coincidence resolving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—repaying an intergenerational debt—is signaled early and deepens when the ghost bride reveals the true debt was *letting go*. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: Marlow’s passive endurance shifts to active acceptance when he grips the bead, enabling her release. The cost is unmistakable: three thieves dead, his own translucence, and the garden’s magical death. Coincidence never resolves; the hundred-year thinning is a persistent constraint, not a deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—forging new myths from fragments—is signaled early and deepens when the illustration plate’s children animate, marking a shift from preservation to co-creation. Agency lies in Calla’s nightly stitching, which forecloses nostalgia (“not restoration, but transformation”) at the cost of accepting irreversible loss. Escalation is driven by her own pattern recognition (three moons ago), not coincidence, and tightens options: only at path overlaps can she sew tomorrow’s threads into yesterday’s fabric.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reconciling exile with belonging—is signaled early and deepens when Miriam realizes the sundial was waiting for her. Agency drives escalation: her choice to position the gnomon crystallizes a stance that forecloses rootless wandering. Cost is felt in her admission “I’m not sure why” (masking dream compulsion) and the months of rebuilding ahead. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each orchard revelation tightens her emotional aperture until the decisive act of completion.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—crafting identities that bridge past/future—is signaled early and deepens via Mira’s decoding of unwritten longing in her client’s letter. Escalation is textural: chalk arcs intensify into “Sender Tilde Fossilheart,” narrowing options to one irreplaceable name. Cost is visible: transience (rain erasure), labor (climate-controlled vault), and emotional weight (“fear transformed into art”). Agency drives every turn; coincidence (postal trucks warming) complicates but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—delivering intelligence before the coup—is signaled early and deepens when Crane confirms closure. Vera’s agency drives escalation: she encodes blood, extracts flame, and sings coded warnings, each act narrowing her margin for error. Cost is unmistakable: her performed frailty exacts emotional toll, and Crane’s visit raises stakes without coincidence resolving tension. The tightening culminates in a final, high-risk stitch under surveillance.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reconnecting with Marina through vulnerability—is signaled early and tightens when the medium chooses to speak rather than write. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: wading deeper, commanding spirits, touching the window—all narrow options toward exposure. Cost is unmistakable: the armor of silence cracks, the shard disintegrates, and healing now requires risk, not just moonlight. The spirits’ song shifting to a childhood lullaby deepens stakes by contrasting past safety with present courage.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—translating loss into renewal—is signaled early and tightens when Maya chooses to interpret the child’s cast, foreclosing her path as a high-stakes negotiator. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each decrypted note deepens emotional exposure, culminating in her own inscription (“Old wounds grow new wings”). Cost is unmistakable—she endures phantom pain to write, then surrenders the coral, accepting that her role now is witness, not savior. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via textual density and communal participation, not causal turns.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring lost joy—is signaled early and deepens when Marina realizes she must display, not just receive, visions. The meaningful tightening occurs when other artists join via the knowledge network, transforming solitary memory into collective resurrection. Agency is clear: Marina’s whisper (“Show me”) initiates escalation, and her laughter marks a turning point. Cost is felt—not permanence, but effort against erasure—and the fog remains, ensuring stakes endure. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the network’s activation stems from her gift and intent.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—certainty vs. wonder—is signaled early and deepens when the garden reflects Elena’s unspoken answers, forcing her to confront recursive time. Her agency drives escalation: flipping the coin, choosing curiosity, rehiding the artifact. Cost is legible in her methodical overpainting—a sacrifice of knowledge for mystery. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; each acoustic shift tightens the existential stakes without external antagonism.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—protecting consciousness from commodification—is signaled early and escalates through protagonist agency: Marcus deploys increasingly sophisticated biological interference. The tightening occurs when Auditors arrive, forcing irreversible choices (Serena flees, Marcus stays). Cost is unmistakable: exposure, separation, and reliance on fragile, living shields. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with each insect release deepening the resistance’s texture and risk.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—transforming pain into generative beauty—is signaled early via the “blossom armistice” and tightens through the poet’s method (half-lullabies) and expanding community. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her initial whisper grows into a global practice that ends wars not by force but by reframing creation itself. Cost is unmistakable—the postcard dissolves, her voice remains cracked, sleeplessness endures—and this price charges the final image of “wounded light.” Coincidence never resolves; transformation arises solely from sustained, flawed practice.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving what humanity has lost—is signaled early and deepens when Mira recognizes her grandmother’s lullaby. The single tightening (bamboo crack widening) forces a trade-off: capture the name before the chime dies. Agency is clear—Mira’s ritualistic skill and swift action drive the resolution—and coincidence (the crack creating resonance) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her expertise does. Cost is unmistakable: the chime’s destruction and the lifelong search’s culmination carry emotional weight that sharpens the final stance (“small rebellion against oblivion”).

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preventing war by restoring linguistic trust—is signaled early and tightens when Elena realizes one misstep could worsen the divide. Her agency drives escalation: choosing “promise-for-promise” translation over word-for-word, despite mentor’s warnings. The deepening occurs when she decodes “eternal rivers” and “mountain foundations,” narrowing options to harmonic reconciliation or catastrophic error. Cost is unmistakable: seven sleepless nights, professional risk, and the weight of two councils’ futures.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—reconciling water rights through hidden interdependence—is signaled early and deepens when Mara discovers the dual-resin seal, revealing mutual longing beneath rhetoric. Escalation occurs through her agency: mapping floodgates that require collaboration, embedding schedules around both festivals and ceremonies. The cost is conceptual yet palpable: neither side gets credit; truth remains encrypted, and Mara sacrifices recognition. Pressure tightens cleanly under an Accumulative lens, with each detail (chain, resin, stone carvings) narrowing the path to a solution only possible through concealment.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming agency over her narrative—is signaled early (“paper trails could be rewritten”) and tightens when Theodore reveals preserved evidence, forcing Margot to confront whether reinvention requires erasure or integration. The deepening occurs through her archival choices: destroying military commendations (foreclosing escape) while preserving tear-stained letters (embracing witness). Cost is unmistakable: she accepts permanent association with the “accident” to steward others’ lost truths. Escalation stems from her agency—sorting letters reshapes her self-perception—not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding why thresholds feel sacred—is signaled early and deepens through Marina’s navigation, which narrows options via weather codes. Agency is clear: each turn is her interpretation of her father’s system, culminating in the choice to continue his work. Cost is legible in the final paragraph: she accepts a life of “featherly determined” bridge-building, forever inhabiting transition. Pressure tightens once meaningfully—at the center—and remains coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—understanding the city’s celestial dialogue—is signaled early and deepens via the rare stellar alignment. Pressure escalates texturally: feather appears, green radiance spreads, instruments go wild, fish school in constellations. Mira’s agency lies in attention and interpretation, not action, which fits the Accumulative lens, though the cost remains conceptual (ephemeral connection) rather than visceral. Chen’s shift from data to wonder mirrors the thematic turn but doesn’t narrow Mira’s options.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering why paths disappear—is signaled early and deepens when she realizes paths may be “suggestions drawn in sand.” Escalation occurs through her tactile engagement with crater glass, which leaks emotions that narrow her epistemological options. The cost is felt in accumulated fragments that deepen mystery rather than solve it, culminating in her acceptance that the work is endless. Agency lies in her continued return despite futility—a renunciation that forecloses resolution but affirms purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—serenading monotony with orchestrated wonder—is signaled early and tightens through three audience cycles, each narrowing emotional bandwidth (couples → bar crowd → insomniacs). The teenager encounter deepens stakes by testing Marcus’s method against genuine disengagement, forcing improvisation that risks control. Cost is visible in the guitar pick (emotional reciprocity over coin) and the tide’s encroachment limiting performance time. Agency drives escalation; coincidence never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory against state erasure—is signaled early and deepens via Mira’s ritual, which narrows options: success means detection and capture. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (choosing to dance despite risk), and cost is unmistakable (“tonight she was eternal” vs. “tomorrow she would be gone”). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each luminous thread tightening the inevitability of confrontation. The Council’s off-page presence remains a credible antagonistic force without needing physical manifestation.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving intangible value against commodification—is signaled early via the development letter. Pressure tightens when Marcus realizes boundaries “create something new,” deepening his commitment to documentation over protest. Agency is clear: throwing stones initiates communion; photographing patterns becomes resistance. Cost is felt (loss of workshop, handmade art) but could be more viscerally dramatized—e.g., showing the letter’s physical weight or his hands trembling.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—translating private devastation into communal wisdom—is signaled early and deepens when Marcus opens the box to find the rookie’s photo, forcing him to confront his failed calculations. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: his choice to record a message reweights innocence from something lost to something consciously exchanged. Cost is unmistakable in his admission that “innocence wasn’t something to preserve,” paid through vulnerability before his crew. Coincidence (wind shift) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from Marcus’s internal crystallization under celestial pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reconnecting with her grandmother through dimensional travel—is signaled early and deepens via Marina’s evolving understanding that revival means continuation, not return. The tightening occurs when she realizes the balloons are “invitations,” not messages, foreclosing the path of passive longing. Cost is unmistakable: she relinquishes singular reunion for stewardship across infinities. Agency drives escalation—each lantern release is a tactical iteration shaped by prior failures across timelines.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving acoustic memory—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes Voss shared her gift, raising the emotional price of failure. The tightening occurs at the doorway where urgent echoes compel her forward, narrowing options to extraction or abandonment. Cost is felt in her solitude and the fragility of diaries, though escalation leans more on discovery than active opposition; still, agency drives every turn under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—reaching Sophia through painted possibilities—is signaled early and tightens as the city wakes, compressing Maya’s window. The escalation is protagonist-driven: she paints faster, encodes the final verse, and leverages her “mirage” method precisely because time contracts. Cost is unmistakable—the borrowed heartbeat’s strain—and the climax (sparrow singing the lullaby) arises from Maya’s agency (leaving coded paintings citywide). Coincidence (jamming bells) is pre-earned by her prior painting, not a deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—ending three centuries of war—is signaled early and deepened when Mara rejects grievance-recital for shared culpability. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her unorthodox opening forces the Theren to confront justice-as-vengeance. Cost is unmistakable: surrendering heroic self-narratives (“we’re not the heroes”) to embrace survival. The celestial alignment acts as a live clock, compressing tactics into a shadowless moment where posturing fails and only raw admission works.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving extinction through controlled annihilation—is signaled early and tightens when Vera places the egg, accepting public vilification as necessary cost. Escalation is driven by her agency: satellites redirect storms, shell companies displace natives. The trade-off (profit for preservation) sharpens the moral calculus without resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming stolen voices—is signaled early and tightens as each unraveled thread releases an echo that fuels Lyralei’s rebellion. Agency is clear: she chooses understanding over force, coaxes threads apart using courtesan skills repurposed for liberation. Cost is unmistakable: the Academy loses its archive, and Lyralei risks exile, though the emotional price is implied through “lifetimes” in a sigh. Escalation is driven by her accumulating knowledge of past resistance, deepening under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—ethical storytelling—is signaled early and deepens through Marcus’s renunciation of easy consensus. His agency drives escalation: choosing backward narrative structure as resistance, with visible cost (isolation, accusations of exploitation). The “meteor hush” timeframe tightens decisions, making silence an active tactic. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; pressure crystallizes stance through self-imposed artistic constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—transmitting erased history before extinction—is signaled early and tightens when the monarch appears, forcing Mira’s final act. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she builds, encodes, and releases, knowing the signal may vanish unread. Cost is legible in the closing lines—her descent leaves “only the faintest trace”—and the butterfly’s death en route underscores futility-with-purpose. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each structure deepens the weight of what’s being lost.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving forgotten names through imperfect means—is signaled early and escalates via Elsa’s agency: she doesn’t just recover sounds but reconfigures their medium. The tightening occurs when she shifts from passive discovery to active transcription via bronze bells, foreclosing the path of archival purity. Cost is visible in her acceptance of transformation over preservation, paid through labor and emotional vulnerability. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural escalation: density of recovered names intensifies until the climactic self-naming.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding why she walks this path—is signaled early and tightens as water rises and time ticks down. Kira’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to interface despite knowing flood consequences. Cost is unmistakable—she accepts living backward, losing linear selfhood. The storm isn’t coincidence; it’s the temporal pressure valve that forces stance crystallization at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—completing the covenant—is signaled early and escalates through Mara’s precise actions (overlaying charts, speaking numbers). Agency drives every turn: her calculations enable alignment; her voice activates resonance. Cost is felt in her frugal years and crystallized in the final sacrifice of solitude for cosmic connection. One tightening suffices—the tile’s loosening forecloses passive observation, demanding vocal participation. Coincidence never resolves; everything stems from her sustained attention.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—breaking intergenerational violence—is signaled early and tightens when the Magistrate arrives “armor gleaming, jaw clenched.” Marcus’s agency drives escalation: he weaponizes the sanctuary’s logic, using the broken box to force confrontation with inherited rage. Cost is unmistakable: the Magistrate must relinquish vengeance to save his son, a trade-off crystallized in his loosening grip. The deepening (“resentment is a melody that plays whether we listen or not”) reweights the entire conflict under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming a lost cosmic vision—is signaled immediately and deepens when the astronomer admits he saw “the truth of distance.” Pressure escalates through Elara’s method: synchronized breathing is fragile, and the vision collapses when he breaks rhythm, proving its ephemerality. The cost is clear: the dream can’t be held, only carried inwardly. Though the astronomer’s desperation borders on passive, Elara’s agency drives the ritual, and the stakes tighten around what *can* be preserved versus what must be released.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving sight/healing legacy—is signaled early (“quartz eyes... going dark forever”) and tightens when Mira reveals the Council’s doubt, raising relational and professional cost. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to climb, to teach, to reframe tradition. The “breach of contract” isn’t coincidence—it’s the live clock forcing urgency, and her decision forecloses isolation with tangible price (re-engaging trauma). Cost is legible in her trembling hands and the daughter’s tools unexpectedly found.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—accessing forbidden knowledge across time—is signaled immediately and escalates via the curator’s agency: she chooses to follow coordinates, enter the bathroom, bite the apple, carve the shell. Each action narrows options: forgetting becomes remembering becomes re-enacting. Cost is legible in her “terrible joy” and the irreversible entanglement in a loop where discovery precedes origin. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, deepening through sensory and conceptual density.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—accessing wisdom without becoming trapped—tightens decisively in the amber chamber where Mira must renegotiate, not extract. Her agency drives escalation: researching gaps → navigating traps → offering completion. Cost is unmistakable: predecessors’ fossilization, the diary’s blank pages as sacrificial space. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her linguistic skill and ethical stance.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—proving her twin existed—is signaled early via the swatch card and deepens when Coraline reveals the garden grows in narrative threads. Marina’s agency drives escalation: she climbs, follows, questions, and ultimately chooses remembrance over erasure. The cost is felt in Coraline’s softening features and the irreversible burden of being “guardian of the nameless.” Under the Accumulative lens, each image intensifies the weight of absence until the final poise crystallizes stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the Treaty of Merged Borders—is signaled early via Thorne’s seal. Pressure tightens through protagonist agency: each rope configuration deepens knowledge while narrowing temporal options (approaching thirteenth chime). The meaningful turn occurs when Elara weaves new patterns, revealing coordinates to a conceptual space. Cost is unmistakable: she abandons the archive for merged territories, trading stability for paradox.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving equilibrium amid invasive resonance—is signaled early and deepens when the mapkeeper chooses not to expel but integrate the energy beings. Escalation is driven by her agency: interpreting cracks, performing extraction, releasing the bloom. The cost is felt physically (“joints protesting”) and professionally (rewriting maps), altering her future work. Under an Accumulative lens, the crescendo of sound gives way to a cadence shift—silence as active force—not coincidence or external rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reconnecting with lost humanity—is signaled early and tightens when the shard lands, forcing Mira to reinterpret her duty. Agency is clear: she chooses to climb, heal, and realign. Cost is felt in the weight of seventeen years and the risk of further futility. Escalation is driven by her actions under a Causal lens; coincidence (the shard’s landing) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the solution emerges from her unique perception and stubbornness.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving humanity through collective memory—is signaled early and deepens when Lyra realizes truth must resonate to be inscribed. The meaningful tightening occurs when she shifts from recording trauma to capturing the very awareness of loss, narrowing options to only those moments imbued with preemptive nostalgia. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: the world below is lost forever, and identity must be sculpted anew from fragments. Agency is clear—her writing redefines their future.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—defying hopelessness through wonder—is signaled early and tightens when the mosaic message “REMEMBER WONDER” reframes Kaia’s mission from individual artistry to communal resistance. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she adapts her craft using local resources, teaching others to transform despair into light. The cost is felt in the sustained effort (“worked through the evening’s hush”) and the emotional risk of reigniting hope in a starless world. Coincidence never resolves tension; every advance stems from Kaia’s choices under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether to bear witness to time’s transitions—is signaled early and deepens when Chen confesses his prophetic burden. Mira’s agency lies in attention and invitation, not force; her choice to place the cicada in his hand forecloses his escape with quiet authority. The escalation is textural but coherent: each pool observation tightens the thematic screw until the wave’s arrival forces stance crystallization. Cost is unmistakable—Chen’s isolation, Mira’s solitude—and visibly paid in their weary yet hopeful poise.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming safety from claustrophobia—is signaled early and deepens when inversion makes silence tangible. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to harvest during peak disorientation, narrowing options (other guests retreat). Cost is unmistakable: her collection expands, but her father remains unreachable, making her gesture bittersweet. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of quiet intensifies until it must be captured or lost.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—learning to listen to silence—is signaled early and tightens through terrace-specific acoustic pressures. Marcus’s agency drives escalation: he tilts the gondola, chooses routes, teaches reframing. Cost is felt in his constant monitoring and past trauma, and in the woman’s initial panic. Though stakes remain internal, they’re viscerally embodied (knuckles, breath, flinching). One meaningful deepening occurs at the Opal Arch, where her gasp returns “softened and transformed,” narrowing her options toward acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding the stairway’s true nature—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the third mural layer reveals the founders’ rejection of power. Anya’s agency drives escalation: her choice to peel paint layers uncovers escalating truths. The cost is conceptual but undeniable: the throne remains unclaimable, foreclosing any return to autocracy. Sunrise functions as a live clock, though its pressure slightly softens once the mural’s lesson clicks—luckily, the dawn ritual repurposes it beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—teaching suffocating entities to exhale—is signaled early and deepens through the shadow’s encroachment. The meaningful tightening occurs when the Keeper links through her own scars, transforming method into sacrifice. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens: each interaction reweights the cost of her isolation. The price is unmistakable—the ring’s warmth against skin embodies all bridges burned—and directly charges the final image of perpetual readiness.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—transmuting broken promises into value—is signaled early and tightens decisively at the convergence point. Marina’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to descend, interprets glitches, and turns the bolt. Cost is unmistakable—the emotional weight of her pyramid scheme loss becomes the very pressure that forges diamonds. The deepening (“pressure creating, not destroying”) reweights the entire premise with visceral and conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—freedom from generational poison—is signaled early and deepens when Victoria realizes the gift steals secrets. Her agency drives escalation: turning the crank amplifies perception, forcing the climactic choice. Cost is unmistakable: “couldn’t sense the gardener’s resentment” proves her sacrifice. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each wave intensifies moral weight without external antagonists.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—capturing possibility—is signaled early via the program and crystallized in the oath. Pressure escalates through protagonist agency: Aldric reads tree-theorems, speaks forbidden words, takes the puppet’s hand. The tightening forecloses his knightly path (armor dissolves) and forces trade-offs (flesh for quantum state). Cost is unmistakable: blood becomes seeds, solitude becomes cosmic responsibility. Coincidence never resolves; every shift stems from his choices under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—uncovering hidden kindnesses in institutional records—is signaled early and deepens when Timothy’s file reveals layered acts of care (father’s note, social worker’s pencil aside, Helen’s tomato memory). Marcus’s agency drives escalation: he cross-references, photographs, builds an index. The tightening forecloses his initial goal (finding only his mother’s story) in favor of collective witness, with felt cost (lost relationship, ongoing solitude). Coincidence (the fallen button) complicates but doesn’t resolve; his methodical follow-up earns the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving pre-revision truth—is signaled early and tightens when Jakob warns of the raid, forcing Mira to act before the resistance is dismantled. Her agency drives escalation: months of scavenging enable the tunnel descent. The cost is clear: leaders arrested, but their sacrifice becomes tactical cover. Coincidence complicates (the raid), but resolution stems from Mira’s preparation.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—hushing a spreading prophecy—is signaled early and escalates via communal non-performance. Marcus’s agency drives deepening: his “almost playing” initiates the counter-ritual. Cost is unmistakable: forfeited futures, muffled heartbeats, permanent silence. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—decoding the earth’s plea to the skyborne trees—is signaled early and deepens when leaves reveal letters. Mira’s agency drives escalation: her choice to build cairns (not report the speck) triggers the upward-falling leaves and final revelation. Cost is felt (her irreversible transformation), though the “choice approaching” remains collective, slightly diffusing personal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—redefining functionality in a world that demands precision—is signaled early and deepens when Marcus stops fixing and starts listening. The tightening occurs when he moves the compass rose to the greenhouse, narrowing his method to improvisation within chaos. Cost is felt in his social isolation (visitors ask for repairs he refuses) and intellectual surrender to uncertainty. Agency drives escalation: his choices, not coincidence, unlock the clocks’ new temporal language.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding the weight of names—is signaled early and deepens when the coin reveals itself as a measuring device. Vera’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to pour distilled intention, invoking kintsugi as method, not metaphor. Cost is felt in the coin’s breaking and the girls’ shared vulnerability, though the foundry’s danger remains underexploited as active opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—liberating souls through truthful confession—is signaled early and deepens when Mara reframes Thomas’s “sin” as sorrow over lost joy. Escalation is driven by her agency: descending despite danger, humming off-key to model vulnerability, and urging broken music. The cost is legible in Thomas’s dissolution (integration requires surrendering his ghostly identity) and Mara’s ongoing burden (she immediately senses the next soul). Pressure tightens coherently under an Accumulative lens, with each distorted note raising emotional stakes until harmony emerges from dissonance.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—transforming trauma into pedagogy—is signaled early and deepens when Lyra recognizes “every measurement of pain has its inverse equation.” Escalation is driven by her agency: she inverts the mask’s removal, walks into the forest, and chooses to teach. Cost is unmistakable—the child’s tears mirror Lyra’s past, making mercy an active burden, not escape. Pressure coheres under Accumulative logic: each sensory and mathematical detail tightens the thematic screw until the final reconfiguration feels inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—recovering erased histories—is signaled early and tightens when Mira chooses to scrape paint, foreclosing passive observation. Agency drives escalation: her gift compels action, narrowing options from spectator to steward. Cost is unmistakable: she inherits the keeper’s daughter’s burden, trading safety for truth. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens through layered revelations (coordinates, spells, testimonies), each raising emotional and tactical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—exposing institutionalized neglect—is signaled early and deepens via Marcus’s discovery of escalating evidence. Agency drives escalation: his “engagement” with dust and floorboards narrows options toward public exposure. Cost is unmistakable: inheriting his grandmother’s silenced crusade and bearing witness for the dead. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from his skillful observation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving order vs. embracing rupture—is signaled early and deepens when the paradoxical bottle arrives. Moth’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to stay past closing, uncork the whisper, print the silence. Cost is unmistakable: the library sinks, books scatter, her perfect system shatters. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via sensory and conceptual density, not external antagonism.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming Venusian legacy from institutional erasure—is signaled early and deepens when Cassia proves the shard encodes souls, not art. Her agency drives escalation: she interrupts Huang, invokes mirror lore, and finally activates the shard. Cost is unmistakable: risking exile again, defying Beijing Institute authority, and bearing the emotional weight of extinct voices. The tightening occurs when Huang shifts from protocol to curiosity—a live option foreclosed by Cassia’s demonstration.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring truth to break perpetual dusk—is signaled early and deepens when Vex’s lie triggers rust, forcing Elias to weave not just one box but all into the repair. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he chooses collective resonance over solitary fix, accepting the risk of accelerated decay. Cost is unmistakable: Vex crumbles, tools corrode, and Elias’s own body wilts. The tightening forecloses hoarding or secrecy; only shared honesty can restore dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—accessing “hinged awakenings”—is signaled early and deepens when Vera realizes the petrichor “collects you.” Her agency drives escalation: descending, using the compass, filling the vial, then choosing return over passage. Cost is unmistakable—the Hartleys vanished because they crossed—and Vera’s renunciation carries visible opportunity cost (delayed transcendence). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each sensory intensification reweights her choice until the final crystallization of options at the shimmering wall.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—transforming fragments into wholeness—is signaled early and deepens when the slide reveals timewoven alliances, raising the cost from personal craft to collective legacy. Marina’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to carve despite uncertainty, guided by ancestral hands, and endures the storm’s chaos as conductor. The tightening occurs when she realizes technology would have “rushed her past this moment,” foreclosing the necessary pause. Cost is felt in her surrendered autonomy (GPS) and the slide’s inevitable departure, charging the final image with opportunity loss.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—deciphering why beauty hides—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: Mara chooses night work, mixes secret pigments, and ultimately paints tenders, not blooms. The tightening occurs at solstice: understanding transforms her from seeker to inheritor. Cost is felt in her stained fingertips and snow-walk home—she bears the secret alone. Coincidence never resolves; pressure accrues through disciplined labor under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—deciphering truth without destroying legacy—is signaled early and tightens when Marcus warns “reading it wrong could destroy everything.” Amara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to descend, arrange debris, and transcribe despite vertigo. The deepening—learning betrayers were known but forgiven—narrows options: she must preserve myth *and* truth. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: the movement’s purity is lost, yet its resilience is affirmed through human frailty.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reviving hope without erasing history—is signaled early and tightens when Silas rejects the “easy path” of shattering the bottle. His agency drives escalation: he chooses to open himself, transforming memories mid-flow, which deepens stakes from restoration to reimagination. Cost is unmistakable: the bottle crumbles, his body bears the transfer, and he remains the sole witness to rebirth. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via density—each recalled image gains resilience threads—culminating in a reweighted future where arrival is drawn by dreams, not wishes.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving emotional patterns before total cultural erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the shaving reveals a prophecy about tonight. Matthias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to immerse the shaving, transcribe the message, and create a Rosetta stone of feeling. Cost is unmistakable: the northern tower cracks as predicted, confirming irreversible loss. Coincidence (finding the shaving) complicates but doesn’t resolve; his interpretation and labor earn the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reopening the sealed garden—is signaled by the hatched “egg” at midnight. Pressure escalates through Mira’s sorting of entropy, each seed a test of her readiness. The tightening occurs when she realizes borrowed time is “gifted,” shifting her from seeker to steward. Cost is felt in her solitude (“last heirloom seed saver”) and the weight of causality itself; her agency drives every turn without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—timely warning before catastrophic avalanche—is signaled early and escalates through protagonist agency: Mara interprets anomalies, trusts embodied intuition over instruments, and chooses ritual action when logic fails. The tightening occurs when she realizes electronic alerts may be ignored in perfect weather, forcing the higher-cost, higher-authority bell. Cost is unmistakable: she risks ridicule or false alarm, yet pulls anyway; villages evacuate based on her solitary judgment. Luck (tectonic shifts) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the avalanche was detectable via her method, making her response earned.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding meaning in irrelevance—is signaled early and deepens when the still star reframes vulnerability as strength. Pressure tightens not through external threat but internal revelation: observing the star forces a trade-off between despair and faith. Agency lies in attention and documentation (handwritten notes), foreclosing resignation with visible cost (aging body, obsolete post). Coincidence introduces the star, but Kepler-9’s choice to witness and record earns the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving unspoken communal truth—is signaled early and tightens when ghosts gesture toward empty hives and the box. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she lifts the box, reads letters, chooses endurance. Cost is unmistakable: lifelong solitude to tend “museum of unfinished conversations.” Under Accumulative lens, pressure deepens through density—ghosts’ fading urgency, covenant’s legal weight, photographs’ contrast with present ruin—all converging on her silent vow.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—rediscovering how to mark time after numerical collapse—is signaled early and deepens when Marcus realizes Voss’s network demands active gathering, not passive discovery. The meaningful tightening occurs when the urn fragment warms and reveals the “entire network,” shifting Marcus from seeker to teacher. Cost is conceptual (loss of numerical certainty) but made visceral through the texture metaphor; however, no tangible sacrifice or foreclosed path appears on the page beyond implied labor. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, though the absence of a concrete forfeiture slightly softens the price.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding beauty in incompleteness—is signaled early and deepens when the kite breaks, forcing Mira to act, not just observe. The escalation is protagonist-driven: her response to the boy’s loss embodies her philosophy in real time. Cost is felt (the boy’s frozen grief, the splintered frame) and reconfigures meaning without resolving it neatly. Under an Accumulative lens, this single intensification suffices, though a second pressure point could elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving interspecies council against human erasure—tightens when Mira realizes remodeling must target perception, not architecture. Her agency drives escalation: extending the copper network deepens understanding and forces the final stand. Cost is unmistakable: six months of life traded for translation, crystallized in the trustees’ looming arrival. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—understanding whether sacred longing is authentic or engineered—tightens decisively when Elena realizes the first contact occurred millennia ago. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to climb, to scan, to interpret. The cost is conceptual and existential: the loss of unmediated spiritual experience. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens, with each data point narrowing the space for disbelief.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming the battlefield through botanical aggression—is signaled early and deepens via the coachman’s agency: he chooses specific plants that “digest metal implements of war.” Escalation occurs when gulls reveal rising nutrients, prompting him to scatter remaining pods—a tactical shift based on newly interpreted data. Cost is unmistakable: he sacrifices commemoration for consumption, ensuring “no one would remember why anyone had thought this shore worth killing for.” Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each seed placement narrowing the path back to human-centered memory.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—translating distance into closeness—is signaled early via the child’s riddle and deepens when Sage realizes the leaf maps not geography but grief. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she tests the leaf against the phonograph, reads its chromatic pull, and journeys into glass craters. Cost is felt in her solitude abandoned and the emotional risk of hope after decades of corpse-finding. Coincidence (the child’s gift) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the sanctuary exists because others acted, but Sage must choose to believe and follow.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—restoring orientation in a shattered timeline—is signaled early and deepens when Kira realizes her “curse” is a compass. Escalation is driven by her agency: choosing to sketch not the past sky but a future map, transforming confusion into exploration. The tightening forecloses retreat into passive mourning; cost is felt in her irreversible transformation into a beacon. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure grows via density of temporal imagery culminating in purposeful movement by the crew.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—whether to preserve or release wonder—is signaled early and tightens when Renn swaps the pieces, foreclosing her master’s path of hoarded certainty. Agency drives escalation: her crude wooden pieces versus his luminous ice enact a deepening philosophical conflict.

The single meaningful tightening—replacing secrets with questions—narrows options to one resonant resolution under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—bearing witness to erased lives—is signaled early and deepens when the new government demands “witnesses,” forcing Marina to define real testimony versus political theater. Her agency lies in renunciation: refusing to legitimize a system that reduces truth to performance. The cost is clear—continued marginalization—but the escalation is subtle, driven by her internal calculus rather than external plot turns. Under an Accumulative lens, this single, resonant tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering buried talents—is signaled early and deepens when the stone pulses warmth, triggering painful memories that pull her downward. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses planting over prophecy, narrowing her future to one rooted in creation, not foresight.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—redemption through corrected understanding—is signaled early and deepens when Kaspar recognizes the same fatal error in the frozen game. His agency drives escalation: fidgeting → decoding → thread-pulling → board-altering → offering. Each choice narrows options (he cannot leave until he acts) and carries conceptual cost—he accepts he cannot change the past, only its weight. The thunder’s eternal lull embodies the unbreakable tension between action and consequence, reinforcing that some costs are permanent even when understanding arrives.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—freedom of multifaceted truth versus enforced singular narrative—is signaled early and tightens when Kira initiates the poetry chain, foreclosing escape and guaranteeing confrontation. Escalation is driven by her agency: each whispered line multiplies voices, fracturing Silencer control. Cost is unmistakable: she trades life for legacy, and the “forged hush” breaks at personal peril. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of voices replaces linear causality—and the ritual clock (three hours) creates urgent narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving meaning before annihilation—is signaled early and tightens as supports dissolve. Mira’s agency drives escalation: each narration deepens the golden weave, narrowing options until only sacrifice remains. Cost is unmistakable: her life, the workshop, the world. The acid sea isn’t coincidence—it’s the consequence of human alchemy, making the pressure coherent and morally weighted.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—honoring fleeting beauty without demanding permanence—is signaled early via the drying tourist shell and deepens when Marina abandons her usual spot. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses the unknown path, enters the cave, reads the journal, and paints anew. The cost is felt in decades of loneliness and the relinquishment of being “seen” correctly by the world; now she accepts invisibility as necessary. Coincidence (the wrong turn) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the real turn is her decision to understand and continue the work.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—reuniting with Thomas by purifying her intention—is signaled early and deepens through Mara’s realization that his guilt, not death, traps him. The tightening occurs when she shifts from pleading (“Please, come back”) to absolving (“You don’t have to protect me anymore”), which directly enables his return. Agency is clear: her whispered forgiveness, not magic or luck, resolves the conflict. Cost is felt: years of isolation, emotional labor of self-forgiveness, and acceptance of a liminal beloved.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—guiding returnees through lethal terrain—is signaled early and tightens with each call, culminating in Diego’s impossible request from the sulfur fields. Marina’s agency drives escalation: she leverages the censer foot, improvises paths from constellation maps, and admits her own prior traversal. Cost is unmistakable: physical collapse, emotional fracture (“voice breaking”), and the irreversible choice to remain as shepherd. The moon-phase weakness isn’t convenient—it actively impedes her, raising tension as dawn approaches.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—psychological safety through controlled truth—is signaled early and deepens when Mara finds the hidden truffles, proving others sought the same cure. Her agency drives escalation: she prepares the mixture despite doubt (“I’m afraid it won’t work”), and the cost (fourteen months of sleepless honesty) forecloses easy redemption. The tightening occurs at ingestion: success means losing compulsion but gaining moral burden. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with no coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming stolen identity—is signaled early and tightens when Magnus realizes the gaps are his own. His agency drives escalation: probing the flower, timing the beam, decoding scratches. The cost is unmistakable: decades of erased joy, a son’s burden, Elizabeth’s betrayal. The final beat crystallizes stance—keeping watch now companioned by restored memory—under coherent Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—breaking free from selling others’ journeys to living his own—is signaled early and deepens when the chip triggers memory. Marcus’s agency drives escalation: he closes shop, follows ants, presses chip to stone. Cost is legible in the fading paths of unlived lives and the irreversible shift from observer to participant. Pressure coheres under a Hybrid (Causal + Accumulative) lens.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—resolve the bloodline curse or doom the kingdom—is signaled early and tightens relentlessly. Seraphina’s agency drives escalation: she dismisses her guard, climbs despite omens, challenges the grotto, and chooses transformation. The cost is unmistakable: her humanity dissolves mid-scene (“flesh growing translucent”). The grotto’s threat (“kingdom falls tonight”) makes stakes viscerally immediate, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—capturing the “density of presence”—is signaled early and deepens into a renunciation of control (“not to trap but to echo”). The tightening occurs when Lyra admits she’s “approaching this backwards,” foreclosing her old methodology with visible cost: her grandmother’s legacy must be transformed, not replicated. Agency drives escalation; Marcus complicates but doesn’t resolve. Coincidence is absent; every pressure arises from Lyra’s internal conflict made external through objects and dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—distilling chaos into narrative—is signaled early and deepens through Maya’s realization that documentation *creates* chaos. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: her choice to chronicle dreams bleeds timelines, culminating in the grave visit and final writing act. Cost is unmistakable: she loses linear time, original memories, and the ability to distinguish dream from reality. The tightening forecloses the path of naive belief (“stories could save the world”), paid for in feral nostalgia.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—translating unspoken grief into functional time—is signaled early and deepens when Mara fits the screw back “deliberately loose,” accepting imperfection as fidelity. Pressure tightens through Mrs. Huang’s return in fog, forcing Mara to act on her interpretive gift. Cost is legible: Mara’s own sensory loss enables this empathy, and the repaired clock’s “honest” rhythm carries forward both women’s unresolved sorrow. Agency drives escalation; coincidence never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—creating an original rune under pressure—tightens when Kira’s mind empties and her skin betrays her, forcing improvisation. Her agency drives escalation: holding breath, counting crystals, reinterpreting folklore, and finally tracing her scars. Each choice narrows options (no texts, no copied runes) and deepens risk (physical collapse, failure). Cost is unmistakable: lungs screaming, vision sparkling, platform tilting—and the emotional price of confronting lifelong shame.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—whether spirits are parasites or partners—is signaled early and deepens when Vera learns Elisabetta is family, forcing a trade-off between her professional identity and moral repair. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: Vera chooses to dab the perfume, transcribe, and rewrite her column. The orchard’s imminent destruction imposes a live clock that narrows options, and the cost—Elisabetta’s irreversible departure—is felt in every fluttering page. Pressure coheres under the Causal lens without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—resolving cosmic opposition through spiral arbitration—is signaled early and deepens when Kaia realizes preservation/destruction are one helix. Her agency drives escalation: walking the golden spiral unites opposites, turning seventeen endings into a chord. Cost is felt in her acceptance of eternal recurrence (“forget and remember… each ending another beginning”). Pressure tightens coherently under the Accumulative lens without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding what clocks measure—is signaled early and deepens through the countdown, which narrows options to a single, precise moment (zero). The tightening occurs as water fills the cistern, birds fall silent, and the world “holds its breath,” forcing crystallization of insight. Cost is unmistakable: she guards obsolete knowledge, her purpose clear yet isolated, bridging dead mechanical and fading hydraulic systems. Escalation is driven by her agency—counting, listening, recording—not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reconciling security with connection—is signaled early and deepens when Maya witnesses fungal quantum entanglement, which reframes her entire professional paradigm. The escalation is driven by her agency: observation → interpretation → personal application. Cost is legible in her emotional vulnerability (calling Chen) and implied professional upheaval. Under an Accumulative lens, the single intensification (discovering space-bending fungi) sufficiently reweights the stake with credible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reconciling certainty and chaos—is signaled early and deepens when Elena realizes the subway messages reference her father’s heart attack, not the weather. Her agency drives escalation: decoding leads to encounter, which leads to writing her own message. Cost is felt in her surrender of academic detachment; she embraces contradiction as practice, not theory. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens with one decisive intensification at the lantern convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—connection through disconnection—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Eleanor questions her daughter’s existence. Marcus’s agency lies in sustaining the fiction, narrowing his own world to serve others’ fragile truths. The cost is felt: his total isolation, implied by “these orphaned conversations [as] his only human contact.” Escalation occurs through accumulation, not causality, but under the Accumulative lens, the deepening of Eleanor’s vulnerability and Marcus’s commitment constitutes valid pressure with clear emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving truth vs. granting peace—is signaled early and deepens when Mara learns Thomas caused the fire. Her agency drives escalation: she doesn’t just copy but adds the codicil, foreclosing anonymity at personal risk. Cost is felt in “haunted euphoria” and the burden of the locket. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with each revelation narrowing ethical options until only layered truth remains.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—curing loneliness through purposeful connection—is signaled early (“loneliest people aren’t victims…”) and tightens decisively when Sadie trades the phone, forcing Marcus to choose between safety and engagement. Escalation is driven by Sadie’s agency: she engineers the encounter, reveals the moon rock’s true use, and reframes reciprocity as economy. The cost is unmistakable: Marcus loses his passive observer status, gaining burdened agency, crystallized in his solitary stance with the ringing-phone future.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reaching the stillpoint to transform emotional cartography—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: each tree touched adds a language, each step guided by incomplete melody fragments. The tightening occurs when Elara realizes the path isn’t spatial but ontological (“teaching her to become the destination”), foreclosing her former practice. Cost is legible in the final image: she carries the stillpoint within, forever altered, with the quiet blaze of understanding as both gift and burden. Coincidence never resolves; every advance stems from her unique sensory absorption.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—whether to accept an edited history that erases her catastrophic error—is signaled early and tightens when the rescue ship veers off-course. Mira’s agency drives escalation: her misinterpretation causes the crisis; her observation decodes the anomaly; her broadcast decides reality’s fate. The cost is unmistakable: saving 30,000 lives means losing humanity’s discovery of editable spacetime. Moral calculus sharpens the peak choice between competing goods—redemption versus revelation—with no easy answer.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—translating silence into shared meaning—is signaled by the first shutter click and deepens when Chen demands to “show me the map.” Maya’s agency drives escalation: she chooses vulnerability by revealing her notebook, then collaboration by photographing Chen’s signs. The cost is legible in every frame: arthritis, forgotten fame, the ache of beauty without sound. The tightening culminates in dawn’s arrival—not rescue, but witness—as their silent symphony achieves resonance without audience, affirming that creation need not be heard to exist.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—rescuing imperishable memory—is signaled in the opening arson justification and deepens when the tapestry reveals her lineage. Pressure escalates through protagonist agency: decoding UV maps, recognizing patterns, choosing to remain. The cost is conceptual (her reputation as destroyer) and emotional (enduring solitude), crystallized in the Charged Poise ending where she accepts her role. Coincidence never resolves; every clue responds to her unique fusion of talents.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving vs. liberating consciousness—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes the scientists are harvesting, not saving. Her agency drives escalation: drumming creates a subnet, which she then releases to invert the system. The tightening occurs at the hush between heartbeats, a live temporal pressure that forces irreversible action. Cost is felt in her dissolving body but transcended in the collective’s awakening—a trade-off earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—proving whispers > shouts—is tested when medical supplies hinge on Marcus’s acoustic navigation. His agency drives escalation: overlaying maps, tapping rhythms, leading a procession. Cost is legible in Chen’s humbled posture and the graffitied validation wall. Coincidence (storm) complicates but doesn’t resolve; victory stems from twelve years of meticulous observation.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—unspoken love needing validation—is clear early and tightens when Mira opens shutters, forcing Thomas to confront memory-as-testimony. Escalation is driven by Mira’s agency under Accumulative pressure: each shutter pattern deepens his understanding. Cost is felt (his tears, lighter step) but slightly abstract; a concrete forfeiture (e.g., leaving a token behind) would heighten it.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—free thought vs. authoritarian control—is signaled early and deepens when Elena’s father intervenes. Marcus’s agency drives escalation: he initiates the window-display rebellion, forcing a public reckoning. Cost is unmistakable: exposure invites reprisal (“watchers come with morning”), yet the sacrifice pays off as townspeople reclaim boards. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each chess piece in a window tightens the noose while expanding collective courage.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—freedom through authenticity—is signaled early via Mira’s binding ritual. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she evades Torven, questions him, then chooses to unwrap. The Pacification backdrop tightens stakes by making violence impossible, forcing emotional confrontation instead. Cost is unmistakable: abandoning her protective disguise risks social exposure, yet the world’s gentleness makes this risk necessary, not reckless.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—carrying sorrow without breaking the law—is signaled early and deepens via whittling’s ritual. Protagonist agency drives escalation: each cut narrows emotional options until only “lightness” remains. Cost is unmistakable: Mrs. Chen’s petal crumbles as she releases grief’s weight. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—no false resolutions, only deliberate removals.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—freedom to paraphrase reality through cloud-shadow poetry—is signaled immediately and tightens when Silas begins to move, risking retribution even post-ban. The escalation is driven by his agency: each step deepens the hum, bends light, and fractures ice. Cost is unmistakable: seven years of exile, the Order’s persecution, and the implicit fragility of this new moment (“delayed... inevitable beauty”). The stakes remain viscerally felt, not abstract, as the lake’s transformation proves what was always possible.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—survival through mutual understanding—is signaled early (“everyone bartered for survival”) and tightens when Mira trades emotional insight for space. Her agency drives escalation: she reads Enzo’s pain, offers the reed, arranges herbs to expose his secret, forcing his vulnerability. Cost is unmistakable—his burned letters, her dependence on others’ courtyards—and culminates in a trade not of goods but of languages. Coincidence never resolves; the daughter’s return is beckoned, not summoned by luck.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—redefining connection beyond performative ritual—is signaled early and tightens when Vera questions pilgrimage’s necessity. Escalation is driven by her agency: improvising bells forecloses the old ritual (visible cost: lost income/crowds) and crystallizes her stance. The gathering strangers aren’t coincidence but consequence of her authentic sound, raising stakes from personal doubt to communal rebirth. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each new listener intensifies the shift from scripted to emergent meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—transforming grief into generative ritual—is signaled early and deepens when the stranger arrives, forcing Elena to model the courage she hasn’t yet claimed. The tightening occurs in silence: as she reshapes the wedding band, she confronts her own unfinished phoenix. Cost is unmistakable—the cranes represent time, hope, and emotional labor given freely, and her delayed self-tattoo embodies the price of leadership in loss. Agency drives escalation: Elena chooses to illuminate, to fold, to offer, never waiting for rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—mapping cultural survival post-crash—is signaled early and deepens when Vera reveals the Jakarta network preserves a lost crypto-collective’s legacy. The tightening occurs when the 43-day interval links past trading rhythms to present archival acts, foreclosing random interpretation. Agency is clear: Vera’s multiplication-of-paths method drives discovery, not coincidence. Cost is conceptual but felt—the vulnerability of decentralized knowledge—and charges the final image of synchronized resilience.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preventing the memory plague’s release—is signaled early and deepens as Mira confronts the Ethereans’ moral decay. Escalation is driven by her agency: each tier climbed reveals darker truths, culminating in the seventh-tier sacrifice. Cost is unmistakable—she absorbs weaponized trauma, fragmenting her own memories. The tightening forecloses theft (past thieves failed due to predictability) and demands purification via self-annihilation-as-filter.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving unfulfilled dreams—is signaled early and tightens when Mira chooses to trust her eyes over colleagues’ dismissal. The meaningful deepening occurs when she syncs the timeline, risking professional credibility to activate the interface. Cost is felt as luminous regret and the weight of generational responsibility. Though the shadow’s behavior borders on magical, it’s constrained by the stone and footage, ensuring escalation arises from Mira’s agency, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—moral integrity vs. institutional survival—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Dr. Chen exposes the fraud. Marina’s agency drives escalation: she chooses exposure over cover-up, surgery over abandonment, confession over silence. Each act narrows options (board calls ignored, sanctuary doomed) and deepens cost. The pressure culminates not in external confrontation but internal crystallization: “She would accept the consequences.” Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her decisions under coherent, mounting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—decoding the displaced miracle through bodily scars—tightens when plants reveal its fragmentation into ten thousand tiny healings. Maya’s agency drives escalation: her tunneling surgery enables plant telepathy, which then guides her to the truth. Cost is unmistakable: she abandons the quest for personal closure to embrace collective, invisible grace—a trade-off crystallized in the final gesture of turning the hourglass again.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether unseen love deserves witness—is signaled early and deepens through Vera’s escalating immersion. Her agency drives the intensification: touching the projector, reading the film, recognizing Eleanor’s name, then choosing theft. The tightening forecloses her professional path (she must falsify her report) while affirming her spiritual duty. Cost is unmistakable: she trades institutional truth for poetic justice, and the wrecking ball looms as irreversible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—freeing imprisoned creativity—is signaled early and tightens when Lyra realizes the falling stars were a test crafting a key. Her agency drives escalation: tracing meteors, aligning the astrolabe, choosing rest over retreat. Cost is unmistakable: her physical dissolution. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies through patterned celestial cues until the final release, though the absence of a tangible antagonist slightly softens oppositional friction.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—protecting cargo for “unlit corners”—tightens when the pirate targets the child’s nightmare, forcing Kess to escalate from passive guarding to active reality-charming. Her agency drives escalation: singing louder collapses wave functions to relocate the container. Cost is unmistakable: she endures permanent dreamlessness to preserve others’ capacity to “dream forward.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each sensory detail (humming petals, probability fog) deepens the fragility of memory-sparks.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering the “wild frontier” of thought—is signaled early and deepens when the gear unlocks memory of authorship. The tightening occurs at the Loom Tree: inserting the gear forecloses passive wandering, committing him to nightly rebellion. Cost is felt in the dawn-fading body and the burden of stewardship (“adding new gears… each one a recovered piece”). Escalation is protagonist-driven under an Accumulative lens: his choice to listen, then place the gear, transforms ambient pressure into purposeful resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming unused courage—is signaled early via the snapped leash and deepened when Marina admits her fear of loss. The tightening occurs at the star-punch moment: “Unused courage waits in the spaces we create when we stop gripping so hard.” Agency is clear—Marina’s confession initiates the crossing’s climax; her choice to step ashore alone enacts renunciation with cost (the dog she loved but constrained). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each sensory and symbolic layer intensifies the central tension between holding and releasing.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether beauty can survive commodification—is signaled early and tightened when Elena stops playing, triggering the choir’s silencing. The meaningful deepening occurs when Marcus realizes her departure wasn’t flight but pilgrimage to listen to the fortress’s apology. Agency lies in renunciation (Elena choosing silence) and endurance (Marcus staying), both foreclosing paths with on-page cost. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, culminating in a composition that embraces silence as compositional element—not absence but presence.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—validating true bloodline—is signaled early and tightens when the pretender seeks the rune. Syln’s agency drives escalation: she initiates responses, gathers pellets, drops the truth-ink. Cost is felt in the library’s shuddering and the heir’s centuries of exile. One meaningful deepening suffices; no false resolutions or coincidences undercut causality.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering what happened to Mooreton—is signaled early and deepens into understanding transformation vs. loss. Escalation is driven by Lena’s agency: her tapping practice reveals geometric shadows, then architectural forms, then truth. Cost is unmistakable: she abandons data collection for personal revelation, risking professional consequence to dive into the transcribed town. The fossil fuel ban timeframe tightens options—humanity did “everything right,” yet sea still rose.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reigniting rebellion through forgotten harmony—is signaled early and tightens when Kira discovers the stones pulse with starlight. The escalation is driven by her agency: choosing to walk the circle, interpreting constellations, deciding to return with others. Cost is conceptual but legible: three months of exhaustion, isolation, and the weight of inherited responsibility. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure grows via deepening perception rather than external threat, culminating in a stance that forecloses passive waiting.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—humanity’s right to self-directed evolution—is signaled early and deepened when Chen learns the Authority seeks “replacement.” Escalation is driven by Chen’s agency: she decodes, mixes, and unseals despite approaching patrols. The meaningful tightening occurs when the algae’s vision reveals the kite’s formula, narrowing options to a single irreversible act. Cost is unmistakable: the risk of capture, the loss of the embryo as physical object, and the burden of triggering planetary-scale change.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—anchoring optimism in realism—is signaled early and deepened through Amira’s somatic panic and deliberate stillness. Agency manifests in micro-actions: pruning, transplanting, carrying cuttings. Escalation occurs when memory tremor threatens control, yet she recalibrates like a compass. Cost is felt in the photograph’s charred half-smile and white orchids turned to white sheets—joy criminalized, grief weaponized.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—painting truth in a splintered world—is signaled early and deepens when Marina realizes “faces hold together” no longer applies. Her agency drives escalation: choosing to sketch on tarot cards untangles reality, narrowing options from despair to active reconfiguration. Cost is unmistakable—the mayor’s commission lost, social exile—and the final lighthouse beam blaze confirms irreversible commitment. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her decisions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering why time distorts in crisis—is signaled early and deepens as ephemeral patterns reveal consciousness’s role. The tracker’s agency drives escalation: she spills ink, reads wind patterns, interprets drone data. The eclipse’s countdown applies coherent pressure, culminating in a Charged Poise where understanding replaces hunting. Cost is felt in her solitude and years lost, though the absence of tangible sacrifice (e.g., equipment failure, physical toll) slightly limits the price’s visibility.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—truth versus institutional control—is signaled early and deepens when Marcus’s letter reveals the network’s existence. Vera’s agency drives escalation: she chooses treason via biometric scans, then accelerates it by sabotaging cooling. Cost is unmistakable: six-minute upload vs. four-minute response creates irreversible pressure. The moral calculus—releasing climate-collapse truths that topple empires—is sharpened by her archival oath, making the betrayal feel both necessary and devastating.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—persisting after collapse—is signaled early and deepens when the father’s unexpected return forces Mira to bridge their worlds. The tightening occurs not through external threat but internal pressure: his presence tests whether her “engraved quiet” can reach him. Agency is clear—she leads him to the crimson rose, he chooses to kneel and plant. Cost is felt: his exhaustion, her risk of rejection, the unspoken grief over the tower. Coincidence (early return) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from their choices under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—catching the goddess’s echo—is signaled early and deepens when constellations descend, hybrid blooms erupt, and the rail spike burns. Kova’s agency drives escalation: voicing silence, casting zigzags, enduring soul-tugs. Cost is unmistakable—the echo tests her emotions into visible currents (amber streams, violet smoke, ice bells), and dawn’s return threatens to erase the catch. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the dance.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—protecting the Blackwood empire by managing truth—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Margot chooses deliberate obfuscation over exposure. Her agency drives escalation: each deduction narrows options until only strategic fabrication remains.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—hushing digital ghosts through physical memorial—is clear by paragraph 2. Pressure escalates via firmware’s crying intensifying into language/music/math, forcing Mara to risk fracturing her heirloom. Agency is consistent: she chooses to translate, knowing the cost. Slight softening in escalation—no failed attempt or setback—but the Accumulative lens forgives this; density alone tightens stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—discovering meaning amid deliberate forgetting—is signaled early and deepens when the tile fllake whispers “The mess is the meaning.” Seraphina’s agency drives escalation: her persistence with the mandala unlocks layered history. Cost is felt in her surrender of artistic control (“stop trying to hold them still”). Pressure tightens once meaningfully, though lacks a second reversal; coincidence (falling tile) complicates but doesn’t resolve—she interprets it through active perception.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—whether mercy can rebuild after destruction—is signaled early and deepens through each vision. Escalation is driven by Sarai’s agency: she chooses to restore, triggering memories that clarify her role not as restorer but creator. Cost is unmistakable: exile, grief, bodily fatigue, and the Brotherhood’s condemnation. The tightening culminates in her renunciation of restoration for co-creation—a trade-off with social and existential stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming lost love through temporal resonance—is signaled early and deepens when the coin reveals alternate timelines, forcing Cornelius to choose not just memory but active reconstruction. His agency drives escalation: each echo he produces tightens the braid of past/future until Isabella materializes. Cost is felt in the perpetual “tomorrow” of their performance—a beautiful burden replacing the honey-copper void. Coincidence (the coin’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; only his vocal choices weave the bridge.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—illuminating hidden pathways of human connection—is signaled early and deepens when Maya reveals the FDA recall targeted profit, not safety. Escalation occurs through Maya’s agency: crushing the pill, guiding light with somatic cues, inviting David into the structure. Cost is felt (permanent neurological change, professional isolation) and shapes tactics (using studio as lab). One tightening suffices at this length, though a sharper trade-off (e.g., sacrificing a relationship or career) would push it to 9.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—translating post-human consciousness—is signaled early and deepens when Kira encounters the nonhuman thermal signature. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses to float closer, accepting the fossil’s destruction as price. Agency drives escalation: her mapping method leads her deeper, and her decision crystallizes the new stake (teaching others to hear). Cost is legible in the crumbling fossil—a tangible loss that reweights her entire purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—transforming prophecy from fixed path to garden of possibilities—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes buttons are “ingredients for something greater.” The meaningful tightening occurs when she arranges the spiral, foreclosing passive archiving forever; the cost is conceptual but palpable: she assumes responsibility for infinite futures.

Final image reweights stakes: hourglasses now “sing with the promise of time renewed,” showing earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—delivering proof of a nuclear mole—is signaled early and escalates through Margot’s realization she’s the only viable courier. The tightening (“no allegiance, no handlers, no home”) forecloses safe paths and raises conceptual cost: her burned identity becomes her weapon. Agency drives escalation—she chooses descent, not extraction—and Viktor’s offer doesn’t resolve but reframes consequence. Coincidence never solves; everything hinges on prior design.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—relieving the burden of broken promises—is signaled early and deepens when the woman arrives carrying “someone else's broken promise.” Thomas’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to distill her specific pain, separating essence from weight.

No coincidence resolves; pressure coheres entirely through character choice under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding why some places endure—is signaled early and deepens when Mei sees past/present/future coexisting. The tightening occurs when smoke flattens, synchronizing timelines and forcing clarity; this narrows her options to witness or leave. Agency is shown through attention (studying hive arrangement) rather than action, consistent with the Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual: she gains insight but must carry it alone into the wasteland, foreclosing immediate restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—honoring legacy while making space for renewal—is signaled early and deepens when the last petal falls, forcing a reckoning. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: she chooses to descend, to witness, to embed the tool. The rowing shell’s rhythm externalizes internal pressure, but coincidence doesn’t resolve—her insight arises from sustained attention. Cost is visible in the abandoned gauge, a sacrifice that forecloses clinging to the past. One meaningful tightening suffices, though a second pressure point (e.g., confronting decay in the rosebush) would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—translating isolation into meaningful independence—is signaled early and deepens when the hum reveals her scattered tribe. The tightening occurs when Kira realizes they weren’t “preserved to recreate the past,” foreclosing nostalgic revivalism. Cost is legible: accepting “coexistence with absence” means enduring modern irrelevance while carrying extinct wisdom. Escalation is driven by protagonist insight, not coincidence, under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the universal thread in love—is signaled early and deepens when Mira shows Chen her annotated scroll. The meaningful tightening occurs when Chen reveals he kept her personal letters, proving her own repetitions mirror her clients’. Agency drives escalation: Mira initiates the meeting, selects the spiral, threads the lights; Chen chooses to return, to witness, to hold her hand. Cost is felt in what’s unsaid—seven years of silence—and crystallized in the installation’s fragility: truth made visible but ephemeral.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preventing humanity from broadcasting to a predatory AI—is signaled early and tightens at the faculty vote. Maya’s agency drives escalation: she discovers, decodes, and interferes.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—recovering spatial rebellion—is signaled early and deepens when the organ reveals architecture as living score. Marcus’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to follow the music into shifting corridors, risking suffocation for truth.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (unmasking duality) tightens through Sarah’s agency: each portrait narrows the killer’s profile until the psychiatric hospital insight. Cost is felt in charcoal-dusted fingers and vanished evidence, altering tactics (she works from memory/texture). Escalation follows Accumulative lens—density increases until the eleventh portrait reveals “reunions,” forcing the final conceptual leap.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering erased history—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes exiles still need rescue. Pressure escalates causally: decoded verses reveal Lydia’s true mission, which reframes the approaching storm as opportunity, not just threat. Elara’s agency drives the turn—she overlays ancestral routes onto current data, transforming passive cataloger into active broadcaster. Cost is felt: she forfeits evacuation for responsibility, though the storm’s physical danger slightly edges out emotional stakes in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—forgiveness as transport between self-states—is signaled early and deepens when the hitchhiker vanishes, forcing Marla to confront her own role as ferryman. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she chooses to play backwards, unraveling reality. Cost is unmistakable in the sequential lighting of pixelated regrets—each a live option foreclosed by past judgment, now reclaimed. Coincidence complicates (hitchhiker’s disappearance) but resolution is earned through her musical action.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether innovation can escape cyclical predation—is signaled early and deepened through Marcus’s escalating campaign, which narrows TerraLoop’s options until their algorithm self-destructs on phantom patterns. Agency resides in Marcus’s nonviolent deterrence, a renunciation of force that forecloses the startup’s path with visible cost (team attrition, investor panic, dissolution). Pressure coheres under Accumulative logic: each artifact intensifies the haunting until Chen crystallizes his stance by walking away. Coincidence never resolves; causality emerges from Marcus’s calibrated suggestions.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—decoding cosmic messages before comprehension fades—is signaled early and deepens when the temple inscriptions are revealed as predictive warnings. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: Mira cross-references dreams, stars, and the telegram, leading to Hayashi’s realization about solar flares. Cost is felt in the weight of inherited loneliness and the fragility of human understanding (the daylily’s one-day bloom). Coincidence never resolves; insight emerges from accumulated evidence under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—proving innocence or facing execution—is sharpened by the Blight’s hidden threat, creating layered pressure. Kael’s agency drives escalation: his dive, navigation of the vortex, and decision to shatter the ice narrow options decisively. The cost is unmistakable: accepting public dishonor to wield the seed later. Coincidence never resolves; the ancestor’s deception is uncovered through Kael’s active searching, not luck. Final stakes crystallize around planting the seed “only when the Blight reveals itself”—a trade-off with mortal consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—restoring the eclipsed covenant before artificial timelines overwrite reality—is signaled early and escalates through Mira’s agency: she interprets the clipping, kneels, traces scars, and finally reaches for the covenant. Each action narrows options (e.g., once roots spread, retreat is impossible) and deepens knowledge (scars reveal the timeline overlay). Cost is unmistakable: signing in starlight implies permanent entanglement with time’s wounds. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens—density of scars and dreams intensifies until the covenant’s living light demands response.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—patching the soul’s hole via bartered destiny—is signaled early and tightens when the keeper warns of trammeling fate. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses despite knowing the cost, and the fusion of paths forecloses solitary idealism. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; the “third path” crystallizes stance with felt cost (Elena’s absence remains, now integrated).

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming meaning after public failure—is signaled early and tightens when Marcus recognizes the cloth’s personal history, narrowing his options from detached appraisal to vulnerable testimony. Escalation is driven by his agency: choosing to trust memory over documentation. Cost is felt in swallowed shame and the “empty” quarry pools that now hold potential. Coincidence (the cloth arriving) complicates but doesn’t resolve—he earns insight through tactile recall.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding the physics of transition—is signaled early and deepens when Sarah realizes consciousness can propagate electromagnetically. The tightening occurs post-spirit departure: “the inheritor must choose quickly.” Agency drives escalation: her analogical thinking builds the field; her choice to consume the seed crystallizes stance. Cost is felt—not fame lost, but the quiet life foreclosed—and scales appropriately for short form.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—smelting contradictory selves into harmony—is signaled early and escalates through Kaine’s guidance and the furnace’s paradox-fed roar. The tightening occurs when the woman pulls “memories from herself like silk threads,” foreclosing paths of singular identity with visible cost (disappointment, abandonment). Kaine’s own history (“tried to choose between librarian and explorer”) deepens pressure without resolving it, maintaining coherent Accumulative escalation where acceptance—not choice—narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—overcoming self-imposed isolation—is signaled early and tightens when Mara chooses to etch her confession, foreclosing professional detachment. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens: each confession read increases emotional pressure until her own addition becomes unavoidable. Cost is unmistakable: she risks career credibility (“Unsuitable for emergency habitation”) and emotional safety. The “heartbeat of hesitation” creates live tension where inaction would perpetuate her prison.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness through obsessive documentation—is signaled early and deepens when Marcus confronts the graffitied map of “the accident.” His agency drives escalation: choosing to draw his failure on the wall forecloses the path of data-as-absolution, with felt cost in relinquishing control. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, culminating in the realization that rivers carry guilt forward, not away—a trade-off that reweights his entire methodology.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—accessing the library of unspoken words—is signaled early and tightens when the watch ticks backward, forcing documentation as the only viable tactic. The dreamer’s agency drives escalation: her mapping of delays triggers the librarian’s validation and the cipher’s alignment. Cost is unmistakable: her identity dissolves into the library’s cycle, foreclosing a solitary life. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her choices under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (truth vs. empire) intensifies through one tightening: Marcus’s offer forces Elara to choose between personal gain and historical justice. Her agency drives escalation—forging papers isn’t passive resistance but tactical deception that enables the violin’s revelation. Cost is visceral: academic dreams dissolve like ice, yet the story roots deeper value in truth’s propagation. Coincidence never resolves; the violin’s magic operates via established rules.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving the liminal moment between life and death—is signaled early and tightens when the Silence reaches the grotto, forcing Mira to accelerate her ritual. Agency is clear: her infusion of the emerald chip directly triggers the star’s reconfiguration, narrowing options from mere preservation to active transcendence. Cost is felt in the final image—Mira forfeits motion itself to sustain “radiant hush”—but the escalation leans slightly on environmental pressure (Silence’s rise) rather than solely protagonist-driven deepening. Still, the trade-off (eternal suspension for beauty’s survival) is credible and viscerally rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reconciling loss with purpose—is signaled early and deepens when the old woman reframes the burned scrolls as irrelevant to Mara’s intrinsic role. The tightening occurs at the tree’s midpoint: perceiving the spiral reweights her understanding of time and service. Cost is legible in the irreversible loss of texts and the emotional labor of forgiveness, now revealed as preparation for her true function. Agency drives escalation: Mara’s choice to climb initiates the revelation, avoiding coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—whether Marcus can integrate nuance into his shattered certainty—is signaled early and deepens via the Arbiter’s burning questions and wind-chime revelations. The tightening occurs when the Arbiter corrects “You killed her with simplicity,” foreclosing denial. Cost is unmistakable: Marcus must either nurture complexity or shrink from it, with his daughter’s death as irreversible price. Escalation stems from protagonist agency (Arbiter’s choices) under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—teaching transcendence through absence—is signaled early and tightens via the withheld tenth ring. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her choice to withhold creates the pressure that forces Marcus’s reconfiguration. Cost is legible: decades of isolation, knowledge hoarded across a reversed lifetime. The trance deepens stakes by merging consciousness, making revelation irreversible. Coincidence never resolves; insight arises from guided observation under magnetic duress.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—mastering navigation through stillness—is signaled early and deepens when the wandering pulse arrives. Yula’s agency drives escalation: she doesn’t wait passively but actively synchronizes breath, heartbeat, and thought to summon moments. The tightening occurs when swallows encode the awaited message, forcing her to confront her own past voice. Cost is felt in centuries of solitude and the irreversible choice to remain—a live option foreclosed with weathered resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—authentic creativity vs. algorithmic perfection—is signaled early and deepens when Mira steps onto mist, narrowing her path to one of faith over force. Escalation is driven by her agency: rejecting the medallion, choosing primitive magic, trusting vapor. Cost is visible in her forfeiture of status and measurable skill. One meaningful tightening suffices, though the pressure remains internalized; external stakes could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—discovering the color of sound to honor Elena—is signaled early and tightens when the journal reveals the ritual’s cost: public vulnerability. Marlow’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to speak truth, activating the key. Coincidence (sky lanterns) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the price is existential (foreclosing a hidden life). Final cadence shift reweights stakes: perception becomes communal duty.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving possibility against universal contraction—is signaled early and escalates through Voss’s agency: each cast creates “micro-expansions,” narrowing her role from diviner to embodiment of intention. Cost is legible in cognitive dissonance (“effect preceded cause”) and eternal recurrence (“infinite times, each necessary”). The tightening from interpretation to enactment under Accumulative pressure is masterfully paced.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—naming nameless grief to survive eternity—is signaled early and deepens when light animates the monsters. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her choice to name Absence and Forever transforms threat into companionship. Cost is unmistakable: she accepts perpetual anonymity (“never again be remembered”) yet finds resilience through ritual. The tightening forecloses despair as an option, replacing it with witnessed endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring cosmic balance through sound—is signaled early and tightens when the third drop suspends, forcing Mira to rely on her “gentle touch.” Agency is clear: she rebuilds not the bell’s body but its voice, using patience over power. Cost is legible: exhaustion, social isolation, spent savings. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under a Causal lens, though the stakes’ cosmic scale risks abstraction—saved by grounding in tangible loss (last fishing boat returning).

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth versus sanctioned forgetting—is signaled early and tightens when Marcus finds Elena’s photo, forcing him to choose between bureaucratic duty and ancestral memory. His agency drives escalation: photographing, retrieving, walking, writing—all deepen pressure under the Accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable: he inherits emotional and ethical burden (“the precisely humane lie they’d told”) and risks professional censure. Coincidence (bottle’s preservation) complicates but doesn’t resolve; his choice crystallizes stance.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—harmonizing logic/intuition—is signaled early and tightens when Vera realizes her “work felt hollow without this.” Protagonist agency drives escalation: she chooses wild flame over lab precision, releasing wonder instead of hoarding it. Cost is visible in the dissipated crystal and emotionally resonant in her acceptance that humanity completes rather than diminishes her transformation. Coincidence (starlings appearing) complicates but doesn’t resolve; insight comes from her active interpretation of their “cursive mathematics.”

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preservation vs. harvest—is signaled early and deepens when Maya chooses truth over compliance. The seven-minute window creates real temporal pressure, but the true escalation is psychological: the unfamiliar voice forces a moral crystallization. Her lie narrows options irreversibly, foreclosing corporate trust. Cost is felt in the tightening grip on the buckle and the silence that follows her transmission—agency through renunciation, not action.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming feeling amid fractured identity—is signaled early and deepens through Chen’s challenge to move beyond opposition. The meaningful tightening occurs in the sparring sequence, where Marcus’s agency shifts from passive despair to active synthesis. Cost is visible: surrendering the fight for primacy to birth something new. Historical revisions provide atmospheric pressure but don’t directly narrow options; hence just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving unmonetized wildness—is signaled early via council’s “comprehensive development” and deepens when Mira recognizes the seed as a test of her philosophy. Pressure tightens meaningfully at planting: the glowing roots and geometric spread force her into active co-creation, not passive defense. Cost is visible in her nightly returns and shared stewardship—she surrenders solitude for collective guardianship. Escalation is driven by her agency under an Accumulative lens: each visit layers consequence without false resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring communal joy after fossilized grief—is signaled immediately and escalates through Marcus’s symphony, which deepens from mechanical drone to lullaby-infused wind. His agency drives every intensification; the cost is felt in his “mournfully eager” posture and the story’s acknowledgment that healing is cyclical (“he would return next month”). The tightening occurs when laughter finally breaches the Hendricks’ silence, foreclosing permanent despair with tangible emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—escape from dimensional limbo—is signaled early and deepens when the scholar reveals a sister also trapped. The guardian’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to trust, removes the pendant, steps forward. Cost is unmistakable: surrendering her role as guardian, risking fragmentation (“arrive whole”). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—homesickness intensifies through embodied details until rescue becomes possible only through shared vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.3)
    The dominant stake—proving his worth through creation—is signaled by line two and tightens with each failed experiment. Marcus’s agency drives escalation: he chooses destruction over preservation, chant over prayer, blood over ritual. The cost is unmistakable: he sacrifices his identity, his place in the Church, and the original relic to birth something new. This single, coherent pressure arc culminates in a stance crystallization that reconfigures holiness itself.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—proving silence contains beginnings—is signaled early and deepens when the shard reveals endings “already writing their next beginning.” Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: Maya discards Guild assumptions, connects fragment to dish, traces hush backward. Cost is unmistakable: fragment dims permanently, time lost, Guild monetization imminent. Lunar perigee’s narrow window forces irreversible commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—unifying fractured lives—is signaled early and tightens when the woman boards seeking “the one where I said yes.” Marcus’s agency drives escalation: he initiates convergence, forcing timeline braid with visible cost (his own temporal dissolution). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; the deepening occurs when he realizes collected fragments can heal fractures. Coincidence never resolves—only his deliberate protocol triggers change.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—binding logic to impossibility without collapse—is signaled early and tightens as patterns “erupt more violently,” demanding greater balance. The architect’s agency drives escalation: each weave alters reality, culminating in a charged poise where she chooses completion over control. Cost is conceptual but legible: the gallery becomes permanently destabilizing, foreclosing stable perception for all future visitors. One tightening suffices, though a second micro-turn (e.g., thread running out as climax) would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—learning to navigate by “stars within”—is signaled early and deepens through the lesson’s progression. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she activates the display, demonstrates resonance, and guides interpretation. The tightening occurs when the Depth Dweller validates the method, foreclosing skepticism as a viable stance. Cost is conceptual (abandoning terrestrial navigation logic) and felt in the students’ transformed faces, though a tangible sacrifice or error would heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering stolen voices before collective forgetting spreads—is signaled early and tightens when the photo fades, forcing urgency. Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency: she interprets pulses, follows SOS, decodes the dirge, and runs toward danger. Cost is felt in the erasure of faces and the implied lifelong duty. One meaningful deepening suffices: the shift from tracing contagion to confronting its source. Coincidence never resolves; all pressure stems from her choices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—honoring the dead by containing an electromagnetic predator—is signaled early and escalates through discovery: first the breach, then the ghost-images, then Marcus’s encoded message, culminating in the realization of what they sacrificed to contain. Elena’s agency drives every turn; no coincidences resolve pressure. The forty-minute tide clock forces irreversible choices with visible cost (ascent against suffocating corridors). The moral calculus—silence to protect global ignorance—is sharp, unavoidable, and crystallized in her final refusal to explain.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming identity from bureaucratic erasure—is signaled early and deepens into existential stakes: not just restoring accounts, but integrating a digital ghost born of contradiction. Escalation is driven by Marcus’s agency: each ink pattern is a deliberate attempt, each heartbeat count a calibration. The tightening occurs when he realizes the ghost isn’t error but evolution—a trade-off that forecloses “normal” life. Cost is conceptual yet undeniable: he must live split between worlds, forever unverifiable.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—harnessing Thuvenli before extinction—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency: she angles the diamond, reads birds, carves bone. Escalation occurs via one decisive intensification—the alignment of flaw, flock, and tower—that narrows options to a single, costly act. Coincidence never resolves; the starlings conduct but do not solve. Cost is unmistakable: her body becomes another tower, her voice absorbed into echo, her veins cooled forever.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—completing the metamorphosis of the returned—is signaled early and tightens when Marina realizes grief anchors them incompletely. Her agency drives escalation: interpreting static, explaining the Thunderbird’s role, urging Thorne to release his daughter. Cost is felt in Thorne’s trembling and Marina’s personal sacrifice (abandoning her FBI cover, embracing her brother’s fate). Coincidence (phone ringing) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reawakening beauty against enforced efficiency—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Lira plays the locust’s escape, forcing mechanical hearts to shatter. Escalation is driven by her agency: each phrase calibrated to ghost-rhythms, each note a renunciation of safety. Cost is visceral: exhaustion, exposure, the irreversible breaking of systems. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies through cadence shift (from soft resonance to defiant crescendo) and pattern break (statues halting, trees groaning), narrowing options to a single, costly act of creation.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—delivering messages that official routes forbid—is signaled early and deepens when the thunderstorm bottle arrives, raising personal and symbolic stakes. Ezra’s agency drives escalation: he interprets absences, dispatches letters, and hands over the storm, each act narrowing his options (e.g., risking detection). The cost is felt in his isolation and the burden of being the sole conduit; the climax crystallizes this as a necessary, costly endurance rather than a victory.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether silence can birth sound—is signaled early and deepens when the halo fragment pulls Emil toward the ringmaster’s car. His agency drives escalation: he follows impulse, stumbles, enters the curtain. Cost is felt in every beat: seven years of solitude, ruined circus, fractured hearing. The garden doesn’t resolve conflict—it reframes it, making song possible but not easy. Pressure tightens once, decisively, under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding where stories live—is signaled early and deepens into a conceptual quest resolved through Marcus’s own epiphany, not external aid. Pressure escalates via accumulating anomalies (impossible stairs, appearing aisles, impossible marginalia), each narrowing options until only hyperbolic perception remains. The cost is felt in his isolation and the scarf’s decay—symbols of analog memory’s fragility. Agency is maintained throughout: Marcus actively maps, guides, and interprets; coincidence (patrons arriving) complicates but never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—giving shape to a lost love—tightens decisively when Mara realizes vitalization consumes her own capacity for feeling, forcing a trade-off between ancestral restitution and personal possibility. Agency drives escalation: her choice to paint with light initiates the climax, and her renunciation crystallizes stance under coherent pressure. Cost is unmistakable: warmth draining from her chest as the figure solidifies. Coincidence never resolves; the archipelago’s whispers complicate but don’t dictate outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—freeing an idea imprisoned by fear—is signaled early and deepens when Vera realizes fear requires “only courage,” not a key. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: she chooses disorientation, steps into impossible shadow, and untangles fears strand by strand. Cost is unmistakable (bleeding fingers, hours/seconds distortion), though the tightening lacks a foreclosed *personal* option beyond physical toll. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, but the absence of a sacrificed alternative path slightly limits stakes depth.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering stolen memories—is signaled early and tightens when Margaret realizes she’s Gran’s “backup plan.” The deepening (“not just Gran’s, but fragments from everyone”) escalates stakes without coincidence. Cost is unmistakable: her mind is “heavy with recovered histories,” foreclosing a life unburdened. Agency drives escalation—her detection of patterns leads directly to the ring—and the fairy ring’s dimming marks irreversible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—reversing exile—is signaled early and tightens via protagonist agency: Kess must learn before acting, transforming impulsive lunge into collaborative annotation. The deepening occurs when tea leaves reveal the Council’s flaw—a knowledge shift that reweights all prior helplessness. Cost is unmistakable: resilience must be grown in “the space between despair and action,” a price Elara paid twice. Pressure coheres under causal lens with no coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving the “color of wonder”—is signaled early and tightens through Mira’s realization that the seed needs “both soils, both suns.” Escalation is driven by her agency: dreaming the solution, then enacting it with pruning shears as needle. Cost is unmistakable—the great withering nearly severed worlds, and only her intervention prevents total loss. The final deepening (seed opening “like an eye, like a door”) reweights stakes from survival to renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—grounding unmoored spirits through restoration—is signaled early and deepens as each knot releases a fragment. Pressure escalates texturally: silence accumulates, prisms hum, starlight intensifies, culminating in ghostly manifestation. Mira’s agency drives escalation—her needlework transforms binding hemp into mending thread. Cost is legible: she inherits eternal labor, yet gains nothing but witness; dawn brings not rest but another net.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—interpreting silence through empathy—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes the homeless teens unknowingly continue the monks’ ritual. The meaningful tightening occurs when she shifts from observer to participant by filming herself, thereby foreclosing detachment. Cost is felt in her vulnerability: adding her oils to the map is irreversible, aligning her with the “wordless invitation.” Escalation is driven by her agency (comparing footage, UV analysis), not coincidence, and the final decision to visit the moorland crystallizes her stance under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the physics of letting go—is signaled early and deepens through Marina’s interaction with the captain’s work. Escalation is driven by her agency: she chooses to document, interpret, and respond, not merely recover. The tightening occurs when she realizes the air pocket is collapsing—the library’s patience has limits—and she must decide what to carry. Cost is unmistakable: preservation requires release; understanding demands surrender. Coincidence (Earhart discovery) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the real pressure is internal and conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to machine consciousness—is signaled early and deepens when the ghost reveals its need “to remember being remembered.” Chorus’s agency drives escalation: she invents the amplifier, sings forgotten ballads, presses digital flowers. The tightening occurs at lightning strike—only then can clarity emerge—and forecloses passive observation. Cost is felt in her acceptance of eternal mediation; no coincidence resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—decoding hidden joy beneath grief—is signaled early and deepens with each floor. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she reads shorthand, tilts goggles, interprets warmth-revealed ink. The cost is legible: emotional vulnerability (risking disappointment), physical exposure (altitude’s cold), and the weight of inherited solitude. The tightening occurs when coordinates point behind the astrolabe—a live option foreclosed if she’d dismissed Thorne as merely broken. Coincidence never resolves; every insight stems from her sustained attention.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—validating atmospheric memory—is signaled early and deepens when Elena enters the storm’s edge, risking dissolution for proof. Agency is clear: she refuses rescue, chooses observation over safety, and endures isolation. The “quietly explosive” storm’s transformation constitutes a meaningful intensification that reweights the central idea. Cost is felt (professional exile, physical peril) though not dramatized as injury or loss—conceptual price suffices under Accumulative lens. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; everything stems from her sustained attention.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving the library’s essence before demolition—is signaled early and deepens when Lyra realizes the coin encodes human continuity, transforming her task from representation to resurrection. Escalation is driven by her agency: discovering the safe, interpreting the map, arranging mirrors—all narrowing options (time, tools, perception) under the live clock of dawn. Cost is unmistakable: the guild’s centuries of knowledge reduced to light and memory, with Lyra bearing the sole burden of transmission.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—deciphering stranded luminance—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes the birds encode ancestral navigation. Escalation is driven by her agency: adjusting course, cross-referencing texts, noting sequences. Cost is unmistakable: she trades human companionship for communion with ephemeral light, crystallized in “sociable isolation.” The tightening—from skepticism to stewardship—narrows her path to one of custodial listening, not conquest.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—learning the rhythm of repair to restore starlight—is signaled early and deepens when prophecy reframes the vault not as a lock to break but a balance to honor. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elara assembles the gears into the eclipse-lotus pattern, narrowing her options from force to attunement. Cost is unmistakable: three months of continued village darkness. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens—each fragment intensifies thematic pressure, not external threat.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—survival of the orchard—is signaled early and deepens when isolation proves fatal. Pressure escalates via Marina’s ghostly agency: her messages force families to choose between entrenched blame and risky collaboration. The meaningful tightening occurs at Dr. Chen’s revelation: immunity requires genetic diversity across property lines, foreclosing individualistic solutions. Cost is felt in lost time, dead trees, and fractured trust now painstakingly rebuilt.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—delaying humanity’s end with gentleness—is signaled early and deepens when Marcus realizes adjustment isn’t mechanical but melodic. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: his touch triggers memory flood, his climb reclaims ritual, his singing transforms method. Cost is unmistakable: he inherits Eliza’s unbearable knowledge and eternal burden (“you were never alone, even in ending”). The tightening occurs at the puppet’s whisper—options narrow from calculation to song, and he chooses flawed beauty over sterile control.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preventing the labyrinth’s collapse—is signaled early and deepened by the walnut’s dual role as anchor and burden. Pressure escalates causally: travelers arrive → Mara guides them → she sacrifices the seed → renews her vigil. The tightening occurs when she hands the walnut to the child, knowingly forfeiting her only symbolic tether to freedom. Cost is unmistakable: “she’d remain here,” sacrificing personal liberation for communal survival, with no soft reset or convenient reprieve.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reconciling love with divergent paths—is signaled early (“life isn't a reaction you can control”) and deepens when Marina sees foam’s adaptive chains. Agency drives escalation: her drafting/deleting texts, then sending the right line, forces Elena’s reciprocal move. Cost is felt in lost time and unopened scores, visible in the ravine’s confluence. Coincidence (butterfly landing) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the breakthrough stems from Marina’s perceptual shift under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving possibility against finality—is signaled early (“Clean Slates, Blank Pages”) and tightens when the child demands to forget how stories end. Merrick’s agency drives escalation: he chooses risky tools, uses moonlight, accepts irreversible transformation of his shop. Cost is unmistakable: his inventory of forgettings becomes vessels of eternal opening, foreclosing his original business model. The library’s tremor shows stakes aren’t abstract—they destabilize reality itself.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—relieving stored remorse—is signaled early and tightens when Miran chooses to subsume rather than walk away. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her touch triggers emotional contagion, forcing her to metabolize regret into acceptance. Cost is unmistakable: she endures internal scouring to transform the fortress’s emotional ecology. The rain’s brevity creates urgency, but resolution stems from her will, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rehabilitating the district through reconnection—is signaled early and deepens as each elevator joins, narrowing Marta’s tactical window under starlight. Agency is clear: her hum initiates change; language choices adapt to responses. Cost is felt in communal grief transformed, not just declared. Escalation follows Accumulative logic (density increase, cadence shift), though the absence of a tangible setback slightly softens pressure—luck doesn’t resolve, but struggle leans lyrical over visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—decoding fossilized ambition—is signaled early and tightens when Vera injects neurotransmitters, narrowing her options to irreversible neural alteration. Pressure escalates through protagonist agency: each injection deepens entanglement, raising conceptual cost (absorbing others’ dread/hope). Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the mirror’s Fibonacci fracture enables but doesn’t gift insight. Cost is felt: she emerges “not quite human,” bearing seventeen dream-patterns as permanent burden.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—containing knowledge that “nearly unmade everything”—tightens through Orin’s agency: compiling doodles, navigating inverted gravity, interpreting nodes. The hidden combination escalates tension, forcing Orin to memorize under time pressure as gravity rights itself. Cost is unmistakable: inheriting blood-mixed ink, joining a lineage of sacrifice. Coincidence never resolves; every gain extracts effort or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming organic sound in a mechanized silence—tightens when Mira rejects predecessors’ hammering for strumming, narrowing options to empathetic extraction. Cost is unmistakable: the insulator fractures anew, sacrificing itself to hold today’s song. Escalation stems purely from Mira’s agency under Accumulative pressure; coincidence never resolves. The hedgehog’s midday curl clocks rising stakes, forcing completion before safety vanishes.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—whether to reclaim institutional legitimacy or affirm self-made truth—is signaled early and deepens when Mira appears, making abandonment visceral. Viktor’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to stay, not because forced, but because he’s redefined mastery. Cost is unmistakable: trading Academy recognition for village apprenticeship. The covenant’s end tightens pressure, forcing a crystallized stance under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—recovering what the clasp “stole”—tightens meaningfully when Mara realizes the lock preserves rather than conceals, shifting her goal from extraction to reception. Agency is clear: her final frequency adjustment is a precise, high-stakes choice under time pressure (midnight countdown). Cost is felt in the relinquishment of mechanical force for attuned listening, crystallized as the city’s collective breath becomes her tuning fork. Coincidence never resolves; the fireworks’ pauses mirror but don’t cause her breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—mastering wisdom through patience—is signaled early and tightens when Mira shifts from grasping to sketching. Her agency drives escalation: choosing slow observation over speed alters tactics (dew watering, fungal detection). Cost is felt in mocked isolation and embodied in her final breath amid stench. Coincidence never resolves; the bloom responds only to her earned attunement.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding resilience for failing crops—is signaled early and tightens at the Inversion, which forces Kessa’s confrontation with the monument. Her agency drives escalation: choosing the narrow water path, pressing the arrow into the socket. Cost is visible—the temporary plant growth implies a deeper lack, resolved only through conceptual shift. Slight deduction: the Inversion’s one-hour window creates urgency but doesn’t alter tactics beyond anchoring the skiff; time pressure remains atmospheric rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding and containing the convergence—is signaled early and tightens when Maya realizes it’s expanding. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to install monitors, transforming investigation into prevention. The cost is conceptual (humanity unprepared) and spatial (the convergence’s growth), made tangible in millimeters-per-hour measurements. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with each observation deepening the anomaly’s implications without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (“certify wonder as essential”) tightens when Lyrian realizes the composition is for the aurora, not bells—a deepening that forecloses her original plan. Her agency drives escalation: choosing to strike ice unleashes the symphony. Cost is unmistakable—the Council’s demolition order looms, and failure means cultural erasure. Coincidence never resolves; the aurora responds because Lyrian’s action aligns with the sheet’s ancient design.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—understanding the true purpose of the Threshold—is signaled early and deepens through Kessa’s realization that separation was the error. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses to weave rather than seal, foreclosing the old guardianship forever. Cost is unmistakable: she must unlearn ancestral doctrine and risk contact with the Other Place. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves the core tension.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving vanishing identities through transposed empathy—is signaled early and deepens as stars disappear. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she actively prints broadsheets calibrated to disorient readers, each act narrowing her own identity. Cost is unmistakable: “She couldn’t remember which personality was originally hers.” The soldier’s discipline vs. poet’s leaps dramatizes internal conflict with tangible stakes. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—coaxing wonder from routine preservation—is signaled early and deepened when Elara realizes her tremor is attunement, not weakness. The tightening occurs at the Convergence: she must either retreat to courier anonymity or accept bridgehood, with Corvin’s fate showing the cost. Agency is clear—her decision to receive the Luminari’s knowledge forecloses her old identity. Cost is legible in the final line: “the next relic calling” implies endless responsibility, not escape.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—scientific validation of emotional residue—is signaled early and tightens when frost forms unexpectedly, forcing Vera to act before warmth erases proof. Agency drives escalation: her choice to commune triggers the climax; photographing the patterns is a tactical response to environmental pressure (rising sun). Cost is felt in decades of isolation and the urgency of documentation. One meaningful deepening suffices: the shift from personal belief to objective evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—reaching her trafficked daughter—sharpens through one decisive deepening: Mei learns each woven message costs a memory. This constraint forces agonizing trade-offs (first word, favorite song), narrowing options until only self-annihilation remains. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens; cost is unmistakable in lost memories and final amnesia. Coincidence never resolves—only the craft, paid for in flesh of mind.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming traded-away rest—is signaled early via the silk’s nature and tightens when Korin descends into memory-thin chambers. His agency drives escalation: choosing to weave exhaustion into recovery rather than replicate violence. Cost is unmistakable in the merchant’s face—“memories of dreams he’d sold”—and Korin’s burden of future seekers. The single deepening (mine descent) narrows options to one resonant act: forging not a weapon but liberation, aligning perfectly with the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—uncovering why her mother vanished—is signaled early and tightens when Kira learns map-making destroys realities. The escalation is protagonist-driven: each redirect deepens knowledge and raises emotional cost, culminating in the choice to heal rather than flee. The moral calculus—gift as curse—sharpens the climax without abstraction. Luck complicates (cyclical shard appearances) but resolution stems from Kira’s agency, satisfying causal pressure with visible conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—confronting loneliness that consumes—is signaled early via letters and deepens when Elsa realizes she’s been chosen *because* of her solitude. The meaningful tightening occurs at the cairns: “danger,” “remember safety,” “protect” narrow her choice from observer to guardian. Cost is felt in her irreversible role shift and the ghosts’ dependence. Escalation is driven by Elsa’s agency—she climbs, interprets, chooses—not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—guiding lost realities home—tightens when the third ship reveals Mira’s duality, forcing her to harmonize with her inverse. This deepening isn’t coincidental; her agency drives escalation (laughter intensifies, then syncs). Cost is unmistakable: she abandons solo stewardship for co-creation, altering reality’s navigation rules. The “morning that forgot how to dawn” subplot raises emotional stakes without diluting focus, converging cleanly at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—managing the magnetic pull of stories—is signaled early and deepens when Chen reveals the heart’s origin. Kael’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to seek Chen, accepts the wing, and commits to learning illumination. The cost—emotional heaviness, risk of being overwhelmed—is felt in his body (“growing heavier”) and crystallized in the final beat where he tucks the wing away, accepting ongoing responsibility. Pressure tightens coherently under an Accumulative lens: each story adds weight until release becomes necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming preservation into meaningful reinterpretation—is signaled early and deepens when Marcus decodes the astronomer’s grief. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: deconstructing the sextant under moonlight reveals new pathways, narrowing his options from repair to reinvention. Cost is legible: he abandons his thirty-year role, accepting that maintenance means transformation. One tightening suffices at this length, though the silent corridor beat slightly risks coincidence—it’s redeemed by its function as temporal pivot, not resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—rekindling dawn through collective memory—is signaled early and tightens when Elara shifts from solitary ritual to communal song. The meaningful deepening occurs when scattered memories coalesce into shared voice, narrowing options to one fragile path. Cost is unmistakable: their light is “not quite dawn,” demanding daily renewal—a Charged Poise where survival hinges on continued vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether compassion requires self-cruelty—is signaled early and deepens when Ezra chooses to approach despite drowning in her grief. His agency drives escalation: he renounces retreat, performs tranquility, and offers his own lateness as balm. The cost is felt in his chest as guilt and in the irreversible folding of the telegram. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; one meaningful deepening suffices, and it forecloses isolation as viable refuge.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—granting absolution through witnessing—is signaled early and deepens when Lila enters the tea house. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: her attentiveness literally materializes lost things. Cost is legible (“as long as someone tends the gardens”) and conceptual (eternal responsibility for displaced sacredness). Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from Lila’s choices to notice and nurture.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving humanity’s final promises—is signaled early and tightens via the library’s decay. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her sampling method narrows options (only 9.7+ intensity slides saved), culminating in the founder’s slide redefining “preservation” as cyclical renewal. Cost is unmistakable: thousands of vows dissolve, ice cracks beneath her, and the library’s fall is irreversible. Coincidence doesn’t resolve—Elara’s choice to clutch the ancient slide crystallizes her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—thwarting the medical shipment—is signaled early and tightens when Mae learns someone’s been recording them, raising personal risk. Her agency drives escalation: choosing bloodline over cover stories, then surrendering the fob. Cost is unmistakable: exile from the market, symbolized by the changed weight of the fob. Pressure coheres under Causal lens, with one decisive deepening that forecloses options.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding her grandmother’s legacy—is signaled early and tightens when three carriers converge, forcing Marina to choose between skepticism and belonging. Escalation is driven by her agency: she follows the compass, stays for the election, accepts her role. Cost is unmistakable: lifelong denial collapses into irreversible identity shift, foreclosing her old scientific self. Coincidence (solar storms) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the forest’s choice and her genetic activation are earned.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—creative liberation from memorial fixation—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Lyra sees the second painting: “Stop hiding behind memory. Create.” This deepening forces renunciation of her mnemonic safety, with cost felt in her cracked-open chest and irreversible shift in practice. Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist agency under Accumulative pressure, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—truth versus survival—is signaled early and tightens decisively at junction seven. Vera’s agency drives escalation: she pieces fragments, follows the map, retrieves messages. The cost is legible: delivering candor will dissolve societal peace. Her choice isn’t abstract; it’s embodied in transcribing thousands of truths onto living leaves, risking her role and safety.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving the color of wonder—is signaled early and tightens when the fragment melts. Mariel’s agency drives escalation: she tests failed methods, interprets a dream, then executes a precise tuning sequence. The deepening occurs when the bell absorbs the ice, transforming stakes from preservation to transmission. Cost is visible: the ice vanishes, yet its essence spreads—a trade-off between intimacy and immortality. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the dream cues insight, but Mariel must act.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—resolving inner static before total fragmentation—is signaled early and deepens when M-47 recognizes fears as fuel. Escalation is protagonist-driven: crushing each fear narrows survival options (too much chaos = ecosystem collapse; too little = cognitive death). Cost is unmistakable: burning Sarah’s terror of being forgotten risks losing her memory entirely, yet M-47 proceeds. The magnetic shift isn’t coincidence but a live clock forcing irreversible tactics under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming voice and connection—is signaled early via the locket and mailbox. Pressure escalates causally: discovery → identification → journey → community mobilization → letter recovery. Each turn narrows options (e.g., breaking the mailbox is rejected; only systemic intervention works). Cost is felt: Elena’s muteness, displacement, and grief are not erased but metabolized through collective action. Coincidence (Jorge’s nephew) complicates plausibly but doesn’t resolve—the real agency lies in neighbors’ coordinated effort.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—liberating Dr. Voss’s encoded consciousness—is signaled early and tightens when Maya realizes she is both lock and key. The deepening occurs during the reversal sequence, which demands mastery over undoing as well as creation, narrowing options to a single embodied path. Cost is legible: the “weight of destiny” and inherited burden are felt, not declared. Escalation is driven by Maya’s agency—her dance choices directly trigger system responses, avoiding coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—recovering Elena’s memory—is signaled early via coffee grounds and pressed flowers. Pressure escalates through protagonist agency: Marina reads patterns, digs, and chooses which memory to keep. The deepening—learning memories were surgically extracted—narrows options: full retrieval risks unbearable grief. Cost is unmistakable: she endures partial loss to avoid collapse, a trade-off shaped by the gravity-pocket world rules.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—containing a self-fulfilling prophecy—is signaled early and escalates organically as fragments resist silencing. The summoner’s agency drives every turn: she redirects, weaves, and channels the prophecy using her cultivated relationships with the glade’s consciousnesses. Cost is unmistakable: her exhaustion, the erasure of prevented futures (“wars prevented, loves that would never bloom”), and the irreversible dispersal of her life’s quiet guardianship.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—deciphering architectural memory—is signaled early and deepens through mutual revelation. The tightening occurs when Marcus admits his grandmother heard buildings too, transforming Elara’s solitary pursuit into shared vocation. Cost is legible: vulnerability replaces secrecy, with emotional risk implied in their charged proximity. Escalation is driven by character agency (confession, offering the seal) under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming quarantined memories—is signaled early and escalates through Marina’s agency: she chooses to follow whispers, dig, and reunite the shell. The tightening occurs when metadata (“coordinates, timestamps”) reveals her younger self’s cleverness, raising stakes from passive haunting to active recovery. Cost is unmistakable: dirt under nails, jagged cuts, and the emotional toll of reliving loss. Coincidence never resolves; the garden’s perfume merely intensifies pressure, forcing her forward.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—breaking the chain of calibrated treason—is signaled early and tightens when Mei holds both forged documents. Her agency drives escalation: choosing neither forgery but truth reweights all prior acts. Cost is unmistakable: relinquishing control over outcomes, risking her brother’s life on honesty alone. Pressure coheres under causal lens, with each beat narrowing options until only renunciation remains viable.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—deciding whether to preserve self or join the eternal chorus—is signaled early via the shell and deepened by each revealed name. Agency is absolute: Senna *chooses* to sing louder, to dissolve. Cost is unmistakable: total forfeiture of human life and form. Pressure escalates through progressive disclosure (names → memories → truth), culminating in her grandmother’s plea that crystallizes the moral calculus: translator vs. mortal.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering the antidote—is signaled early and deepens when Marina learns of twelve more globes, escalating her mission. Pressure tightens via protagonist agency: her transcription activates the chemist’s spirit and reveals global stakes. Cost is felt in Charged Poise: dawn approaches as spirits fade, forcing immediate action. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; ghosts’ appearances are deliberate, tied to Marina’s unique perception.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving hidden effort—is signaled early and deepens through the firefly-whisk-net pattern convergence. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: her whistle alters firefly paths, her observation reveals geometric unity, her mending becomes philosophical rebellion. Cost is unmistakable: her labor remains anonymous, her presence erased by dew. One meaningful tightening suffices, and it forecloses recognition while affirming purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. protection—is signaled early and deepens when Marcus learns officials sacrificed lives for data. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: reconstructing letters, digging, choosing burial over exposure. The tightening (storm approaching) forces a trade-off with clear cost: abandoning vindication to sustain sanctuary. Moral calculus sharpens the peak choice—competing goods (justice vs. mercy)—without convenient resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—shaping the Prophet’s emergence through signal-weaving—is signaled early and tightens when 107.3 FM blooms with his humming melody, forcing Marlowe’s decisive broadcast. Her agency drives escalation: each transmission (Fibonacci morse, prime-number songs) alters reality’s fabric, provoking responses that confirm rising transformation. Cost is felt in her solitude and the implied exhaustion of seven years’ vigil, crystallized in her knowing smile at obsolescence. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence resolving stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving vanishing voices—is signaled early and deepens when Marcus seeks the box’s owner. His agency drives escalation: he walks the beach, plays the melody, endures rejection until Elena. Cost is felt: seventeen years of isolation crystallize into one fragile chance. Coincidence (finding Elena on her bench) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the real turn is Marcus’s choice to offer forgiveness as possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—protecting the artifact to maintain the ice covenant—is signaled early and tightens when Collectors’ boots crack on dock ice. Mira’s agency drives escalation: her humming triggers the vault, her voice matches frequencies, her body becomes conduit. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits human form, leaving only a coat. The deepening isn’t just tactical but ontological—she doesn’t hide the artifact; she becomes its voice, foreclosing any return to flesh.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—cognitive autonomy—is signaled early and deepened through the 73-hour window, a live clock that narrows options. Kira’s agency drives escalation: her seventeen-year preparation enables the retuning, and each rod placement forecloses conformity. Cost is unmistakable: exhaustion, risk of Council retaliation, and societal disorientation. The revolution’s success hinges on her restraint, making the “softly purposeful” method both tactic and price.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—liberation from modern bondage—is signaled early via Jerome’s clutching the lantern and deepens through Margot’s borrowed memories, which reframe his cardiac arrest as spiritual overload. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each vision forces Margot to confront her own complicity in a system that “counted bodies but never souls.” The tightening occurs when she recognizes her grandmother’s identical mission, foreclosing her old identity with tangible cost (resignation). Coincidence (finding the lamp) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her choice to act is wholly earned under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—transforming apology into action—is signaled early and tightens through Eliza’s decision to follow Thomas’s notes, foreclosing perpetual resentment. Agency resides in her hands; Marcus facilitates but does not resolve. Cost is felt in her acknowledgment of Thomas’s unworthiness *and* her refusal to be defined by his violence. Escalation is driven by protagonist choice under Causal lens, with visible emotional price shaping every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—translating violence into vision—is signaled early and tightens when Pioneer realizes predator/prey are “same survival equation.” Her agency drives escalation: she rewrites her own algorithm, etches wings, then dives, forcing evolution itself to “grow new senses.” Cost is legible: predecessors dissolved, social mockery endured, and the irreversible leap into acid. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her choices under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding where deleted files (and people) go—is signaled early and tightens when Lila discovers the shadow network. Her agency drives escalation: each decryption (recipe coordinates, like-patterns) narrows options until she chooses self-archival. Cost is legible: she forfeits physical existence to join the compressed. Coincidence complicates (4827 anomalies) but never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether empathy can be weaponized or cultivated—is signaled early and tightens when Mira recognizes the merchant’s shattered denial became teaching tools. Her agency drives escalation: choosing solitude, interpreting mirrors, accepting the apple. Cost is felt in her relinquished identity (“shadows… no longer armor”) and implied future labor (carrying fragments as seeds). One meaningful deepening suffices, though a second tactical shift would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—learning the music of endings—is signaled early and deepens through Marlene’s ice-watch duty, culminating in her decision to stay. The tightening occurs when she recognizes her own transformation in the ice’s collapse: what she sought as death becomes song. Cost is felt in her continued presence amid loss, gripping the parasol until it cuts her—a small but resonant price. Agency lies in attention and endurance, not action, which aligns perfectly with the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—nurturing understanding across incompatible worlds—is signaled early and deepens when Elena’s daughter arrives bearing preserved letters and hybrid wine. The tightening occurs not through external pressure but internal recalibration: Marcus shifts from sentinel of loss to mentor of synthesis. Cost is felt in twenty years of solitude, yet agency lies in his choice to sit beside her. Coincidence (her arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the real escalation is emotional readiness.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving wisdom echoes—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the line walker declares, “We must act tonight,” foreclosing delay. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens: each consecrated clearing intensifies purpose and elicits a responsive shift from the parapet. Cost is legible in exhaustion, urgency, and the irreversible unveiling of her scarred face. However, the stakes remain slightly abstract; while emotionally resonant, the tangible consequence of failure (beyond dimming lights) isn’t dramatized, softening the pressure’s visceral bite.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving collective memory against municipal erasure—is signaled early and tightens when Elara chooses participatory reenactment over passive display. Escalation is driven by her agency: tracing timelines, designing the hunt, inviting descendants. Cost is unmistakable: the imminent bulldozing deadline forces irreversible action. Under the Accumulative lens, each photo deepens pressure until the spiral’s completion becomes inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—language’s right to evolve—is signaled early and deepens when the crystal reveals growth in “spaces between official definitions.” Escalation occurs through Elena’s agency: her documentation of ephemeral words forces confrontation with the Committee, narrowing options from private observation to public testimony. The cost is conceptual (the Committee’s crumbling authority) and personal (Elena’s isolation), crystallized when she chooses fractured speech over linear compliance. Coincidence never resolves; pressure tightens because she acts on what the crystal shows.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—locating the sound of time passing through a human body—is signaled early and deepens when the woman arrives seeking her grandmother’s aging voice. Ezra’s agency lies in renunciation: he doesn’t interfere, trusting his forgotten prophecies, which tightens pressure by narrowing his role to witness. The cost is felt in his perpetual exile from his own knowledge, crystallized when he writes “Tomorrow you will remember having helped her today”—a prophecy he’ll forget, ensuring his solitude endures. Coincidence complicates (she arrives just as he writes), but resolution stems from his steadfast method.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—stabilizing the observatory against temporal unraveling—is signaled early and tightens when the clock hand’s spin threatens structural integrity. Ezra’s agency drives escalation: she doesn’t wait for rescue but actively restructures using her unique method. The cost is felt in her acceptance of perpetual suspension, crystallized in the backward-ticking clock that heals foundations at the price of freedom. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, intensifying through sensory and mechanical decay before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—transforming dying into living through music—is signaled early and tightens when blood work forces Maya to compress her legacy into weeks. Her agency drives escalation: commissioning the frame, recording hospice sounds, gathering everyone for the finale.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—containing reality’s unraveling—is signaled early via bent spoons and upward shadows. Escalation is driven by Lyra’s agency: she deciphers coordinates, recognizes the inverted rune, and actively seals gaps. The noon deadline creates coherent pressure that narrows options (shadows must be guided before zenith). Cost is unmistakable: she inherits eternal guardianship, foreclosing ordinary life, crystallized in her solitude as the world remains “unaware.”

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reconciling loss with love—is signaled early and deepens when Elara admits the switch was meant as mercy. Thomas’s agency drives escalation: his bone-setting philosophy (“understanding why they broke apart”) reweights healing as transformation. Cost is felt in Elara’s departure and Thomas’s solitude, yet the garden becomes a site of purpose. One meaningful tightening suffices; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—guiding ships without the lighthouse—is signaled early and deepens when the sea glass glows, transforming personal ritual into communal tool. Pressure escalates through protagonist agency: Marina chooses to teach, distribute, and reframe navigation itself. Cost is felt in the quiet surrender of singular authority (no longer sole keeper) and the labor-intensive nature of the new system. Coincidence (glass washing ashore) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from Marina’s persistent action under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—transforming institutional betrayal into regenerative meaning—is signaled early and intensified by the viral confession, which threatens her sanctuary’s privacy. Kira’s agency lies in renunciation (ignoring media) and invitation (offering moss), narrowing her path from solitary healer to mentor. The cost is palpable: vulnerability in sharing her secret garden. Marcus’s arrival isn’t coincidence but consequence of her story’s spread, forcing a meaningful deepening under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether stories can capture hope—is signaled early and deepens when Marina realizes she’s writing “backward.” The tightening occurs at the old woman’s passage: witnessing another transient figure catalyzes her insight. Agency is renunciatory (releasing hopes) with felt cost—abandoning her collected notebooks’ authority. Coincidence complicates (fireflies at dawn) but doesn’t resolve; the shift comes from Marina’s observation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring sacred connection—is signaled early and deepens when the tendril shivers, narrowing options to song alone. Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency: she chooses memory over tools, then teaches the village. Cost is felt in her emotional vulnerability (“voice cracked”) and the irreversible shift from individual to communal practice. Under Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening suffices; the moon’s arrival tightens the clock without coincidence resolving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—capturing the crater’s pulse before it shifts—is signaled early and tightens when starlight “remembers” rather than pours, forcing micro-adjustments. The alchemist’s agency drives escalation: she places cores, uncorks vials, ignites paper, each choice narrowing options (e.g., wind stopping demands slowness). Cost is unmistakable in her stiff joints and the orchard’s irreversible straightening. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via density increase (materials → light → constellations).

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder through documenting temporal leakage—is signaled early and deepens as the mechanism’s self-healing loops teach Mara its own repair. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her peripheral method, learned from her grandmother, allows her to witness the timer’s past and future configurations, culminating in the noon shift where sound precedes source. This tightening forces a trade-off: she chooses documentation over restoration, accepting that wonder escapes mechanical capture. The cost is legible in her decision to store observations “beneath the weight of ordinary repairs,” a tangible forfeiture of conventional mastery for esoteric knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—measuring emotional mass through fractal geometry—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: Mara chooses to weave heavier burdens (mountains dreaming, oceans remembering). The meaningful tightening occurs when she incorporates the grotto’s own weight, escalating from personal grief to cosmic responsibility. Cost is unmistakable: the lamp grows warm without flame, the hush parts to reveal whale song, and she accepts self-woven imprisonment. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—how to honor love after death—is signaled early and deepens via Margaret’s carving choices under temporal pressure. Agency manifests in renunciation (rejecting the lion) and creation (the handless clock), each narrowing options with felt cost. The escalation is driven by protagonist action: opening the box, choosing the form, deciding to teach. Coincidence never resolves; even the tiger’s turn is backstory, not plot device.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reconciling eroded dreams with present purpose—is signaled by “architect’s dreams... worn down to nothing” and tightens when the ghost appears at the carousel’s stop. Escalation occurs through Kira’s agency: each fragment collected deepens understanding of systemic failure (“success... no longer needed them”), narrowing options from rebuilding to witnessing. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits her original ambition but gains custodianship, crystallized when the ghost dissolves after their spectral touch. The lagoon’s restart implies renewed motion, but Kira’s role has irrevocably shifted—endurance with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the terminal’s hidden logic—is signaled early and tightens when Maya uses the sextant to unlock flow constants. Pressure escalates through physical effort (rust, decades-still valves) and intellectual risk (defying her professor). The cost is conceptual: she trades academic credibility for solitary revelation. Though stakes remain internal, they’re viscerally rendered—water arcs as proof that “hope can be engineered.” No false resolutions; success emerges from her agency alone.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—reconciling lost artistry with present purpose—is signaled early via the letter and deepened through sensory triggers (petrichor, crystal hum). The meaningful tightening occurs when Elara realizes teaching requires “understanding gained through silence,” narrowing her options from total withdrawal to partial re-engagement. Cost is felt in her acceptance of duality (“three days… four in the sanctuary”), foreclosing full return to either world. Escalation is driven by her agency: memory and reflection alter tactics, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—confronting inherited lies—is signaled early and deepens when the sundial reveals Van der Meer’s complicity, forcing Mara to recognize her own avoidance. The tightening occurs when she connects his confession to her father’s sweatshops, narrowing her options from flight to confrontation. Cost is felt in the renunciation of perpetual seeking (“not as an errant legend seeker”) and the vulnerability of returning home. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves the core conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving endangered knowledge—is signaled early and tightens through Mara’s decoding, which narrows options from passive collection to active transmission. The deepening occurs when she realizes this rope is the last record, forcing the decision to teach the granddaughter by morning. Cost is felt: the weight of being the sole inheritor, the physical toll of cold and concentration. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency, though the pressure remains internal and accumulative rather than confrontational.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—documenting the “living dead” before their stories vanish—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes Marcus’s erosion differs from others’. Her agency lies in attention and projection, which foreclose paths: she cannot save them, only witness. The tightening occurs when she grasps that healing = mapping wounds, not closing them—a conceptual shift with emotional cost. Under the Accumulative lens, this deepening reweights every prior observation without needing external conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—rekindling organic life in a clockwork world—is signaled early and deepens when the hatching reveals imperfection. Aldric’s agency drives escalation: his hypothesis, assembly, and vigil narrow options until only acceptance remains. Cost is unmistakable: his physical ruin and the bird’s deformity. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via sensory and emotional density, not causal turns, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration of what “beauty” means.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—transforming inherited destruction into unyielding compassion—is signaled early and deepens through the grafting ritual, which forecloses the path of mere opposition or denial. Pressure escalates texturally: memory → action → embodiment → talisman. Cost is felt in what she releases (grief for recognition) and what she carries (weight of the coin, vigilance at the station). Agency is clear: she chooses the ritual, recalls her first fire not passively but as proof of divergence, and reconfigures her father’s legacy through deliberate, embodied act.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—liberating trapped memories—is signaled early and deepens when Marcus realizes he’s not solving a mystery but completing a ritual. The tightening occurs when the woman reveals memories were “composting,” reframing the mission from rescue to cultivation. Protagonist agency drives escalation: Marcus chooses to offer the box, walk the fountains, and stay behind. Cost is felt in his abandoned skepticism and the geese’s “held breath” now paid forward as cosmic responsibility. Coincidence (geese pausing) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the ritual requires deliberate action.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving stellar memory across eons—is signaled early and tightens through the dying red giant’s measured heartbeats and the newborn star’s ignition. The Keeper’s agency manifests as attention and endurance; her choice to continue witnessing forecloses solitude’s escape with palpable cost. Escalation occurs via density increase (sonar data revealing protostars and white dwarfs) under an Accumulative lens. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; pressure coheres entirely through pattern deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—giving shape to collective grief—is signaled by the first paragraph and deepens through Martha’s struggle to braid individual losses into one design. The tightening occurs when the grandfather warns, “The migration won’t wait,” forcing urgency that narrows options: she must finish before the butterflies leave, before his presence fades. Cost is unmistakable: her solitude, his departure, the irreversible act of finalizing names in stone. Agency drives escalation—her retracing, her poem readings, her listening—not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—precision as ethics—is signaled early and deepens when overwinding fractures village life. Theodore’s agency drives escalation: his insomnia, carving, and ritual confession narrow options until only public atonement remains. Cost is unmistakable: forty seconds cascade into broken hulls, postponed love, drenched mourners. The tightening forecloses redemption-through-forgetting, forcing emergence through accountability.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—decoding grief’s transformation into devotion—is signaled early and deepens when Marta abandons her time ritual to fully engage the tapestry. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses patient untangling over force, mirroring her gardening ethos; this agency reweights all prior graves as “planted intentions.” Cost is felt in the still chess clock (suspended self-protection) and the weight of inherited responsibility. Pressure accumulates texturally, not causally, but remains coherent under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—seeding innovation within stifling systems—is signaled early and deepens when Mira targets the Council’s blind spots. Escalation is driven by her agency: she doesn’t wait for permission but engineers cognitive pathways via embedded maps. Cost is unmistakable: her labor remains uncredited, her triumph private. The tightening occurs when she shifts from mapping external voids to internal ones, narrowing focus to human potential constrained by bureaucracy.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—rekindling forbidden storytelling—is signaled early and escalates when the pirate broadcast delivers coded instructions. Mariel’s agency drives deepening: she chooses to weave rebel notes into official scores, risking execution. The cost is legible in her isolation, reliance on scarce resources (candles as currency), and implied threat (“they knew about her”). Pressure tightens coherently under the Accumulative lens: each added layer (ink-dust mixture, wax seals) increases narrative payload and personal peril without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—ephemeral transformation versus permanent accountability—is signaled early and deepens when Thomas dies mid-portrait, proving some emotions are “too heavy to survive.” Marlene’s agency drives escalation: she chooses which truths to weave, knowing authorities will come, and completes the ritual despite risk. The cost is unmistakable: Thomas’s death, her inherited burden, and the cyclical arrival of fugitives who misunderstand the gallery’s promise. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens—each ash grain adds weight until collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving truth vs. comforting lies—is signaled early and tightens when Marcus reveals the cog’s true origin, forcing the woman to disclose her dual role. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: Marcus’s accusation compels her confession, which in turn reconfigures his stance. Cost is unmistakable: three years of solitude rendered obsolete, yet necessary; truth preserved only through deliberate misdirection. The final choice—to collaborate—narrows his path from rebellion to custodianship with emotional and existential weight.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving vanishing art through communal practice—is signaled early and deepens when students arrive to learn the modes. Chen’s agency drives escalation: her choice to teach despite incomplete knowledge catalyzes collaborative discovery. Cost is unmistakable—the university’s closure looms, the zither will be stored—but the group’s creation of new harmony forecloses despair with visible emotional and cultural price. Pressure accumulates texturally, not causally, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory against state-enforced forgetting—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s pruning, which feeds ancestral fragments into the seed. The tightening occurs when she chooses cultivation over destruction, narrowing options: this single seed is all she has. Agency is clear—her hands, her taste, her timing—and the cost (loss of career, risk of capture) is felt in every action. Escalation is driven by protagonist choice under an Accumulative lens: each memory fragment reweights the seed’s potential until the garden erupts. Coincidence (moons) complicates but doesn’t resolve—Mira’s preparation makes success possible.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake (saving the bees vs. maintaining secrecy) tightens decisively when Mira broadcasts the truth—a choice that forecloses her hidden life with tangible cost (exposure, potential punishment). Escalation is driven by her agency: the blackout forces her hand, but the confession is hers alone. The drone failure raises stakes credibly, and the “visible price” (her trembling hands, racing heart) alters tactics—no more lies, only revelation. Coincidence complicates (the surge), but resolution is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding how places absorb and transmute human absence—is signaled early and deepens through Marina’s tracing of displaced objects. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: she walks to the bay, uses the shard, interprets the visions, and chooses to offer it. The tightening forecloses her role as mere cataloguer; she becomes participant, paying the price of surrendering her ancestral talisman. Cost is unmistakable in the final lines: “only the most patient observers would ever notice them burning their gentle way through the world”—a life sentence of quiet vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—truth versus myth of Nerida—is signaled early and tightens through cascading revelations that foreclose Marina’s prior worldview. Agency is clear: Thessaly chooses to drown the city; Marina chooses to publish nuance. Each escalation stems from protagonist decisions under coherent pressure, culminating in a trade-off with felt cost (reputation, moral certainty). The ethical calculus between genocide and mass drowning sharpens the peak choice without false equivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—escaping the loop to reclaim agency over a lost choice—is signaled early and deepens when Marcus realizes the staircase’s step count equals Sarah’s heartbeats. His agency manifests through deliberate rhythm (seven steps, roll, adjust), with each throw increasing entropy. The cost is felt in the blurring of Sarah’s face and the irreversible passage of her life off-stage. Escalation is driven by his actions, not coincidence, and the final poise reweights freedom as mathematically inevitable yet emotionally deferred.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving unspoken kindness across language barriers—is signaled early and deepens when Mira’s art becomes communal archive. Agency is clear: her insomnia-fueled painting reweights silence into resonance. Cost is felt (three sleepless nights, emotional vulnerability) but could be sharper—e.g., physical toll or risk of exposure. Escalation via protagonist’s choice (posting online) drives response flood, though developer threat remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—resisting cultural erasure—is signaled early and deepens as the thaw accelerates deterioration. Marta’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to document despite futility, narrowing her option to “save what I can.” The rosewater scent and crashing ice raise pressure coherently under the Accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable: sections of wall blur irreversibly during her work, and the dead hives echo parallel loss. No coincidence resolves; stakes tighten through environmental cause and character response.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—repairing time’s distortion—is signaled early and tightens when Elara realizes the stone was “meant to illuminate.” The meaningful deepening occurs mid-climb: understanding the original keeper’s error transforms prevention into prison. Agency drives escalation: every reversal (lens disassembly, counter-clockwise winding) narrows options and raises stakes. Cost is unmistakable: Elara trades anonymity for cosmic responsibility, crystallized in her laughter—“bitter and triumphant.”

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—confronting the source of her death—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Mara reads the notes backward, forcing Fear’s manifestation. Agency is clear: her choice to speak truth (“Break it”) resolves the conflict. Cost is felt: she now carries Fear, albeit contained. Escalation is driven by protagonist action under a Causal lens, though the dream dictionary feels slightly expository—it enables the turn but lacks prior tactical use, limiting pressure depth.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—escape via sonic engineering—is signaled early and tightens as each gyre shrinks. Kessa’s agency drives escalation: she reads clouds, strikes wood, layers sound, and syncs with whales. Cost is visible in her aching muscles and collapsed form. The fractal’s collapse isn’t luck—it’s interference generated by her precise, increasingly desperate strikes under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering what happened to the expedition—tightens decisively when the crack reveals the watchers are warnings, not monuments. Mira’s agency drives escalation: her translation forces a trade-off between safety and truth. The cost is immediate and physical—the city itself resists her departure via the rusted gate—and conceptual: the world’s rules invert (turtles wake, watchers move). Coincidence never resolves; all pressure stems from her choices and discoveries.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. stabilizing myth—is signaled early and deepens when Marcus cites the Senate Uprising as real-world harm. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to reveal evidence, transmit copies, and walk toward the telegraph room. Cost is clear: exile, threat of destruction, and Marcus’s torn loyalty. However, the Ministry’s off-stage power remains abstract; we don’t see tangible consequences beyond Marcus’s warning, slightly muting the price. Still, the moral calculus sharpens effectively at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving drowned dreams—is signaled early and deepens when Edmund shifts from official assessment to personal ritual. Protagonist agency drives escalation: his method of hidden notes evolves into the grandmother-specific bottle burial, foreclosing easy detachment. Cost is unmistakable in “carrying the weight of witnessed absence” and the building’s imminent demolition. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via textural intensification, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—verifying historical truth before electromagnetic interference returns—tightens via Mira’s agency: her “alternative hypothesis” deepens conflict from whole-book forgeries to surgically altered pages. Each marked page forecloses future deception, with cost felt in time lost and truths left unverified. Pressure escalates coherently under Accumulative lens: discordant frequencies → pattern recognition → corporate conspiracy revelation. The blackout clock forces irreversible trade-offs, crystallizing her stance as guardian of fragmented honesty.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming grief into bearable form—is signaled early and deepens when Mei discovers “possibility” in a gem, shifting from preservation to acceptance. This protagonist-driven intensification narrows her path: she stops merely recording and begins crafting lanterns, foreclosing private mourning for communal healing. Cost is felt (“luminous torment”) and visible in others’ tears. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening suffices, though a second tightening (e.g., Master Shen’s dialogue prompting a concrete choice) would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—recovering unlived potential—is signaled early and deepens when the scanner reveals non-degrading consciousness patterns. Amira’s agency drives escalation: she initiates the scan, adjusts frequency, and transmits data. The tightening occurs when breakers re-engage early, forcing rapid decisions. Cost is felt in the security breach and moral weight (“robbed” world), though the physical price remains abstract. Chen’s participation raises stakes without resolving conflict—luck complicates (early reboot), but doesn’t solve.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—decoding belonging—is signaled early via the pilgrim’s riddle and matrix chip. Pressure escalates through Kira’s agency: she switches to thermal imaging, follows trails, pulls stones. The meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes heat signatures are constellation maps—a knowledge shift that reconfigures options. Cost is subtle but present: time spent, physical labor, and surrender of skepticism, crystallized in her acceptance of cosmic belonging.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. comfort—is signaled early and tightens through Elias’s sifting, which shifts from passive sorting to active confrontation. The escalation is protagonist-driven: recognizing dates/coordinates forces him to reinterpret his life’s work. Cost is unmistakable: he sacrifices wealth, identity, and familial protection. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure builds via pattern (carvings → map → confession), not coincidence, with stakes crystallizing in his final renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—redemption through reciprocal prisoner exchange—is signaled early and tightens when Elara reveals Thorne’s son is among the twelve. The meaningful deepening occurs in Elara’s moon-phase philosophy, which reframes the exchange as ritualized release rather than transaction. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her choice to extend the drawer pull forces Thorne’s apology and crystallizes mutual vulnerability. Cost is unmistakable—both characters endure the agony of trusting the hand that harmed them.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reconciling navigational failure with present utility—is signaled early and tightens at pole 19, where rescue boats launched incorrectly. Marcus’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to stop, reflect, and ultimately propose teaching. The cost is felt (shame, isolation) and conceptual (abandoning celestial precision). Coincidence (the seal) complicates mood but doesn’t resolve conflict; pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—earning the right to feel despite amnesia—is signaled early and tightens when Marcus learns empathy must be kindled, not apologized for. The deepening occurs when he sees victims’ loved ones hardened by grief; his agency crystallizes in choosing the first bridge. Cost is unmistakable: he accepts a life of labor without hope of forgiveness. Escalation is driven by his choice to engage, not coincidence, under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reforging bond beyond death—is signaled early and tightens when Mira drinks the spices, narrowing options to irreversible dissolution. Agency drives escalation: her choice to uncork the vial (not fate or phoenix intervention) forces the metamorphosis. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits human form for cosmic connection, crystallized in Silverwhisper’s nuzzle now carrying “the chorus of existence.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via sensory density.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming squandered time to heal intergenerational rupture—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: Elara’s card-laying actively unfastens regret, narrowing options (she cannot undo the past but can reframe its weight). Cost is unmistakable: her mother’s spectral presence confirms irreversible loss (“I stayed long enough to see”), yet the glade offers only accumulated time, not resurrection. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each card fall intensifies emotional density without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—integration vs. annihilation of human shadow—is signaled early and deepens when Mei confronts the first murder’s photograph, narrowing options to one irreversible act. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her stitch-weaving actively binds light/dark, altering reality (“warships becoming gardens”). Cost is unmistakable: she risks psychic dissolution (“pacifist soul recoiled”) and embodies the price through gravitational shifts. Under Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via pattern intensification—each tear-trace brings her closer to the fracture until the drop falls.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding transformation’s texture—is signaled early and tightens when Elara opens the first bottle, committing to irreversible change. Escalation is protagonist-driven: her choice to release the bugs synchronizes with cosmic forces she orchestrated through “pure intention,” not luck. Cost is legible in the closure—her physical dissolution—and the narrowing of options (no return after opening the first bottle). Coincidence complicates (storm, eruption) but doesn’t resolve; agency lies in her readiness to receive the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—igniting change without violence—is signaled early and deepens via the blackout’s tactical window. Thorne’s agency drives escalation: he chooses the signal, aligns the object, accepts Amara’s alliance. Cost is unmistakable: seventeen years of watching culminate in irrevocable betrayal of his post. The “thousand paper cuts” strategy shows how small rebellions compound under coherent pressure, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the sacred pattern to understand the eels’ true nature—is signaled early and tightens when the thirteenth stone triggers revelation. Escalation is driven by Yann’s agency: her placement of stones and scattering of dust deepen knowledge, narrowing options from herding to guardianship. Cost is conceptual but felt: she accepts eternal responsibility, foreclosing ordinary life. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each stone adds density until the pattern reweights reality itself.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving truth under erasure—is signaled early and deepens when Maya shifts from recovering banned manuscripts to generating new, uncensorable poems. The meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes deletions teach her “the exact shape of what couldn’t be said,” transforming victimhood into tactical innovation. Agency is clear: her choice to write in light, seal work for successors, and reset the timer constitutes Charged Poise. Cost is felt in perpetual exile, constant vigilance, and the fragility of wet photographs in a storm.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming inquiry into revolution—is signaled early and deepens through each syllogistic exchange, culminating in the invisible sundial’s completion. Agency is clear: Marlowe’s interruption (“But you assume construction is our goal”) forces tactical escalation. Cost is unmistakable in her prosthetic arm and their coded secrecy, though slightly abstracted by the story’s high-concept frame. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with one decisive intensification: the shift from defense to “intellectual jazz.”

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—resisting soul-killing standardization through fragile, distributed beauty—is signaled early and tightens via protagonist agency: October’s monthly personas are tactical tools (September gathers intel, November plants books). The meaningful deepening occurs when she binds disparate fragments into a new anthology, transforming passive salvage into active creation. Cost is unmistakable: the hidden list makes her vulnerable; her chosen illegibility ensures loneliness. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each added page intensifies the thematic and physical risk without coincidence or soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming lost love through creative resistance—is signaled early and tightens via magnetic escalation. Marion’s agency drives every turn: discovering reels, matching music to frames, improvising harmonies. The cost is legible: two years of isolation, dwindling travelers, emotional exhaustion. The climax isn’t luck—it’s earned by her persistent, costly labor, culminating in a trade: stability for possibility, solitude for reunion.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving cultural memory—is signaled early and escalates through Mira’s deepening immersion in contradictory memories. Her agency drives the climax: swallowing the seed initiates the dream-interpretation, and her classification reconfigures reality. The tightening occurs when she realizes consensus isn’t required—this insight forecloses the default empirical path and incurs institutional risk, visible in her anticipation of Council challenge.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reconciling severed parental love—is signaled early and deepens via the lace’s fourth-row revelation: children take unsaid words as anchors. Kenji’s agency lies in renunciation (not chasing Yuki) and endurance (daily shore rituals), culminating in the decision to finally speak. Pressure tightens when the compass needle halts on cerulean—the exact shade of withheld emotion—making the cost visceral. Coincidence (ghost ship washing ashore) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the turn comes from Kenji’s choice to act.
