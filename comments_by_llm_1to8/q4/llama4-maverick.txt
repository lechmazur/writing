  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (unlocking cosmic secrets) progresses through clear stages but lacks genuine opposition or cost. The herder succeeds without meaningful struggle - the "precognitive curse" never manifests as actual hindrance, making the escalation feel predetermined.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=4.2)
    The dominant stake (processing grief/regret) is signaled early but never faces genuine pressure or complication—Kaito simply performs a predetermined ritual that leads smoothly to resolution.

    Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a density increase of sensory details and memories that culminates in a decisive cadence shift. The dominant stake (finding the sound) is signaled early and tightens through her collection of "absences." Protagonist agency drives the climax—her calibration and imprinting of the sound. The cost is felt in the "shattering" sensation and the description of the result as a "battered marvel."

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are clearly signaled and escalate through a single meaningful tightening—the discovery of the logbook—which narrows options and changes knowledge.

    The dominant stake of uncovering secrets is signaled early. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is a single, meaningful deepening as her analysis of the diaries changes her knowledge and reconfigures her understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation is driven by the archivist's agency under the accumulative lens, moving from individual acquisition to public installation.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.5)

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (discovering what happens after goodbye) is signaled early and escalates causally through Kael's agency with the magnetic fields and amulet.

The cost is legible: the amulet's dark power is now a permanent part of Kael, foreclosing a path of simple existence.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is driven by agency: Lena's reflective shift and her father's successful negotiation create a meaningful tightening.

The transition from observation to committed action is a decisive turn earned under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.5)

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake (unlocking resonant awakenings to repay the debt) is clear and escalates causally through the alchemist's agency. The choice to claim the bead is a meaningful tightening that forecloses other paths and unlocks the transformation. The cost is the ghost's dissolution, which is legible on the page, though its emotional weight on the alchemist could be more deeply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through the increasing density and luminous intensity of the weaving process, which reweights the stake of transformation. Protagonist agency drives the escalation, and the cost is the tangible burden of creation. A single meaningful deepening is sufficient and well-executed.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation is driven by Maya's agency under the Accumulative lens, with each discovery deepening the stakes and her commitment. The cost of her labor and the weight of responsibility are legible, though the external pressure could be more viscerally felt to heighten the tension further. The final reconfiguration of her faith is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through the meditative encoding process, culminating in the decisive act of mailing. The dominant stake of creating meaningful connection tightens with the letter's completion, and the cost of anticipation is legible. However, the escalation is more contemplative than driven by urgent, narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation is driven by the Accumulative lens, with pressure building through the density of the stitching process and the looming coup deadline. The dominant stake of uncovering secrets is signaled early and tightens meaningfully as the work nears completion. However, the external threat of the coup remains largely off-stage and abstract, lessening its immediate, visceral pressure on the protagonist's on-page choices. The final charge is more conceptual than a clear, agency-driven narrowing of options under direct duress.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation is driven by Aria's agency under the Accumulative lens, as her use of the rainspout shard actively deepens the mystery and evokes the manifestation.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    Escalation is driven by Kael's active decryption of the cast, a meaningful deepening that changes her knowledge and reweights her internal stake. The cost is legible in the ache that persists even after her shift to peace.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure coheres and deepens through the discovery of the fragment, which acts as a meaningful intensification that reweights the dominant stake (rediscovering artistic purpose). The cost is the effort and emotional investment into creating a piece meant to be reclaimed, legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a single decisive intensification as Lena's playful arrangement of mirrors creates a "dizzying feedback loop." This tightens the situation, forcing a stance crystallization from certainty to curiosity. The cost is legible on the page in the garden's transformation and the palpable shift in Lena's perception. The protagonist's agency drives the entire escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are clearly signaled (taxable thoughts) and the pressure coherently accumulates as the message grows. However, escalation is environmental rather than driven by active opposition, muting the sense of risk and tangible cost to Lyra.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clear and escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency—the decision to sing transforms her longing. The cost (centuries of vigil) is legible, though the pressure feels more internal than externally coherent under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation is textural, achieved through the density increase of the sung song and its alchemical effect on the light. This deepening reweights the dominant stake of preservation, and the cost of endless labor is felt, though agency in initiating the song is slightly passive.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.4)
    Escalation is driven by accumulative density and a final cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake of restoring trust. The pressure coheres, tightening through her focused labor until the breakthrough forces a stance crystallization. The cost is the palpable risk of isolation ("threads of fate... would snap") and is felt on the page. A minor deduction as the escalation is more internal and textural than a clear, agency-driven turn.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation is driven by the accumulative pressure of the environment and Kaelin's deepening realizations, coherent under the textural lens. The dominant stake of harmonizing values is signaled early and tightens meaningfully, though the cost, while felt, is more conceptual than viscerally dramatized in a key choice.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under the accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through a deepening of emotional and thematic stakes rather than causal turns. The dominant stake of achieving internal equilibrium tightens meaningfully as Emilia's reflection leads to a "newfound sense of purpose." The cost of her reinvention is legible, though the escalation relies more on reflection than on-page, present-moment pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.9)
    Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a decisive cadence shift when the weather code reveals its secrets, narrowing options and forcing a choice. The dominant stake (discovering truth) is clear, and the cost of the quest's weight is felt. The agency is primarily in the act of attention and interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are clear and escalation is achieved through a steady, textural deepening of the character's connection to the place. However, the pressure is atmospheric rather than actively complicating, and the protagonist's agency is more receptive than decisive, which limits the score under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a decisive cadence shift (the discovery of the seeds and the subsequent path) that reweights the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clear (to captivate the audience) and escalate through the performance beats, driven by Elian's agency. The cost is conceptual—the weight of unrealized potential—which is legible. Under the Accumulative lens, this is sufficient, though the pressure feels more thematic than viscerally tight.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens—her decision to "fledge" and dance intensifies the stakes. The cost is legible in the etching on her skin and the lifting of exile. A single meaningful deepening is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are clearly signaled (seeking meaning) and escalate through a deepening of perception, consistent with the accumulative lens. The catalyst (the fisherman's stone) is a minor coincidence that complicates but feels slightly external to the glazier's agency. The cost of her renewed commitment remains conceptual, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation is driven by Kael's agency in opening the box, deepening his reflective stakes under the Accumulative lens. The cost is legible in the "weight of his experiences" settling upon him, though the external wildfire conflict remains summarized rather than dramatized, slightly limiting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.1)
    Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a decisive cadence shift into the vision, which deepens Aria's knowledge and reweights the stakes. The cost of overwhelming scale is legible. Agency is demonstrated through her active contemplation and pattern-making.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation is driven by the cartographer's accumulation of knowledge, which deepens the stakes from curiosity to a sense of sacred duty.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake (unlocking the mirrors) is clear. Escalation is accumulative, driven by her agency in painting and humming the lullaby, culminating in the mirrors' response. A cost is felt in the silent, poised anticipation of the ending, a trade-off of a normal life for this pursuit. The escalation is effective but could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake of brokering peace is signaled early. Escalation is achieved accumulatively through the growing symbolic weight of the clipboard and the changing atmosphere, which reweights the stakes. However, the primary tightening—the delegates becoming "more conciliatory"—is somewhat passive, happening to Elian rather than being directly driven by a difficult, on-page choice he must make under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clearly signaled (restoring the land) and escalate with the approaching storm, creating coherent pressure. The protagonist's agency drives the resolution, and the cost of inaction is felt in the desolation. However, the opposition (powerful interests) remains off-page, slightly diluting the immediacy of the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant internal stake (defying conformity) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency in untangling threads, a meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. The cost of shedding her past is legible, though its conceptual nature slightly mutes the visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.9)
    Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through the increasing density of creative inspiration fostered by the dome's atmosphere. The dominant stake (crafting a subversive narrative) tightens meaningfully as her ideas take shape.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are clear and the accumulative pressure builds to a meaningful cadence shift. However, escalation is more observational than driven by active, difficult choices, limiting the visceral feel of the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation under the Accumulative lens is achieved through the swelling music and warping reality, which reweights the dominant stake (teaching release) and forces Elara's stance crystallization. However, the protagonist's agency in the climax is diminished by the vague, magical means of resolution, which complicates the earned nature of the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency—finding the sextant and performing the breathing ritual—which meaningfully deepens the stakes under the Accumulative lens. The cost of her vanishing is legible but operates more on a conceptual than a visceral level.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation is accumulative, built through Elara's persistent nurturing acts. The dominant stake (bridging generational wisdom) tightens meaningfully when the seeds from the satchel catalyze a visible change in the orchard, attracting visitors and ultimately Aria. The cost of her long solitude is the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate through the curator's active inquiry, culminating in the philosophical breakthrough. The cost is conceptual (a shattered worldview) rather than a visible, felt price, which limits the score under the accumulative lens. Agency is clear but the trade-off is abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Causal lens, with the pursuit and the need to "research gaps" creating coherent pressure. The cost of the journey is the shift in Elara's motivation, which is legible. However, the primary external threat (the shadowy figures) is neutralized off-page via summary in the denouement, which deflates the tension of the final confrontation and prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation is driven by Lyra's agency in poring over the book and following the threads, which deepens her knowledge and narrows her options under the Accumulative lens. The cost of mental disorientation is felt on the page and charges the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, escalation is achieved through a decisive intensification of atmospheric and conceptual density.

The price paid is a fundamental shift in perception, felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.9)
    Under the accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through a density increase in sensory and resonant patterns. The dominant stake (finding quiet) is clear, and the protagonist's agency in studying the ice drives the change. The cost is the effort of her concentration, though the external conflict with the energy beings resolves with minimal visible friction.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.3)
    Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a single decisive cadence shift: touching the orrery reweights the dominant stake (rekindling knowledge) with a visible cost (the surge of light and responsibility). The pressure coheres, though the shard's discovery is more happenstance than agency-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clearly signaled and escalate through the storm's clearing and the surge of collective memory, a meaningful deepening under the textural lens. The cost of her transformation—subsuming her identity into the collective—is legible, though its articulation leans slightly toward summary rather than being fully dramatized through a concrete trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation is accumulative, with pressure building through sensory density and the discovery of the note, which deepens her options. The dominant stake of defying hopelessness is signaled early, and the final cadence shift is meaningful, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.5)
    Escalation is achieved through accumulative density of observation and reflection, consistent with the lens. However, the primary pressure is external (the paused conversation) and observed rather than directly enacted upon by the protagonist, muting the sense of agency-driven tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a single, decisive intensification through the density of the gilded hush experience. The dominant stake (overcoming fear) is clear, and the cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation is subtle, driven by the operator's accumulating observations rather than a causal tightening of options. The dominant stake of achieving comfort through understood silence deepens texturally, but the lack of a consequential choice or live option foreclosed limits the peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clearly signaled (restoring Xylophia-IV) and escalate causally through Aria's discoveries. The sunrise timeframe adds tangible pressure. The cost is legible in the "weight settling upon her shoulders," though it could be more visceral. Agency is strong, driving every beat from claiming the flake to ascending the stairs.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under the accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through a decisive intensification of stakes—the waning threshold threatening the sanctuary's essence—which forces the keeper's pivotal choice to reconnect. The dominant stake (preservation/revival) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully. The keeper's agency in "linking through scars" and navigating the shadows drives the escalation. The cost is legible in the emotional weight of encountering past remnants.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are clearly signaled (fulfilling the quantum promise) and escalate coherently under the hybrid lens through Lyra's experimentation. The cost of this risk is somewhat muted, however, as the equipment malfunctions and pressure build-up lack a palpable sense of danger or consequence for Lyra personally.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.1)
    Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the accumulative lens, through the deliberate act of turning the crank. The stake of uncovering a truth is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation is driven by the knight's agency under the Accumulative lens, moving from passive discovery to active unsnapping and chanting.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake (resisting indifference) is clear, but escalation is weak. Pressure accumulates texturally through the gathering's energy rather than through a meaningful tightening of options or a consequential choice by Aria. The cost of the mission is declared but not made viscerally felt or tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive intensification as the music seeps into the negative space and the mist responds, reweighting the dominant stake. The cost is legible in the mist's temporary clearing and its inevitable, eerie return.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake (decoding the message) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the accumulative lens—her prodding of the speck and building of monuments deepen her knowledge. However, the pressure remains gentle and the cost of her transformation is soft, more a promise of future change than a tangible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    Escalation is driven by Elian's agency under the accumulative lens, with the device's creation serving as a meaningful deepening that reweights the stake of navigating uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake (self-redemption) is clear, and pressure escalates through her accumulated experiments and realizations. However, the escalation is more internal and reflective than driven by active, on-page choices that visibly narrow her options under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is driven by the collector's agency under the accumulative lens, moving from observation to active listening and intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clear early (reckoning/redemption). Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens: her decision to enter the forest is a major tightening that forces her to confront her memories. The cost is legible in the reliving of her trauma. A stronger tactile cost during the climax could have elevated the score further.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes escalate effectively under the Accumulative lens through a series of discoveries (purchase, painting, realization). The dominant stake (unlocking hidden histories) is tested and deepened by Lena's agency. The cost is conceptually clear but could be more viscerally immediate in the closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clearly signaled (uncovering secrets) and escalate through a single meaningful deepening: dust analysis reveals the hidden logbook.

Under the Accumulative lens, this is sufficient, though the pressure lacks a tactile tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.3)

    Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative lens, with the discovery of the shard tightening her focus and deepening the stakes. The cost is legible in the "burnished sorrow" that fuels her work.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are clearly signaled (reclaiming light/balance) and escalate through the intensifying glow of the chip and the focused act of repair. The final, successful note is a decisive change earned by Erebus's agency. A slight deduction as the "wilts near dishonesty" trait introduces a declared stake that is not tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a cadence shift (deciphering the symbols) that decisively reweights the dominant stake (the quest for mystery). The cost is the protagonist's subsumption into the mystical realm, which is legible on the page, though the felt price of this loss is somewhat conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes (truth-seeking) escalate through parley, tightening understanding under Accumulative lens. Agency is in Naomi's engagement, foreclosing ignorance with cost in her renewed resolve. One meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.0)

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a single decisive intensification as the archived patterns take on a life of their own. The dominant stake (understanding the present) is reweighted with palpable cost, foreclosing the path of simple preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.0)
    Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates effectively through the intensifying sensory and visionary experience of the vortex, culminating in the protagonist's stance crystallization. The dominant stake (preserving balance) is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation is driven by Ember's agency under the Accumulative lens, moving from observation to experimentation with the bell.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.0)
    Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a cadence shift towards meditative stillness, reweighting the dominant stake of finding purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is driven by the timekeeper's agency in decoding messages and repairing the capsule, leading to a meaningful deepening of understanding. The cost of their relentless pursuit is legible in the final, charged image of anticipation.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.3)
    Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through a decisive cadence shift (the kite string snap) that reweights the dominant stake of discovering beauty. The cost of transience is legible. Agency is more observational than actively driving the pressure, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clearly signaled and escalate coherently under the causal lens towards the single, decisive action in the chamber. The cost of potential failure is felt, though the successful resolution itself is achieved with proficient ease rather than a costly struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation is accumulative, driven by the historian's arrival and the patterned walk, which deepens the mystery and coalesces the group. The dominant stake of uncovering truth tightens through the formed alliance. Agency is collective, a renunciation of silence for shared purpose. The cost is the foreclosed path of individual inaction, though it is more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are clearly signaled and escalation is driven by the seer's agency under the textural lens, culminating in a decisive act. The primary weakness is the climax's lack of a specific, visible price paid for the act of seeding a new reality, leaving the cost conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clearly signaled (forgiveness) and escalate through the urgent decoding of the tapestry, a meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through the density of artistic observation and the deepening desire to capture essence. The dominant stake (artistic fulfillment/legacy) is clear.

    Dominant stake (self‑understanding) is signaled, but pressure scarcely intensifies; the looped‑timeline “tests” are recounted rather than confronted. No on‑page turn forces a trade‑off or forecloses a live option. The closure reads as acceptance/peace without a visible price. Tension remains steady, gentle, and low.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes (overcoming secrecy/mistrust) remain abstract, with little concrete pressure or counterforce. The primary tightening is the act of raising the lens, which shifts perception but doesn’t foreclose a live option. No reversal or visible price is paid; tension stays steady rather than climbing. Resolution is more acceptance than tested choice.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes remain largely abstract (prove reciprocity between gardener and garden) and do not escalate. The measurable‑luck premise suggests external pressure, but it never forces a trade‑off or reversal. The polishing ritual repeats without tightening options. Resolution is an earned stasis rather than a tested decision with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes remain largely internal and unopposed; the machine works on first attempt, and touching the nexus yields immediate success and safe return. The single tightening (choosing to touch the nexus) is present but carries minimal risk or trade‑off on the page. Pressure doesn’t compound, and no credible loss alters tactics. The result is wonder without meaningful escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are gentle: decode the ghost’s message and secure a personal epiphany. The one escalation—her decision to disturb the stillness—produces progress but little visible price or foreclosed path. No antagonist, and pressure doesn’t intensify beyond lyric density; consequences remain internal and mild. The ending resolves without a tangible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on how she will understand and bear the truth; escalation accrues via density (data, margins, contributions) rather than turns. The most meaningful tightening is the shift from solitary annotation to a collaborative palimpsest, preparing the final repricing. Costs are felt but soft; no foreclosed external path or hard trade‑off occurs on the page. Tension is steady, not sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes remain mostly internal and abstract; pressure increases gently rather than through a meaningful foreclosing turn. The logbook discovery is the lone escalation, but it doesn’t exact a price or force a trade‑off. The radio hush is evocative yet doesn’t tighten options. Resolution is earned in mood, not through tested commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is internal—seeking regenerative silence versus the duty to witness—yet escalation is modest and largely descriptive. The turn to burrow narrows options, but tension is low and consequences feel gentle. No antagonistic pressure or loss forces a tradeoff beyond abstraction. The final endurance registers but without a clear, felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—help Eli connect—escalates only via the eclipse’s arrival; tension remains gentle with little narrowing of options or risk. Aria’s agency (starting a new melody) deepens the moment but does not demand a trade-off. The climax lands emotionally, yet the scene lacks a felt price or tested alternative. Pressure is present but soft.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake (uncover the silo’s secrets) remains largely unopposed; escalation is a gentle deepening via reading rather than a pressured turn. The “displaced axis” hints at a key but never tightens options or exacts a price. The last diary fading provides a cadence shift, not a true narrowing. Tension is steady but low.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain abstract (“a life about to change”) and the pressure doesn’t escalate beyond a visitor’s arrival. The “orchestrate” move doesn’t foreclose options or extract a price; the meeting proceeds without a test or reversal. No meaningful narrowing occurs; coincidence (a stranger appears) frames events more than agency under pressure. The final state reads as a smoother continuation, not an earned trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.2)
    Pressure grows texturally (whispers louder, energy builds), but trade-offs and narrowing options are not dramatized. The “possession” stake is invoked rather than experienced on-page, muting urgency. No decisive choice with cost; the ritual proceeds smoothly to success. Tension is present but low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake (capture inspiration before exhaustion) is clear, but pressure escalates modestly through cadence (sun climbing, quicker tracing) rather than a narrowing choice. The tightening is more tonal than consequential; no option foreclosed or tangible price extracted. The shell’s “pulse” hints at a turn but doesn’t force a trade‑off. Resolution is an internal stance rather than a tested commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (master the labyrinth to reshape reality), but escalation is largely declarative: obstacles appear and are “overcome” without specific tests or losses. The tightening beat (viaduct glow fading/darkness coalescing) shifts tone more than options. Resolution stems from assertion of mastery rather than a pressured trade‑off or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (feeling vs. numbness) is clear but escalation is gentle; humming grows, seasons turn, anticipation thickens. There’s no true narrowing of options or visibly paid price, only a deepening trance. Without a foreclosed path or trade-off on the page, pressure feels static. The ending’s shift is more mood than conflict resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are sketched (illicit lab, being watched), but escalation occurs mostly in thought; no turn forces a concrete trade‑off on the page. “After being followed home” adds pressure yet yields no immediate tactical adaptation beyond vigilance. The tightening is primarily a realization leading to future action. Consequently, cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=5.9)
    Pressure is soft: the hum/UV “transformation complete” serves as the single intensification. Stakes remain internal without a clear trade‑off or foreclosed path beyond catharsis. The release reads credible but low‑tension.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.9)
    “Impossible choices” are asserted but not tested; pressure does not narrow options on the page. Escalation is mainly decorative (patterns “grow more intricate”) without a turn that forecloses a path. No tangible loss or trade‑off alters tactics. The closure feels contemplative rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is internal: can art and community relieve the “chronic hush.” Escalation arrives when she accepts the invitation and plays, deepening from watching stories to becoming the focal act. The cost is soft (risk of vulnerability; lingering hush), with no marked foreclosure beyond endurance. Tension is steady but muted, fitting the lens yet limiting bite.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake—crafting believable half-truth emotions for a discerning client—is clear but remains low-pressure. Escalation is minimal; completion arrives without complication or trade-off beyond the stated detachment. No meaningful reversal or narrowing of options occurs. The result is poised but static tension.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake—recognition of quiet contributors—is declared but not tested; no opposition or trade‑off emerges. The locket complication resolves instantly and spurs harmony, not pressure. Escalation is a gentle deepening of intent rather than a narrowing of options or a price paid. The final “initiate project” move lacks a visible on‑page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes remain largely internal and abstract, with minimal escalation—no obstacle complicates the search or the social presentation. The discovery of the tag functions as a soft turn rather than a pressured choice. Consequences are positive and immediate, with little visible price. Tension is quiet and never tightens meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are largely internal (discover the echo‑source) and remain coherent, but pressure never pinches hard. The main tightening is the ticking nap ending, which prompts her to stop; no genuine alternative or loss is dramatized. Escalation is a smooth deepening rather than a crisis, with little cost beyond relinquishing access. This keeps tension modest.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes stay abstract and largely unopposed; the orchard’s silence permits the ritual rather than testing resolve. The main tightening is a tonal hush into the ritual’s climax, but no live option is foreclosed and no evident price is paid beyond solitude. The result is a soft deepening rather than escalation. The final stance is chosen without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are coherent (to be seen by those who need them) and tighten when the lights return, prompting urgency. The meaningful turn is a recommitment to indirect visibility via curated traces. However, pressure remains gentle; no option is dramatically foreclosed beyond continued self-erasure. Cost is felt but not acute.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake (embracing metamorphosis) is stated early, but pressure does not meaningfully tighten. There’s no external or embodied test that forces a trade‑off; the decision arrives unopposed. The storm season functions as texture rather than an active clock. Stakes remain abstract, limiting tension and consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake is internal understanding; escalation is mild: the exchange is the only concrete pressure point. The price of trading art is gestured at but not tested on the page, and no subsequent option is foreclosed. The stranger provides information without real resistance, muting tension. The final turn is a contemplative deepening rather than a costed choice.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes remain largely internal (understanding her role), with minimal escalation beyond deepening awe. The arrival of the pearl suggests pressure, but no test, trade‑off, or narrowed option is dramatized. The piece accrues wonder without tightening consequences. As a result, the ending’s reweighting lacks a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes (restore communal identity) are declared, yet escalation is gentle and summary-driven. No hard narrowing of options or on-page trade-off; success arrives without a visible price. The “staggered intervals” sequence implies progression but not tightening pressure. Conflict remains largely conceptual and unopposed.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.8)
    Dominant stake (reach the fortress/learn truths) faces little resistance; pressure does not tighten meaningfully. The “urge to dare” is stated rather than tested against a countervailing threat or loss. No reversal or foreclosed option is visible en route to the light. Result: a smooth progression with minimal stakes clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are primarily conceptual (unlocking “entangled memories”), with little on‑page resistance or narrowing of options. Transcription proceeds smoothly; no reversal tests her commitment. The end grants resolution without a visible price or foreclosed path. Tension remains low and largely static.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.8)
    Pressure coheres and rises with the storm’s zenith and the amulet’s glow, culminating in the appearance of the duplicate. Still, conflict remains largely unopposed; mastery arrives without meaningful resistance or trade‑off. The stakes are internal and clear, but the escalation doesn’t foreclose options or demand sacrifice. The final shift is persuasive but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes (client’s asylum vs getting caught) are signaled, and the “breach of protocol” proposal tightens the situation. Yet escalation remains mostly verbal and anticipatory; we don’t see a test or a foreclosed option with an on‑page cost. The plan and waiting method are clear, but pressure doesn’t crest into a consequential turn. Tension hums rather than bites.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—capturing the moment’s “texture”—meets no real resistance; escalation is nominal (hum grows, then fades). There’s no meaningful tightening that narrows options or exacts a discernible price. Resolution arrives without a pressured tradeoff or altered tactic. The piece remains static in conflict despite its lyrical build.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=4.4)
    Dominant stake is stated but never truly tested; no meaningful tightening or trade‑off occurs. The survivor’s agency is mostly attention and collection without pressure or loss. The “metronome” tide motif marks time but doesn’t force a choice. Resolution feels inevitable and low‑risk.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake is clear, and escalation reads as density increase toward a sonic and spectral crescendo. However, obstacles remain abstract—no reversal or tangible loss tests commitment. The success arrives without a visible price; pressure rises but never threatens to foreclose options. The result is satisfying but soft.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes (gentrification vs. community) are clear, and urgency increases as the deadline approaches. However, escalation is summary-heavy with no on-page tightening that forecloses a live option or exacts a visible price. Authorities are mentioned but never pressure a scene; success accrues without reversals. The final readiness lacks a concrete trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—get the last photographs before disappearance—is stated but meets little resistance. The timed message adds a light clock, yet there’s no on‑page setback, adaptation, or trade‑off beyond endurance. Success arrives without a narrowing choice that exacts a visible price. Tension remains more atmospheric than structural.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—calibrate the drone—remains coherent but low-pressure. Escalation is a gentle intensification (“light became more vivid,” “responses grew more precise”), with no real narrowing of options or credible risk. The ship’s anchor and auspicious timing do not apply pressure, and no tangible cost is paid. Resolution is competent rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes are stated early (find the convergence), and the deciphered pattern creates the lone genuine tightening leading to the step onto ice. Escalation remains low‑key, with little counterforce or loss to shift tactics. The cost at closure is present but light. Pressure coheres but never truly pinches.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes (revival) remain abstract, and escalation is modest: rhythm grows, the town quivers, dawn resumes. The key tightening is the sensed stirring, which deepens the pattern but doesn’t force a trade‑off or foreclose options. The endurance agency is present but low‑pressure. Cost is implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear (preserve memories before energy dies) and pressure tightens as she reaches the heart and time compresses. Escalation is primarily tonal and rhythmic rather than obstacle-based; there’s little on-page resistance or trade-off until the end’s loss. The final price (silence of the temple) is legible and reconfigures the gain. One meaningful tightening, not a reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes remain abstract (truth, legacy) with a late, underused “bodies” clock. Escalation is linear: corridor → lattice → big door/lock; no narrowing options or felt price. The touch of the lock implies threshold pressure but does not force a trade-off. The desire to continue is not tested against a credible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are primarily internal/spiritual: awakening the flora and repaying a karmic debt. Escalation hinges on one turn (the bead’s grasp) with a clear but gentle cost (ghost fading), yet pressure remains low and largely uncontested. There’s little narrowing of options or trade‑off beyond that beat. The resolution feels earned but soft.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake (“from ruin to reverence”) stays abstract; escalation is minimal and largely tonal. “Weight of her task” and the fabric’s glow are deepening beats, not tightening turns that foreclose options. No credible loss or forced trade‑off appears on the page. Resolution stems from steady endurance rather than tested agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes remain largely internal and static: uncovering and documenting proceed without impediment. Pressure does not meaningfully escalate; no option is foreclosed or trade-off demanded. The sundial’s pull hints at deepening, but it doesn’t force a costed choice. The resolution arrives without a testing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes remain modest: complete and send a letter that encodes meaning. Pressure barely tightens—the patrons’ arrival doesn’t force adaptation. No visible price or foreclosed path beyond the general commitment to analog slowness. The result is pleasing but low‑tension.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are signaled (uncover secrets before the coup), but escalation is mainly tonal: brighter flame, cooler nights, “urgency” declarations. There’s one meaningful tightening—the imminent coup as the chart nears completion—but no on‑page obstacle or sacrifice testing commitment. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens yet lacks a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Aria can surface and release the burden of unsent words—tightens once at the clearing with the apparition’s coalescence. She exercises agency by invoking and confronting, and the spirits’ crescendo deepens pressure. The price paid (emotional exhaustion, relinquishment) is felt but not cutting; options do not narrow to a painful trade so much as resolve into release. The escalation is coherent but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are largely internal (can she reframe shared anxieties before consciousness slips), signaled early but not meaningfully tightened. The anesthetic clock is the closest to pressure, yet it doesn’t force a fraught tradeoff or visible price. Decoding yields a hopeful reframing, but no option is foreclosed on the page. Tension remains gentle and static despite strong motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake (recovering joy) is clear but faces limited pressure; escalation is gentle rather than tightening. The key “turn” is the decision to unroll and use the abandoned film, but consequences are largely aesthetic. No live option is dramatically foreclosed on the page. Tension remains low and untested by genuine risk.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are coherent—will she risk destabilizing her controlled craft to pursue awe—and pressure accumulates through the feedback vortex. The tightening is present but gentle; little is truly foreclosed or lost. Resolution is earned by her agency in arranging mirrors, yet the conflict feels low‑risk success‑leaning. A visible consequence to the mural or her role would raise tension.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are declared (taxed thoughts; need for covert speech) but never tested in a concrete scene—no surveillance sweep, informant, or near‑miss to tighten options. The “plan” proceeds smoothly, with no reversal or narrowing that forces a trade‑off. The final beat reiterates success rather than paying a price. Tension remains flat across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are internal (finding peace/meaning), with escalation expressed as a density and cadence lift through song. There’s minimal narrowing of options or visible price; the conflict remains largely static until the lullaby diffuses it. The closure is earned but gentle, with low on‑page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes remain abstract (“preserve forgotten names”), with minimal pressure escalation. The song briefly intensifies the moment but doesn’t foreclose options or present a trade‑off. There’s no palpable reversal; the conflict is largely maintenance versus entropy. The cost (loneliness, ongoing vigilance) is acknowledged but not stressed to a decisive test.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes are internal (self‑trust, credibility), but the scene lacks a concrete test or reversal; hours passing and an emptying ink well are soft pressures. The “before paths diverge” warning doesn’t operate as a live clock. Completion of the transcription is a turn, yet it doesn’t force a visible trade‑off beyond fatigue. Tension remains steady rather than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes (preserve vs. safety) are articulated, yet no scene-level test or tradeoff forces a costed choice. Escalation does not occur; the pressure remains constant and soothing. The “decode” breakthrough is retrospective and thematic, not a forcing move. Resolution is a declared feeling, not an earned renunciation or decision under heat.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes (secrecy vs connection/inner balance) remain largely internal and static, with no clear escalation or narrowing of options. The reliance on the ritual “across the months and years” is told rather than pressured in scene. The final release of a pigeon is gentle cadence, not a tested turn. Tension exists but does not meaningfully tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes center on understanding sacred thresholds, but escalation is mild: decode, follow, arrive. The “hidden path” deepens options once; no meaningful price or foreclosed alternative appears. The father’s beckoning feels coincidental rather than earned by a pressured choice. Resolution lacks a visible trade‑off beyond leaving “lostness.”

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.8)
    Dominant stake is inward, but pressure scarcely tightens; the “until sunrise” clock doesn’t affect tactics. There’s little escalation beyond deeper quiet; no reversal or narrowing of options with cost. The shared exhale signals a method but doesn’t create genuine jeopardy or trade‑offs. Resolution arrives without a felt price or foreclosed alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake is clear, and the trail of seeds plus symbol-decoding provides one meaningful deepening. However, pressure is gentle; solutions arrive without significant resistance or trade-offs. The “before memory fades” clock never forces a choice. Escalation is present but soft.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.9)
    Dominant stake (enchant the crowd through “orchestrated serendipity”) never tightens beyond setup. The performance succeeds without complication; no beat forecloses options or exacts a price. “He knew he had successfully harnessed…” softens any tension that might remain. The “between acts” clock never pressures tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes (capture a cosmic verse) are declared early, but pressure scarcely escalates; the “anchoring” and “fledge” beats signal rather than force choices. The dance proceeds without obstacle, and success arrives without visible price or narrowed options. The tightening is a cadence/intensity swell rather than a consequential turn. Resolution is earned in mood, not in conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.9)
    Pressure remains low; the fisherman’s stone provides a fleeting intensification that doesn’t force a trade‑off. “Before everything shifts” implies a clock, but nothing on the page narrows options or exacts cost. The final “capture the essence” impulse does not foreclose a competing path. Stakes stay abstract (meaning, beauty) rather than tactically felt.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.8)
    Pressure stays internal and low; the only real tightening is the opening of the box and looking into the mirror. Stakes are declared (pain, ecology, purpose) but not tested. The ending’s “messenger” identity is earned texturally, not through a hard trade‑off. There’s little felt price or foreclosed option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake (finding a way to hope) remains largely conceptual, with escalation expressed as a soft intensification (light pulse → precipice vision). Pressure doesn’t force a trade‑off or foreclose an option; the overwhelm is transient and consequence‑light. The tightening under the accumulative lens is present but modest. Resolution is more affirmation than tested commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.9)
    Stakes remain abstract (“legacy’s burden,” “what walls dream about”) with no pressured test or narrowing of options. The “glimpse” and diary finds don’t produce a consequential choice or loss. The ending offers a stance, not a price. As a result, escalation is minimal and tension flatlines.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are declared (coax the mirrors to show possibilities) and pressure “tightens” toward the bells, but escalation lacks a price. The mirrors’ stirring is not answered by a trade‑off or narrowing of options; success arrives without risk or loss. Internal conflict does not complicate the method. The cadence shift at the bells is clear but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are declared (broker peace) but escalation remains abstract; we don’t see a concrete tightening or a choice that forecloses an option. “Delegates opened up” reads as summary rather than a turn. The cadence shift at sunset adds mood but not a visible price. As a result, tension stays low and resolution costs are largely implied.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake is clear (restore water), and thunder builds urgency, but escalation is mostly tonal rather than obstacle-based. The plan is stated and then executed without a meaningful turn that forecloses options or exacts a price. The climax (“released the waters”) lacks friction, so tension crests softly. Internal and external strands align but do not meaningfully tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (self-liberation from conformity) is legible and escalates via the sustained untangling culminating in the prism’s glow. Pressure is largely internal and textural with minimal opposition or trade-off on the page. The cost remains abstract; no option is foreclosed with tangible consequence. The turn is clear but the test feels gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain abstract; pressure does not escalate beyond “ideas take shape.” The planned reversal of narrative structure is stated rather than tested, and no live option is foreclosed on the page. Without a felt price or tightening, tension stays low and resolution is easy.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake (honoring histories) stays abstract and meets limited on-page resistance. The meaningful tightening is the completion of the final knot and the decision to leave, which don’t visibly foreclose a costed path. No antagonistic pressure or trade-off tests her commitment. Tension is ambient rather than escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are declared (save the names) but pressure barely tightens; there’s anticipation rather than escalation. The only turn is the moment of activation (pluck) which works but carries little risk or trade‑off. No option is foreclosed on the page; failure isn’t dramatized as a possibility. The result feels serene and earned, not hard‑won.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding the “decaying directive”—remains conceptual and faces little resistance. The main tightening is the storm’s arrival prompting a dream, but options don’t close or force a trade‑off. Resolution is acceptance rather than a choice with discernible price. Tension stays steady, not truly rising.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes remain lofty and abstract; pressure accrues as mood rather than through narrowing options. The key turn (lifting the tile, sealing the covenant) arrives without a tested alternative or visible price. Escalation is a cadence swell, not a meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are declared (freeing others from resentment) but escalation is mild and resistance absent. The “reality shift” signals a turn, yet it eases rather than hardens the task. The resolution arrives via a convenient ability without visible price or trade-off. No option is foreclosed; the path to peace is opened without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is present (make the dream real) and the pressure deepens once (attunement → crafting → crossing). However, obstacle and price are soft until the final beat; the making proceeds without real friction or trade‑offs on the page. The final choice forecloses a path but arrives without a prior squeeze that forces sacrifice. Tension operates more as atmosphere than as narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes remain largely abstract (healing a legacy), with minimal on‑page escalation. The discovery and planting of seeds is the only tightening, and Aria’s return resolves tension without a concrete trade‑off. There’s no credible loss or jeopardy that narrows options. The pressure rises gently rather than forcing a stance at cost.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake (pursuit of forbidden knowledge) is present, but pressure remains low and largely unchallenged. The key turn—handling the stone and “breakthrough”—happens without a tested trade‑off or visible price. The Order’s presence provides a hint of danger without forcing a decision under threat. Escalation is a steady deepening of strangeness rather than tightening options.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stakes (secure diary, find library, evade pursuers) are stated, but escalation is summarized and light on on-page tests. The one tightening beat—renegotiating at the diary—is promising, yet it lacks a visible price or foreclosed option. Pursuers’ pressure never crystallizes into a consequential choice. Resolution arrives without a tested trade-off, softening tension.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake—finding the Garden—is present, but pressure rarely tightens beyond pattern accumulation. The “threads that bind” prompt leads to reading and realization rather than a turn that forecloses options or exacts a price. The brief threat of being mentally lost doesn’t escalate into a consequential tradeoff. The final arrival feels unopposed, muting tension.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes remain mostly conceptual (understanding the “fables of absence”) with little opposition or narrowing of options. Escalation is tonal rather than pressure-driven; the professor’s ritual proceeds without credible risk or trade-off. The final turn grants insight but lacks a felt price or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake (finding quiet) is clear, but pressure barely tightens: no reversal, no hard trade-off, and minimal consequence for failure. The “storm of vibrations” establishes conflict, yet the protagonist meets little resistance en route to success. Escalation is a smooth cadence shift rather than a narrowing of options. The ending lacks an unmistakable price.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake (rekindle lost knowledge) is stated but pressure is gentle, with little narrowing of options or felt risk. The shard’s discovery simplifies rather than complicates the path. The single tightening (reaching the orrery; spark) lacks a trade‑off or consequence. Tension sits in mood rather than concrete stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake is identity/guardianship, but pressure barely tightens; the storm clears as she decides to proceed, so external pressure abates. The meaningful turn is the touch of the crystal, which deepens experience rather than forcing a trade‑off. No path is clearly foreclosed or price paid beyond bearing weight abstractly. Tension operates mostly as tone, not as escalating consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake is internal (resisting hopelessness), but pressure scarcely tightens; there’s observation → note → uplift with no credible loss or foreclosed path. The mosaic provides a single cadence shift, not an escalation that narrows options. The fire performance doesn’t challenge her, only enriches texture. The cost of recommitment is declared, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain largely conceptual (understanding time’s “texture”); external pressure from the paused figures never tightens. No meaningful escalation or trade‑off occurs; the pause ends without a cost. Agency is contemplative endurance, but it doesn’t foreclose a path. Tension operates more as tone than conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (enduring and reframing claustrophobia) is clear, but pressure remains gentle; the hush’s descent is more enabling than antagonistic. A single tightening occurs as gravity inverts and Eli commits attention, yet little is foreclosed with visible cost. The resolution is earned but light on consequence. Stakes stay largely internal and low‑conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain abstract (“teach silence”) and face no concrete test; pressure does not tighten. No beat forecloses a path or forces a trade‑off; the closest turn is a sunset cadence rather than a decision under stress. Monitoring noise never alters tactics. The result reads as static serenity rather than escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake (reach the stairway/claim the throne before sunrise) is signaled but pressure seldom tightens; no real foreclosed options or trade‑offs appear. The message reveal and ruby flare dissolve problems rather than testing commitment. Escalation reads as a steady uncovering rather than a tightening with cost. The final move is earned but easy.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes (sanctuary’s essence fading) are signaled, but pressure rarely tightens against resistance; success arrives without friction. The middle deepens mood rather than narrowing options. The choice to reconnect and revive lacks an on‑page price or foreclosed alternative. Escalation reads as tonal rather than consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.8)
    There is escalation (machines misbehave; pressure peaks), but it’s largely declarative and consequence‑light. No option is foreclosed, and Lyra never faces a trade‑off or credible risk; the release produces only gain. Coincidence via enigmatic texts drives turns more than Lyra’s costly agency. The dominant stake (unlocking diamonds) resolves too smoothly for high tension.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake (uncover truth) is clear, but pressure remains abstract and opposition is absent. The hum intensifies to visions, yet no option narrows, no trade‑off is forced, and no price is paid. The final “history‑changing” claim sidesteps an on‑page test or loss. Escalation is tonal rather than consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake is to realize and hold the “shape of possibility,” but pressure remains largely atmospheric. The meaningful tightening occurs with the unsnapping and subsequent coalescence; beyond that, stakes don’t sharpen into a trade‑off. Resolution is protagonist‑driven (chanting, grasping), yet no option is foreclosed with felt loss. Tension stays smooth rather than testing commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=4.9)
    Stakes remain abstract (purpose, remembrance) and pressure does not meaningfully tighten. Discoveries occur, but no beat forecloses an option or forces a trade-off; escalation is largely a steady mood. The emancipation frame does not introduce a live clock or opposition. Resolution arrives without an on‑page price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake is signaled (resist indifference), but pressure does not notably tighten; no on-page antagonist or complication tests resolve. The key beats—travel, arrival, sharing, dispersal—proceed without a turn that forecloses options. The “when plans unravel” line promises pressure that the scene never dramatizes. Cost remains implied rather than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake is clear (counter the prophecy), but escalation is largely static: the music continues; mist swirls, clears, then returns. There’s one gentle tightening (whispers grow more insistent as the mist thickens), yet no concrete price or narrowed options. Resolution feels assumed rather than earned through a hard turn.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake (decode the message) is present but low‑pressure, with escalation mostly as intensification of glow and pattern rather than narrowed options. The “prod” offers a modest turn; building the monument deepens but doesn’t force a trade‑off. No visible price or foreclosed path lands at the close. Tension remains gentle and static despite lyrical accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes stay internal and low‑pressure; the device’s construction meets no resistance and coincidence (glowing compass) guides rather than complicates. Escalation is mostly tonal (waterfall recedes/returns) rather than a narrowing of options. The final turn reframes intent but forecloses little on the page. No meaningful price is paid to earn the stance.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake (self‑redemption through renewed practice) is declared but scarcely tested. There’s minimal escalation—experiments “yield unexpected results,” but no turn forces a trade‑off or forecloses a path. The coin’s glow and kintsugi metaphor deepen tone rather than pressure. Resolution arrives by affirmation, not by a costly decision.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake (freeing a trapped soul) is clear, but pressure stays gentle; the main tightening is the harp’s insistence and the confession itself. The protagonist’s agency resolves the situation without a meaningful trade-off or visible loss. No real reversal tests her limits. The ending’s “burden” is asserted more than felt as paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (reckoning/redemption) is clear, yet escalation is minimal: decide, walk, epiphany. The forest’s response (“light growing brighter”) suggests intensification, but no on‑page obstacle or trade‑off narrows options. Agency drives the resolution, though the visible price paid in‑scene is modest and mostly internalized. Tension skews declarative rather than felt through turns.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.8)
    Pressure is largely internal and declarative; the story accumulates wonder rather than tightening screws. The painting discovery is the closest turn, shifting knowledge but not foreclosing options or exacting a price. Stakes (“honor overlooked histories”) stay abstract, with no on‑page loss or trade‑off. The ending resolves in intention without a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes—uncover the place’s secret—remain mostly abstract, with little opposition or cost on the page. The one tightening (dust trail → hidden compartment) happens without resistance or trade‑off. Ghosts’ presence adds pressure texturally, not as an antagonistic force that narrows options. The resolution is earned but low‑intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes stay abstract; escalation is a density build rather than narrowed options with cost. The rupture and crescendo register, but the operator faces no tangible counterforce or trade-off on the page. The final success arrives without a visible price paid. Tension exists as atmosphere more than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the asteroid’s truth/reimagining a civilization—is clear, but on‑page pressure barely tightens. The storm and “time made visible” promise risk, yet no turn forecloses options or extracts a clear price beyond mood. The meaningful shift is internal and reflective; the shard’s “secrets yielding” happens off‑pressure. Tension simmers rather than escalates.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are stated (restore lost song/balance) but on-page resistance is gentle; there’s no setback or test that narrows options. Escalation occurs mainly via heightened aura and the chip’s glow before the “moment of truth.” The cost—the chip dimming—reads as minor and unopposed. Without a palpable squeeze or trade-off, tension stays low.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes remain conceptual; pressure increases in texture rather than consequence. The needle pointing to a hidden grotto is the lone tightening, but no option closes or cost bites; “deciphering” arrives without resistance. The final unity offers wonder, not a trade‑off or renunciation. Tension operates as mood more than conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake is internal: finding meaning/inspiration; escalation is a density increase as storm + slide + reflection braid. Yet there’s no real narrowing of options or forced trade‑off, and the storm never corner‑presses her into a costly stance. The GPS failure complicates arrival but doesn’t tighten later moves. Resolution lands, but with soft pressure and low consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes remain primarily aesthetic/philosophical, with little narrowing of options or explicit trade‑offs. The piece deepens rather than tightens; conflict is nearly frictionless and lacks a concrete pressure point. The shift from bold to contemplative art suggests a price, but it’s neither contested nor tested on the page. As a result, escalation is soft and momentum low.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake (uncovering truth) is stated early, but escalation stays abstract. The meeting with Ada and the debris‑messages add density rather than narrowing options or extracting a price. No credible loss or foreclosed path accompanies Naomi’s decision to persist; pressure never bites. The tension between revelation and secrecy is asserted rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.9)
    Stakes (revival vs. decay) are declared but not tested; pressure does not tighten through a trade‑off. The dawn shift is a change of mode rather than an escalation with price. The bottle’s mystery never forces a choice. Conflict remains largely static and conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes (archiving vs. unleashing/foretelling) remain abstract; escalation is mainly tonal (“air thickening,” “anticipation”). The prophecy’s emergence does not force a narrowing choice or sacrifice beyond unease. The scribe’s agency is passive; continuation rather than a charged decision drives the turn. The final retreat into shadows feels like a posture shift, not a forced trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake (reopen/assume stewardship) is signaled, but escalation remains largely declarative; visions heighten scope without narrowing options. The key turn (realization about inheritance-as-sharing) is thematic rather than a hard tactical squeeze. Cost and foreclosed alternatives aren’t felt—no trade-off or loss is enacted in scene. Tension stays steady, not tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes are predominantly internal—attention and vocation—signaled early but escalating gently. The key tightening is the hush/threshold that prompts the switch from sirens to bell; beyond that, pressure is low-friction with minimal visible cost. No antagonist is needed, but consequences remain largely inferred. The piece deepens rather than narrows options, limiting tension.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake is internal and largely static; escalation is minimal and not forced by external pressure or a narrowing of options. “Empathy” and “vulnerability” are reiterated rather than tested. No decisive trade‑off or foreclosed path is made legible on the page. The final repositioning of the glass suggests meaning but not cost.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake (safeguard memory) is legible, but pressure remains gentle; the ghosts’ stirring adds atmosphere more than force. The meaningful tightening is the act of opening the box and becoming conduit, then re‑sealing it, but no option is truly foreclosed beyond internal burden. Stakes are felt in sorrow, not in hard choices or reversals. The “covenant” does not surface as a live pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain conceptual; pressure doesn’t tighten beyond a general quest for understanding. The “response that hinted at a code” suggests potential escalation, but it isn’t leveraged into a turn with cost. Repairing the capsule proceeds without hindrance or trade-off. The ending offers readiness rather than a tested commitment or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes remain internal and low‑pressure; escalation is a single cadence shift at the kite‑string snap. No option is foreclosed beyond a gentle renunciation of grasping, so the felt price is limited. The poem‑tending faces no real counterforce. Tension operates mostly at the sentence‑mood level.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake (legacy vs. mortality) is clear, and the prognosis provides one tightening beat. Escalation is gentle: health declines while the orchard flourishes, but conflicts are rarely staged as tests with consequences that alter tactics. The price is present (time, body), yet pressures seldom force a hard tradeoff on the page. The ending’s poise works but lacks a sharp on-page crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake (understanding the “chemistry of homecoming”) remains abstract; escalation is largely tonal—heavier air, deepening quiet—rather than a turn that forecloses options. The meeting occurs, but there is no explicit trade‑off or loss to reach it. Pressure coheres but stays static, with no reversal beyond a poised arrival. Consequences are deferred to implication.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes (healing the land) are stated but face no on‑page resistance; escalation is minimal. The key act (fertilizing/planting) proceeds smoothly, and the “submerged concord” remains conceptual rather than a pressure point. The final survey of “promise of new life” offers resolution without felt trade‑offs. Quiet can work, but here tension seldom tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes (find water/life) are declared but pressure scarcely escalates on the page; obstacles are summarized as “long and arduous.” The riddle’s solution offers the only clear tightening, with no meaningful foreclosed option or sacrifice shown. We don’t see the journey testing them beyond travel. The resolution feels earned in logic but light in cost.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are internal (disconnection vs. choosing a path), and the flickering light plus compass alignment provide a soft tightening. Escalation is modest; trepidation is noted but not tested. The choice to step forward resolves the scene, yet with minimal felt price or narrowed options. Pressure remains gentle rather than inescapable.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are declared as cosmic, but the on‑page conflict remains smooth—no reversal or credible obstacle tests commitment. The “treacherous ice tunnels” never bite, and the swap itself proceeds without complication. Escalation is a single cadence lift at the final placement. Price and trade‑offs are not made concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes stay abstract: “unbind the past” and fill a void; opposition is essentially absent. The alliance forms without friction, and escalation is a soft deepening (words spelled; they follow) rather than a pressured narrowing. The final re-seeing of the pawns suggests potential but no on-page trade-off or loss. Tension operates mostly at the conceptual level, limiting urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake (find the stone to unlock truth/seed reality) is signaled early, but pressure is gentle and largely unopposed. The main tightening is the vision catalyzing the choice to seed a new reality. Consequences and costs remain abstract; no option is compellingly foreclosed. Tension hums but never bites.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are internal and single‑threaded; escalation moves from decoding to entry to traversal, but pressure remains gentle. There’s little on‑page resistance or trade‑off testing commitment; the labyrinth yields without contest. The final release is earned structurally, not through a visible price. The conflict reads meditative rather than pressing.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is clear and escalates through intensifying poetry and looming ritual, culminating when the mist parts. The tightening is more cadence than consequence; cost is understood rather than suffered. Agency matters—the artist chooses to speak, then lands on a single line—but the trade‑off isn’t sharply priced on the page. Still, internal and external pressure interweave coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is tight: finish deciphering before suffocation. Escalation is clear as vision narrows and breath fails; the final match triggers a release and a literal gasp. Agency is endurance‑driven and consistent with the lens. A stronger mid‑scene turn or foreclosed option would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stakes are internal and remain largely untested. The “wrong turn” discovery is the lone tightening, but no option is foreclosed or traded at a price. Resolution is achieved by painting without resistance or loss. Tension stays low despite lyrical momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake is declared early, and the ritual escalates to a “crescendo,” but pressure remains internal and unopposed. The tightening is a cadence shift rather than a narrowing of options; no trade-off or loss alters tactics. The final acceptance doesn’t cost him anything legible on the page. As a result, tension never quite crystallizes into a test.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (finding a path through grief) is signaled early; the meaningful tightening is her setting out at full moon leading to dawn acceptance. However, peril and obstacles are asserted, not tested, so price and narrowing feel abstract. The ending choice/stance is earned but low-friction on the page. Agency is present but not rigorously challenged.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake is internal (modulate damaging honesty), but pressure seldom tightens beyond discovery beats. The choice to “experiment” with cures is a soft escalation without foreclosing a path or exacting on‑page loss. External conflict is absent; internal stakes remain largely abstract. Tension hums rather than climbs.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.9)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure grows gently via repeated glances and the lighthouse legend, but stakes stay abstract and largely untested. The “tightening” is the recognition of the boutonnière as a key, which is more interpretive than consequential. There’s minimal cost or foreclosed option on the page. A bolder turn—risking intrusion, questioning, or surrendering the object—would sharpen escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are declared (promise, flood), but the conflict remains mostly internal and summarized, with “trials” elided. The clock (rising creek) threatens without forcing a costly choice; options don’t visibly narrow beyond general momentum forward. The doorway decision and transformation lack a felt price. Escalation is more tonal than structural.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake (discover the source/meaning of the dreams) is declared, but escalation is largely rhetorical (“the darkness seemed to grow thicker”). The one tightening—stepping into the grotto—doesn’t foreclose options or extract a visible price. No reversal or deepening changes the queen’s options or knowledge on the page. The hooded “final warning” raises the ceiling but never gets cashed in as real pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.3)
    Dominant stake (to understand/capture essence) is present but escalates modestly. The whispered “truth” is a soft inflection, not a narrowing of options or a costly turn. No competing pressure tests her commitment. Resolution doesn’t require sacrifice or foreclose a path.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake is internal clarity/purpose, yet pressure does not meaningfully tighten; the movement from confusion to peace is gradual and largely declarative. No decisive turn foreclosing a path with felt cost. The piece sustains mood but not escalating stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain internal and mostly static; there’s no decisive tightening or trade‑off on the page. The loss of smell is a solid pressure source but isn’t actively tested in scene. The “trembling calm” persists without a turn that forecloses a path. Resolution feels like affirmation rather than earned shift with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake is internal (can he convert scars into story in this liminal moment). The meaningful tightening is the whispers upon exhale prompting action; escalation remains gentle and largely textural. Cost and foreclosed options are minimal, keeping tension modest.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake is clear (reconnection), but pressure is low: no on‑page resistance tests her commitment beyond mood and memory. The tightening is primarily a cadence shift (hum → glow → deciphering → stillness) rather than option foreclosure. Costs are implied (estrangement, impending orchard loss) more than enacted. The resolution leans on process completion rather than a hard trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes (unravel cosmic illusions) remain lofty and abstract, with minimal on‑page pressure or narrowing of options. The “hiccup” offers a window but doesn’t force a trade‑off or visible loss. Escalation is more tonal density than conflict; the outcome arrives without a tested decision.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=4.9)
    Stakes (precision as paramount; guarding time) are stated but never tested on the page—no discrepancy arises to force a trade‑off. The “counting backwards” intensifies attention but doesn’t foreclose options or extract a price. Pressure is static; the dawn shift reads as a mood deepening rather than escalation. Without a concrete tightening, tension remains conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain abstract; there’s little tightening or visible price. No turn forces a trade-off or forecloses an option; the “breakthrough” arrives without a test. The “familiar strangers” never apply pressure on the page. The laser button and spatial skill do not escalate conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are stated (father’s addiction, post–heart attack urgency), but on-page pressure doesn’t escalate beyond reflective deepening. The graffiti phrase provides a conceptual “tightening,” yet no option is foreclosed or traded at a cost in-scene. The resolve is gentle and untested. A single concrete barrier or renunciation would clarify consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain abstract (connection vs estrangement) and do not tighten through a concrete turn. The loop motif reiterates rather than escalates; no option is foreclosed or traded. The dawn beat clarifies stance but doesn’t extract a visible price. Conflict reads static and contemplative.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.4)
    Dominant stake remains abstract: honoring the past by documenting the present. No meaningful tightening or turn occurs; no option is foreclosed. The “regenerated covenant” is invoked but never tested in scene. Tension stays ambient rather than escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake (alleviate loneliness via communal shift) is clear, and the escalation is a gradual density increase as rumors spread. There’s one meaningful deepening (the crowd’s mood turns), but no concrete narrowing of options or visible price. External conflict is diffuse; obstacles are absent, making the success feel untested. The resolution reads more bestowed than hard‑won.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are signaled (find the stillpoint for inner reckoning), and pressure increases through sensory intensification. However, escalation lacks a visible price or narrowing options; following the melody meets no credible obstacle. The final turn is a deepening rather than a tested choice, keeping tension modest. Agency is present but minimally contested.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake (restore pen/assume narrative power) is signaled, but pressure never meaningfully tightens. No credible obstacle opposes the unbending or writing; the anomaly’s response comforts rather than tests. The responsibility theme implies cost without enforcing one. As a result, tension remains low across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes center on giving voice to the unheard, but pressure is gentle; escalation comes via density (crowd gathers, music swells) rather than narrowing options. The “disruption” is framed as soothing, reducing friction. The advisor’s agency is present but rarely tested. The ending’s cost is conceptual, not a trade‑off with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes are declared (preservation/promise/truth) but face little opposing force; escalation is an increase in artworks rather than a narrowing of options. The vandalized portrait provides a catalytic beat, yet few consequences test commitment. The hidden message appears without friction, lowering tension. Cost is emotional rather than tactical and is not sharpened on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure escalates texturally: rhythmic drumming intensifies, lagoon brightens, and the shared vision crests, then fades. Stakes remain internal (solace via shared dream), with the primary cost being impermanence. There’s a clear tightening, but no hard trade‑off or foreclosed option beyond acceptance. Still, agency (drumming harder, staying with the moment) shapes the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake (prove whisper > shout) is signaled early and receives a test with the stranger, but pressure is modest and largely uncontested. The find‑objects beats (coin, key) don’t meaningfully raise cost or narrow options. The escalation is a gentle approach rather than a squeeze. Consequences are conceptual, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stakes remain abstract (a vibe of “stillwater tension” vs. connection), and escalation is incremental at best (shutter pattern grows, calm deepens). The key “turns” are observational: the box opens, pattern weaves, then parting—little is foreclosed. The guardian’s agency is passive endurance rather than a pressured trade‑off with visible price. The final dissipation reads more as exhale than consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes (spark a “humble rebellion”) remain primarily abstract; no opposition forces adaptation. The plan emerges smoothly and succeeds off‑screen, so pressure never meaningfully narrows options. The grotto visit hints at a turn, but nothing is risked or lost to get the displays made. Tension operates as mood, not escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (claiming freedom) is signaled early and tightens at the whale’s call. The escalation is internal and singular: dock → plunge → revelation → return. Costs and foreclosed paths are mostly implied; external resistance is minimal, so pressure never truly bites. The earned stance shift still resolves the piece credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake is internal (how to live with grief) and the piece deepens rather than tightens; the bouquet arrival offers a soft pivot but doesn’t foreclose options. Pressure accrues atmospherically with few costs paid on the page. The “moral ambiguity” never forces a trade‑off, and no beat tests commitment beyond reflection. Tension remains low and steady.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake (crossing sacred boundaries in art) is signaled early and deepens as she “surrenders.” Escalation is a single intensification rather than turns, with little narrowing of options. No visible price is paid; fear, risk, or loss never surface as counterweights to liberation. The pressure stays lyrical rather than coercive.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes remain abstract—“seeing beauty”—with no credible threat, deadline, or trade-off. There’s no on-page tightening; the painter’s arrangement prompts curiosity, not conflict. Outcomes (the hub of creativity, intentional imperfections) arrive by assertion rather than pressure or price. Tension never truly escalates.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain conceptual (understanding connection) and never tighten into a choice with cost. The “crescendo” is tonal rather than pressured, with no option foreclosed. “Questioning assumptions” is asserted but not dramatized as a real test. The meta halt diffuses tension rather than resolving it.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (transmuting grief into craft/illumination) is clear, but pressure scarcely tightens—no real trade‑off or foreclosed option accompanies the glow. The “method” arrives and works smoothly; no setbacks or forced recalibration. The “peak illumination” reads as a volume increase, not a costly pivot. Resolution feels earned in tone, light in consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—recovering meaning through cards—remains abstract, with minimal escalation beyond accumulating insight. No reversal or narrowing choice; “confiding in the cards” and measuring proceed without obstruction. The dawn departure is a resolution of attention rather than a tested tradeoff. Stakes are felt conceptually, not viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake is internal (seeing forbidden truth), but pressure never bites—no obstacle tests her resolve or imposes trade‑offs. The escalation is mostly a handoff to a magical device that works as promised. The “avoid patterns” rule isn’t used to narrow options or extract a price. Ending resolves without a visible loss beyond a general “forever changed” assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes remain mostly conceptual (hope vs. encroaching shadow) and escalate gently through recognition rather than pressure. The meaningful tightening is her resolve to act after naming the shadow, but no option is truly foreclosed on the page. There’s limited cost beyond a felt burden. Tension operates more by mood than by conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (redefining purpose with balanced self-respect and compassion) is clear, but pressure remains gentle, with minimal tightening. The touch of the tail introduces a stillness beat rather than a narrowing of options. The “con” offers potential heat yet never forces a trade-off on the page. Escalation is mostly a deepening of mood, not stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake (unlock scars’ stories) remains abstract, and pressure grows primarily via accumulation, not a clear tightening or trade‑off. The “breakthrough” moment arrives without a concrete reversal or narrowed option that forces a costed choice. Physical exertion and pain read, but consequences do not meaningfully alter tactics. Tension stays steady and low‑grade.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake is understood, and pressure accumulates (letters swarm, air thickens, melody coalesces). Yet escalation lacks a decisive narrowing of options or a trade‑off; the gazer isn’t forced to sacrifice or choose between competing goods. The turn is primarily a mood deepening rather than a tested commitment. Stakes remain abstract, so tension never truly bites.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake is internal and signaled early, but pressure scarcely tightens—no real narrowing or trade‑off beyond endurance of doubt. The escalation relies on lyrical intensification rather than a decisive turn with palpable risk. Resolution arrives without confronting a live alternative or paying a visible price. One sharp foreclosed option would raise stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake is present but pressure is mild; Asa faces little resistance and achieves each step with minimal cost. The main tightening is the clock’s reactivation, which deepens the pattern rather than foreclosing options. Merging with the dune reads as an intensification, but no reversal tests commitment. The ending resolves quietly without a hard trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stakes (understand his mind/translocation) stay abstract; pressure doesn’t escalate beyond the hum growing to a “roar.” The dominant turn is simply entering the dream‑state, without a narrowed option or trade‑off. No antagonist or meaningful obstacle forces tactics to change. Resolution is not driven by a decision with on‑page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain abstract (seek courage) and face no concrete test; danger is mentioned but never bites. The vigil provides a modest deepening, not a true narrowing or trade-off. Eira’s agency guides, but no beat forces a loss or renunciation on the page. Escalation is mostly atmospheric rather than consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes (the cost of silence for safety) are legible from the start, but escalation is minimal. The only tightening is the figure’s quiet task with the piano bench bolt, which deepens theme rather than narrowing options. The bellhop’s agency is primarily endurance (“remain”), with limited on-page cost beyond contemplation. Consequently, tension stays low-level rather than tightening to a crisper inflection.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are declared (rune could sunder reality; throne at risk), but pressure doesn’t on‑page escalate. The pretender appears and is immediately unmasked; no visible reversal or trade‑off tests Kael. The clock (constellations) adds urgency in summary rather than forcing a hard choice. Cost and narrowing options remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are internal—understanding vanishing paths—but pressure scarcely tightens; activity remains contemplative. The map-building offers a mild deepening, not a true escalation or narrowing of options. Resolution emerges via recognition rather than a tested choice with visible price. Tension is steady but low-amplitude throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake is internal (recovering purpose); pressure tightens via the journey and crescendoing hum. Escalation is felt texturally rather than through foreclosed options, with little visible price beyond discomfort and existential weight. The final stance is earned but low‑risk; no competing good forces a true trade‑off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake is early and consistent, but pressure barely tightens: the plants’ agitation and “fevered pitch” don’t manifest as resistance or trade‑off. The decoding proceeds smoothly, the retrieval is effortless, and the unsealing has no apparent price. Escalation feels like volume increase without consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—reconcile trauma with future—remains steady, but escalation is gentle; pressure eases rather than tightens. The “turn” is mainly a cadence shift (wind dies, sun sets, breathing slows) rather than a choice that forecloses alternatives. Her agency is endurance/attention, credible yet low-cost. The resolution is earned but not severely tested.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are internal (whether art can hold beauty/darkness) and the pressure coheres around “when the walls close in.” Escalation comes via the increasing focus of the untangling ritual, culminating in a stance shift. However, the price and narrowing of options are mostly abstract; no tangible loss or foreclosed alternative is dramatized. Tension is steady but not sharpened by a concrete risk.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake is signaled early, but pressure barely tightens: noticing the smudge → following patterns → seeing the person → gentle touch. The missing person poses no friction, and the “time slows” beat arrives without cost or reversal. The resolution feels given rather than earned by a trade-off or foreclosed path. Stakes remain mostly conceptual and serene, not escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes are signaled (upending fragile peace), but pressure remains abstract, with no on‑page resistance or reversal beyond internal resolve. The meaningful tightening is the decision to use hidden networks, yet it faces no concrete counter‑force. Consequences appear as a montage (“message would spread,” “outrage and curiosity”) rather than a test of commitment. Cost is implied, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.9)
    Stakes (weave continuity vs. the world’s chaos) remain largely declarative; no external or internal pressure escalates on the page. The renunciation lives in backstory; the scene offers no turn that narrows options. Visitors’ arrival is reported rather than creating fresh friction. The ending resolves without a visible price paid in‑scene.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes remain largely internal (achieve communion) with one deepening beat when the garden’s hum intensifies and the ground vibrates. Escalation occurs, but options never truly narrow and no trade‑off is forced; the outcome arrives without visible sacrifice. Agency is present in the choice to “voice silence,” yet the scene lacks a live risk or loss that reconfigures tactics. Tension stays meditative rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake is declared, yet pressure remains abstract; no concrete obstacle forces trade‑offs. The only tightening is resolve to intervene via a chosen method, without losing an option or paying a price. Stakes feel telescoped (empire at risk) while on‑page conflict stays interior and low stakes. No reversal or credible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (quelling inner dissonance) is clear; escalation arrives with the time fold and firmware whispers peaking. The tether is a meaningful tightening that changes options and calms the system. Prices and trade-offs feel light—no lasting consequence beyond relief, and no sacrificed path is made explicit. Tension operates more through tone than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake is internal: whether she can reframe turmoil through making and listening. Escalation is a density increase (hush grows, whispers coalesce) and culminates in a final, deliberate alteration of the pattern. The price—accepting lingering unease—is conceptually legible but not viscerally costly on the page; no option is sharply foreclosed. Tension is steady but rarely tightens into a consequential trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes center on reclaiming meaning from devastation, but pressure escalates gently rather than through a narrowing field of options. The key turn is the choice to rename, driven by the vision and mission; opposition is ambient rather than active. Cost remains conceptual (commitment to a new narrative) rather than felt loss or risk. The piece earns a cadence shift, not a hard trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—reweaving a fractured timeline to find peace—is clear, but escalation is gentle and mostly tonal (echoes grow, garden shifts). There’s no significant narrowing of options or visible price beyond nostalgia’s weight. The “tightening” is a density swell rather than a pressured turn. Resolution arrives without a hard trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake (unlocking a safer, personal conduit to the collective unconscious) is clear, and the static shock provides a meaningful tightening beat. Yet pressure remains low, with minimal narrowing of options or visible trade‑offs. The path forward isn’t contested; Luna’s commitment is affirmed rather than tested. Escalation is tonal and textural more than stakes‑driven.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.9)
    Stakes (“chart the unknown”) remain abstract and untested; the scene offers wonder more than conflict. The one nod to pressure (cold, pressing darkness) does not foreclose options or demand a trade. Heat-mapping succeeds without complication, and no price is paid to earn the final peace. Escalation is minimal under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes remain abstract (unraveling truth/shared wisdom) and escalate little beyond the jar’s hum and the cumulative cataloging. There’s no on‑page turn that forecloses an option or exacts a price; pressure does not tighten. The “freeing” of the canyon echo functions as deepening, but with no trade‑off. Resolution is a stance to continue working, not a tested choice under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is internal: summon courage to face what burned her; escalation is a gentle tightening from search to confrontation. The key turn is choosing to approach the figure; consequences remain soft and largely symbolic. There’s little visible cost or foreclosed alternative beyond anxiety. Tension is steady but rarely sharpens.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes stay largely textural: waiting and conveying a single traveler across in fog. The meaningful tightening occurs when the figure emerges and boards, but pressure doesn’t escalate beyond tone. No option is foreclosed with cost; coincidence (arrival) does as much as agency. The ending’s serenity lands without a tangible price.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are internal—understanding resistance to change—and they remain coherent. Escalation is minimal: the thrum deepens and the smoke’s behavior nudges a realization, but no option is meaningfully foreclosed. Agency expresses as attention and leaving with the glass, with little felt price. The tension stays textural rather than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are intimate: accept the rosebush’s cycle and instill purpose in tending the city’s “dark corners.” Pressure escalates minimally (hush → calm → dawn); the main tightening is the petal’s fall prompting pruning and renewed resolve. Costs remain abstract; no option is starkly foreclosed beyond seasonal acceptance. Quiet endurance resolves the piece credibly but gently.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes remain mostly internal and abstract, with little tightening beyond patterned repetition. No clear reversal or foreclosed option; the day simply passes into night with a reflective shift. This limits pressure and the felt price of the ending stance.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are primarily internal and remain gentle; the meaningful tightening is Lena choosing to contribute to the installation, but the price of that choice isn’t tested. Pressure rises slightly as the community gathers, yet no live option is foreclosed in a way that bites. The result is serene rather than tense.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are declared (community disturbances), but pressure doesn’t tighten; there’s no complication or trade‑off before success. The decisive move meets no counterforce and forecloses no meaningful path. Without a felt price or credible escalation, tension remains low. The win reads procedural rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes center on discovery and a fear constraint, but pressure rarely tightens; obstacles (lock, ominous door) yield quickly without a meaningful trade‑off. The “spatial mutiny” is more wonder than threat, reducing cost clarity. The major turn (touching the crystal) arrives with minimal resistance and produces a largely positive outcome. Escalation is present but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake (thawing numbness/rekindling empathy) is clear but faces minimal on‑page resistance. The primary tightening is her internal resolve after his explanation, which reweights the portrait’s meaning. Little cost is dramatized, so escalation reads as a gentle deepening rather than a true test. The ribbon’s discovery is a tonal nudge, not a turn.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes are declared (uncover hidden truth; honor bravery) but pressure doesn’t tighten through a concrete turn. The “spongey dread” intensifies tonally without narrowing options or forcing a trade‑off. Conflict remains internal and abstract, with no visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake is internal (speak vs. silence), but escalation is gentle: breeze → deciphered message → playing → intention to recount. The revelation does not force a trade‑off or foreclose a live path; consequences remain abstract. Agency is present but lightly tested, with minimal cost on the page. The shiver and glow register, yet stakes do not tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes remain internal and abstract—understanding circling paths, dissuading others—without a concrete test or narrowing of options. The mid-story doesn’t meaningfully tighten pressure; it catalogs found markers. The “turn” is a late decision to share, which isn’t forced by an escalating dilemma. Tension is steady but shallow.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.8)
    Dominant stake (decoding to relieve present burdens) stays abstract and experiences little tightening. No on‑page obstacle or foreclosed option tests her commitment. The “breakthrough” telegram and inscriptions’ secrets are reported, not dramatized into reversals. Tension remains flat, culminating in reassurance rather than earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes remain abstract (truth/understanding) and see little tightening; the world’s hostility is felt but doesn’t force trade‑offs. The only meaningful turn is touching the ice, which triggers the reveal without a counter‑pressure or visible price. No option is foreclosed, and tension doesn’t escalate beyond the initial eerie approach. The end is acceptance rather than a pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stakes (find the intersection of dreams) remain largely abstract; pressure builds atmospherically but not through foreclosed options or trade‑offs. The “hedges closing in” hints at threat without extracting a price. Escalation is a deepening of mood rather than a dilemma, so the final turn lacks bite. Agency is present but untested.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (internal healing) is signaled early and proceeds steadily as she commits to a spell. Escalation arrives via density—trees “lean in,” energy thickens—but pressure doesn’t force a trade‑off or foreclose an option. “Trammel the darkness” is a stated intention more than a tested action with price. The resolution feels earned texturally, not hard‑won.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—can he reconstitute purpose after failure—is stated early, but pressure scarcely tightens. The call prompts competence, yet no option is foreclosed; his resolve carries minimal cost or trade‑off. Escalation is a soft swell rather than a turn. A concrete test or sacrifice would raise stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=3.9)
    Conflict remains abstract; pressure doesn’t tighten beyond repeated aims to “reestablish.” No beat forecloses an option or forces a trade‑off. The apparent resolution arrives without a visible price, test, or reversal. Stakes feel declared more than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain abstract (preserving wonder) and never face a concrete obstacle. Pressure doesn’t tighten; moon phases and identity flux are explained rather than tested. The final stance is a continuation rather than a hard trade‑off with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes remain internal (connection vs. guardedness), with one soft intensification when she “listens” and feels the surge of others’ hopes. The pressure does not force a trade‑off or foreclose a live alternative; “trepidation” is noted but not dramatized as a costful decision point. Resolution is a stance adoption rather than a tested choice. The conflict never tightens beyond the lyric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) is signaled, but escalation is minimal and mostly summarized. No beat forecloses a path or forces a trade; the piece moves laterally through reiterated insights. The closest tightening is playing the accordion as a lament, yet it doesn’t alter options. Pressure remains gentle and static.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake is clear, and there is one meaningful tightening (decoding → doorway → step through). Escalation reads as density rather than increased cost; opposition is diffuse, with no real foreclosed option shown. The step through is a choice, but its price is abstract. Tension hums but rarely bites.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (dream vs empire) is stated early, and escalation arrives when the promise is “on the verge of losing its glow,” prompting urgency. Pressure remains internal and largely declarative; there’s no on‑page loss or narrowed option beyond resolve. The final stance crystallizes, but with limited visible price. Tension runs more as mood than as tightened consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—capture one last spark before oblivion—is signaled and coherently tightened as the “threshold” draws closer. Escalation is textural: density and resonance build as she attunes and infuses, culminating in the glow and a recalibrated stance. The price is more conceptual than visceral, keeping the peak quiet. Still, agency drives the turn rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.3)
    Stakes remain abstract (contentment, forgiveness) and never face a concrete test. The piece lacks a meaningful escalation or narrowing of options; each move returns to tranquil tending. No reversal forces a trade‑off or shows cost paid. The ending assurance feels granted rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=4.9)
    Stakes remain abstract (metaphorical “cloak of doubt”) and pressure does not escalate; the mission succeeds without resistance. The wind‑chime deciphering does not generate complications or trade‑offs. The final “unhooking” lacks a felt price or foreclosed path. Tension is steady‑low with no decisive tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes remain abstract (comprehension) and pressure doesn’t escalate beyond anticipation. “Withholding” is named but never tests commitment or forecloses a path. No reversal or concrete price marks the peak; the lesson simply lands. The result feels earned by continuity, not by increased cost.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are internal (mastery through stillness); escalation is a deepening: birds’ patterns unlock the arrowhead’s tale, culminating in pulse‑synchrony. The price is patience/time rather than a sharp turn, but the cadence tightens meaningfully. Lack of a concrete reversal keeps tension soft, yet the reweighting is clear. The skimmer’s agency is attention and appraisal, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake (reignite creativity) is declared, with a single tightening when she chooses to unstrap the bindings. Pressure remains low; “great care and precision” are asserted without challenge or loss, and no reversal tests commitment. The glow resolves tension without extracting a clear price. Stakes land as internal and abstract rather than pressured on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes are internal (understand “luminous vows”/“color of sound”), and pressure grows modestly as he becomes lost and is drawn deeper. There’s one soft deepening—committing to wander purposefully—before the glow redirects him to the window. Costs and foreclosed options are not sharply rendered; no real trade‑off or test of commitment beyond endurance. Tension operates more as hush and lure than conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes are cosmic but remain abstract; escalation is a smooth preparation rather than a tightening. The distillation provides a single turn toward ingestion, yet no option is foreclosed or priced. Pressure never truly mounts; there’s no visible loss, trade‑off, or risk. The resolution arrives without resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are internal (comprehension and naming of fear) and escalate chiefly via intensifying imagery rather than narrowing options. The key tightening is the conjuring itself culminating in a charged dissipation; agency is present but not tested against a hard trade-off. The cost—persistent melancholy, continued duty—is felt yet low-intensity. Absence of a concrete reversal undercuts peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake (restoring balance via repairing the bell) is clear but faces minimal resistance. Escalation exists as density and tempo increase toward the toll, yet no option is narrowed by threat or loss. The ritual proceeds without reversal or complication. The result feels inevitable rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes (heal communal pain) stay abstract; pressure doesn’t escalate beyond deepening darkness and movement deeper into town. The “trail of photographs” promises a turn but never forces a genuine trade‑off or visible loss. No meaningful foreclosure of options occurs on the page. Tension remains steady rather than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes remain gentle: curiosity and discovery with minimal resistance or penalty. The one tightening beat (lighting the flame to activate the crystal) deepens the moment but doesn’t narrow options or price a choice. The “unsettling” note is stated rather than dramatized into a cost. Pressure never truly forces a trade‑off or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are declared (mission danger, trust), yet the scene lacks a tightening turn that forecloses options or forces a trade‑off. “Revisions” progress, but opposition remains abstract and off‑stage. The cost signaled (watcher’s burden) doesn’t escalate on the page. Tension thus plateaus into contemplation.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake is internal (numbness vs. aliveness), but pressure escalates only modestly—vibration, “fabric of reality” language—without a narrowing choice or visible price. The jar’s watching presence is evocative yet doesn’t force a trade-off. Resolution stems from sustained attention/endurance rather than a tough decision. The clone-custody premise never tests him on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are internal and professional (creativity and innovation), but pressure scarcely escalates beyond contemplation. The single meaningful turn is the decision to design the new room; the visible price is only exhaustion. There’s no opposing force testing commitment or foreclosing options. Tension remains soft, with cadence deepening more than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are singular (restore laughter), and pressure accumulates as sound transforms, but escalation is gentle and largely linear. The key tightening is the shift from cacophony to lullaby to emergent whispers/laughter. Cost is present but underplayed, keeping tension modest. Agency drives the outcome without reversals or hard trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—reconciling duty with uncertainty—is clear, but pressure escalates gently without a concrete test or foreclosed option. The main tightening is a tonal deepening into reverie, not a tough trade. Resolution arrives via reception (whispers/revelation) more than earned adaptation under pressure. Cost and consequence remain largely conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.7)
    Pressure escalates through the gathering, pattern‑weaving, and energy crescendo, but opposition is largely atmospheric rather than concrete. The dominant stake—interrupt destiny—tightens conceptually yet lacks a tangible price or narrowed option on the page. The “moment of truth” arrives as expected, with limited reversal. Agency is present but the trade‑off is soft.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake (uncover the source of the shard of hush) faces minimal opposition; obstacles never complicate or price her pursuit. The single tightening (finding and interpreting the message) is not contested, so options don’t narrow. The perigee clock doesn’t press tactics, and success feels assured from the outset. The ending’s “dissipation” is a soft after‑effect rather than a cost paid.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake (solving the vanishing ferry/threshold crossing) is present, and escalation occurs via decoding markings → realization → stepping in. Pressure remains soft and largely internal; little is foreclosed or traded with visible price. Marcus’s caution adds a faint counter‑pressure but doesn’t materially shift options. The final choice is earned but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are internal—find the “texture of connection”—and escalation is a single intensification as the weaving culminates in a riot of light. Pressure is coherent but the price of pursuit is underdefined; unsettled calm hints at risk without a concrete trade‑off. The final return preserves options rather than foreclosing a path. The thread’s tension is felt but not cashed into consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake (teaching/expansion) stays conceptual and untested; no tightening beat or trade‑off lands. There’s no on‑page reversal, threat, or cost that forces a stance beyond affirmation. “Edge geometry” and starlight navigation are explained, not trialed under pressure. The ending offers uplift without consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are intimate and coherent (offering assurance/closure), but pressure barely tightens—no real obstacle, risk, or trade‑off tests Aria’s resolve. The meaningful beat is the contact and verbal assurance, followed by the mist’s response, yet nothing forces adaptation. The price paid is largely off‑page (ongoing burden), which softens escalation. A single complicating resistance would have sharpened the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake (retrieve and get out before the tide) is legible, but escalation is modest and largely timed rather than contested. The tide change provides the single tightening, yet Lyra encounters no setback or hard trade‑off. Return through cables works as a climax image more than a pressured decision with visible price. The resolution leans on competence and timing.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.9)
    Pressure is primarily internal and textural; the clearing radio static and ink‑reading mark a single meaningful tightening. Stakes (understanding the ghost) remain abstract, with limited visible trade‑off beyond acceptance. The ghost’s coalescence deepens the inquiry but doesn’t force a difficult choice. The final renunciation reads earned but low‑temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes (preserving fading whispers) remain mostly conceptual; escalation is a density increase (bird patterns → harnessing → crescendo). Pressure does not force a trade‑off or visibly foreclose an option; the turn to “new language” arrives without on‑page sacrifice. The diamond’s shift from curse to catalyst is thematically potent but low on cost.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are largely internal—will Lena tune in and absorb the “harmony untamed” without losing herself—and escalation is a density increase (static → coalesced voices). The tightening is modest; no path is visibly foreclosed and prices are mostly conceptual. The piece avoids coincidence‑resolutions, but the cost isn’t unmistakable on the page. Tension functions more as mood than as dilemma with trade‑offs.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes (beauty vs. mechanical grip) are declared, but on‑page pressure stays gentle and largely uncontested. There’s little escalation: Luna plays; the statues awaken; the orchard brightens. No option is foreclosed, and the “price” of change isn’t confronted. The turn is serene rather than crucible‑like, muting tension.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake (deliver across a surveilled border) is clear, and pressure coheres around the hover-drone moment. Escalation is modest: a single timed crossing with no reversal or price paid on-page. The “linking absences” tactic is intriguing but under-exploited in-scene. Resolution feels earned but risk remains largely asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.4)
    Pressure is soft: curiosity → wrong turn → oasis → return, with one meaningful deepening at the discovery. Stakes remain largely internal and low-risk; the felt price of the pursuit (getting lost, time lost) is not dramatized beyond a chill and thicker mist. Agency is present (choosing to follow, then to return), but no option is truly foreclosed. Tension operates more as hush than squeeze, limiting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes remain abstract: reawaken stories versus failure has no concrete pressure beyond time passing. Escalation is minimal—a cadence shift as lamps fade and urgency rises—without a narrowing of options or trade‑off. No antagonist or counterforce tests her aim. The resolution lands, but the price paid is barely felt.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain largely abstract (“capture a runaway dream”) and face no concrete test or narrowing. Escalation is a smooth wash rather than a tightening; no beat forecloses an option or forces a trade-off. The “archipelago responding” moment raises mood, not pressure. The ending confirms continuity over consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes remain abstract and the pressure only mildly intensifies (“air… seemed to thicken”). There’s one turn—the lock’s resistance to the click—but few narrowed options or trade‑offs. The “disorient” tactic is named rather than dramatized, blunting tension. Resolution arrives smoothly with little felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes are primarily internal (recover memories; unlock patterns) and signaled early, but escalation is gentle and mostly tonal. The only concrete turn is finding the mushroom; the star‑study doesn’t tighten options or raise cost. Trepidation is noted, yet no live option is foreclosed or traded off on the page. The resolution is a vow rather than a pressured decision with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—decipher to enable return—tightens as the annotations become fervent and a hidden geometry is uncovered. The shift from anxious to confident reads as the piece’s escalation. Still, the on-page price is modest; no option is truly foreclosed, and external pressure remains low. The final “first step” promises consequence more than it exacts it.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.9)
    Dominant stake (revive the land/preserve wonder) never meets resistance; success proceeds without complication. Escalation is an intensification of radiance rather than a narrowing of options under pressure. The threshold moment offers potential choice, but no dilemma or trade‑off lands on the page. Without a felt price, tension remains low.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—bringing peace to the spirits—is legible and pursued through one method: undoing knots. Escalation is a density increase rather than reversals; each knot releases pressure/whisper, tightening toward the final release. The price paid is mainly exertion and the “accumulated silence” she must carry, which reads more atmospheric than consequential. A sharper constraint or lost option would heighten the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake (uncover the henge’s secrets) remains mostly declarative; escalation is modest when the footage “begins to yield,” but no option is foreclosed and no price is paid. The piece sustains tone rather than tightening pressure. Resolution stems from recognition without a consequential turn.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are internal—understanding/reframing letting go—and pressure coheres via accumulative discoveries (logbook line, net‑message, lectures) toward acceptance. Escalation is a deepening of pattern rather than narrowing options; one cadence shift occurs when the “last transmission” redefines source and meaning. Costs are emotional and credible but restrained. No sharp reversal, yet agency is present in sustained attention and the decision to leave changed.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake is to communicate with the entity; escalation occurs via storm intensification and increasingly frenzied art. Yet options do not materially narrow and no on‑page price is paid; the pressure is more mood than consequence. The ghost’s response arrives without a real test or trade‑off, keeping tension modest. A single, sharper cost or risk during the encoding would lift this.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—decoding and emotionally re‑framing the diary—does not escalate; there’s little narrowing of options or consequence. The elevator “clock” and corridor discovery do not introduce meaningful risk or trade‑off. The final stance is chosen without friction, so pressure remains static. Quiet is fine, but stakes feel abstract rather than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes (to memorialize, to prove “empty spaces remember”) remain abstract; pressure doesn’t tighten beyond mood deepening. The main turn is a tonal calming rather than a forced trade‑off or renunciation. No concrete option is foreclosed; escalation reads as steady accrual. The closing insight is resonant but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are singular—finish/capture essence before demolition—but pressure remains steady rather than escalating. The coin’s discovery is a gentle deepening, not a reversal, and no option is forcefully foreclosed beyond leaving the place. The price (loss of the library) is felt but offstage; the protagonist is never forced into a trade‑off that bruises their aim. The final choice is endurance/attention rather than a decisive sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes (to make a discovery/map a hidden location) are clear and deepen via decoding and the luminance brightening in response. Pressure escalates in knowledge, not risk; no option is forcibly foreclosed beyond sleep and disclosure to crew. The secrecy and all-night labor provide a small, credible price. The ending resolves to intention, not a hard turn, so tension remains restrained.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are signaled (find the hall/understand repair) and there’s one meaningful deepening with the reveal of the frost-glass door. Yet opposition is soft; decoding proceeds smoothly and the lock opens without resistance or trade-off. Pressure doesn’t narrow options or exact a visible price. Tension is more atmospheric than conflictual.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes remain abstract (“nourish the planet”) and conflict is gentle; puzzlement yields quickly to cooperation and success. There’s no meaningful tightening that forecloses options or imposes a visible price. The settlers “work tirelessly,” but no loss alters tactics. The result reads as smooth execution rather than tested commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are declared high (time’s balance), but on‑page pressure is gentle and mostly static. Escalation is a soft deepening (daylight dying, hush thickening) rather than a tactical narrowing with cost. The sole meaningful turn is finishing the adjustment and choosing to sing; no option is foreclosed on the page. Tension stays textural rather than conflictual.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (reactivate before frost) is established and there’s a mild tightening as sunset approaches and birds circle. Escalation remains low‑threat; the birds investigate but never force a new tactic or exact a price. The result is functional pressure without a decisive squeeze or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are internal and stable: living with loss and finding a connecting purpose. There’s a mild deepening when the foam patterns trigger the materials insight, but pressure doesn’t tighten or force a trade‑off. No beat forecloses a live option or exacts a visible price. Resolution reads as a reflective shift rather than an earned test.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes stay focused on how to engage the bottle’s mystery—breach or preserve—with one meaningful tightening at the hesitation and switch to “quantifying absence.” The price is an opportunity cost, not a wound, keeping tension gentle. Pressure accumulates rather than reverses, consistent with the lens. A sharper consequence would raise charge.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are primarily internal—can Elara absorb and smooth communal remorse—and they escalate by approaching and touching the pavilion. The tightening is singular but soft, with limited on-page resistance or trade-off beyond assertion of threat. No option is visibly foreclosed besides “not confronting it,” which she does swiftly. Tension exists but remains low-intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake (unifying town/rehabilitating silos) remains abstract and faces little friction. The conversation contains no reversal; the elevator is “willing to talk,” so pressure never tightens. The dawn softening is a tonal deepening rather than a true narrowing of options with price. The resolution arrives without a felt trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake (unlocking/withstanding memories) is clear but low-pressure; resistance is mostly implied. The deepening from analysis to modification to immersion in memories is smooth yet lacks a moment that forecloses options or forces a trade. The “losing herself” hint could be the cost, but it never bites on-page. Resolution feels chosen, not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (uncover the hidden combinations) is steady; the tightening arrives with inversion’s clock and the map insight. Escalation is mostly linear and low-friction; obstacles are more atmospheric than oppositional. The price is primarily conceptual (responsibility, leaving as hour ends) rather than a felt trade-off. Agency drives the reach into the chamber, but without a credible loss or narrowed option set beyond time.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.8)
    Pressure remains gentle: discovery of the insulator and the careful strumming deepen the attempt but do not foreclose options or present palpable risk. Stakes are thematic (“empathy in motion”) rather than situational, and escalation is primarily a density increase in resonance. The tightening beat is the integration of the insulator and the grove’s response. Effective for lyric mode, but low-cost and low-conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.0)
    Dominant stake (recover purpose/beauty post-exile) remains abstract and faces no on‑page resistance. Escalation reads as steady mood accretion without a decisive tightening. The “before next phase of the moon” clock doesn’t alter tactics or force a trade‑off. Resolution is an internal stance rather than a tested choice with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes center on accessing the diary and deepening empathy; pressure rises mainly through intensification of stillness and focus. The only real turn is the clasp releasing, which resolves the central obstacle immediately. No meaningful trade‑off or lasting price is dramatized. Tension is lyrical rather than oppositional, resulting in mild escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.8)
    Pressure centers on whether the corpse flower will bloom and what it will reveal, but resistance is minimal and outcomes feel assured. The “turning of the tide’s thought” hints at a clock yet never forces a trade‑off. The bloom’s arrival escalates affect, not stakes. Resolution hinges on realization, with no visible price or narrowed path.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake (uncovering the source) is clear, with a single tightening: inverted gravity amplifies growth, creating a trail to the pool. Pressure remains gentle; there’s no true obstacle or cost that forces a trade‑off. Agency exists in the choice to follow and land, but consequences are low. The clock adds situational pressure but doesn’t force a painful decision.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes (understanding the crash to prevent future disasters) remain largely abstract, with little tangible pressure or a narrowing of options. The wind phenomenon hints at a deepening, but no on‑page test or trade‑off arises. Escalation is tonal rather than structural. The final resolve to continue is not bought by a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes are identified early (proving wonder essential) and pressure concentrates toward the chisel strike, but there’s little jeopardy or narrowing of options. The “crescendo” functions as escalation, yet success feels inevitable. The piece could use a credible risk or trade-off to sharpen the peak. Resolution is earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are internal (unlocking understanding through failure); escalation arrives via the music intensifying and the markers lighting, but options don’t visibly narrow. The choice to play creates the single meaningful deepening; thereafter, pressure remains mostly atmospheric. The ending doesn’t force a trade‑off or price beyond implied psychic expenditure. Tension is present but low‑grade.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake (unlocking emotion’s mathematics) is clear, and the ticking clock via disappearing stars provides a credible squeeze. Escalation remains mostly tonal; there’s no on‑page reversal beyond “last star vanishes.” Agency is present but uncomplicated; consequences are asserted more than felt. The cost of time expended is hinted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.3)
    Dominant stake (sustain wonder/community) remains abstract, with no escalating pressure. The encounter with the auroral woman deepens tone but doesn’t tighten options or force a trade-off. No reversal or visible cost emerges from Eira’s agency; she endures rather than chooses under strain. The pendant’s intensification reads as emphasis, not escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain abstract; the desire to “prove” is not tested, opposed, or traded against anything concrete. Escalation is minimal—mist clears, insight arrives—and no option is foreclosed. The prism and frost method do not generate reversals or force a choice. The piece reads contemplative rather than conflict‑driven.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes are singular (reconnection), and there’s a mild tightening from puzzle assembly to purposeful weaving to departure. Yet no turn forces a trade‑off in scene; obstacles are internal and largely summarized, with cost implied rather than felt. The result is steady tone more than sharpened pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake (forge a resilient artifact/way of life) is declared, and success arrives without a real test or complication. The only tightening is the apprentice’s arrival, which shifts directions but not under duress. No credible loss, trade‑off, or narrowing of options during the forging. Tension remains largely thematic rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (uncover the withheld truth) is stated, but pressure doesn’t tighten via a concrete trade‑off or foreclosed option. The shard intensifies (glow/pulse), yet the protagonist faces no real risk or dilemma; she advances linearly to revelation. Escalation reads as volume increase, not narrowing of choices. Cost at resolution is mainly conceptual, not felt as a sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes center on preserving a sense of safety against encroaching darkness, but the pressure escalates gently rather than decisively. The outage and letters create unease, yet no turn forecloses a live option. The main tightening is his choice to build the cairn and commit to tending the light. Cost remains mostly internal and soft.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes remain abstract (shape the dawn/day) with little on‑page resistance; escalation is a steady hum rather than a tightening. The wick adjustments and physics motif don’t force a trade-off or loss. No reversal or narrowed option is dramatized. The weight of duty at the end gestures at cost but isn’t tested in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes remain largely conceptual; the only escalation is the sun’s descent enabling a richer display. “Caution” never bites—no option is foreclosed or trade‑off forced. The illumination choice deepens wonder but doesn’t raise price or narrow paths. Tension operates at a gentle hum without a meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—deconstruct sorrow to restore what’s broken—remains largely internal and unthreatened. Escalation is mostly textural (storm syncs with heartbeat), with one meaningful tightening at the concentrated mapping and pin‑drop. Resolution arrives without a visible trade‑off or foreclosed option; the outcome feels guaranteed by gift rather than tested. The result is calming but low in pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake (rekindle the realm) is declared, but pressure remains gentle; escalation is mostly glow → pulse → vision without a trade‑off or narrowed options. No on‑page loss, refusal, or risk complicates her tactic. The window draws her in and releases her without consequence. The hopeful turn lacks a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.9)
    Conflict is largely internal and static; the live stake (reconciling a past mistake) faces little on‑page resistance. The main tightening is the approach to midnight and the discovery of “The Harmony of Opposites,” which functions as a gentle deepening rather than a test with price. Resolution is an internal stance shift without a felt trade-off. Tension remains low throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes stay low and largely internal; the “absolution” concept never faces a concrete test or trade‑off. Escalation is a calm accumulation (birds flying south, repeated visits) without a decisive tightening. The gardener’s arrival doesn’t force a choice or loss. Resolution is reflective rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—salvaging meaning before it fades—remains abstract and faces little on‑page resistance. The discovery of a hidden harmony is a soft deepening rather than a pressure-driven turn with cost. “Racing against time” is asserted but never cornering her into a trade‑off or loss. The resolution stems from attention and interpretation, not a tested commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake (thwart The Shadow / expose trust fracture) is declared but not concretely tested; the standoff lasts “until sunrise” without a narrowing choice or revealed price. The eye‑lock and faint recognition at the fob are promising but do not foreclose options. The resolution dissipates tension rather than transforming it. Overall conflict feels static with minimal deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes are signaled (find what weather‑carriers are, connect to grandfather’s legacy), and escalation occurs via ring activation and the stranger’s appearance. Yet pressure remains low: no option is starkly foreclosed, and risk or cost is not dramatized beyond trepidation. The decisive act (reaching out) is underdetermined by danger or sacrifice. Tension is atmospheric rather than strategic.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake is legible (unblock creativity), but pressure scarcely tightens; once she decides to draw, nothing credibly resists her. The lock’s role doesn’t force a trade‑off or loss; the “turning dials” beat doesn’t escalate cost. Resolution arrives smoothly without a visible price beyond release of pent‑up feeling. Emotional stakes read, but conflict lacks a meaningful squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake is clear but pressure scarcely tightens; obstacles and trade‑offs are summarized rather than dramatized. There’s no decisive on‑page loss or foreclosed option; the journey unfolds without meaningful reversal or cost. The “treacherous tunnels” do not generate a concrete squeeze that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes remain abstract (“symphonies of truth,” “era after words”) with no concrete threat or trade‑off. The iceberg’s arrival offers an opportunity but not a test. There’s no genuine tightening or loss that alters tactics. Resolution feels preordained rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes (protect roses/resolve inner static) are legible, and pressure coheres during the burn. The main tightening—choosing to contain rather than flee—reads, but reversals and prices are muted. We seldom feel options foreclosing or tools failing; consequences remain largely conceptual. As a result, tension plateaus rather than bites.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes center on uncovering a benign mystery and validating a belief; pressure rises modestly from commotion to meeting. The tightening lacks a felt price or foreclosed option; obstacles are minimal and off‑stage. Coincidence (anonymous admirer’s intent) resolves rather than complicates. The result is pleasant but low‑tension.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake (escape) is signaled early, but pressure escalates gently through motifs rather than concrete obstacles. The spider’s web suggests a clock without forcing on‑page trade‑offs. The decisive act (encoding then exiting) faces little immediate resistance. Stakes feel more conceptual than visceral, limiting turn intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake (recover what’s lost) is signaled early; escalation moves from omen (whale) to method (grounds) to confrontation (crystal). Pressure remains gentle; coincidence (vision) and a smooth path undercut cost and narrowing of options. The decisive act (touching the crystal) lacks a visible price or meaningful trade‑off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (neutralize the prophecy’s imbalance) remains abstract, and escalation reads as a thicker hush rather than a narrowing of options or cost. The deepening from meditation to web‑of‑silence to release forms a gentle cadence shift, but tension is low. No credible trade‑off or reversal tests commitment. Resolution is earned in tone but feels nearly consequence‑free.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=4.9)
    Stakes remain abstract (“understand secrets”) and untested. The interrogation is a soft deepening rather than a tightening that forecloses options, and no price is paid to obtain the seal or knowledge. There’s little escalation; pressure doesn’t compound. The result is pleasant motion without felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes remain internal: whether she will face and integrate a quarantined memory. The tightening is minimal—the whispers grow, she focuses, memories surface—without a live counterforce or trade-off on the page. We don’t see a reversal or a pressured choice that forecloses an option beyond a gentle acceptance. The result is coherent but soft, with little visible price paid in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake (transforming an oppressive document) is declared, yet pressure scarcely tightens on the page. There’s no credible reversal or narrowing of options; completion proceeds without friction. The “calibrated treason” never extracts a concrete price. The end resolves by serenity rather than tested commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes (to learn why some people echo) remain abstract and never bite; escalation is mostly a volume/intensity increase in song and whispers. There’s a nominal discovery (“echoes… tied to relationships”) but it doesn’t alter options or force a trade‑off. No reversal or narrowing choice occurs on the page. The final stance is endurance without a visible price paid in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes (find and expose truth) stay mostly conceptual; pressure rises by density rather than narrowing choices. The key turn is the snow globe’s pattern igniting a vision and the windows opening, but little is foreclosed and no clear price is paid. Internal/external conflict interweave softly without a demanding test. The result is evocative but low‑tension.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.8)
    Dominant stake (“will she touch the hidden order?”) stays abstract; pressure does not tighten. The only deepening is a mood intensification as she follows the moon path; no option is foreclosed, no trade‑off forced. The revelation resolves without a visible price. Tension is textural rather than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake (find the diamond/stillpoint) is clear, but escalation is linear and low‑friction. The meaningful tightening is the deciphering of letters, yet no option is foreclosed or paid for; “being watched” and storms do not force a trade‑off. The final image is charged but cost‑light, so pressure never fully crystallizes into consequence. Conflict remains mostly task‑completion rather than decision under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.3)
    Stakes are declared (variant allegiance reshaping society) but never sharpen into a pressured choice; conflict stays abstract. No meaningful tightening or loss forces new tactics; escalation is summarized as growth and spread. The ending claims success without trade‑off. Without a concrete test of commitment, tension remains flat.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.9)
    Pressure is primarily internal and accumulative: from creative drought to tentative re-engagement. The meaningful tightening is the decision to write as the music fades, but there’s minimal sense of trade-off or loss on the page. Stakes—purpose vs. isolation—remain abstract rather than tested by a hard choice. The piece deepens mood more than it escalates consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake (protect/harmonize) is stated early but opposition is minimal and success is largely assured; no meaningful reversal or costly trade‑off occurs. The “tightening” is mainly a fade of light, which doesn’t force altered tactics beyond pacing. Internal pressure is calm and confident rather than contested. Resolution feels untested by stress.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake is clear (signal the uprising), and pressure rises via the wind, the hum, and the full moon toward a single culminating act. However, escalation remains largely declarative, with minimal narrowing of options or trade‑offs. No on‑page loss or forced compromise sharpens the peak. The result reads as an unopposed ritual rather than a contested turn.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stakes are internal (liberation) with a secondary investigative aim, but pressure never tightens beyond the inscription beat. There’s no real obstacle or trade‑off tested on the page; tension remains textural. The cadence shift near the end is felt but low‑cost. As a result, escalation is modest for the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is internal (how to live after failing someone), yet pressure scarcely tightens beyond reflective deepening. The proprietor’s counsel gently nudges rather than tests or forecloses options. The “gift” beat signals a turn, but there’s no meaningful price paid or hard trade‑off. Escalation is more tonal than consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are named early (reach the bell), but escalation is mostly iterative wonder rather than narrowing options. The transliteration yields a pattern, yet no on‑page reversal or credible price tests commitment. The climax (ringing the bell) arrives without a palpable trade‑off. Pressure remains static despite the evolving workshop.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stakes are signaled, but pressure doesn’t tighten through a concrete turn; discoveries arrive by summary. The recurring numbers suggest deepening, yet no beat visibly forecloses options or exacts cost. The “don’t lie to yourself” nudge hints at an internal crucible without a dramatized choice under pressure. Resolution is largely informational, limiting felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake (restore fragile balance via crystal) is clear but undergoes minimal tightening; obstacles never bite. The methodical mirror work offers no reversal or visible price. The ending’s “quiet resolve” is earned but not tested. Tension remains atmospheric rather than escalatory.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—whether to live into this “second chance”—is clear, but escalation is gentle: the work soothes rather than tightens pressure. The meaningful turn is internal (motivation shift) without a concrete trade-off tested on the page. Cost is implied more than dramatized; no on‑scene conflict forces a hard choice. The cadence deepens nicely but lacks a squeeze point.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.3)
    Dominant stake is internal and signaled, but pressure scarcely tightens; wandering yields parallels without a real test. No on‑page reversal or foreclosed option; the “price” of the realization is not dramatized. Escalation reads as repetition rather than deepening. The quiet ending works conceptually, but tension remains low throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve the echo of wisdom—is declared early, but pressure remains gentle and largely uncontested. The only tightening is the act of consecration deepening into a sanctuary while the prophet speaks. No path is truly foreclosed; consequences or trade‑offs stay abstract. Tension operates more as tone than friction.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain abstract: “collective healing” never faces a specific on‑page test or resistance. There’s no tangible tightening or trade‑off; lingering and photographing proceed unopposed. The sunset shift modulates mood but doesn’t escalate pressure. Resolution contains no visible price or narrowed option.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—protect work vs testify—is clear, with a single tightening when the visitor arrives. The click and retrieval of the crystal function as a small reversal, breaking the hush and committing the scholar to movement. Escalation remains modest; the cost is implied rather than tested on the page. Still, the decision forecloses the safety of isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake is clear and continuous; pressure deepens as the pattern forms and the fog “holds its breath.” Escalation is more tonal than antagonistic but coherent under the chosen lens. The visible price—letting the pattern be erased and discarding the chalk—registers, though the squeeze never tightens into a hard trade-off. A slightly sharper test of commitment would elevate stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake (hold the observatory/derive meaning) is signaled, and tremors give a single escalation; however, pressure remains low and consequences are largely summarized (“it held”). The restructuring choice is the main agency beat, but it doesn’t force a sharp trade‑off. The clock hand’s stopping reweights theme more than it tests stakes. Overall tension is steady but rarely tightens to cost.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (help Emma let go) is signaled, and pressure coheres via the blood work result and Lena’s chosen method. Escalation is gentle: the deepening comes through the matched breathing and the lullaby’s cadence shift. Little resistance or counter-force exists, so the price feels modest. Still, the final surrender of Emma’s gaze and breath provides a credible tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=4.9)
    Stakes remain abstract; there’s little concrete pressure or narrowing of options. The “find where shadows go” desire never faces a hard on‑page test. The dawn insight is a soft deepening rather than an escalation with cost. No visible loss or trade‑off occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=4.9)
    Stakes remain internal and largely declarative; there’s no credible tightening or loss that reshapes options. The tooth’s “power to reveal hidden truths” never forces a choice or consequence, and the “substitute body” has no on‑page pressure. The turn is essentially “she decides to feel purposeful,” with no price. As a result, tension is low and escalation minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake is tranquil—share light without fire—but pressure never meaningfully tightens. The “weighing” moments don’t foreclose options or raise cost, and there’s no reversal that tests commitment. Escalation is mainly increased lyric density rather than a narrowing corridor of choices. As a result, the ending reads as a continuation rather than an earned culmination with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake (healing after a viral confession) is legible, but pressure remains soft and largely unopposed. The arrival of the figure and the flower deepens the moment rather than narrowing options. No tangible trade‑off or foreclosed path appears on the page. The resolution feels earned but low‑stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—recovering a voice—appears early, but escalation is gentle and largely inspirational. The cameo nudges effort, then words “begin to flow” without a trade‑off or foreclosed path. No hard test or loss marks the turn. Tension remains steady rather than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake (rekindling communal practice) is stated early, but pressure scarcely escalates. No reversal or foreclosed option precedes the device’s clean success; the villagers arrive and harmonize without resistance. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, density increases, yet cost remains abstract. The outcome feels assured from setup, reducing tension.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (complete the sealing/enchantment) is signaled early and tightens as daylight fades and the ritual nears irreversibility. The key turn is committing her essence to the plate; the hum aligning with her heartbeat marks the deepening. The price is present but light; pressure stays inward and ritualistic, not adversarial, which limits escalation intensity. Still, the cadence shift reads and resolves via her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes stay abstract: curiosity and comprehension without real impediment, loss, or deadline. The main “tightening” is endurance over time, not a pressure that narrows options or forces a trade‑off. No antagonist or meaningful reversal tests his commitment. The final whirr reads as inevitable rather than hard‑won.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain abstract; pressure scarcely tightens beyond sustained concentration. No clear reversal or narrowed options—work proceeds smoothly to completion. The cost of “collecting burdens” doesn’t test her resolve on the page. Tension exists mainly as meditative focus.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (contain grief during the ritual window) is clear, and the live clock adds mild pressure. The meaningful tightening occurs as the kettle moves from simmer to empty and the carving takes shape. Still, conflict is largely internal and steady; few costs or foreclosed options surface beyond acceptance. Tension hums rather than bites.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (reconciliation with eroded ambitions) is legible, with one meaningful tightening as the collection completes and daylight fades. Escalation is accumulative rather than confrontational, culminating in the single act of taking the photo. The price is conceptual—accepting irretrievability—rather than a felt loss or trade‑off on the page. No reversal, but cadence and narrowing are clear.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake (revival) is signaled, but pressure barely escalates; no obstacles, trade‑offs, or narrowing options appear. The key turn (“By rerouting the pipes…”) is instantaneous and low‑cost, and subsequent beats reiterate success. Internal/external conflicts don’t interweave; the maze of intentions remains thematic rather than adversarial. Resolution feels granted rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes remain internal and abstract; the bear’s approach provides the only tangible pressure, then defuses via “excruciatingly gentle.” The tightening is modest—a pattern deepening rather than a narrowing of options—and no option is genuinely foreclosed on the page. The decision to reconcile dreams carries little visible cost. Tension is present but never bites.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake (find the sundial to gain truth) is clear but faces little resistance; clues appear and yield without counter‑pressure. The meaningful tightening is minimal, and no option is foreclosed or traded. The ending does not demand a costly decision, reading more as receipt than test. Tension stays lyrical rather than situational or causal.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake (decode rope to preserve knowledge) is clear, but pressure scarcely tightens; she proceeds without real opposition or tradeoff. The fog darkens and quiet deepens, yet nothing forces a change of tactics or imposes a cost beyond time. The “last knot” is a completion rather than a reversal or narrowing. Escalation reads flat.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.9)
    Pressure accrues more by mood than by concrete stakes; the key tightening is dusk → writing → revaluation of silence. The dominant stake (bridge the absences, find healing) remains largely internal and unopposed, so escalation feels gentle. The thread’s snap provides a small felt price, but no option is forcefully foreclosed. Effective for lyric mode, limited for conflict intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake is clear (reawaken beauty), and escalation occurs via the device’s assembly and the palace’s shuddering. Opposition remains largely atmospheric; there’s little narrowing of options or a felt price. The climax functions as intensification rather than a pressured trade‑off. Resolution leans on mood over tangible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain low and untested: the tree is saved without obstacle, risk, or tradeoff. Internal stakes (daughter of an arsonist) never force a difficult choice in the scene. Escalation reads as mood deepening rather than option-narrowing. The rain’s arrival eases, not tightens, pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes (freeing the city’s memories) are declared early, but pressure does not tighten meaningfully; obstacles are atmospheric rather than adversarial. The “breadcrumbs” yield a smooth progression with little narrowing of options or visible price. The climax (opening the box) carries minimal risk. The post-release vow reframes duty but doesn’t register as an on-page loss.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes remain abstract (“share light without fire”) and face no concrete resistance. The sonar pinging increasing in frequency suggests deepening, but no option is foreclosed or price paid. Pressure does not tighten toward a consequential decision. The ending coasts on mood rather than escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is internal understanding; escalation occurs through accumulating images and the mentor’s nudge, not through a hard choice. There is a cadence shift as butterflies arrive, but no sharp foreclosure or trade-off. The peace gained implies cost (accepting grief) yet isn’t stressed under pressure. Tension remains low-grade and steady.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake is her move toward redemption; the only meaningful tightening is the discovery and reading of the rake inscriptions. Pressure remains largely internal and static, with minimal cost or narrowing of options. The choice to walk away is a reorientation rather than a tested decision. Tension is steady but seldom intensifies.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes center on deciphering the echoes; escalation is gentle: patient untangling → pattern → crystal → hidden message. Pressure does not tighten through a visible trade-off, and the chess clock detail doesn’t shape tactics once “run down.” The reveal deepens knowledge but doesn’t force a difficult choice or loss. Tension remains mostly atmospheric rather than conflict-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes are declared (write a future that prevails), but pressure barely tightens; the piece remains a poised meditation. The primary turn is rhetorical—from intention to the hover—without a visible price or foreclosed option. Predictive modeling appears but does not force trade‑offs. Tension operates more as mood than complication.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the pirate broadcast to catalyze dust‑stories—is clear and escalates once via the crescendo and flicker/presence beat. Agency is attentional and artisanal (tuning, transcription) rather than decisional under risk; the cloak gesture hints at danger without altering tactics. The cessation of the broadcast imposes a soft deadline that works, yet no option is visibly foreclosed with cost. The tension remains felt but low‑stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake is internal (how to regard the illusion of safety), yet escalation is slight and largely discussed rather than tested. The only meaningful tightening is the move from contemplation to scattering, with little resistance or reversal. Agency exists but with low cost; consequences remain abstract. Pressure stays steady instead of rising.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake is internal: to find/preserve truth against the comforting narrative. Pressure accretes but rarely tightens; there’s no real reversal or forced trade-off. The endurance choice carries implied isolation and physical wear, yet escalation remains static. Tension stays conceptual rather than sharpened into a concrete, narrowing decision.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are declared (preserving harmony against vanishing arts), yet on-page pressure stays diffuse. The primary tightening is internal—a reaffirmation after the music—but few options are genuinely narrowed. No concrete opposition or loss forces adaptation. The piece sustains tension as mood rather than conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake (create a dish at the alignment) is stated early but opposition is minimal. The key turn is the seed’s discovery via pruning; afterward, pressure doesn’t tighten—no risk of failure, loss, or trade‑off on the page. The alignment functions more as backdrop than live clock. Resolution arrives without a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake (learn the truth) is clear, but pressure remains gentle: no meaningful risk, trade-off, or foreclosed option. The riddle and log deliver answers without friction or loss. Escalation is primarily procedural rather than tightening. The resolution doesn’t require a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes (understanding a house’s aliveness) remain largely internal and face minimal resistance. Escalation is a gentle deepening of attention; there’s no credible trade-off or foreclosed option. The ritual proceeds without complication, so tension stays low. The final insight doesn’t force a new cost calculus on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes remain abstract: understanding replaces decay with renewal, but there’s little pressure, narrowing of options, or visible price. The ampoule’s arrival reads as convenient rather than earned escalation. The “series of small, structural weaknesses” insight deepens knowledge without testing it. Conflict is largely absent; tension operates more as mood than causality.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake is internal (endurance vs. release), but escalation is mostly tonal (“air thicker,” “steeper”) rather than choice‑driven. The “rupture” does not reconfigure options on the page, and no live path is palpably foreclosed before the end. The closing acceptance has cost conceptually, yet the scene lacks a concrete pressure point that forces a trade‑off. Tension plateaus in the middle.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes remain largely abstract (hope, connection, cultural revival) with limited on‑page friction. The meaningful tightening is the choice to start painting; after that, pressure eases into flow rather than testing resolve. No reversal or foreclosed path is felt beyond time passing. Consequences remain mostly conceptual, so escalation reads gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake (preserving heritage) is present but lightly challenged; the thaw drives discovery rather than Elena’s agency under pressure. Tension spikes in the chamber with “rosewater dread,” yet no option is foreclosed or traded off. The escalation is textural rather than decisional, muting stakes’ bite.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—unlocking the lighthouse’s secret—is clear, but opposition is mostly atmospheric; the puzzle yields without real setbacks or trade‑offs. The meaningful tightening is the discovery of the yoyo and its decoding, which deepens possibility rather than foreclosing options. Cost is conceptual rather than dramatized, and stakes stay abstract (“fate’s design,” “latent radiance”). Tension operates more as anticipation than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake (pursue the mystery/harness luminance vs. safety/sanity) is present, and pressure escalates to the mirror apparition. Agency is mostly “press on” under the advisor’s prodding; the blackout removes decisive choice at peak. The cost (haunted aftereffect) lands but the narrowing of options and a true trade‑off are faint. Stakes stay abstract rather than viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes remain largely aesthetic: can she coax music that fuses with atmosphere. Escalation is a density build (fractal rhythm complexifies), but no option is narrowed and no price is paid beyond exertion. The hush and echo create expectancy without a consequential test or trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—approach the watchers/learn the expedition’s fate—is clear early and tightens with the crack and map discovery. The main escalation is knowledge/depth rather than direct threat, culminating in the leave‑the‑city decision. Price and foreclosed options are implied (safety vs truth) but not sharpened by a concrete loss or test. Coherence holds under the Situational lens, if somewhat gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are largely conceptual (“rescue truth”), with no concrete opposition or narrowing of options. The investigation proceeds without obstacle; there’s no on‑page test of commitment or trade‑off. Escalation is minimal; the key find arrives and yields. The ending resolves without felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake (preserve and transmit the past) is present, but pressure scarcely tightens. No real obstacle or reversal tests the surveyor’s commitment; the “wresting” remains figurative. The end choice to leave the inkwell behind is understated and carries limited felt price. The beat structure reads as a steady hum rather than an escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake (decoding/locating truth) does not meet significant resistance; pressure deepens but seldom tightens. The pivot to a complex, interwoven code is a mild escalation, not a foreclosing trade‑off. Costs and risks remain abstract; no option is visibly lost. Tension operates more as atmosphere than contest.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—turning sorrow into light—remains coherent but escalates only modestly. The basilica’s beckoning and the crane’s release mark the lone tightening/deepening. Costs are mostly internal and quiet; no option is starkly foreclosed beyond continued endurance. Tension hums steadily rather than mounting.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stakes are stated early, but escalation stays abstract: analysis yields a disturbing pattern, then a revelation. There’s no on-page obstacle or tradeoff that narrows options; the clock and location don’t bite. The turn to “catalyst” knowledge is interesting but low-cost and untested. Tension hums conceptually rather than pressing Amira into a visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake is signaled, but pressure remains low; discovery arrives with limited resistance and minimal trade‑off. The meaningful tightening is the carvings revealing a compartment, yet the price is mostly deferred (“journey was far from over”). Internal and external threads align, but no beat forces a costly choice. Tension is more meditative than escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (to uncover withheld truth vs. fear/guilt) is clear, with one tightening: the shoreline search precipitates resolve. Escalation is largely tonal and internal; options do not significantly narrow. Cost remains abstract (postponing guilt; risking painful truths) without an on‑page price point. Tension simmers rather than intensifies decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake (breakthrough in prisoner exchange) is declared early, but escalation is soft and mostly offstage. The “tightening” happens via assertion that the time is near rather than a pressure turn that forecloses options. Resolution feels uncontested; no visible price or tested trade-off. Tension stays low despite weighty subject.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are internal (purpose vs. regret), but escalation is mild; there’s no turn that meaningfully narrows options. The shift to navigating by utility poles helps focus, yet no real test complicates or prices that choice. Resolution comes without a felt trade-off beyond summarized endurance. Tension remains steady rather than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake (beginning the quest to restore empathy) is signaled, but pressure scarcely escalates; obstacles are absent and the “labyrinth” functions metaphorically. The one tightening beat—the hidden path’s reveal—doesn’t force a trade‑off or visible loss. Stakes stay conceptual, so tension lacks bite. The final commitment reads as low‑cost momentum rather than a tested stance.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (reconnecting with the dead while Lyra changes) is signaled early, but pressure escalates without real resistance. The ritual proceeds smoothly; no beat meaningfully forecloses an option or forces a trade‑off on the page. The cost is stated as “exhilarating and terrifying” yet doesn’t alter tactics mid‑scene. As a result, tension stays lyrical rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.4)
    Pressure deepens once when the clasp is unfastened and the hand‑tracings refract the core want. However, escalation remains gentle and largely reflective, with no significant narrowing of options or explicit trade‑off. The cost of acceptance is implied rather than dramatized. Tension operates more as cadence than as tested stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake (unlock the dimension) is signaled early, but pressure largely accrues lyrically rather than through a narrowing of options. The key turn is completing the final stitch; we do not see a genuine alternative or risk that forces a trade‑off beyond tone. The peril of “shadow work” is told rather than dramatized. Cost lands more as aura than consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes remain primarily internal (seeking meaning), with limited on‑page pressure. The old woman’s prophecy deepens tension briefly, but there’s no real trade‑off or loss; accepting the bottle entails no risk. Escalation reads as a steady amplitude increase in the “hush,” not a narrowing of options. The final commitment (“follow the hush”) doesn’t foreclose a path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes are declared high (revolution), yet escalation is minimal: the code is deciphered quickly; activation succeeds without resistance. Pressure scarcely narrows options or extracts a price. Coincidence (timely blackout; conspirator appears) does more to enable than complicate. The ending lacks a felt trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.2)
    Pressure remains low; the dominant stake is cosmic but largely uncontested. Escalation arrives mainly as density increase: the sequence completes and the vision breaks. No clear trade‑off or visible price narrows options, so the turn lacks bite.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is internal: will she face what she hid and accept its cost. Escalation is a measured tightening toward opening the envelope; the timer’s ticking and storm density help. The price reads as an inward exposure rather than a tangible loss, limiting felt jeopardy. Still, the final stance crystallizes credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake (win the duel/argument) is signaled, and tension rises from waiting to clash to outcome. Escalation is present but mostly told, with minimal on‑page narrowing of options or visible price. The opponent remains generic, muting pressure and reversals. The sundial tactic is invoked but doesn’t force a trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake (rebuild the library) is signaled early, yet pressure scarcely escalates—no obstacle or trade‑off narrows options. The “resistance” remains conceptual and never forces a tactical shift or priced choice. The tightening beat is the decision to begin, which is not tested. The result reads aspirational rather than hard‑won.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (grief’s refuge vs. returning to the living current of time) is coherent and tightens when she finds peace in the film world but must leave as night approaches. The encore as defiance against fate underscores agency and consequence. Escalation is primarily internal and could use one sharper on‑page squeeze or opposing force. Still, the refusal to remain in sanctuary carries a readable price.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are signaled (memories at risk before the monsoon), but tension rarely tightens beyond asserted urgency. There is no clear reversal or forced trade‑off; the work proceeds smoothly and resolves off friction. The monsoon functions as a deadline but does not corner Aria into a costly decision. The ending’s “vanishing” skirts consequence rather than crystallizes it.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are internal (grief vs. release) and signaled early; pressure coheres through the ritual’s stages. The meaningful tightening occurs when the lace reveals the blue and Kaito chooses to let the compass go. The cost—letting go while accepting lingering regret—is legible though subdued. Escalation is quiet but credible under the accumulative lens.


== Grader: Gemini 2.5 Pro ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=5.2)
    The stakes are purely intellectual and abstract—a search for a unifying theory—which results in a complete lack of narrative tension. While the character's understanding deepens in a way that is consistent with an Accumulative lens, there is no meaningful pressure, opposition, or risk. The final "cost" of kindled humility is stated but feels intellectually convenient rather than viscerally earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is internal—finding purpose—and is signaled early. The pressure builds atmospherically, culminating in a deepening of understanding when the frost patterns connect to the ledger. This functions as the single meaningful turn appropriate for this lens and length. The resolution is earned by her synthesis of these elements, but the conflict lacks bite as there are no opposing forces or difficult trade-offs presented in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story establishes a compelling emotional stake but fails to test it with meaningful pressure. The central conflict—"the discord that had crept into their composition"—is introduced and resolved within two sentences, lacking any sense of struggle, trade-off, or genuine difficulty. This frictionless resolution prevents any significant escalation, making the final harmony feel easily achieved rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=3.5)
    This is the story's most significant failure. While a central stake is established (revitalize the signal), there is no meaningful escalation, opposition, or on-page struggle. The undertaker proceeds from one objective to the next without encountering a single significant obstacle that tests his resolve or forces a difficult trade-off. The conflict is a simple, frictionless procedure rather than a dramatic contest.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—the community's survival under sanctions—is clear from the start. The story achieves a deepening of resolve through Akira's speech, which serves as the central event. However, the conflict remains static; the pressure from the sanctions is a background state, not an active force that escalates or forces a trade-off within the scene, leaving the tension uniform.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.2)
    The internal stake is clear—finding a place for "unused love"—and the pilgrim's arrival deepens it. However, the escalation lacks friction; Aria is a skeptical but quickly compliant participant. The resolution is achieved through a guided exercise without a significant trade-off or visible cost, making the earned victory feel muted.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding the halo fragment—is clear, and the conflict escalates as reality dissolves into a "quaking reverie," which aligns with an Accumulative lens. The critical flaw is the lack of a tangible price for the knowledge gained. The stakes remain purely intellectual, and since the "terrifying" experience concludes with a feeling of "reverence" and empowerment, the conflict lacks visceral tension or meaningful consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=3.5)
    The stakes are high (civilizational survival) but remain abstract because the conflict is not dramatized. The antagonistic "forces" are off-stage, and the primary on-page obstacle—the heavily guarded vault—is bypassed without any tension, cost, or struggle. There is no meaningful escalation or turn; the protagonist proceeds with frictionless competence, which undermines the narrative's claims of a desperate struggle for the future.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story establishes a clear, potent internal stake: capturing an impossible sound to facilitate healing. The escalation is handled well for an accumulative piece, moving from a state of searching to the crystallization of the sound itself. This shift represents a meaningful deepening of the conflict, and the cost is the palpable emotional weight of the memories Lyra pours into her work.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story establishes a clear initial stake (capturing a photo) and effectively deepens it to a higher, more abstract one (uncovering destiny's secrets). This shift provides a single, meaningful escalation consistent with an accumulative drive. The cost is legible—Lumina abandons a moment of human connection for a path of mystery—but the pressure feels entirely internal and arises from a convenient external prompt, lacking a sense of earned struggle or opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake is internal—whether Elian will commit to a new purpose—but the conflict lacks pressure. The escalation is a single moment of internal decision ("abandon the familiar") rather than a response to mounting opposition. The absence of any external friction or meaningful internal trade-off makes the resolution feel preordained and low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant internal stake—overcoming fear and betrayal—is clearly established. The act of decryption serves as a sufficient tightening of knowledge that precipitates the climax. The primary weakness is the resolution; the conflict essentially evaporates after the epiphany, and the proclaimed cost of embracing vulnerability is presented as a purely positive step forward without any immediate, tangible trade-off or sense of loss.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—imposing order on the chaos of the "endless night"—is established early and pursued relentlessly. The conflict escalates as the oracle's ritual deepens the silence and darkness, culminating when the last star dies. The protagonist’s agency drives this deepening, and the cost of her success is made visible, resulting in a well-managed escalation for this textural narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=3.2)
    The conflict is entirely internal, static, and resolved through passive reflection rather than active struggle within the scene. The central stake—understanding sentience—lacks on-page pressure or escalation; the "looped timelines" are presented as past research, not a present action with risk. The resolution arrives as a frictionless epiphany without a trade-off, cost, or the foreclosure of any meaningful path, rendering the conflict inert.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.5)
    The central conflict is purely internal and progresses through a deepening of mood rather than escalating external pressure, which is valid for a textural piece. The dominant stake—achieving clarity over secrecy—is clear. However, the resolution lacks a felt cost; the protagonist's final state is one of pure "freedom" and "peace" without any visible trade-off, which deflates the tension and makes the earned victory feel slight.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central stake is a quiet, internal one: the dresser's need for communion with the garden. While this is established, the narrative lacks a meaningful escalation of pressure under its Accumulative lens. The conflict is static; the garden simply flourishes in response to care, confirming the initial premise without forcing a difficult choice, trade-off, or re-evaluation of tactics in the face of rising opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=3.5)
    While the central stake—proving a scientific theory—is clear, the story lacks meaningful conflict or escalation. Kaelin proceeds unopposed: the repair is successful, the simulation works perfectly, and the experiment yields immediate, unambiguous results. The absence of any setbacks, complications, or rising pressure turns the narrative into a procedural demonstration rather than a tense conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—unraveling the code to find inspiration—is established early. The pressure deepens texturally as Rachel interacts with the program. The decision to "disrupt the tranquility" serves as a meaningful turn. However, the resolution feels too easy; the code unravels without significant opposition, and the resulting peace lacks a visible price, softening the conflict's overall impact.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—finding an abstract "truth"—lacks immediacy and concrete consequences, making the conflict feel low-pressure and purely intellectual. There is no tangible opposition or antagonist. While the story deepens its central concept, it fails to escalate the stakes in a way that forces a difficult choice or trade-off; the final resolution is an acceptance that carries little dramatic weight beyond its philosophical poignancy.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=3.5)
    The central stake—finding an abstract "weight of a swallowed truth"—lacks immediate, tangible pressure. Escalation is nearly nonexistent until the final paragraphs, where the conflict is resolved by pure coincidence. The protagonist's agency does not drive the resolution; they simply stumble upon the answer, which fundamentally undercuts the sense of earnedness and deflates any accumulated tension.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.7)
    The central conflict is internal—a soul weary of time seeking peace—and the stake is the keeper's state of being. The decision to burrow serves as the story's single, meaningful deepening of this stake. However, the pressure feels static and gentle; there's no sense of a difficult trade-off or a struggle against the choice, which limits the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Aria can connect Eli to the world—is established and maintained. The solar eclipse provides a single, meaningful deepening of pressure that forces the climactic moment of connection. While the conflict is entirely internal and gentle, the escalation is legible within the story's accumulative design. The resolution feels earned within this quiet framework.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central conflict—deciphering the past—is clear and sustained, fitting the Accumulative lens. The stakes are intellectual and emotional, focused on Emilia's desire to understand. The narrative deepens as she connects the tapestry to the diaries, creating a single, meaningful intensification of knowledge. While the pressure is coherent, it lacks significant escalation; the opposition is entirely passive (the cryptic nature of the artifacts), and Emilia's progress feels inevitable rather than hard-won against mounting resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.2)
    The central stake—The Oracle's internal transformation—is signaled, but the escalation is entirely abstract and told to the reader. The pressure from the stranger's visit is summarized in phrases like "expertly guiding the discussion toward a hidden truth," but we see no evidence of this expertise or the conflict it generates. Because the core conflict happens off-page in a summarized conversation, the stakes remain conceptual and lack visceral tension.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—unraveling the stillness—is abstract and the pressure feels diffuse. The conflict escalates texturally as "the whispers of the unknown grew louder," but the lack of a concrete obstacle or antagonist lessens the tension. The introduction of the "possession" stake in the story's final moments is a critical failure, as it arrives too late to build any meaningful pressure or force any difficult choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.8)
    The central stake—reigniting creative passion—is clear, and the pressure of the fleeting dawn provides a soft clock. The escalation, however, is minimal, depicted as a quickening of pace rather than a meaningful turn that narrows options or raises the price of failure. The conflict is resolved without a dramatized struggle or a visible cost, weakening the sense that a significant victory has been won; the inspiration arrives as a gift of the scenery, not as the result of overcoming a formidable obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.5)
    The stakes are cosmic ("reshape the fabric of reality") but feel inert because the conflict is entirely frictionless. The protagonist's journey is described as a victory lap; her "mastery of procedural generation" allows her to overcome obstacles without any visible struggle, cost, or tactical adaptation. This lack of tangible opposition or a single moment of genuine difficulty makes the escalation feel purely aesthetic rather than a test of the character's will.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story establishes a clear internal stake—defeating emotional numbness—and deepens it through an accumulative structure. The pressure builds texturally as Aria's humming "grew more insistent" and the cavern's atmosphere thickens with "anticipation." The resolution is earned within this quiet mode, with the cost being the acceptance of a new way of being, foreclosing the old path symbolized by the phonograph. The conflict is coherent and resolves with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake that escalates from curiosity to a moral imperative with personal risk. The introduction of paranoia ("she couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched") provides a meaningful tightening of pressure. However, this external threat remains an assertion rather than a dramatized force, and the protagonist’s internal conflict resolves with a smoothness that undercuts the tension, making the final decision feel less costly than the narrative claims.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara's struggle to process her grief—is established early and remains central. The intensification of sensory details from the UV lights serves as an effective deepening of pressure under an Accumulative lens, forcing a choice to finally grieve. The resolution is earned through this catharsis, but the stakes feel entirely internal, lacking any external friction or complication that would heighten the tension before her emotional release.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake is the abstract goal of understanding, and the pressure is intellectual. While this fits the Accumulative lens, the escalation is a quiet deepening of thought rather than a visceral tightening of options. The "impossible choices" that frame the conflict remain a background concept, never forcing a concrete, on-page trade-off, which keeps the tension at a sustained, low hum without a decisive peak.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake: the protagonist's internal struggle against the despair embodied by the "chronic hush." The pressure deepens appropriately for a textural piece when she encounters the community, challenging her solitude. The resolution, where her music transforms the nature of the silence, is an earned reweighting of the central stake with a legible emotional cost ("unbind the sorrow and the loss").

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—successfully crafting nuanced emotions—is clear, and the process is detailed. However, the conflict remains entirely internal and lacks escalation or a moment of genuine pressure. It's a depiction of a master at work, not a struggle against failure, which keeps the tension at a steady, low hum without a meaningful tightening that tests the character's commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=1.5)
    The story is almost entirely devoid of conflict or meaningful stakes. The initial micro-mystery of the locket is resolved immediately and without opposition. The main goal of starting a community project is met with instant agreement and collaboration, encountering no obstacles, trade-offs, or internal resistance. This lack of pressure or escalation results in a flat, tensionless narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=3.8)
    The central stake—Kael's desire for belonging—is clearly established but never genuinely threatened. The conflict is entirely internal and lacks any meaningful external opposition or pressure, resulting in zero escalation. The resolution is achieved without any tangible cost or trade-off; the community's immediate and total acceptance makes the outcome feel predetermined and frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—finding the place where echoes are born—is clear, and the conflict is a focused, metaphysical struggle against time and perception. The pressure deepens effectively during the spell-casting sequence. However, the lack of a tangible obstacle or antagonist makes the resolution feel somewhat frictionless; success is achieved through focus and will alone, which slightly lessens the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story establishes a coherent internal stake: the quest to understand emotion to palliate a sense of loss. The pressure deepens effectively as the orchard grows silent and the ritual begins, culminating in the character confronting the "weight of ambiguous loss." The resolution is driven by her agency in completing the ritual, but the conflict's power is limited by its abstract nature and lack of concrete external pressure or unexpected complications.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=4.2)
    The dominant stake—the desire to be seen—is declared past the midpoint rather than being dramatized through early action. Consequently, there is no meaningful escalation of pressure; the character simply decides on a new purpose after a pleasant memory. The resolution is not earned through overcoming any concrete obstacle or paying a visible price, rendering the conflict static and low-impact.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=3.6)
    The conflict is entirely internal and remains static throughout the narrative. The initial stake—Emilia's restlessness versus her reluctance to change—is stated but never escalates. There is no meaningful tightening of pressure; the resolution arrives via a simple decision rather than as the result of a difficult, costly choice, rendering the conflict inert.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding the brooch—is signaled early. The primary tightening point is the negotiation with the stranger, which forces a trade-off and carries a stated cost. However, the escalation leading up to this point is weak, with obstacles like the "wild goose chase" being summarized rather than dramatized. The resolution is driven by the protagonist's agency, but the conflict feels more like an intellectual puzzle than a visceral struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—the nature and scope of Aria's clairvoyance—is clear. However, the pressure is gentle and the escalation is more of a deepening than a tightening. The conflict is entirely internal and lacks a compelling counter-pressure; Aria never seems at risk of failing or turning back. The cost of her transformation is purely conceptual, lacking a visceral or tangible price on the page, which softens the impact of her final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=3.8)
    The central stake—healing a community after a devastating exile—is significant, but the conflict is static. The archivist faces no opposition, setbacks, or moments of doubt. Her plan to "hearten the community" unfolds with frictionless success, which completely negates any sense of rising tension or escalation. The conflict exists only in the backstory of the exile; the present-tense narrative lacks any immediate, tangible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=3.8)
    The central stake—uncovering unspoken truths—is clear, but the conflict is inert. Emilia faces no meaningful obstacles, external or internal; the path is literally marked for her. The story declares the journey a "test of her resolve," but this resolve is never challenged, which deflates tension and makes the "triumphant" conclusion feel hollow. The cost is stated in the final paragraph, not viscerally felt through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.5)
    The stakes—unlocking entangled memories—are abstract and lack a clear, visceral cost for failure. While the story deepens its central mystery in line with an Accumulative lens, the pressure never truly escalates. Emilia's primary conflict (skepticism) is resolved without a struggle, and the task of transcribing is presented as a methodical process rather than a high-stakes challenge, flattening the overall tension.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes a powerful existential stake early on and tests it directly in the climax. The escalation, driven by the intensifying solar storm, creates coherent pressure that forces Kael's decisive action. The cost of the resolution—trading eternal stasis for unknown potential—is legible and reweights the character's entire future.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stakes are established early, and the conflict escalates with a single, effective tightening when the father reveals the plan requires a "breach of protocol." This forces a clear choice with a legible cost (failure vs. getting caught), which Lena makes with clear agency. The pressure builds coherently to the final moment of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.4)
    The conflict is subtle but clear: the artist against the ephemeral nature of the moment. The stake—capturing the "texture" before it vanishes—is well-defined for this textural piece. Escalation is handled effectively through a single, meaningful deepening: "the lamp's hum grew louder" as dawn approaches, creating a temporal pressure that gives the central action urgency and a visible cost when the moment passes.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central conflict—a person versus the abstraction of erasure—is clear, but the stakes remain purely intellectual. Pressure builds texturally through the repetition of the "layering" action, but there is no meaningful tightening of options or visible cost paid. The resolution feels preordained rather than earned through a struggle against tangible opposition or a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—decoding the riddle to find the compass—is signaled early and remains the focus. Pressure escalates effectively under the accumulative lens as the sounds and whispers intensify. The protagonist shows agency by pressing on through the "beautiful and terrifying" crescendo, and the resolution is earned by this endurance, with the cost being the overwhelming sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.0)
    The central conflict—community versus gentrification—is clear and the stakes are high. The pressure escalates as the deadline looms, forcing a change in the community's stance from passive to active resistance, which fits the accumulative lens. However, the escalation is summarized ("Ava's messages became more urgent") and the costs are merely stated ("not without risk") rather than dramatized, which lessens the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—capturing the images of the flora before it vanishes—is established early and clearly escalated by the timed message. The conflict is a simple but effective "character versus time/environment," and the resolution is earned through Elara's endurance. The cost is purely emotional, which is appropriate for the story's melancholic tone and textural drive.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.2)
    This is the story's most significant weakness. The central conflict—calibrating a "finicky" drone—lacks palpable stakes or escalation. Emilia's process is meditative and faces no setbacks, complications, or rising pressure. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through overcoming adversity, and the cost of her effort is asserted as dedication rather than dramatized as a tangible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—finding the singular convergence—is established early and holds throughout. Pressure effectively deepens with the discovery and deciphering of the cryptic pattern, forcing a high-stakes decision. The final choice to step onto the ice represents a clear commitment with a felt cost of uncertainty and danger, earning the story's quiet climax.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central conflict—the tuner versus entropy—is clear, and the stake is the town's revival. Pressure escalates texturally as the rhythm grows "stronger, more insistent," leading to a clear deepening when the town begins to respond. The cost is one of endurance, which is fitting for the story's mode, but the lack of any tactical shift or setback keeps the conflict at a single, unchanging level of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—the permanent loss of a civilization's memories—is signaled early and remains high. The conflict escalates effectively as Kael moves from untangling energy to the "frenzied intensity" of harnessing it at the temple's heart. The resolution is earned through her direct action, and the cost of her success (the silence, her loneliness) is made clear on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.5)
    The conflict is primarily internal and atmospheric, as the boy contends with the prison's secrets. The stakes are effectively reweighted in the final lines ("Before they find the bodies"), which provides a powerful tightening. This escalation, however, is not driven by the protagonist's agency but by an abrupt reveal, making the pressure feel less earned than it could have been.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent. Both protagonists share the same goal, and there is no opposition, internal or external, to create tension. The stakes—the ghost's freedom and the alchemist's knowledge—are clear, but they are achieved without a single moment of escalation, risk, or a meaningful trade-off. The narrative describes a smooth process of transference, not a struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=3.8)
    The central conflict—art against despair—remains entirely abstract and lacks on-page pressure. The stakes are declared but never tested. There is no escalation, reversal, or deepening of the conflict; Aria's success feels preordained from the first sentence. The story describes her task as a "burden," but this is never dramatized, resulting in a static conflict with no sense of earned resolution or palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story lacks meaningful conflict or stakes that are tested on the page. Maya's journey is a smooth, meditative process of discovery with no opposition, setbacks, or difficult choices. The pressure never escalates; instead, positive feelings simply accumulate without cost, resulting in a narrative with very low tension.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=2.1)
    This is the story's most significant failure. There is no discernible conflict or meaningful escalation. The stakes—creating the letter and finding meaning—are declared but never face an on-page test or threat. The creative process is described as a "meditative... flow," free of struggle, doubt, or external obstacles, which results in a complete lack of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story signals the dominant stake—uncovering a conspiracy before a coup—early and effectively escalates the tension through an accumulative structure. The increasing intensity of the work and the growing "otherworldly energy" of the chart serve as a valid form of rising pressure. The primary weakness is that the antagonistic force (the conspiracy and coup) remains entirely abstract and off-page, which prevents the stakes from feeling visceral and immediate, even as the protagonist's urgency is stated.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a strong spiritual stake—resolving the sorrow of the unspoken—and escalates it effectively under an Accumulative lens. The pressure builds through the intensification of the spirits' singing, culminating in the manifestation of the entity. This confrontation serves as the one meaningful deepening, forcing Aria's direct engagement and leading to a resolution with a clear, felt cost as she carries the letters' essence forward.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.8)
    The internal stake—overcoming trauma—is established early and resolved through the protagonist's agency. The deepening of emotional pressure is legible within the accumulative design, and the cost is felt as a "deep ache." The conflict resolution, however, feels unearned, as the internal opposition of her trauma collapses too easily in the face of a convenient external symbol.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.3)
    The internal stake—rediscovering lost joy—is signaled clearly and drives the narrative. The conflict deepens decisively when Lena commits to creating her art *for* this forsaken place, a choice that redefines success on her own terms. The cost is the renunciation of conventional artistic permanence, which is made tangible when she leaves the mural to the fog.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant internal stake—Lena's struggle against creative stagnation—is signaled early and effectively. The pressure escalates through a single, decisive intensification as she manipulates the sound waves, creating a "swirling vortex." Her agency drives the climax, and the cost (giving up certainty) is legible, making the resolution feel earned under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.1)
    The story establishes a high-concept stake (freedom of expression vs. a thoughts tax) but fails to translate it into on-page pressure. The conflict remains abstract and distant. Lyra's actions face no opposition, risk of discovery, or complication, resulting in zero escalation. The story describes a state of successful resistance rather than dramatizing the act of resisting under threat, which deflates any potential tension.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story effectively dramatizes a quiet, internal conflict. The dominant stake—the poet's search for peace from her inner turmoil—is signaled early and meaningfully deepened by the appearance of the postcard. Her agency is demonstrated in the choice to sing, an action that directly confronts the pressure and leads to a resolution with the felt cost of centuries of processed sorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving memory against oblivion—is established early. Under the Accumulative lens, the conflict doesn't escalate through causal turns but deepens through the caretaker's ritualistic song. This intensification reweights her purpose and crystallizes her stance. The cost is the melancholic acceptance of an endless, lonely task, which is legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—restoring trust—is established early and remains the central focus. The conflict is primarily internal, and the pressure deepens effectively as Elara works toward her goal. The completion of her transcription provides a single, meaningful turn that resolves the immediate internal struggle, with the cost of her past isolation and the future risk ("before paths diverge") making the resolution feel earned and weighty for this story's scope.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.5)
    The central stake—harmonizing conflicting values—is stated clearly but remains abstract. The story tells us the project is a "complex web," but it never dramatizes a moment of genuine trade-off or a choice where preserving history concretely clashes with a safety measure. The pressure is entirely internal and escalates through assertion rather than through a tangible test of Kaelin's commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story's conflict is entirely internal, and its escalation is subtle, fitting the Accumulative lens. The pressure deepens as Emilia's reflections move from her present task to the painful core of her fabricated history. Her act of agency is the deliberate use of her ritual with the dust motes, which allows her to reconfigure her emotional state. The final peace is earned, and the cost—living with the permanent tension of her past—is legible in the story's bittersweet resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding the father's lessons—is established early. However, the pressure lacks significant escalation. The conflict is largely conceptual, and the protagonist overcomes it with a moment of insight rather than a costly choice or trade-off. The resolution is achieved with minimal dramatized struggle, which lessens the impact of the final "peace."

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.0)
    The internal stake is clear, and the conflict progresses as a deepening of connection rather than an oppositional struggle, which is appropriate for the chosen lens. However, the pressure remains consistently low throughout. There is no moment where the goal seems genuinely at risk, which makes the final achievement feel less like a victory and more like an expected outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding the disappearing paths—is established early and resolved directly. However, the story lacks a meaningful escalation of pressure. The protagonist moves from a state of not knowing to knowing via a conveniently found clue, without facing significant obstacles or being forced into a costly trade-off. The resolution is an intellectual insight, and while the conceptual cost of accepting impermanence is present, it feels gentle and lacks visceral tension.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=3.1)
    The dominant stake—achieving "orchestrated serendipity"—is abstract and never feels genuinely at risk. The story lacks any form of meaningful opposition or conflict; the audience is immediately "mesmerized" and "entranced," and Elian's performance is an unqualified success. There is no escalation of pressure, no moment of potential failure, and therefore no earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—to pen a cosmic verse—is established early and resolved cleanly. Under an accumulative lens, the escalation works as an intensification of internal state and artistic focus, culminating in the dance. The critical choice to "fledge" represents a clear tightening, committing Aria to the act that resolves the conflict. The cost is legible in the lifting of her exile, which re-frames the prior isolation as the price paid for her art.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.2)
    The conflict is internal and philosophical, but the stakes are made clear: to capture a fleeting insight before it vanishes. The thrown stone provides a single, meaningful deepening that focuses the protagonist's abstract musings into a concrete artistic urgency ("before everything shifts"). This escalation, driven by an external catalyst acting on internal readiness, is sufficient and effective for this story's length and accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.5)
    The internal stake—transforming pain—is clear, but the escalation is minimal. The central turn, opening the box, feels more like a predetermined step in a ritual than a decision forced by rising pressure. The resolution is framed as a positive gain of purpose, which lessens the feeling of a costly trade-off, making the conflict feel low-pressure and its resolution too tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story establishes an abstract, internal stake (finding "equations for hope") and escalates it through a single, significant deepening—the vision. This vision serves as the on-page test, described as "exhilarating and terrifying," which functions as the emotional price for her insight. However, the conflict remains entirely conceptual, lacking a concrete trade-off or a foreclosure of a tangible path, which limits its visceral impact despite being structurally sound for its textural mode.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.2)
    The central stake—understanding the estate's secrets—is established, but the conflict remains entirely intellectual and passive. Pressure fails to escalate meaningfully because information is acquired without opposition, cost, or setback. The progression is a simple accumulation of clues, lacking a genuine test of the character's commitment or a moment where options are meaningfully narrowed by opposing forces.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central stake—unlocking the mirrors—is established early and remains the focus. There is a discernible escalation as the bells toll and the mirrors begin to respond. The conflict is critically weakened by being frictionless; the painter's success never seems in doubt, and she faces no tangible opposition, setback, or moment of genuine risk, which deflates the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=3.1)
    The dominant stake—achieving peace and personal redemption—is clear, but there is no on-page escalation. The conflict's progression is told, not shown; we are informed that Elian's approach worked and that delegates grew conciliatory, but we witness no specific turn, trade-off, or moment of heightened pressure. The resolution feels unearned because the struggle it supposedly resolves is entirely summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=2.5)
    Conflict and stakes are stated but never manifest on the page. The antagonist force ("powerful interests") is an abstraction that applies no pressure, leading to zero escalation. The protagonist's plan unfolds without opposition, cost, or trade-off, making the resolution feel predetermined and dramatically inert. The core stake is resolved without a single meaningful test of the character's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant internal stake (freedom vs. conformity) is signaled early and drives the narrative. The "untangling" sequence provides a meaningful deepening of this conflict, consistent with an Accumulative lens. The resolution is achieved through the protagonist's agency, but the price paid remains abstract, preventing the stakes from feeling fully realized or costly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.5)
    The conflict is primarily internal, stemming from a need to process a "heated argument" and fulfill an intellectual mission. The dominant stake—exploring the ethics of storytelling—is abstract. The story achieves a single, quiet deepening when Amaranth decides to "reverse the conventional narrative structures," but the pressure feels self-generated rather than imposed. The final cost is legible but lacks visceral impact, reading more as a thoughtful acceptance of a burden than a price paid for a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—honoring the forgotten—is established early and remains the focus. The conflict is internal and philosophical rather than external. Pressure deepens rather than escalates, fitting the textural mode, culminating in the completion of her ritual. The cost is the poignant understanding that her work is ephemeral and unending, a price made legible in the final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.2)
    The central stake—preserving forgotten names—is clear, and the atmospheric intensification functions as escalation under a textural lens. However, the conflict lacks meaningful pressure. Akira's success feels preordained; there is no moment of potential failure, no difficult choice, and no on-page cost associated with her actions. The resolution is an achievement, but not one forged through overcoming tangible opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central stake—understanding why paths choose their walkers—is clear and entirely internal. Pressure escalates via the deepening dream state, mirrored by the storm, which serves as a meaningful deepening of the conflict. The final resolution is an earned insight, with the cost being a fundamental shift in Hindsight's understanding of agency, which qualifies as a felt, conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—sealing a covenant—is established early. The conflict is primarily internal, escalating as the "liminal moment between regimes" provides a window of opportunity, which serves as an effective tightening. While the pressure is more atmospheric than causal, this aligns with the Accumulative lens. The resolution is driven by the protagonist's decisive action, and the cost (personal transformation) is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=3.1)
    Conflict and stakes are declared but not dramatized. The central challenge—convincing those consumed by resentment—is resolved without any form of resistance, setback, or escalation. Elara's power works perfectly on the first attempt, creating a static conflict that lacks tension. The story bypasses any meaningful test of the protagonist's conviction or abilities, resulting in an unearned and frictionless resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—capturing the dream—is established early and escalates effectively through the metaphysical process of creation. The pressure deepens as the boundary between the maker and her dream blurs, a perfect intensification for an Accumulative lens. The resolution is earned through the protagonist's agency, and the cost is unmistakable and severe: she is consumed by her art, erasing her former self. This is a powerful and legible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara's struggle to maintain faith in her family vows against loneliness and separation—is clear. Her persistence serves as a form of agency. However, the escalation is minimal and internal; the key external development (the orchard's sudden vitality) feels more magical than earned. The final resolution is brought about by this unexplained vitality and Aria's convenient return, softening the impact of Elara's struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.5)
    The primary conflict is the curator's internal "disquiet" versus their curiosity, with the stakes being epistemological. While the pressure deepens upon meeting the robed figures, the resolution is an acceptance of knowledge rather than a choice made under duress. The cost of this new understanding remains somewhat abstract, lacking a concrete trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the central stake is clear, the conflict lacks tangible pressure. The "shadowy figures" are generic antagonists whose threat is never demonstrated, and the climax is resolved too easily by finding a hidden door. The story’s one meaningful tightening—the renegotiation—is summarized, failing to build the tension required for a satisfying escalation and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—finding the Garden—is clear and sustained. The pressure deepens texturally as Lyra reads and the environment shifts. While there is a meaningful conceptual turn, the resolution lacks a sharp, felt cost, as the internal struggle of losing oneself in memory is resolved too neatly into a feeling of peace.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story establishes an intellectual stake—understanding the fables—and escalates pressure texturally as time distorts. However, the conflict is abstract (confusion vs. clarity) and resolves without any tradeoff, sacrifice, or lasting consequence for the protagonist. The frictionless resolution undermines the stakes, making the conflict feel low-pressure and its successful outcome a foregone conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.5)
    The core conflict is established, and the protagonist's agency drives a clear intensification toward resolution. The stakes, however, feel abstract because the pressure never forces a difficult trade-off or extracts a price for success. The conflict resolves so smoothly that the initial sense of crisis feels retrospectively low.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=2.0)
    This is the story's most significant failure; there is virtually no conflict. The dominant stake of rekindling knowledge is never tested, as the protagonist moves through a frictionless sequence of discoveries and successes. There is no opposition, no meaningful obstacle, no escalation of pressure, and consequently, no price paid for the final victory. The resolution is a given from the start, which drains the narrative of all tension.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a clear, dominant internal stake—the archivist's need to define her identity against the weight of her duty—and pursues it relentlessly. The pressure deepens decisively when she touches the crystal, forcing a confrontation with the collective memory. This single, meaningful intensification provides a strong pivot, and her subsequent acceptance feels like an earned resolution with a clear, if intangible, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—overcoming creative hopelessness—is clear, but the conflict remains entirely internal and lacks significant escalation under the Accumulative lens. Pressure does not tighten; rather, it dissolves with the discovery of the note, which functions as a coincidental solution. The resolution is not earned through a difficult choice or costly action but is simply found, undercutting the gravity of the initial stake.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict and stakes are almost nonexistent, rendering the narrative inert. The central "conflict" is a philosophical inquiry, which never manifests as a dramatized struggle with tangible opposition or meaningful consequences. The stakes remain purely intellectual and abstract. The resolution of the observed couple's conversation happens without the chronicler's intervention, reinforcing her passivity and the absence of any narrative pressure or escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—Eli’s struggle with claustrophobia—is clear and personal. The pressure escalates texturally with the arrival of the inverted gravity and "gilded hush," forcing a moment of confrontation. The resolution is a quiet deepening of understanding rather than a complete victory, which feels earned within the story's gentle logic. The cost is the fading of the magic, leaving a permanent but subtle internal change.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=2.0)
    The story is almost entirely devoid of conflict, stakes, or escalation. The central goal—to "teach silence how to comfort"—is an abstract premise that never faces an on-page test, obstacle, or opposition. The operator's journey is one of serene, unimpeded success, resulting in no narrative tension or meaningful deepening of the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming the throne—is signaled early, and the sunrise provides a time pressure. However, the conflict is minimal and lacks escalation. Aria faces no meaningful obstacles, setbacks, or difficult trade-offs; she finds the key, follows the clues, and reaches her goal with ease. The tension is declared rather than felt, as failure never seems like a credible possibility on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—the potential extinguishment of the sanctuary's essence—is established early and provides clear motivation. The pressure deepens texturally as the keeper descends, culminating in a clear, protagonist-driven action at the climax. The resolution is earned, and the cost of abandoning isolation is made explicit, successfully fulfilling the core requirements for conflict at this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=3.5)
    The stakes are declared but never feel tangible. The central conflict—translating pressure into diamonds—is resolved with a convenient, magical solution that lacks any sense of struggle or trade-off. The escalation is merely stated ("the pressure in the lab began to build") rather than dramatized, and the victory is achieved without a visible or felt cost, deflating all tension.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.1)
    The central stake—uncovering a hidden truth—is clear, and the pressure escalates texturally as the hum and visions intensify. However, the conflict is frictionless and the resolution is achieved without a meaningful trade-off. The supposed consequence, the end of the dynasty, is presented as the character's desired outcome, not a price paid, which deflates the stakes at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—capturing the shape of possibility—is established and pursued consistently. Pressure escalates effectively under the Accumulative lens as reality distorts and Lysander's presence grows. The knight's agency in murmuring allegiance and unsnapping the catch provides a clear point of tightening, leading to a resolution with a visible cost (transformation).

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=4.8)
    The central conflict is internal: Emilia versus her sorrow. While this is a valid stake, the pressure remains low and static throughout. The process of discovery deepens her purpose but never truly tests it or forces a difficult trade-off. The resolution feels inevitable rather than hard-won, lacking a moment of genuine crisis or a meaningful tightening of the emotional stakes before the gentle closure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.2)
    The stakes are grand but abstract ("tyranny of indifference"), and the conflict is entirely off-page. The story lacks any immediate, on-page opposition or pressure; the gathering of "like-minded individuals" presents no friction or disagreement. Without a tangible antagonist or escalating threat within the scene, the conflict remains static and lacks tension.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—countering the prophecy's fear—is signaled early and held throughout. The conflict is primarily atmospheric and internal, which suits the textural lens. Escalation occurs as the music's intensity grows and the mist's reaction becomes more pronounced, deepening the mood. The resolution is earned through the protagonist's direct action, but the stakes feel abstract as the prophecy's specific threat is never hinted at, slightly limiting the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the central stake—decoding the message—is clear, the conflict lacks genuine pressure. The escalation is purely textural (the light gets brighter) without forcing a difficult trade-off or testing the protagonist's commitment. The resolution arrives without a meaningful, felt cost; the "transformation" is presented as a frictionless reward, undermining the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Elian's need for a new direction in life—is clear and internally focused. The pressure escalates as he transitions from observer to creator, culminating in a choice to embrace a new philosophy. However, the conflict remains largely conceptual. The story effectively deepens his understanding, but lacks a sharp, decisive turn where a tangible option is foreclosed with immediate consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.5)
    The central conflict is purely internal—Elara's disillusionment versus her need for purpose. While this stake is clear, the pressure remains low and abstract throughout. The story's "tightening" is an intellectual reframing of her goal, lacking a visceral sense of what is lost if she fails, which keeps the stakes from feeling immediate or substantial.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=3.8)
    The central conflict is resolved without meaningful escalation or pressure. The collector's success feels inevitable, as her methods (listening, humming) face no resistance or complication. The stakes, while present, lack tension because the protagonist's competence is never genuinely tested, making the resolution feel procedural rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—psychological healing from trauma—is established early and remains the focus. The conflict effectively deepens as Elara moves through the forest, with her agency driving the escalation. The cost of confronting her memories is made legible on the page, satisfying the core requirement for an earned resolution at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story effectively deepens its stakes from simple curiosity to a life-defining purpose, which functions as escalation under the accumulative lens. Lena's agency is clear in her investigation. The significant weakness is the lack of a visible or felt cost; her newfound purpose arrives as a pure gain, a moment of enlightenment without any sense of sacrifice, trade-off, or burden, which diminishes the conflict's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story establishes a clear, if quiet, dominant stake: whether Ezra can uncover the circus's hidden story. The pressure escalates appropriately for an accumulative plot, deepening with the discovery of the logbook. The resolution is earned through the protagonist's agency and carries the cost of the "weightless burden," satisfying the core conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story establishes a high-concept, metaphysical stake—compressing eternity and altering reality. Escalation occurs through the accumulation of prints and rising atmospheric intensity, which aligns with the textural drive. However, the conflict is inert due to a complete lack of opposition, struggle, or setback. The operator's path to success is unimpeded, which significantly lowers the tension and makes the ultimate achievement feel less earned.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake is internal—the search for purpose—and it deepens effectively under the story's textural pressure. However, the external conflict framing it, the "heated dispute with her colleagues," remains entirely off-page and abstract, providing no immediate pressure. While the escalation of internal turmoil is palpable, the lack of a concrete on-page opposition softens the overall tension.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stakes—reclaiming light from an encroaching cosmic darkness—are established early and feel significant. The conflict is a quiet one of artist versus entropy, which is fitting for the tone. Escalation is handled texturally rather than causally, as the "chip seemed to glow in resonance with his efforts" and the tension builds to a "moment of truth," which is an effective deepening of pressure for this narrative style.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=5.2)
    The central stake—finding a place beyond explanation—is clear but remains abstract. While the pressure deepens texturally, the conflict is frictionless; the protagonist encounters no opposition, setback, or moment of doubt. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned against meaningful resistance, and the associated cost is not dramatized as a tangible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=2.1)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent. The central stake—Aria's artistic inspiration—is never threatened, and there is no escalation of pressure. She finds an object, enters a "state of flow," and succeeds without opposition, complication, or a single moment of doubt. The storm, the only potential source of external conflict, is immediately repurposed as an inspirational force, resulting in a narrative devoid of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=1.8)
    Conflict and stakes are effectively absent. Luna's quest for understanding is presented as an unimpeded, linear journey of discovery with no obstacles, setbacks, or opposing forces. The central stake—gaining knowledge—is never in jeopardy. Because there is no pressure or escalation, the final resolution feels more like a description of a process than an earned outcome of a struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the truth of the diary—is signaled clearly. The story achieves a single, meaningful deepening when Naomi begins to understand the codes after her talk with Ada. However, the conflict lacks sharp edges and the cost remains abstract; the "weight of the truth" is mentioned but not demonstrated through a tangible sacrifice or a difficult trade-off on the page. The escalation feels more like a gentle dawning than a high-stakes turn.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—reviving the town—is clear, and the conflict is internal. However, the pressure remains static and intellectual throughout the contemplation phase. The turn at dawn is a decision, not a reversal forced by escalating pressure. The resolution is entirely unearned; by summarizing the town's revival without showing any struggle, sacrifice, or specific action, the story completely fails to dramatize the consequences of the alchemist's choice.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.8)
    The initial stake—archiving emotions—effectively deepens into the accidental creation of a prophecy. However, the escalation feels passive, driven by an external force or subconscious impulse rather than the scribe's choices under pressure. The final cost is legible, but the lack of active agency in the pivotal turn softens the conflict's core.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.2)
    The central conflict is internal and the stakes are cosmically high but feel abstract ("the delicate balance that sustained the world"). The story declares the visions "threatened to overwhelm her," but her "furiously tranquil heart" resolves this tension almost immediately, flattening the escalation. The cost—lifelong duty—is established at the end, but the on-page struggle to reach that point lacks visceral pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake is Ember's internal search for a deeper connection, which is established but remains at a low intensity. The conflict is a gentle preference (listening over noise) rather than a high-stakes opposition. While the story successfully executes a deepening of her purpose under the Accumulative lens, the lack of significant pressure or a tangible price paid for her choice keeps the conflict from feeling truly compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story establishes a clear internal stake: the janitor's search for meaning. Within the accumulative structure, there is a legitimate deepening of understanding, crystallized by the lantern glass. However, the pressure is minimal and intellectual; the conflict lacks visceral tension, and the resolution is a gentle acceptance rather than a choice made under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story establishes a clear, dominant stake: the preservation of memory against a desolate world. The conflict is internal and atmospheric, fitting the accumulative lens. The pressure deepens when the recluse commits to opening the box, and the resolution is earned as they accept the emotional weight of the past. The stakes remain personal and deeply felt, avoiding abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding the new world—is clear, but the conflict is largely passive. The timekeeper investigates and is rewarded with clues in a linear fashion. There is no significant opposition, setback, or reversal to truly test the character's resolve or force a costly trade-off. The pressure doesn't escalate so much as the puzzle's solution gradually unveils itself without resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—the poet’s quest for peace by harmonizing discord—is clear. The conflict is internal, but the "shrill twang" of the snapping kite string provides a single, effective external pressure point that deepens the stakes. This forces a stance crystallization on the nature of transient beauty, and the resolution is earned through this confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=4.5)
    The primary stake—creating a legacy before death—is clear, and the ticking clock provides a source of pressure. However, the conflict is inert. The caretaker's project proceeds without any setbacks, opposition, or complications. This lack of any meaningful struggle or tactical reversal on the page makes the journey feel frictionless and the final success preordained, draining the narrative of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding the "chemistry of homecoming"—is signaled early and remains the focus. The pressure escalates texturally as the skeptic moves along the path, fitting the Accumulative lens. However, the final confrontation and its associated cost remain largely conceptual; the "revelations" are promised rather than shown, and the price paid is an intellectual shift that lacks a visceral or deeply felt consequence on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming the battlefield—is signaled early and resolved. However, the conflict is static. There is no meaningful escalation, deepening, or pressure that forces a trade-off; the coachman's success feels preordained. The story portrays the completion of a task rather than the overcoming of a genuine, dramatized opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake: finding a source of life and purpose in a desolate world. The external conflict (person vs. environment) is sustained throughout the journey to the spring. However, the escalation is linear—a long, arduous walk—rather than a sequence of tightening pressures or narrowing options. The resolution is achieved through perseverance, but the discovery of the path felt too convenient to make the final success feel fully earned against formidable opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.8)
    The internal stake—overcoming stasis—is clear, and the glimpse of light provides a good moment of intensification. However, the conflict resolves without a meaningful test of the protagonist's agency; the magical compass provides a solution instead of forcing a costly trade-off, which deflates the narrative tension at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.1)
    The story declares world-ending stakes ("the very fabric of reality began to unravel") but fails to translate them into tangible, on-page pressure. The conflict lacks escalation; Moonwhisper proceeds from the spire's edge to its heart without a single setback, obstacle, or difficult choice. The core task is described as "intricate and delicate" but is resolved off-screen in a single sentence of smooth success. The absence of struggle or failure makes the triumphant resolution feel hollow.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—how to address the void of the "interregnum"—is signaled early and meaningfully deepened by the historian's arrival. The conflict is primarily conceptual, and the alliance forms with little friction, which somewhat mutes the tension. However, the final image successfully reweights the stakes from stasis to active potential, with the implicit cost of leaving a known silence for an unknown future.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—the nature of reality—is appropriately scaled for the story's mythic tone. The conflict deepens effectively when the seer touches the stone, providing a clear turning point that shifts knowledge and compels the final action. The seer's agency drives the resolution, and the decision to create anew forecloses the path of enduring the painful past. The escalation is coherent and fits the Accumulative structure perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.8)
    The internal stake—the need for self-forgiveness—is strong and well-established. The discovery of the labyrinth provides a meaningful escalation, forcing the protagonist to move from passive contemplation to active confrontation. The conflict loses pressure at the climax, however; once inside the labyrinth, the tutor feels a "sense of peace," and his guilt lifts "like the ebbing of a tide." This lacks the friction and difficult trade-offs expected in a final confrontation, making the resolution feel less costly than the setup promised.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stakes are established early and the conflict escalates effectively under the accumulative lens, with the artist's growing fervor acting as the primary driver of pressure. The single, decisive deepening—the mist parting—is driven by the protagonist's agency and results in a permanent change in her knowledge state with a felt cost, fulfilling the requirements for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story establishes a clear, high-stakes conflict: decipher the statue before suffocating. The pressure of the ticking clock is felt throughout, creating tension. However, the resolution is abstract; she uncovers a vague "secret" and finds "meaning," but this payoff has no demonstrated consequence beyond an internal feeling of peace. The stakes, while dire, resolve without a tangible impact, which lessens their ultimate weight.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=3.1)
    This is the story's most significant weakness. There is no meaningful escalation of conflict or stakes. The painter is a master at the start and effortlessly succeeds in her goal of capturing beauty. The central "complication"—taking a wrong turn—is a happy accident that presents a new opportunity without any cost, risk, or struggle. The absence of coherent pressure or a single meaningful tightening makes the resolution feel predetermined and inert.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake is philosophical—to prove a personal belief. While the story builds pressure through an internal crescendo ("a screaming tenderness that threatened to overwhelm him"), the conflict lacks tangible opposition or setbacks. The escalation deepens a single state rather than narrowing options, and the resolution, being a private confirmation, feels low-risk.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—navigating grief—is established immediately and maintained. The pressure deepens accumulatively through the perilous journey and the enigmatic guidance of the calls. The climax, arriving at the "great, empty plain," serves as the final test, forcing a stance crystallization. The resolution is earned through this confrontation, and the cost is the emotional toll of the journey itself, made visible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—the forager's "psychological safety"—is clear and consistently held. Pressure deepens appropriately for an accumulative story as new information complicates the protagonist's internal state. The discovery of the cures as a way to "occlude" trauma provides a meaningful intensification, but the overall conflict remains passive, driven by discovery rather than by difficult choices made under direct pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—Kael's intellectual and emotional need to understand the stranger's gesture—is signaled early and deepens coherently. The pressure intensifies as Kael connects the stranger's actions to the lighthouse's legend, forcing a stance crystallization. His final act of retrieving the boutonnière represents an earned agency, a choice to engage with the mystery at the cost of accepting its emotional weight, which is a fitting climax for this textural story.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=4.5)
    The central stake—fulfilling the promise—is clear, but the conflict lacks genuine pressure and escalation. The story explicitly mentions "a series of trials," but skips dramatizing them entirely, which is where the escalation should have occurred. The resolution feels unearned, as the final chamber is revealed by simply choosing a path after finding a note, with no visible trade-off or cost paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story establishes clear existential stakes ("the very fabric of reality begins to unravel") and successfully builds atmospheric pressure, which serves as escalation under an Accumulative lens. However, the conflict is never resolved on the page. The lack of a dramatized climax where a price is paid or a genuine trade-off is made leaves the stakes feeling entirely theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.5)
    The conflict is entirely internal and low-stakes: a scientist's intellectual and spiritual quest for a new perspective. The pressure is self-imposed concentration, and the "escalation" is a deepening of focus rather than a narrowing of options. While a quiet conflict is valid, the lack of any meaningful opposition, trade-off, or visible price paid for the final insight makes the resolution feel gentle and easily won.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—overcoming internal chaos—is established early and remains the focus. The conflict deepens effectively through the writing process, with the protagonist's agency (the choice to write and confront memory) driving the narrative toward resolution. The final state of peace is earned through the difficult work of processing the initial pain, making the cost of the transformation feel legible and scaled appropriately for the story.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story's central weakness is its lack of meaningful conflict and stakes. The core problem—Elara's adaptation to her loss of smell—is presented as something she has already accomplished before the story begins ("Elara had come to realize..."). The narrative is a placid reflection on a resolved conflict, with no new pressure, escalation, or on-page choice that carries a felt cost. The "trembling calm" is static, never genuinely threatened.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.2)
    The internal stake—overcoming the past to create—is established clearly. The pressure escalates through a deepening of internal focus, culminating in the "held breath" sequence. However, the resolution feels somewhat unearned, as the "whispers carried on the wind" provide the inspiration Kaito seeks. This external intervention lessens the sense that his own agency under pressure was the decisive factor in overcoming the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—reconnecting with an estranged friend—is clear and personal, providing a strong emotional core. The conflict is primarily internal, and the pressure deepens effectively when Lyra discovers the perfume bottle, which transitions her from a state of desperate searching to focused action. The cost is emotional vulnerability, which lands with quiet credibility in the story's final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.8)
    The stakes are cosmically huge but feel entirely abstract. The central conflict lacks any form of opposition, setback, or tangible pressure. Aria simply walks, understands, and succeeds without a struggle. The "crescendo" of the universe's hiccup is an external event that coincides with her success, rather than a point of escalating pressure she must overcome through agency.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—a philosophical quest for understanding—is clear but remains abstract. The pressure is entirely internal, and while the act of counting backwards serves as a deepening of focus, it lacks a tangible sense of rising tension or risk. The resolution (a feeling of peace) arrives without a clearly dramatized trade-off or cost, making the conflict feel low-stakes and its resolution gentle to the point of being inert.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=2.1)
    The story lacks a dramatized conflict or meaningful stakes. The central "conflict" is an intellectual problem—understanding a concept—which is resolved through quiet contemplation without any opposition, setback, or difficult trade-off. The stakes ("revolutionize the way people interacted with their surroundings") are abstract and exist entirely off-page. There is no escalation or tightening; the narrative pressure remains flat from beginning to end, leading to a resolution that feels inevitable and, therefore, weightless.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—finding a way to help her father—is clear, and the internal conflict is present. The escalation, however, is purely conceptual. The discovery of the graffiti "Certainty is a shadow on the wall" serves as the single deepening beat, which is acceptable for this length. However, the pressure feels intellectual rather than visceral, and the resulting cost ("clover melancholy") is stated rather than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central conflict—creating connection from anonymity—is compelling but remains abstract. The stakes are philosophical, and the pressure is static throughout. The narrative deepens the operator's understanding of their purpose rather than escalating the external or internal conflict. The final resolution is an acceptance of the status quo, which is a valid choice for the lens, but the lack of a tangible test or a moment of heightened risk makes the conflict feel low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=2.1)
    Conflict and stakes are almost entirely absent. The central stake—"to preserve the weight of small moments"—is an abstract mission statement, not a goal tested by opposition. There is no escalation, no meaningful tightening of pressure, and no on-page choice with a legible cost. The archivist's internal "pang of melancholy" is resolved without struggle, making the entire narrative feel like a placid observation rather than a story driven by conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central stake—overcoming loneliness—is clear and compelling. The conflict escalates as a deepening of community connection rather than a direct confrontation, which suits the textural drive. The resolution is earned through Raven's agency, and the cost is felt in their bittersweet emotional state at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story establishes a clear internal stake—navigating emotional depths—and escalates pressure texturally, which aligns with the Accumulative lens. The intensification is legible as the musical notes grow louder and sensory details converge into a "single, piercing note." The final resolution is earned by the protagonist's journey, but the sense of cost feels slightly muted because the initial "sorrow and loss" remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—Aria's need to find agency and meaning after a mistake—is established early and pursued consistently. The pressure deepens when she decides to act and the anomaly responds, culminating in a choice driven by her own agency. The resolution is earned under the accumulative lens, but the conflict remains entirely internal and the stakes feel conceptual rather than immediate or threatening.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—giving voice to the unheard—is clear and compelling within the story's quiet framework. Escalation functions texturally by deepening the shared emotional experience, moving from a private moment to a public symphony. The climax delivers a crescendo with a tangible emotional cost, the "joyful sorrow," which provides a satisfying, albeit gentle, resolution. The pressure is atmospheric rather than causal, which aligns perfectly with the chosen narrative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—fulfilling a forgotten promise—is clear, but the conflict remains largely abstract and internal. The escalation, driven by the creation of art, lacks tangible opposition or rising external pressure, fitting an Accumulative lens but feeling low-stakes. The resolution is an emotional insight, but the cost is vague, described as carrying a promise rather than demonstrating a tangible loss or trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central conflict, nurturing a shared dream against the forces of time and fragmentation, is established clearly. Escalation is handled well for an accumulative piece, with the rhythmic drumming creating a rising intensity that deepens the stakes. The cost is made tangible through the feeling of "auroral sorrow," effectively landing the price of the momentary connection.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central stake—proving that whispers travel farther than shouts—is a compelling idea but lacks visceral, on-page pressure. The conflict is passive; the protagonist is never at risk of failing her mission due to opposition or a ticking clock. The story's progression is an accumulation of clues rather than an escalation of stakes, and the resolution arrives through convenient discovery rather than a costly, character-driven choice.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central conflict between "stillwater tension" and "silent empathy" is well-defined and operates as the dominant stake. The pressure deepens effectively under the Accumulative lens as the figure's actions intensify the quiet encounter. The resolution—a momentary connection followed by a return to charged solitude—provides a meaningful shift and lands with the felt cost of ephemeralness, fitting the story's scope and mode.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=3.1)
    Conflict and stakes are almost entirely absent. The opposition is a vague "status quo" that offers no resistance, and the "humble rebellion" encounters no obstacles. Elian conceives a plan and it succeeds perfectly. The lack of a single meaningful tightening or on-page test of his commitment renders the resolution unearned and removes all tension from the story.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.5)
    The internal stake—Kael’s quest for freedom—is established early and remains the focus. The escalation, driven by the whale's call, functions as a decisive deepening of pressure under an accumulative lens, forcing a clear choice. The cost of this choice (detaching from the past) is thematically clear, but its impact feels somewhat smooth and tranquil, slightly undercutting the tension implied by a term like "combative tenderness."

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story establishes a clear, dominant internal stake: Echo's struggle against an "emotional void." The conflict is appropriately scaled for the length, and the discovery of the bouquet provides the single, meaningful deepening required, altering the content of Echo's narrations and intensifying their longing. The cost of this engagement is felt in the sadness articulated in the final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake in artistic liberation is clear and deepens effectively under the accumulative lens, with Lyra’s choice to "surrender to the muse" serving as a meaningful turn with a legible cost (the dissolution of old boundaries).

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=2.1)
    This is the story's most significant weakness. There is no discernible conflict or meaningful stakes. The central idea—celebrating imperfection—is presented without opposition. The glassblower's acceptance is immediate and without resistance, meaning there is no pressure, no escalation, and no choice that carries a tangible cost. The narrative arc is flat because it lacks any tension to resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=2.1)
    There is a near-total absence of conflict or meaningful stakes. The protagonist's journey is frictionless; they explore, discover, and feel fulfilled without encountering any obstacle, opposition, or internal resistance. The central goal is never threatened, resulting in a complete lack of tension and a narrative that reads as a pleasant but undramatic vignette rather than a story with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—overcoming grief to rediscover creative purpose—is established early and remains the focus. Pressure escalates as the origami figures begin to work and the curtains illuminate, creating a moment of focused intensity that compels the creation of the final piece. This action serves as the story's meaningful turn, crystallizing the protagonist's shift. The resolution is earned within the story's internal logic, though the conflict lacks external pressure or complex setbacks.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story establishes a clear intellectual stake: mapping cultural patterns in a chaotic world. Within the Accumulative lens, pressure effectively deepens as the cartomancer's focus intensifies and her connection to the cards evolves. The cost is the night of dedicated, isolating labor, which is legible and earns the final insight, but the conflict remains entirely internal and lacks a sharp, decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—the pursuit of forbidden knowledge—is signaled early and tightens when the pagoda is introduced, shifting the conflict from intellectual to experiential. This turn effectively raises the personal cost, leading to the "anguished joy." However, the conflict's resolution feels somewhat frictionless, as the magical solution works without any depicted struggle or setback.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—preserving hope against a creeping psychic darkness—is established early. The conflict escalates as the protagonist's research deepens her understanding of the threat's pervasiveness. The final realization acts as a decisive deepening, forcing a shift from passive study to active purpose, with the cost being the burden of this new knowledge and mission.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.5)
    The internal conflict is present, but the stakes are significantly blunted by the undefined nature of the inciting "con." Without knowing what was lost or what external pressures exist, Lena's struggle for a new "sense of purpose" lacks immediate, tangible stakes. The pressure accumulates atmospherically but never tightens into a moment that forecloses a specific, meaningful path with a sharp, visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=3.5)
    The central conflict—Elian versus the earth—is static and lacks escalation. The digging progresses without any meaningful obstacles, setbacks, or choices that raise the stakes; the earth simply "yield[s]." The pressure remains flat from the moment the tunneling begins to the moment it succeeds, undercutting any sense of a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding the theater's secrets—is clear, but the conflict remains entirely atmospheric and lacks tangible pressure on the protagonist. Escalation occurs as a deepening of a vision ("the atmosphere thickening"), but the character is a passive observer. The resolution is achieved through reception of knowledge, not a costly choice, which limits the sense of earnedness and tension.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant internal stake—freeing creativity—is signaled early and remains the focus. Under the accumulative lens, the intensification of the aurora and the dreamer's connection serve as a form of escalation. However, the opposing force ("doubts and fears") is an abstraction mentioned in backstory rather than an active pressure within the scene, which softens the conflict's immediacy and the cost of the final victory.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—cultivating dormant potential in a ruined world—is signaled early and pursued consistently. The conflict escalates under an Accumulative lens as Asa channels more energy, culminating in her merging with the dune. This peak moment carries a clear, on-page cost (loss of self) that makes the final resolution feel earned and impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.8)
    The internal stake—understanding his consciousness—is clear. The escalation is a simple intensification of a sensory experience ("hum grew louder... became a roar") rather than a narrowing of options. The peak conflict, the threat of being "consumed," provides a moment of tension and a legible cost, but the overall pressure feels linear and lacks the complexity of a truly challenging conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—the quest for "unused courage"—is signaled early and consistently held. For an accumulative story, the escalation works well, intensifying at the vigil where the star stamp marks an irreversible commitment. This act deepens the stakes and makes the cost of their journey—leaving the mundane world behind—legible and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story successfully maintains pressure on a single, dominant internal stake: reconciling the cost of safety. The escalation is textural—a deepening of contemplation spurred by the arrival of the second figure. The resolution is an act of endurance (Earned Stasis) that forecloses the path of rebellion with a clear, established cost (loss of voice/identity), fitting the story's meditative, non-causal drive.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—unmasking the pretender—is established early and remains the focus. Pressure escalates via the approaching celestial alignment, providing a clear deadline. However, the final conflict lacks tension as the pretender is entirely passive; they arrive, Kael speaks, and they crumble. There is no on-page struggle or adaptation, making the climax feel more like an execution of a foregone conclusion than a genuine confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story establishes a clear, dominant internal stake: Maya's need to understand the disappearing paths. The pressure deepens not through external events but through the failure of her scientific methods, which constitutes a meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens. The resolution is earned by her shift in approach, with the cost being the forfeiture of a data-driven, provable answer for a more profound, intuitive one.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story establishes a clear internal stake and escalates pressure effectively through the accumulation of sensory detail, fitting the narrative lens. The climactic deepening at the stone circle forces a stance crystallization that is earned by the protagonist's agency and carries an unmistakable on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the central stake is clear, the conflict is procedural and lacks significant pressure. The main obstacle—the cryptic script—is overcome too conveniently by the protagonist's special ability, feeling more like a key fitting a lock than a genuine struggle. The resolution is earned through action, but the absence of meaningful opposition or a tangible price paid makes the success feel inevitable and low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant internal stake—finding peace in the face of traumatic memory—is signaled early and remains the focus. The pressure of her past is palpable, and the narrative demonstrates a meaningful deepening of her condition, culminating in a stance crystallization. The resolution is earned through her engagement with the environment, though the escalation feels more passive and receptive than driven by high-stakes choices.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story establishes a clear internal stake—overcoming creative despair—and deepens it effectively under an accumulative lens. The pressure builds as the artist's perception shifts through the act of untangling the threads, leading to a decisive stance crystallization. The cost, embracing a "luminescent ache," is made legible, and the resolution is earned by the protagonist's internal agency, foreclosing her prior state of hopelessness.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story signals a dual stake: tracking a person and understanding a metaphysical phenomenon. The pressure deepens appropriately as Kael closes in. The central failure is that the resolution comes at no cost. Kael achieves both goals without sacrifice, which deflates the tension retroactively and makes the climax feel convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes a single, dominant stake—disrupting a complacent society—and escalates pressure through one meaningful tightening when Aria reads the letter. Her subsequent choice to disseminate the information forecloses her path of passive observance and carries a visible cost in the form of societal chaos and personal risk. This escalation is decisive and drives the narrative to its potent conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks meaningful, on-page conflict or escalation. The primary stake—maintaining a sanctuary—is declared but never tested within the scene. The external chaos is a static backdrop, and the internal conflict is presented as already resolved. Without a meaningful turn or a moment of pressure that forces a choice, the narrative feels flat and devoid of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    The conflict and stakes are spiritual and internal, fitting the Accumulative lens perfectly. Pressure escalates through an increasing density of sensory and energetic phenomena—the shifting constellations, the gathering energy, the vibrating ground—rather than external opposition. This textural intensification effectively raises the stakes for the fisher's single, decisive act of "voicing silence," which resolves the central desire with earned agency.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—the fate of the Wychwood legacy—is established early and remains the focus. The pressure, while internal, is sustained. The narrative deepens effectively when Adelaide moves from a vague desire to intervene to a specific methodological commitment, an act of agency that gives her a path forward and makes the final cost feel accepted and real.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—resolving the protagonist's internal "dissonance of old guilt"—is established and serves as the story's core. The conflict escalates effectively when "time began to fold in on itself," creating a moment of tangible crisis that forces her to act. The resolution provides a sense of peace, but the cost is purely internal (confronting turmoil), which feels less weighty and visible than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.5)
    The internal stake—finding meaning amid uncertainty—is signaled early and remains the focus. Pressure escalates texturally as the whispers and mist intensify, cohering with the chosen lens. The final choice to "interject one final change" constitutes a meaningful turn that leads directly to the resolution, and the cost of accepting the lingering unease is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming hope from despair—is signaled early and remains the focus. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the pressure builds coherently as Aria's internal state deepens, culminating in a decisive choice to act. While the conflict is primarily internal, the renaming provides an on-page turn that externalizes her stance crystallization with the felt cost of her ongoing mission.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—Echo's quest for peace against the chaos of her fractured memories—is established early and pursued consistently. The pressure escalates effectively under the accumulative lens, with the garden's transformation and the growing intensity of the echoes serving as a meaningful deepening of the conflict. The resolution is earned through Echo's agency in weaving the echoes, and the final state of peace is achieved at the felt cost of confronting her powerful nostalgia.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Luna's need to find a new creative method—is established early and drives the narrative. The pressure is primarily internal, and the intensification happens through a layering of sensations rather than escalating external opposition. The "tightening" brought on by the static shock is effective but feels more like a fortunate accident than a consequence of Luna's direct agency, slightly weakening the earnedness of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=3.1)
    The story's primary weakness is its lack of meaningful conflict or stakes. The desire "to become the voice of the unknown" is established but never meets resistance, internal or external. Phrases like "Aria was undaunted" explicitly dismiss potential for tension. Without a credible test of her resolve or a significant price paid, the narrative progression lacks pressure, and the resolution feels inevitable rather than achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict and stakes are entirely abstract and internal, lacking any tangible opposition or pressure. The "escalation" is merely a description of progress ("the truth began to unravel") rather than a tightening of options or a raising of costs. The resolution is an intellectual realization without a preceding crucible moment or a visibly paid price.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant internal stake—to find unused courage—is signaled early and remains the focus. The confrontation with the mysterious figure creates a moment of genuine tension and forces a meaningful choice to step forward despite trepidation, serving as the story's one clear tightening. However, the opposition remains entirely internal and spectral, which slightly lessens the immediacy of the stakes, and the resolution feels too frictionless to fully satisfy the build-up of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story establishes a clear internal stake: achieving a state of distilled truth. The pressure builds texturally through the prolonged, patient wait in the fog. The cadence shift when "the rain gutters...slowly stopped ticking" serves as a meaningful deepening, creating a charged stillness just before the climax. While the external conflict is nil, the internal pressure is coherent and resolves with the arrival of the traveler, making the final serenity feel earned after the cost of the long wait.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding resistance to change—is conceptual but consistently held. The escalation functions well under the accumulative lens, with the thrumming and observation of the smoke acting as a deepening of pressure that leads to the final insight. This shift in knowledge reweights her understanding and resolves the internal conflict with an earned, on-page realization, which serves as the key turn.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant internal stake—finding meaning in cyclical decay—is signaled early and deepens effectively under the accumulative pressure of the scene. The gardener’s agency is demonstrated in the choice to "instill" a new purpose into their work. While the escalation is coherent for this lens, the final cost is subtle and conceptual, lacking the unmistakable, on-page price that would elevate it to the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.0)
    The conflict is effectively internalized, with the stake being Lyra's ability to integrate her past and forge a future. Following an accumulative structure, pressure coheres and deepens steadily through her contemplation. The final shift in understanding feels like a legitimate culmination of this internal work, with the "lifting" of the weight representing a clear, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a clear internal stake: Lena's search for connection. The pressure deepens effectively when the arrival of the artists presents an unexpected opportunity for action, forcing her to move from passive pondering to active participation. Her choice to contribute the twig is a meaningful turn that makes the final resolution feel earned within the story's gentle framework.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dominant stake—outwitting cosmic tricksters—is clear but abstract. The "tricksters" are an undefined force offering no meaningful resistance, making the conflict feel static. The resolution is so immediate and total that it completely deflates any built tension. There is no cost associated with the victory, which renders the stakes weightless in retrospect.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—finding the vital key—is signaled early and drives the action. There is a clear tightening of pressure at the locked door. The central weakness is the resolution, which comes without a significant price; Lyra gains a profound insight and is cured of her phobia at the minimal cost of feeling wistful, which deflates the accumulated tension and makes the success feel too easy.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant internal stake—overcoming emotional numbness to awaken empathy—is signaled early and remains the focus. The pressure escalates appropriately for an Accumulative story, deepening through conversation rather than external action. The artist's decision to confront her own pain is a clear turning point, but the resolution feels somewhat soft, with the cost of this newfound empathy being stated rather than shown with lasting consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story establishes a clear stake—uncovering a hidden truth—and successfully escalates it from familial honor to personal identity. The tightening occurs when Emilia realizes the coded stanzas may refer to her, which is a solid turn. However, the pressure remains largely atmospheric and internal, and the final confrontation with the conflict is deferred, leaving the climax as a statement of intent rather than a decisive, costly action.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.5)
    The internal conflict—the fiddler's burden of unspoken secrets versus the possibility of redemption—is well-established and serves as the dominant stake. The discovery of the scaffold-wrap pattern provides a meaningful deepening, shifting the character from passive contemplation to the active choice of playing music. The resolution is earned within the story's lyrical framework, with the cost being the release of past trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake is internal: whether Kael can find meaning in his failure. While the story follows an accumulative structure appropriate for this stake, the pressure is uniformly low. The resolution feels preordained rather than won. There is no single moment of tightening or a difficult choice; Kael simply wanders, reflects, and arrives at a neat conclusion without facing any narrative friction or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.0)
    The internal conflict—Lyra's struggle against a daunting task—is established, and the stakes are clear, if abstract ("alleviating the burdens of the present"). The story executes a single, meaningful deepening when Lyra's reflection on shared burdens gives her a "fresh perspective." The resolution is earned within the story's quiet, internal logic, but the pressure never feels particularly acute or the outcome truly in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.5)
    The central stake—to discover what mirrors don't show—is clear, but the conflict lacks progressive escalation. The druid moves through the environment without facing tangible opposition until the "frozen confession" appears. This discovery serves as the single point of intensification, but the resolution is delivered by the mirror cracking, an external event, rather than a costly choice made by the protagonist under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—unraveling the topiary's mystery—is established early and pursued consistently. The pressure deepens effectively as Aria enters the maze and the "hedges seemed to close in around her," narrowing the world to the path. The climax at the tree resolves this stake, but the escalation is more atmospheric than a series of choices with compounding costs. The resolution is earned by her persistence, and the final image clearly articulates the new, larger stake she now faces.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=3.9)
    The story signals a high-stakes internal conflict ("bartered destinies," "darkness within her") but fails to dramatize it with escalating pressure. The resolution arrives via a vaguely defined spell that meets no resistance, making the protagonist's success feel preordained rather than earned. The absence of any potential for failure or a meaningful trade-off renders the conflict static and the conclusion weightless.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.7)
    The story establishes a clear internal stake: finding purpose versus succumbing to stagnation. The phone call provides a single, meaningful deepening of this conflict, forcing Jack to engage with the professional life he's uncertain about. The resolution, however, feels less like an earned victory from escalating pressure and more like a sudden decision, which lessens the impact of the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=2.5)
    While a dominant stake—reestablishing a connection between worlds—is clearly signaled, the story contains no meaningful conflict or escalation. Elara faces no opposition, obstacle, or setback. The resolution is achieved through quiet contemplation without a single trade-off or price paid on the page. The absence of escalating pressure or a tangible antagonist force makes the final success feel predetermined and hollow.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=2.5)
    A central conflict is declared—preserving wonder against the mundane—but it is never dramatized. The librarian exists in a state of post-conflict serenity, having already embraced contradictions. Consequently, there is no escalation, no pressure, and no on-page test of the stated stakes. The story describes a resolution without ever presenting the problem, making the entire narrative feel inert.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=3.2)
    The internal stake—overcoming isolation—is signaled but never faces a concrete test. There is no meaningful escalation or tightening of pressure; the character moves from one realization to the next without opposition, setback, or a difficult trade-off. Conflict is asserted ("the process was not a simple one") but never dramatized, leaving the resolution feeling inert.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara's quest for self-forgiveness—is established early and remains central. The conflict is entirely internal, escalating when "memories, long suppressed, now rose to the surface," which serves as a meaningful deepening of pressure. This prompts the lament on the accordion, and the resolution is an earned shift in her perspective, with the felt cost being the acceptance of perpetual uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—to find the library of unspoken words—is established early and resolved thematically. However, the conflict is entirely internal and lacks tangible opposition or escalating pressure. The journey is a linear series of discoveries without meaningful setbacks or choices that foreclose other paths, which lessens the tension leading up to the final revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=3.8)
    The central conflict—"a dream... against the weight of an empire"—is stated but never dramatized, remaining entirely abstract and inert. There is no escalation of pressure; the conflict is a static internal summary. The story bypasses any meaningful test of Elian's commitment, resolving the tension with a sudden internal decision that lacks an on-page trigger or a specific, immediate cost.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.8)
    The internal stake—capturing beauty before oblivion—is potent and well-defined. Pressure escalates effectively as the "threshold of stillness" draws closer, forcing Aria to deepen her focus. The climax, her successful infusion of the gem, provides a meaningful resolution that reweights her relationship with death at a clear emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=2.1)
    Conflict and stakes are nearly nonexistent. The dominant stake, "to find the source of contentment," is entirely internal and abstract, facing no opposition or meaningful obstacle. There is no escalation of pressure; Aria simply thinks until she arrives at an answer. The resolution comes without any visible cost, trade-off, or sacrifice, rendering the character's journey dramatically inert.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—resolving the client's "cloak of doubt"—is clear. The story features a meaningful deepening when the conscience realizes the problem is suffocating *certainty*, not doubt. This conceptual shift provides the necessary escalation for a textural piece. The final cost, a moment of personal vulnerability, is legible and connects to the story's core tension, though the lack of on-page struggle mutes the overall pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=2.1)
    The story lacks meaningful conflict or stakes. The central challenge—teaching the student—unfolds without any opposition, doubt, or failure. The student is a perfectly receptive vessel, and the researcher is an infallible guide, rendering the process a smooth transmission rather than a dramatic struggle. Tension is asserted ("the trance deepened") but never dramatized through on-page obstacles or rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—achieving navigation without movement—is clear, and the conflict with the "unmoored" pulse provides a focal point. However, the pressure is uniform and the escalation is minimal. The process of attunement is described as a gradual success without setbacks or moments of genuine doubt, which flattens the tension and makes the final earned stasis feel less hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—Eira's creative stagnation—is internal and clear, but the on-page conflict lacks tension. The central action of unstrapping the keystone is described as requiring "great care," but no risk of failure or negative consequence is ever dramatized. The absence of tangible opposition or a meaningful trade-off makes the escalation feel flat and the resolution low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story's central weakness is its lack of meaningful conflict or stakes. The protagonist's quest is unopposed; he finds the key object immediately and faces no internal or external obstacles. Atmospheric tension is built but never translates into a genuine test or a choice with a visible cost, making the final resolution feel entirely passive and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake: deciphering the prophecy to "wavelength align with purpose." The conflict is largely internal and atmospheric, which fits the lens. The distillation process serves as a single, sustained deepening of pressure, culminating in a resolution. However, the stakes feel somewhat abstract, and the resolution lacks the punch of a hard-won victory or a deeply felt cost beyond a conceptual shift.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—the reaper's struggle with eternal grief—is established early. The story deepens this stake by connecting personal loss to a universal "echo of sacrifice," which functions as the narrative's central turn. However, the conflict remains largely static and internal; the process of crystallizing the echoes lacks tangible risk or opposition, making the escalation feel more like a meditative exercise than a high-stakes confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is virtually absent. The mage faces no meaningful opposition or internal struggle during the ritual, which proceeds smoothly and hypnotically toward a successful conclusion. The stakes, a "cosmic imbalance," are declared but never dramatized, leaving them feeling abstract and low-impact. There is no escalation of pressure, merely a depiction of a process, which fundamentally lacks tension.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=3.5)
    The stakes—to "expunge the pain" and heal a community—are large but remain entirely abstract and internal to the warden's mission statement. The story lacks any form of opposition, complication, or meaningful escalation under its accumulative lens. The pressure is static and atmospheric; the warden's journey is a linear progression of intent without any on-page test or trade-off, resulting in a complete absence of narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant internal stake—harmonizing logic and intuition—is signaled early and coherently deepened. The experiment with the flame serves as the one meaningful tightening required at this length, leading to a new level of knowledge. The cost is conceptual rather than tangible, which fits the story's tone, but the pressure remains gentle throughout, lacking a moment of genuine risk or potential failure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving trust and ensuring mission success—is clearly signaled. The conflict is primarily an internal struggle against a complex task, and pressure deepens as Lyra works toward her breakthrough. While the escalation is coherent for a textural piece, the stakes remain somewhat abstract as the danger and the peers she serves are entirely off-page, which lessens the visceral tension.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.8)
    The internal stake—overcoming emotional numbness—is clear. The pressure escalates texturally ("the air around him began to vibrate"), fulfilling the requirement for an Accumulative lens. However, the conflict's resolution lacks a tangible, on-page cost; the pain of the past is framed as a "distant memory," which diminishes the price paid in the moment of closure and makes the release feel less earned.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=4.1)
    The conflict is entirely internal and lacks tangible stakes or escalating pressure. The mystery is framed as a potential "prank" or "opportunity," which diffuses any sense of urgency. The resolution is achieved not by overcoming an obstacle but by a smooth, unimpeded burst of inspiration. There is no meaningful tightening of options or visible cost paid to achieve the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake: restoring lost laughter. The conflict between the Maestro's performance and the oppressive silence escalates effectively, moving from cacophony to melody, then from whispers to a hum, and finally to laughter. The cost is visible in the Maestro's exhaustion, providing a sufficient, if simple, sense of consequence for this textural piece.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—the guardian's internal struggle with responsibility and uncertainty—is signaled early and remains the focus. Pressure escalates atmospherically, culminating in a deepening of knowledge during her reverie. The resolution is driven by her choice to engage with the mist, but the stakes feel entirely internal, lacking a concrete external test or price beyond the shift in her emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—breaking free from a "stifling destiny"—is established early and held throughout. The narrative shows a single, meaningful tightening of pressure as the experiment reaches its crescendo. The resolution is driven by the protagonist's agency, but the stakes feel somewhat abstract and the cost of success is not made legible, which lessens the impact of the final victory.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=4.1)
    Conflict and stakes are the story's most significant weakness. The dominant stake—to uncover a hidden truth—is purely intellectual and lacks any tangible risk or consequence for the protagonist. There is no antagonistic force, meaningful obstacle, or pressure that requires a costly choice. The escalation is a simple progression of discovery without any corresponding increase in jeopardy, resulting in a narrative that feels tensionless and predetermined.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the ferry's mystery—is signaled early and effectively deepens into a personal, cosmic quest. The escalation is achieved through a single, clear turn based on Elara's agency in exploring the grotto. While the ultimate stakes feel somewhat abstract and out of scale for the character we meet, the pressure coheres and forces a stance crystallization with a legible cost at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    The internal conflict—the search for "rational enchantment"—escalates effectively through the textural intensification of the weaving and the gallery's response. A clear climax is reached when the gallery erupts, and the cost is legible in the protagonist's altered memories and lingering "unsettling calm." The pressure build is coherent and sufficient for this lens and length, creating a palpable sense of approaching a precipice.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=2.0)
    Conflict and stakes are declared but never dramatized. The central "conflict" is overcoming humanity's former ignorance, which is resolved frictionlessly within a single lesson. There are no obstacles, reversals, or tangible costs, resulting in a complete lack of tension and a stake that remains purely abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—the woman's unresolved grief—is established and resolved within the scene. The pressure is primarily atmospheric and emotional, fitting the textural drive. The story achieves a meaningful deepening when Aria realizes the connection between the photograph and the ghost she's tracking. The resolution is earned within the story's gentle logic, but the conflict lacks any real friction or risk for the protagonist; the outcome feels assured from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.1)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake (retrieve codex, escape) and a coherent external pressure (the turning tide). However, the central conflict is resolved by narrative fiat, as the impassable lock puzzle is simply ignored. This deflates the tension at a crucial moment. The final escape, while conceptually tense, occurs without any on-page struggle or trade-off, weakening the sense of an earned victory.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake is internal—Akira's search for meaning in the face of mortality. The conflict escalates appropriately for a textural piece through a deepening of understanding, rather than a sequence of external events. The crucial shift in her goal from "uncovering secrets" to "fetching wisdom" serves as the story's single meaningful turn, reweighting the stakes and leading to the final earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving the essence of a dying language—is signaled clearly and provides a strong conceptual pressure. Under the accumulative lens, the conflict escalates effectively through intensification rather than direct confrontation; the storyteller begins to "harness their power," and the "canyon's echoes responded, swelling in a crescendo." The resolution is earned within this framework, and the cost (the loss of the old language and the storyteller's voice) feels proportionate to the act of creation.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding the strange occurrences—is signaled early and undergoes a meaningful deepening. The conflict escalates from an external investigation to an internal confrontation with a terrifying reality ("harmony untamed"). The realization that this power requires confronting one's inner darkness effectively reweights the stakes and provides a clear, felt cost for Lena's new resolve at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=3.1)
    The central conflict is inert. The stake—freeing the statues—is clear, but there is no escalation, opposition, or meaningful struggle. Luna plays her violin and the magic simply works without complication or resistance, making the resolution feel like a foregone conclusion rather than an earned victory. Pressure is nonexistent.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—safe delivery across a patrolled border—is clear and established early. The story achieves a moment of tightening at the border as the mailman waits for the drone to pass, showing protagonist agency. However, the resolution of this pressure point feels too convenient, hinging on an external "stray signal" rather than a costly choice or clever application of the mailman's skills, which slightly undermines the earnedness of the success.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central stake—to find meaning in silence—is established early and pursued with agency. Under the Accumulative lens, the conflict deepens effectively from quiet work to a haunting search and finally to a transformative encounter. The resolution is earned through the carpenter's choice to follow the sound and interpret the experience, with the cost being the acceptance of a beautiful mystery instead of a concrete answer. The pressure is textural and emotional, and it escalates coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—reawakening the stories—is established early, and the pressure deepens appropriately for an accumulative structure. The conflict is entirely internal, a "slow, painstaking process" against the dormancy of the narratives. While coherent, the stakes lack significant weight or a clear sense of what is lost upon failure, making the librarian's "urgency" feel intellectually motivated rather than viscerally necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.1)
    The conflict is entirely internal and static, defined by the abstract goal of capturing a dream. There is no meaningful escalation or tightening of pressure; Elian's routine is depicted as an unchanging loop. The stakes remain conceptual and never face a concrete on-page test or threat, resulting in a lack of narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central conflict is underdeveloped. The opposition—"protective mechanisms" and a "thickening" atmosphere—is abstract and feels more like an atmospheric effect than a tangible obstacle that forces adaptation or difficult choices. While a cost is felt at the resolution, the escalation lacks teeth, reading as a single, gentle intensification rather than a genuine struggle that tests the protagonist's limits.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—recovering stolen memories—is signaled early and effectively. The pressure deepens decisively when Emilia finds the mushroom, transforming an abstract legend into a tangible, high-stakes quest. This is a meaningful intensification appropriate for an accumulative structure. The resolution lands with a clear, felt cost in the form of the "weight" and "uncertainty" of the journey ahead, making the stakes resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—reversing the exile—is established early and provides a clear throughline. The conflict is primarily internal, a struggle against the shadow's complexity, which fits the story's intimate scale. The escalation is a single, powerful deepening of intensity as the archivist’s annotations grow "more fervent." The discovery of the hidden pattern serves as the pivotal turn, changing knowledge and leading to a resolution earned through focused agency.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.8)
    While the stakes—restoring a dying landscape—are high, the conflict is inert. The "parched earth" is a passive condition, not an active opposition. Aria faces no obstacles, no setbacks, and no moments of doubt or potential failure. The escalation is a smooth, unopposed magical process, which drains the narrative of tension and makes the successful resolution feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central conflict is subtle but clear, escalating effectively under the accumulative lens as the silence deepens with each unraveled knot. The stake—grounding the restless spirits—is signaled early and resolved through the protagonist's sustained agency. The final feeling of "lucid unrest" serves as a legible, if quiet, cost for her success.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=4.2)
    The central conflict—uncovering the henge’s secrets—lacks meaningful escalation. The process of discovery is presented as a smooth, frictionless progression without obstacles, setbacks, or difficult trade-offs. The stakes are entirely conceptual, and because the struggle is not dramatized, the final resolution feels like a foregone conclusion rather than a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story effectively builds pressure through the accumulation of knowledge rather than direct confrontation. The central stake—understanding "letting go"—is consistently deepened by each discovery, from the logbook to the untangled net. The cost is intellectual and emotional, "the weight of my discoveries," which is a fitting price for an internal journey.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—to communicate with an ephemeral entity—is established early and pursued consistently. Under the Accumulative lens, the conflict escalates effectively as the storm's intensity mirrors the "frenzied" pace of the balladeer's creation, tightening the emotional pressure. The resolution is earned through her agency, and the cost is felt in the vulnerability and creative energy she expends to achieve a moment of connection.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding the diary's secrets—is clear, but the conflict remains low-pressure and internal. The escalation is a gentle deepening of emotional understanding rather than a tightening of options or a raising of external stakes. The resolution is an earned insight, fitting the story's quiet mode, but the lack of significant opposition or tangible cost keeps the tension muted.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—proving that meaning persists through chaos—is internal and philosophical. However, under the Accumulative lens, the pressure fails to meaningfully deepen. The story establishes a contemplative mood but maintains it without significant intensification or a moment of genuine crisis. The resolution, therefore, feels more like a gentle arrival than a hard-won crystallization of stance against mounting internal resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.9)
    The central stake—creating a piece of lasting beauty against imminent destruction—is clear and compelling. The pressure escalates effectively through the "pre-demolition stillness" and the final arrival of the demolition crew. The conflict is primarily situational and thematic rather than driven by character choice, but the tightening of the timeframe forces the story to a potent conclusion with the loss of the library as an undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central conflict is a clear 'person versus mystery,' with a dominant stake in making a great discovery. The pressure deepens effectively as Eli moves from a strange light to a decipherable code to a complete map, changing their knowledge and options. While the escalation is coherent, the stakes remain purely intellectual and aspirational, lacking immediate external pressure or a tangible sense of loss if Eli were to fail, which keeps the tension moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.5)
    The central stake—learning the "rhythm of repair"—is abstract and never faces a concrete on-page test. The conflict is minimal, presenting as a simple search-and-find mission with no meaningful opposition, setbacks, or rising pressure. The progression from clue to resolution is frictionless, undercutting any sense of tension or earned victory; the resolution arrives without the protagonist having to make a difficult choice or pay a price.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=2.1)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent. Past hardships are mentioned, but the story's present action is entirely frictionless; Aria's plan is proposed and executed without opposition, error, or consequence. The stakes—nourishing the planet—are grand but abstract, and are never placed under any genuine threat. The lack of a meaningful escalation or a single on-page test of the settlers' commitment renders the narrative inert.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are cosmic ("balance of time itself") and effectively anchored to the adjuster's internal conflict against the "weight of their responsibility." The story achieves a single, meaningful deepening of pressure as the light fades and the task concludes, which aligns well with an Accumulative structure. The cost is the emotional burden, which is made legible and then resolved into a quiet pride at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—guiding lost travelers—is clear, but the conflict lacks meaningful escalation. The caretaker finds the blueprint and successfully implements its instructions without significant setbacks or complications. The antagonistic forces (mechanical birds, impending frost) are introduced but do not apply tangible pressure; the birds merely observe and the frost is a last-minute time constraint that doesn't force a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.2)
    The internal stake—resolving grief and finding a way to honor her sister—is clear and compelling. Pressure effectively deepens with the sight of the chrysalis, which sharpens her feelings of loss and transformation. The resolution, driven by her insight, feels earned within the story's accumulative logic, and the cost of her "divergent path" is legible. The conflict progresses coherently from a state of sorrow to one of purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—understanding the bottle's secret—is established early and intensifies effectively. The central conflict is internal but lands with a clear, decisive choice: Ember renounces the destructive path of "incising" for a more patient one. This choice forecloses an option and has a legible cost (forgoing immediate knowledge), which successfully deepens the stake and drives the resolution under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara's struggle to process collective remorse without being overwhelmed—is established early and tested directly. The escalation at the pavilion provides a single, meaningful tightening of pressure. The resolution is earned through her demonstrated resilience, but the internal battle feels slightly muted, preventing the stakes from feeling viscerally life-altering, even though the conceptual cost is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.0)
    This is the story's critical weakness; there is a premise for conflict but no actual on-page conflict. The grain elevator is "willing to talk" immediately, which dissolves all tension and removes any sense of stakes. The narrative is static, proceeding as a pleasant dance rather than a struggle, and the resolution is foregone from the moment the conversation begins, lacking any escalation or meaningful opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—recovering lost memories—is established early and pursued with clear agency. The conflict escalates internally as a deepening of Elara's psychic entanglement, which is appropriate for the Accumulative lens. The cost of "losing herself" is named but feels somewhat abstract and is resolved with too much ease, lacking the visceral price that would make the final transformation feel more hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—finding the forgotten knowledge—is signaled early and resolved. The pressure of the one-hour time limit provides a clear tightening. However, the conflict lacks significant opposition; the archivist overcomes the challenges of the grotto without any real struggle or setback. The cost is conceptual ("the weight of her discovery"), which is valid, but it feels intellectually understood rather than viscerally earned through a difficult on-page trial.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=4.8)
    The central stake—creating felt music in a silent world—is clear, but the conflict remains static. There is no meaningful escalation; the discovery of the insulator is a convenient opportunity, not a complication that forces a harder choice or raises the cost. The sculptor's path to success is smooth and unopposed, which limits the tension and payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.5)
    The central stake—overcoming despair to find a new purpose—is clear but remains entirely internal and low-friction. The pressure deepens gradually rather than escalating through sharp turns, which fits the textural lens. However, the resolution feels frictionless, lacking a moment of genuine crisis or a trade-off with a significant, visible cost to make the final hope feel hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will violate her friend’s trust for knowledge—is established but never genuinely tested. There is no escalation of pressure. The conflict is resolved instantly and without cost or struggle via a magical ability that negates the obstacle entirely. A story about empathy completely avoids dramatizing the difficult choice at its heart, resulting in a static conflict and a resolution that feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story establishes a philosophical stake—unlocking secrets and finding wisdom—but fails to support it with meaningful conflict. There are no tangible obstacles, opposing forces, or setbacks. Pressure does not escalate; Lyra simply waits patiently for an external event to occur. The conflict is static, lacking any turn or tightening that forces a difficult choice or raises the cost. The resolution is achieved through passive observation rather than protagonist agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—discovering the source of resilience—is signaled early, but the conflict lacks significant pressure. Lyra is portrayed as so competent and her ship so effective ("responded smoothly") that the environmental challenges feel perfunctory rather than genuinely threatening. The gravity inversion acts more as a key to unlock the next step than an escalating complication, resulting in a resolution that feels earned by competence but not by struggle against meaningful opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—understanding the crash to prevent future ones—is signaled early and remains the focus. The conflict is primarily intellectual. A single, meaningful deepening occurs when the investigator observes the wind's complex adaptation, which raises the intellectual stakes and complicates a simple explanation for the crash. The cost is felt conceptually at the end: the weight of responsibility and the lonely burden of ensuring the lessons are learned.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story establishes a clear, if abstract, stake: successfully unfettering the "sculpted hush." The pressure escalates texturally toward the climactic moment of the chisel strike, creating a focused point of tension. However, the conflict is entirely artistic and lacks any significant opposition or potential for failure, making the resolution feel preordained. The successful outcome is achieved without a deeply felt cost or trade-off, limiting the stakes' resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.5)
    The internal stake of seeking understanding is clear and deepens during the mystical ordeal, where the music becomes "both beautiful and terrifying." However, the conflict's resolution lacks a legible cost. The journey yields "insights" and a positive transformation, making the preceding turmoil feel like a trial with a guaranteed reward rather than a conflict with a genuine price, which keeps the stakes from feeling truly sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a clear, high-concept stake: understanding the mathematics of emotion. The pressure escalates effectively via an external constraint—the vanishing stars—which provides a concrete timeframe and a sense of cosmic urgency. The final choice to accept the terrifying implications of success is earned, and the cost is felt in the starless, silent world Echo embraces.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant internal stake—Eira's anxiety versus her quest for wonder—is well-defined. The narrative escalates effectively for its accumulative lens, with the mystical encounter serving as a decisive deepening of the emotional stakes. The protagonist's receptive agency feels earned and appropriate for the tone.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.5)
    The internal stake—to uncover a profound truth—is clear, but the conflict lacks meaningful escalation. The mystic's progress is a smooth intensification of awareness without any tangible opposition, doubt, or setback. The central turn, the shattering of assumptions, occurs without a visible price, making the resolution feel less earned than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—bridging the "raveling silence"—is established early and remains the focus. The conflict is primarily internal, and the narrative provides a single, meaningful deepening of resolve when the act of completing the puzzle crystallizes the spinner's purpose. While this turn is effective for a story of this length, the pressure feels entirely atmospheric rather than escalating through progressively narrowing options or tangible consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—crafting a remarkable sword—is signaled early and pursued with focus. The conflict is primarily internal and process-oriented, fitting the story's tone. The arrival of the apprentice provides a meaningful deepening of the stakes, shifting the focus from the object's creation to the creator's legacy. The cost is the forfeiture of solitude, a price made clear and felt in the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=4.2)
    The dominant stake—uncovering a withheld truth—is signaled early and consistently. However, the pressure is described rather than felt, consisting of a "kaleidoscope of images and sensations that threatened to overwhelm her senses." The escalation is a linear accumulation of vague experiences, not a tightening of options or a meaningful turn. Because the resolution is a purely internal, abstract revelation withheld from the reader, the stakes are never truly tested or paid off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake is internal: the skipper's struggle to preserve a sense of safety against an encroaching, sorrowful darkness. The pressure deepens effectively from the lamp's failure to the growth of the internal "ache." The climactic act of stacking stones is a meaningful, character-driven response that crystallizes his stance. The cost is made explicit—he will carry this ache—which gives the resolution weight.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=2.5)
    This is the story's critical failure. There are no discernible stakes or escalating pressure. The herald is never in doubt, faces no obstacles, and succeeds effortlessly. Since the outcome is never in question, the narrative is stripped of all tension, reading as a placid description of a process rather than a conflict with consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.5)
    The central stake—understanding a mystery—is entirely intellectual and lacks visceral pressure. The escalation is soft, moving from contemplation to a gentle experiment. The resolution is an insight that comes without any meaningful cost, conflict, or sacrifice, which keeps the tension low and the stakes feeling abstract throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—deconstructing sorrow to heal the sextant—is clear. The story deepens this stake by tying the external storm to the worker's internal effort. However, the resolution feels frictionless; the worker's own sorrow dissipates as a reward, making the "cost" of the magical act negligible and lowering the felt stakes of the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.5)
    The global stake—rekindling a dying realm—is clear, and the story executes a single deepening of pressure consistent with its textural drive. However, the on-page conflict lacks tension. The keeper performs her song and it works without opposition, setback, or immediate risk. The escalation feels pre-ordained rather than earned against meaningful resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.9)
    The internal stake—finding peace with a past mistake—is clear. However, the escalation is minimal, relying on a simple temporal pressure ("as midnight drew near") that doesn't create significant friction. The conflict is resolved by a convenient discovery rather than a difficult choice or a shift in tactics forced by mounting pressure. The resolution lacks a sense of being earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.8)
    The conflict is exclusively internal, focused on the protagonist's search for peace. The stakes are clear but low-intensity. Escalation occurs as a gentle deepening of feeling rather than a tightening of external pressure, which is appropriate for the chosen lens. The cost of the resolution—that the peace is seasonal and must be sought again—is legible but could have been rendered with more palpable weight.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving meaning against oblivion—is established early. The conflict is primarily atmospheric and conceptual. A meaningful deepening occurs with the discovery of the "pattern," but because this turn is summarized rather than shown, the escalation lacks visceral impact. The cost is legible but abstract: the assumption of a new, weighty responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dominant stake is muddled, split between a personal quest for the fob and a professional one to thwart a rival. The central conflict is a static standoff that doesn't escalate; pressure is maintained rather than tightened. The resolution is a deflation of tension caused by an external event (sunrise), not by the protagonist's agency, and the asserted cost is never dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—Aria's skepticism versus her desire for mystical truth—is signaled early and tested. The conflict escalates texturally through the intensifying environment and the ring's vibration, culminating in a decisive choice of agency: reaching out to the stranger. This action provides a resolution with a clear, felt cost—the loss of her scientific certainty—which powerfully informs the final emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.3)
    The internal conflict over creative blockage is well-defined and carries the narrative. The pressure escalates from a passive "plaguing" to an active engagement with her "auroral sorrow." The climax, the act of creation, is driven by protagonist agency and results in a clear resolution. The cost is felt in the dissipation of her sorrow, a trade for creative release and peace.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=3.8)
    The central conflict is abstract and lacks tangible opposition, resulting in low and static stakes. Obstacles are described with labels like "painstaking" and "arduous" but are not shown on the page, so the pressure on Aria never feels immediate or compelling. The narrative coasts on the promise of a final discovery rather than earning it through escalating tension.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=2.1)
    Conflict is absent. The story presents a goal and an unimpeded path to its achievement. The arrival of the iceberg fragment is not a complication that raises stakes but an opportunity that facilitates the protagonist's existing plan. Without any opposition, tension fails to build, and the resolution feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—Aria’s need to resolve her inner turmoil—is clear and effectively externalized through the controlled burn. The pressure escalates well as the fire rages. Aria’s agency is demonstrated in her calculated decision to contain the chaos, linking her action to the stake. However, the resolution feels slightly too neat, a direct and immediate consequence of her actions rather than a more complex, lingering outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=3.8)
    The central conflict, the "locked mailbox mystery," is presented as a low-stakes curiosity and is resolved without any meaningful opposition or escalation. Pressure does not build; Emilia simply gathers information unopposed until the mystery is explained away. The story lacks a significant tightening or reversal, resulting in a flat trajectory that trades tension for gentle, predictable discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.1)
    The primary stake of escape is clear, but the conflict is almost entirely internal and lacks tangible pressure. The escalation is a smooth intensification of resolve rather than a series of tightening constraints or reversals. While the spider's web provides a timeframe, the sense of threat remains low, and the final resolution is achieved without a visible trade-off or a deeply felt cost, which undermines the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming lost memories—is clear and the central conflict is resolved through the protagonist's direct action. The pressure tightens when the lighter ventures into the tunnels, a decisive choice that narrows options. However, the escalation feels muted, as the "pockets of gravity" act more like a guide than a genuine obstacle, missing an opportunity for greater tension.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—the need to hush a threatening prophecy—is signaled early and remains the focus. The conflict is internal and metaphysical, escalating as the summoner's meditative state deepens and the silence becomes a "palpable force." This deepening serves as the story's single, meaningful intensification, and the resolution is earned through the protagonist's agency, with the cost being their expended energy.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the student will grasp the profound, hidden nature of language—is established and effectively deepened when the tutor's interrogation reveals the student's personal quest. The pressure is primarily atmospheric and intellectual, escalating texturally rather than causally. The resolution is earned within this framework, and the cost is the student’s former, more limited worldview, which is a fitting price for the knowledge gained.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.5)
    The internal stake—reclaiming a past to achieve independence—is clear and consistent. The pressure deepens as Lyra listens to the seashell, leading to a decisive turn where she confronts her memories. The escalation feels somewhat linear and lacks a moment of true resistance or a trade-off that would heighten the sense of a difficult victory.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—subverting a historical text to provide closure—is well-defined. However, the conflict remains largely conceptual, and the pressure feels static. There is no meaningful escalation or tightening point where the forger must adapt her tactics or face a tangible setback. The process is portrayed as a smooth, masterful execution rather than a struggle, which limits the tension and the impact of the final victory.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding the echoes—is clear, and the story effectively builds pressure under an accumulative lens as the song intensifies. The conflict, however, is with an abstract mystery rather than a tangible opposition. The resolution feels somewhat unearned as the insight arrives via a mystical vision, lacking a clear, costly trade-off or a choice that forecloses a genuinely tempting alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—to find and expose truth—is clear. The story achieves a single deepening of this stake through the vision, which reconfigures Aria's understanding and purpose. However, the pressure remains entirely internal and psychic. The cost is stated as the "weight of her mission," which is felt but abstract. The conflict lacks a concrete trade-off or a moment where a tangible option is foreclosed, softening the impact of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=2.5)
    This is the story's most significant failure. While a philosophical stake is established (to understand hidden patterns), there is a complete lack of conflict, pressure, or escalation. The protagonist's journey is a serene, unimpeded stroll towards enlightenment. Without any obstacles, trade-offs, or moments of potential failure, the stakes remain abstract and the resolution carries no dramatic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the truth—is established early and pursued consistently. Finding the letters provides a meaningful tightening, focusing the investigation on a specific location and hinting at a larger conspiracy. The final confrontation, however, is with a passive phenomenon. The external pressure is minimal, and the internal conflict between skepticism and belief is told rather than shown, weakening the resolution's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=2.1)
    This is the story's most significant failure. Despite mentioning "discontent" and the "old ways," there is no dramatized conflict, antagonist, or obstacle. The prophet's rise is depicted as an inevitable, frictionless success. The stakes of shaping a "new dawn" remain abstract because there is no sense of what might be lost, no moment of tension, and no meaningful tightening of pressure that forces a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—the poet's internal battle against despair and creative sterility—is established immediately. The conflict deepens effectively under the Accumulative lens, as memories and preserved sounds intensify his sense of loss before providing a path to purpose. The turn is his interaction with the glass jar, which crystallizes his mission and provides the agency to write, paying the price of continued solitude but reframing it as valuable.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake—protecting the artifact—and escalates pressure by deepening the intensity of the attunement process, which fits the Accumulative lens. However, the conflict remains largely procedural and internal, lacking a sharp, decisive turn or trade-off. The cost of future vigilance is stated but feels less immediate than a price paid in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—igniting a revolution—is clear, but the escalation is weak under an Accumulative lens. The pressure builds primarily as a function of time (waiting for the moon) rather than through any mounting opposition or narrowing of options. The story declares high stakes for "the people," but the conflict in the scene itself is passive, lacking an immediate, tangible threat or a meaningful trade-off for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant internal stake—Maya's freedom from her past—is signaled clearly. The pressure, however, is purely accumulative and lacks a distinct moment of tightening where a choice is forced or an option is foreclosed. The escalation feels gentle and pre-determined, and while a resolution is reached, it lacks the feeling of having been won against significant, active opposition, reading more as an inevitable insight than an earned victory.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—the chaplain's need for absolution and a new purpose—is clear from the start. The conflict deepens effectively when he reframes his mission from offering solace to helping others "deserve" redemption. However, the pressure is entirely internal and lacks any meaningful on-page resistance or complication, making the escalation feel purely intellectual rather than viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=3.5)
    The central conflict is purely intellectual and lacks tangible escalation. The stake—understanding the algorithm—is clear but static; Zephyr simply persists until she succeeds without facing setbacks, trade-offs, or rising opposition. The story tells us the process is difficult, but because this pressure is never dramatized through action or choice, the conflict feels flat and the resolution unearned. There is no meaningful tightening or deepening of the core problem.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.1)
    The story signals a dominant stake (solving the cold case) and deepens it with a personal one. The escalation, fitting the accumulative lens, occurs as clues mount. The core weakness is the resolution; the central conflict is not resolved through Lena's agency against an obstacle but is sidestepped by a sudden realization that the *real* mystery was something else entirely, which deflates the established tension.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story establishes a grand, abstract stake—the "fragile balance"—but fails to test it with any tangible pressure. There is no escalation; the protagonist conceives of a plan and executes it without opposition, setback, or complication. The central conflict is resolved too easily, which undermines the feeling of earnedness and leaves the tension static from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—the protagonist's will to live—is clear and maintained. Under the Accumulative lens, the conflict deepens effectively not through a single reversal but through the steady pressure of physical labor and sensory immersion. The resolution is an earned crystallization of stance, and the cost (accepting a life haunted by impermanence) is made visible in the final paragraphs, lending weight to the newfound peace.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.5)
    The conflict is entirely internal, and the stakes relate to purpose and understanding. For an accumulative story, the pressure builds coherently as the sentinel gathers observations that complicate her initial view. The final realization serves as a meaningful deepening of the stake, accepting a more complex and nuanced role. The cost is subtle—an embrace of melancholy complexity—but legible within the story's tone.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central conflict is internal—turmoil versus the need for calm—with a clear stake: preserving the prophet's wisdom. The pressure deepens as the line walker performs their task, culminating in success. However, the escalation feels gentle and preordained; there is little sense that the line walker might fail, which keeps the tension and the stakes from feeling viscerally high.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=2.1)
    The story is nearly devoid of conflict. The central stake—"to transmute pain into a masterpiece"—is an abstract declaration that faces no opposition, obstacle, or pressure. There is no escalation or tightening, as Luna's journey is entirely smooth and affirming. The absence of any tangible struggle makes the resolution feel predetermined and dramatically inert.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.8)
    The conflict is elegantly focused on a single, dominant stake: the safety of private knowledge versus the risk of public testimony. The arrival of the visitor provides a single, effective tightening that forces the scholar to act. The protagonist's agency in choosing to go, despite their fear, is clear, and the cost of that choice is unmistakable on the page, satisfying the demands of this story's length and scope.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story establishes a compelling, albeit internal, dominant stake early on and maintains focus. The pressure deepens effectively for an accumulative piece, particularly in the moment the prophet sees the weathered statue, which renews her purpose. The final resolution presents a clear trade-off with a visible cost, forcing a renunciation of the original goal for a more profound understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story establishes an intellectual stake (the clock hand) which is effectively escalated by a physical one (the earth tremors). Eli's agency is shown when he restructures the observatory. However, the resolution is weak; the tremors simply stop on their own, deflating the tension. The cost is also muted; the observatory holds, and Eli achieves a peaceful epiphany. The external conflict resolves through convenience rather than as a direct, paid-for consequence of the protagonist's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—to "execute a flawless goodbye"—is signaled early and provides a clear objective. The pressure deepens appropriately for an accumulative lens, moving from the clinical knowledge of the blood work to the intimate, emotional intensity of the final moments. The resolution directly addresses and fulfills the stake, providing a sense of earned completion.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=3.8)
    The conflict is entirely abstract and intellectual, lacking tangible stakes or escalating pressure. The "reality-bending spoons" are a compelling hook that is never dramatized, leaving the central problem as a distant, unfelt threat. The story lacks a meaningful tightening; it's a placid summary of research that proceeds without opposition, failure, or trade-offs, resulting in a conflict that is stated but never viscerally experienced.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Emilia's internal need to find clarity after a past trauma—is established early and remains the focus. The discovery of the tooth provides a meaningful deepening of this conflict, forcing her to confront her uncertainty. The resolution is earned within the story's accumulative logic, but the stakes lack visceral immediacy, and the cost of her newfound purpose remains largely conceptual rather than concretely felt or paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—capturing and sharing the "pearl of stillness"—is established and maintained. The conflict is entirely internal, and the pressure escalates as a deepening of purpose rather than a narrowing of options. While consistent with the textural lens, the stakes feel low and the lack of any real opposition or setback makes the final accomplishment feel inevitable and less impactful. The resolution is earned within its own meditative terms.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—Aria's internal quest for peace—is clear. The arrival of the figure and the proffering of the flower create a meaningful deepening of this stake, forcing a choice between continued isolation and accepting a gentle connection. The resolution is earned through her quiet agency in accepting the flower, but the stakes remain entirely internal and low-key, lacking a sharper edge of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.4)
    The central stake—overcoming writer's block—is established early, but the escalation lacks teeth. The conflict is entirely internal and resolved by an external, unexplained apparition, which feels more like a gift than a test of the protagonist's agency. The resolution arrives without a visible price, making the victory feel hollow and diminishing the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.2)
    The central conflict—Elara versus the villagers' collective malaise—is static and lacks escalation. The stakes are declared but never face a concrete test, as the device works perfectly on the first try without complication or setback. This absence of meaningful opposition or a tightening of pressure makes the resolution feel inevitable and emotionally unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—enchanting the plate—is established early and remains the focus. The conflict is primarily a test of will and endurance. The escalation is textural, intensifying as Aria moves to the final act of sealing the plate with her own essence, a clear deepening of the stakes. The cost is legible in her final exhaustion, earning the resolution within the story's quiet, internal framework.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story establishes a clear intellectual stake but fails to escalate the pressure. The conflict is static: a long, patient effort with no dramatized setbacks, moments of doubt, or tangible risk of failure. The passage of time is asserted as the primary cost, but it lacks the on-page friction needed to make the final success feel hard-won against meaningful opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story establishes a clear, albeit internal, stake: to capture the ephemeral nature of burdens. The conflict is the weaver against this ephemerality, and the pressure deepens through her focused act of creation. The resolution—the finished tapestry—is earned within this quiet, textural framework, and the cost is legible in her disappearance, leaving only her work behind.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    The internal stake—managing overwhelming grief—is clear and consistently held. The pressure intensifies through the focused act of carving, which forces a confrontation with the core emotional wound. The resolution is an Earned Stasis, a believable shift from being overwhelmed to containing the pain, with the cost being the full acceptance of her husband's finality. The escalation is subtle but appropriate for the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story's conflict is entirely internal, centered on the dominant stake of achieving reconciliation. Under the accumulative lens, pressure deepens effectively as the scavenger gathers narrative fragments, culminating in a stance crystallization. The final action provides resolution with a clear, felt cost, foreclosing the path of restless searching in favor of preservation and acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.2)
    The central conflict—Maya versus entropy—is present but lacks significant pressure or escalation. The "labyrinthine puzzle" of the maze presents no actual obstacle, as the solution arrives via a sudden insight unrelated to deciphering it. The stakes of finding "hope" remain abstract because the terminal's decay never threatens to defeat her; the resolution feels inevitable and easily achieved, without a meaningful trade-off or price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant internal stake—reconciling a stable life with an abandoned passion—is clear. The appearance of the bear provides a meaningful deepening of this conflict. However, the resolution lacks a legible on-page cost. Elian's decision to pursue his dream is presented as a peaceful, wholly positive outcome, which deflates the tension and makes the preceding stasis feel less consequential than it should.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—finding the sundial to gain clarity—is clear, but the conflict lacks tangible pressure. The search is presented as a serene, inevitable process rather than a struggle against obstacles, internal or external. While a deepening occurs when the goal shifts from an external relic to internal truth, the lack of any real risk of failure or meaningful trade-off makes the resolution feel gentle and predetermined.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—preserving ancient knowledge by decoding the rope—is established early and held consistently. The conflict is a compelling person-versus-mystery, and pressure deepens effectively through the increasing fog and the protagonist's dawning recognition of a pattern. The resolution is earned directly through her defining trait of patience, and while the cost is subtle rather than visceral, it feels appropriate for the story's meditative pace and textural drive.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story establishes a clear internal stake: the narrator's quest for understanding. The pressure deepens effectively for an accumulative piece, narrowing from the empty town to the single thread, forcing a contemplative crisis. The cost of resolution—accepting fragility—is meant to be symbolized by the snapping thread, but the plot contradiction surrounding this moment makes the cost illegible and consequently feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—reawakening beauty in a mechanical world—is established early and held throughout. The story achieves a meaningful deepening of pressure under its accumulative lens, as the prince's work builds "a sense of anticipation and trepidation." The resolution connects to the prince's agency in building the device, but the stakes resolve too cleanly, lacking a final, sharp trade-off or lingering consequence to make the victory feel hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story establishes its internal stake—reconciling with a scarred past—coherently. The external conflict with the burned tree serves as a solid catalyst, providing a moment of intensification that forces her to act on her values. However, the pressure remains consistently low, and the resolution comes without a significant trade-off or visible cost beyond the acceptance of a pre-existing emotional burden, which slightly lessens the impact of her final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—reviving the city by liberating its memories—is clear from the outset. However, the conflict lacks genuine pressure. Aria progresses through her quest without significant obstacles or setbacks, following a linear path to success. The escalation feels perfunctory because she is never forced to make a difficult trade-off or pay a price for her victory, making the resolution feel unearned and the tension minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=3.5)
    This is the story's most significant failure. A central conflict—sharing light without fire—is declared but never dramatized or tested. The sentimentalist faces no obstacles, opposition, or difficult choices; their method works without complication. The lack of any meaningful escalation or tightening of pressure renders the stakes purely theoretical and the resolution unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—the protagonist's internal quest to understand grief—is established early. The conflict is entirely internal, and the pressure escalates through an accumulation of memories and sensory inputs rather than external opposition. The resolution is earned within this textural logic, but the stakes remain abstract and lack visceral immediacy, feeling more like a philosophical problem being solved than a high-cost personal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=4.2)
    The internal conflict is presented as a static state of turmoil rather than an escalating pressure. There is no meaningful tightening or deepening of the stakes; the conflict is simply resolved when a convenient solution appears. Elara's agency is minimized because her primary choice is prompted by an external, magical-seeming discovery, not by a difficult trade-off forced by rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—understanding the uncharted echoes—is established early and pursued relentlessly. The conflict is primarily a person-versus-mystery, and the escalation occurs as a deepening of knowledge rather than a series of external reversals. The final discovery provides a decisive turn that redefines the gardener's purpose, with the cost being a transition from a solvable quest to a perpetual state of heightened, perhaps burdensome, perception.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—overcoming stagnation by writing a new future—is established early. The conflict is conceptual, pitting imagination against constraint. While the pressure deepens internally as the vision crystallizes, the escalation lacks a tangible on-page test or trade-off, feeling more like a smooth, inevitable process than a struggle with rising costs.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central stake—capturing the broadcast to animate the dust—is clear, but the conflict lacks significant escalation. The primary pressure point (the flickering lights and "presence") is introduced and then abandoned, representing a missed opportunity to tighten the stakes. The resolution feels earned but comes at little visible cost, making the victory feel less impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.5)
    The conflict is entirely internal and philosophical, which suits the story's tone but lacks visceral pressure. The stakes are conceptual (gaining understanding), and the "tightening" occurs through Eli's direct explanation rather than a challenging event. While coherent under an accumulative lens, the lack of a tangible trade-off or difficult choice keeps the tension muted.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=4.5)
    The internal stake—reconciling competing historical narratives—is signaled clearly but remains entirely static. There is no escalation of pressure or a meaningful turn that narrows Kael's options; he begins the story agonizing and ends it agonizing, albeit with a new sense of purpose. The conflict is a flat line, lacking the dynamic tension required to make the resolution feel like a significant shift earned under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—maintaining resolve for a difficult, abstract goal—is established but never faces a concrete, on-page test. The conflict is entirely internal and lacks tangible pressure or opposition. The story deepens her feeling but does not escalate the stakes, and the cost ("the weight of her task") remains a generalized burden rather than a price paid for a specific choice.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—creating a beautiful, healing meal during the alignment—is signaled but never faces a genuine threat. While the celestial alignment provides a temporal boundary, it functions as an amplifier rather than a source of escalating pressure. The conflict is static; Aria's success is a foregone conclusion, and the resolution arrives without any price paid, rendering the stakes inert and the victory emotionally weightless.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story lacks meaningful stakes or conflict. The central "problem"—the beehive failure—is revealed to be a positive adaptation, retroactively deflating any tension. There is no opposition, no significant price paid, and the single "tightening" (receiving a clue) is a gift from a stranger. The resolution is an intellectual understanding without any tangible consequence or earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=4.2)
    The central stake—to understand the aliveness of houses—is clear but faces no meaningful opposition or pressure. Eli's path is frictionless: she finds the key object easily, the proprietor is helpful, and the ritual proceeds without complication or risk. The story lacks a meaningful tightening of pressure or a turn that forces a trade-off, resulting in a conflict that feels conceptual rather than dramatic and a resolution that feels predetermined rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—finding meaning in decay—is established early and remains coherent. However, the escalation of pressure is external and passive; the conflict deepens not because of a choice the statue makes, but because a solution drifts by. While the internal re-evaluation following the revelation is a meaningful turn, its catalyst is unearned, which flattens the overall tension.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    The conflict is primarily internal, pitting the protagonist's intellectual drive against the futility of their task. The dominant stake—whether to succumb to despair or find meaning in the endless process—is clear. The story achieves a single, meaningful deepening of this stake as the obsession intensifies ("the weight of my obsession bearing down upon me"), culminating in a final stance crystallization. The cost (renunciation of freedom for purpose) is visible and felt at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—the painter's internal battle for hope against the city's apathy—is established early. The pressure is primarily atmospheric, accumulating until it forces a choice to act. The key tightening occurs when she picks up the brush, foreclosing inaction. While effective under an Accumulative lens, the stakes remain entirely internal and the external pressures feel generalized, limiting the conflict's intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the stakes—preserving cultural history—are clear and deepen effectively with the revelation of the bread sculptures, the conflict lacks pressure. Elena is a passive observer to the central event; she exerts no agency to make the thaw happen. Consequently, the final "cost" is an abstract "weight of discovery" rather than a price paid for a difficult choice, leaving the resolution feeling unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central stake—unlocking the latent radiance—is clear, but the conflict lacks dramatized pressure. The puzzle-solving process is described as "painstaking," but this struggle is summarized rather than shown, weakening the sense of escalation. We don't witness moments of difficulty, false leads, or near-failure that would test the protagonist's resolve, making the final triumph feel less earned than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story establishes a clear psychological stake and successfully escalates pressure through the protagonist's descent and the increasing insistence of the advisor's voice. The climax at the mirror serves as a meaningful tightening, and the cost—a permanent psychological haunting—is legible. However, the protagonist's agency is consistently undermined; they are led to the conclusion rather than driving towards it through difficult choices, which caps the conflict's potential.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—the successful translation of atmosphere into music—is clear. Within the Accumulative lens, escalation occurs as a deepening of complexity ("the sound grew more complex, a rich tapestry of tones"). The conflict is low-key and internal, but the pressure is coherent for this lyrical mode. The cost is the prophet's physical exertion and the transient nature of the music, which is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the truth of the lost expedition—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the deciphered note transforms the abstract mystery into an immediate, personal threat. Lyra’s agency is clear as she chooses to confront this threat despite her fear. The cost is legible in the oppressive atmosphere and her internal dread, making her final steps out of the city feel earned and weighty.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict and stakes are stated but never dramatized. The central struggle is resolved through a simple, linear sequence of discovery and analysis with no setbacks, complications, or difficult choices. There is no escalation of pressure; Emilia proceeds unimpeded from goal to victory. The absence of any tangible obstacle or price paid makes the conflict feel entirely conceptual and inert.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central stake—preserving stories against the silence of the past—is established and consistent. The discovery of the inkwell provides a single, meaningful deepening of this stake. However, the conflict remains entirely internal and reflective, lacking any tangible opposition or trade-off that would force a higher-stakes choice with a more visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story establishes a clear, internal stake: deciphering the truth hidden in the texts. The conflict deepens effectively when Elara realizes her initial method is flawed, forcing her to "readjust her approach." This single turn is sufficient for the story's length and provides a clear point of escalation. The resolution is earned through her intellectual agency, fitting the Accumulative lens perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story focuses on a single, dominant internal stake: Kaito's struggle to manage his grief. The conflict deepens through his meticulous, obsessive craft, culminating in an act of agency—releasing the crane—that reweights his emotional state. This cadence shift serves as the story's climax, and the cost of his ongoing sorrow is palpable throughout, making the final moment of respite feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stakes pivot from physical survival to a highly abstract intellectual puzzle about "unused potential." While the story deepens the stakes with the revelation that this potential is a *catalyst* for conflict, the connection to the initial drone strike feels asserted rather than proven. This conceptual gap makes the pressure feel theoretical rather than immediate, undermining the emotional weight of the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story establishes a clear goal, but the stakes associated with decoding the "frequency of belonging" remain abstract and low-pressure. While Lena overcomes a series of procedural obstacles, the conflict reads as a straightforward puzzle without meaningful opposition or the risk of genuine failure. The resolution is achieved without any tangible cost or sacrifice, which diminishes the sense of earned success.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering a dangerous truth versus remaining in guilty stasis—is signaled early and effectively deepened. The escalation is internal but potent, moving from vague unease to a specific memory that forces a choice. The resolution is driven by protagonist agency, and the cost is made explicit, charging the final moments with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—the stalled prisoner exchange—is clear from the start. Pressure escalates not through action but through a deepening of understanding, initiated by the negotiator's speech, which serves as the story's single, effective turn. The resolution is earned by her agency, but the stakes feel more philosophical than visceral, and the cost is expressed as a "weight of responsibility" rather than a tangible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.0)
    The conflict is purely internal and the stakes are personal well-being. The story provides one meaningful deepening when Jack chooses to navigate by the utility poles, a concrete action that represents a shift away from his reliance on a broken past. This choice directly facilitates the story's emotional resolution. However, the pressure feels gentle and the outcome never seems truly in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Lena's internal quest for empathy—is established early. The single meaningful deepening occurs when she finds the baseball, which crystallizes her resolve. However, the escalation feels somewhat passive; the mist clears *for* her, revealing the path. While this works within the textural mode, her agency in forcing this escalation is limited, making the pressure feel more atmospheric than driven by her choices under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—Lyra's impending transformation—is signaled early, but the conflict lacks pressure. Lyra's "reluctance" generates no meaningful opposition or difficult trade-offs in her decision to proceed. The climax escalates the magical elements but not the personal cost, as the metamorphosis is quickly resolved into a positive outcome without a lingering sense of loss for her previous, steady existence.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake is internal: resolving the perplexity around lost time. The conflict unfolds as an accumulative deepening of understanding rather than a series of external reversals. The key tightening occurs when she connects the cards, the saucer, and the hand-tracings, which reweights her perception and forces the final shift. The cost is the acceptance of loss, which is legible and poignant at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—opening a locked dimension—is clear and maintained. However, the conflict feels low-pressure. The "perilous journey" is asserted but not dramatized; Aurora proceeds with "practiced ease" and faces no setbacks or difficult trade-offs. While the story deepens emotionally, it lacks a meaningful tightening of pressure that would test her resolve or force a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.8)
    The central conflict is almost entirely internal and lacks significant pressure. The stakes—understanding one's place in the universe—are high but remain abstract. The "tightening" moment with the old woman presents no real opposition; Aria accepts her role almost immediately, which deflates any potential tension. The resolution is not earned through overcoming a meaningful obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story signals high stakes—the fate of the fort, a revolution—but the on-page conflict is virtually non-existent. The supposed antagonist or obstacle is immediately revealed to be an ally ("a fellow conspirator"). The central challenge, deciphering the message, is overcome with ease. There is no meaningful opposition, no difficult trade-off, and no palpable sense of risk during the climax, which severely deflates tension.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story establishes a clear, dominant stake: harnessing the stardust to understand the universe's sacred patterns. The pressure deepens through the meticulous, accumulative process of arranging the rocks. The climax is a direct result of the protagonist’s sustained agency in completing this ritual, earning the final vision. The conflict is simple but effectively executed for a textural piece.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.3)
    The internal conflict is well-defined and consistently held: the poet's struggle for self-understanding against her inner turmoil. Pressure escalates effectively through the accumulation of imagery and reflection, culminating in the choice to open the envelope.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake—winning the duel—and escalates the pressure effectively from anticipation to a physical climax. The protagonist's agency drives the resolution. The primary weakness is the legibility of the cost; the physical toll is mentioned ("caught his breath," "sweat") but is quickly sublimated into a philosophical gain, muting the sense of a genuine price paid for the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming hope by rebuilding the library—is signaled clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving collective memory against the approaching monsoon—is signaled early and provides a clear source of tension. Pressure escalates effectively under the accumulative lens as the timeframe shortens, increasing Aria's urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.5)
    The internal conflict is clear, with the stake being Kaito's peace of mind. Under the accumulative lens, the pressure deepens effectively through the focused, ritualistic act of weaving the lace. The climax is driven by his agency—the choice to complete the pattern and release the object—which forecloses the path of passive suffering. The resulting cost is well-defined: regret is not erased but integrated, making the resolution feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve civilization’s memory—tightens once: energy flow restored, temple falls silent. Agency is present (Kael’s frenzied final burst), but the escalation is more accumulative density than causal narrowing; cost is felt yet diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.7)
    A dominant stake—uncovering hidden stories—is signaled early, yet pressure never escalates; the boy’s agency is limited to walking and noticing. No meaningful tightening or cost is dramatized. Coincidence and atmosphere substitute for escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.9)
    A single dominant stake—“unlock resonant awakenings”—is signaled early, but pressure never escalates; the bead’s activation resolves the conflict in one beat. No visible price is paid or option foreclosed. The ghost’s debt is thematic backdrop, not active antagonistic pressure that narrows the alchemist’s choices.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—transform ruin into reverence—is declared early but never tested; no reversals or trade-offs appear. Pressure is static; the weaving proceeds without obstacle or escalation. The ending asserts success without showing a foreclosed path or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—reconnecting with heritage—is declared early but never tested; excavation unfolds smoothly without reversals or resource loss. Pressure is static; the final feeling of harmony lacks a visible trade-off or narrowing of possibilities.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—“discover meaning in the margins”—is declared but never tested by an opposing force or irreversible trade-off. Pressure is ambient, not escalating; the arrival of patrons is decorative, not complicating. One soft tightening occurs when the letter is sealed, but no option is foreclosed. Agency is contemplative, not consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—uncovering truth behind unsent letters—is declared early but remains abstract; pressure escalates atmospherically, not through narrowed options. No visible cost is extracted from Aria; the apparition dissipates without forcing her to relinquish anything. Escalation is textural (spirit crescendo) rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single dominant stake: re-grafting memory onto lingering wounds. Pressure tightens once: decrypted cast links translator's trauma to the child's hope, narrowing options to acquiescence under anesthetic. Agency here is endurance/acceptance, not act; price is the surrender of control. Causality intact under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—rediscovering lost joy—is signaled early and tightened once: the act of displaying the mural in the ruins forecloses any chance of conventional preservation. Escalation is accretive rather than causal, but the deepening sensory density reweights the stake effectively. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the cost is the artwork’s inevitable erosion.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—exchange certainty for curiosity—is signaled early and tightened when the feedback loop forces Lena to choose between control and wonder. Escalation is textural (density of sound/color) rather than causal; a more visceral price would elevate tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.5)
    Central stake—evading thought-tax via coded gardens—is clear, but pressure never tightens. No reversal or trade-off; the message simply grows while gardeners remain oblivious. Agency is low: Lyra plants, then watches. Cost is asserted (“taxable thoughts”) but never dramatized on page.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—transmuting pain into beauty—is signaled early and tightened by the lullaby’s spell. Agency is renunciation/acceptance rather than overt action; the cost is conceptual (perpetual vigil). Escalation is lyrical, not causal; one deepening suffices under Accumulative lens. Coincidence (postcard’s arrival centuries ago) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—restoring trust after silence—is signaled early, but the pressure plate is the abstract fear that “threads of fate…would snap.” No concrete obstacle or trade-off is tested on the page; the breakthrough is achieved by diligence, not by a narrowing choice. Escalation is tonal (growing shimmer) rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—restore vs. preserve—is declared early but never tested in scene; no concrete safety dilemma or trade-off appears. Pressure is lyrical, not causal; the “conflicting values” remain thematic labels. One soft tightening: the decrypted message reframes purpose, yet no option is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes—secrecy vs. connection—are signaled early and tightened through the daily dust-mote ritual, but no single beat forces a trade-off with visible price. Escalation is textural rather than causal; tension accrues but never snaps. Sufficient for length, yet lacks a visceral test.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.1)
    Dominant stake—“why thresholds feel sacred”—is stated not tested; pressure stays atmospheric rather than narrowing. One meaningful tightening occurs when symbols resolve into path, but agency feels conferred by code and father, not forged by contradiction. The cost (peaceful reunion) undercuts tension.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake—“learn the rhythm of belonging”—is declared early but never materially tested; no tightening beat narrows options or exacts a visible price. The night’s passage feels like duration, not escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—path evaporation—tightens to a single, lyrical crystallization rather than escalating pressure through choices. Agency is recognition rather than alteration; price is felt but not forced, yielding a soft but earned closure under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—transform audience monotony into wonder—is declared but never tested by failure or trade-off. Each performance succeeds; applause confirms rather than challenges. No escalation beyond repetition of success; no visible price paid or option foreclosed. Conflict is static appreciation loop.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—transcribing the cosmos onto flesh—is signaled early and tightened by the dance’s crescendo. The pressure is textural rather than causal: each swirl narrows possibility until the verse manifests. Cost is the exile’s solitude and the irreversible skin-mark, legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—capture the world’s hidden beauty before it shifts—is declared early but never tested under rising pressure. No meaningful narrowing of options; the stone’s ripples serve as contemplative trigger, not obstacle. Cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—transforming personal pain into universal meaning—is signaled early but remains abstract. Pressure escalates only through accumulating reflection, not through a narrowing of options or a costly test. No concrete loss or trade-off is dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes—“equations for hope” across timelines—stay abstract; no tightening choice or trade-off appears on the page. Pressure is atmospheric, not causal, so escalation remains mild.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.1)
    Stakes—“what walls dream”—stay abstract; no tightening beat forces trade-off or visible cost. Pressure is diffuse nostalgia rather than escalating constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the mirrors—remains static; pressure does not tighten. No visible price is paid or option foreclosed. The escalation is atmospheric, not causal.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—lasting peace—is declared early, but escalation is atmospheric, not causal. Delegates soften because the mood shifts, not because Elian risks or forfeits anything tangible. No visible price is paid on the page; tension plateaus rather than tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.6)
    A single dominant stake—releasing the waters to answer extinction’s echo—is signaled early and escalated through mounting thunder and rising dust. Pressure tightens one notch toward Charged Poise; cost is felt in her exposed stance and uncertain post-storm future. No reversal beyond the climatic release, but tension holds.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—defy conformity—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each untangled thread deepens the prism’s glow, tightening the choice to step away. No external antagonist; pressure is internal and societal abstraction. One meaningful tightening suffices; cost is loss of past identity, felt but diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes are abstract—“audiences will question truth”—never embodied in a live test within the scene. Pressure is static; the only tightening is narrative intent, not on-page cost or narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake—“honor overlooked histories”—is declared early but never sharpened into a live dilemma. Pressure is atmospheric, not causal; no option is foreclosed, no visible price paid. The migration of the last monarch butterfly supplies poignancy yet does not tighten Aria’s choices.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve forgotten names—is signaled early and tightened once: the rope’s reconfiguration becomes the single path. Agency is present but low-stakes; no external opposition or resource loss sharpens the cost. The final hum reweights the premise, yet the price remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes—“why paths choose walkers”—are declared early but remain abstract; no on-page tightening forces a trade-off. The storm’s approach adds texture, not pressure. Agency is limited to passive reception of dream insight; cost is conceptual, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—sealing a covenant with the unknown—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens once when the tile’s decrypted harmony forces the astronomer to act. The pressure is lyrical rather than causal, but the final image narrows all options to a single stance. Cost is conceptual (loss of empirical distance) rather than visceral, yet legible.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes—“teach release from resentment”—are declared early, but pressure never escalates; the resentful listeners are anonymous silhouettes, not active opposition. The melody’s swell substitutes for earned reversal. Agency is diffuse: Elara “weaves” and “coaxes,” yet no single choice narrows options or exacts cost.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—recreate the dream—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: mirror nears completion, dream materializes. However, escalation is atmospheric, not tactical; no visible price is paid until the vanishing, which is off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—bridging generational wisdom—remains coherent; pressure tightens when forgotten seeds sprout, visibly reweighting the orchard. Cost is diffuse (years of solitary labor) rather than crystallized in a single beat, so escalation feels accumulative rather than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—access to forbidden knowledge—tightens once in the bathroom; however, escalation is gentle, and the price (loss of prior worldview) is stated more than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.6)
    The library quest exists as stated yearning; shadow pursuers are decorative rather than pressing, never forcing a real fork between diary and knowledge. One summarised rescue loop counts as pressure only generically; no moment where a taken risk or irreversible forfeiture is dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—find the Garden—remains abstract; pressure rises via thickening fog and merging memories, but no single beat forces a trade-off or visible forfeiture, so escalation is atmospheric rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (understanding the fables of absence) is declared early but remains abstract; no concrete test or trade-off is dramatized. Pressure does not tighten—Emilia observes, then participates without risk or escalating cost. The final beat offers no new limitation or forfeiture; options feel unchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“restore balance”—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: cacophony → bloom of hush. Agency is cognitive (examine, conjure) and effective; cost is the perpetual tending implied at the end. No external antagonist, but internal/external stakes interweave cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—recover lost knowledge—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once when the shard flares, but the cost is more wonder than loss. Escalation is atmospheric rather than causal; the custodian’s agency is largely observational.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving/shaping identity via collective memory—is signaled early. Pressure deepens through immersion, but the cost is conceptual rather than visceral; no live option is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominate stake defying “gravity of hopelessness” is early and clear; single deepening through mosaic note triggers stance crystallization with atmospheric cost. Escalation stays coherent under Accumulative/T extural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake signaled early: chronicler’s desire to “foresee” the texture of time and the figures’ next move. Pressure accumulates through deepening stillness rather than narrowing options; felt cost arrives as the dawn forces end of vigil, but no on-page reversal tests commitment or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—collecting silences to ease claustrophobia—is signaled early and deepens through the hour, but the pressure escalates via lyrical accretion rather than a narrowing of options; the cost is emotional but diffuse, lacking a single tightening beat that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake—“teach silence to comfort”—is declared early but never tested; no live option is foreclosed. Pressure is ambient, not causal. The operator’s agency is observational; no reversal or trade-off occurs. Cost is atmospheric, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—claim the throne—is signaled early. Pressure is the sunrise deadline, but it never tightens; Aria reaches the top with time to spare. No meaningful trade-off or escalation; the stairway simply appears when needed. Stakes remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—the sanctuary’s survival—tightens once when the keeper chooses to rekindle the flame, paying the cost of re-engagement. Pressure escalates via Accumulative density rather than causal reversals; the final image crystallizes the trade-off. The cost is felt but could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.0)
    A single dominant stake—translate pressure into diamonds—is signaled early and achieved. Pressure escalates via equipment malfunctions and rising psi, but the tightening is external rather than driven by Lyra’s irreversible choice; the final breakthrough feels gifted by quantum fiat. No visible price is extracted from her, blunting the sense of earned triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—uncovering a truth that ends the dynasty—is signaled early. Pressure escalates through the intensifying hum and visions, but the tightening is driven by external mysticism rather than protagonist agency; the cost is conceptual, not dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—“capture the shape of possibility”—is signaled early and escalates through each shift of reality. Pressure tightens once, when the knight must decide to grasp the entity. However, the cost is diffuse; no concrete forfeiture or limitation is dramatized, only a vague “trepidation.”

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving forgotten kindnesses—is clear early. Pressure deepens via accretion of discovered stories, but no single beat forces a trade-off or visible price; escalation is atmospheric rather than option-narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—resist historical erasure—is declared early, yet pressure remains atmospheric rather than escalating. No single beat narrows Aria’s options or forces a trade-off; the gathering simply disperses. Cost is asserted (“road ahead fraught”) but not dramatized on the page. Under Accumulative lens, a single intensifying cadence shift is present (stars → dawn) but does not reweight the stake with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—silencing the prophecy—is signaled early; pressure tightens as the music “seeps into the mist.” Yet escalation is atmospheric, not causal; the prophecy never pushes back. Agency is present (she plays), but the cost is diffuse—no forfeiture or irreversible choice.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—decode the prophecy—tightens once as leaf-patterns unlock hidden meaning. Cost is the seed sorter’s irrevocable change; escalation remains lyric rather than causally intensifying.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—finding direction amid uncertainty—tightens once when the compass rose’s glow guides the improvisation; the cost is the relinquishment of certainty, but the pressure is more atmospheric than sharply tested, keeping it just below the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—self-redemption through understanding—is signaled early and tightens via the escalating experiments. Pressure grows texturally rather than causally; no single beat forces a trade-off with visible price. The final stance crystallizes, but the absence of a concrete loss keeps it from the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—guiding one lost soul—remains static; pressure does not tighten but merely unfolds. No meaningful reversal or trade-off narrows options; the collector’s agency is limited to listening. Closure resolves without a visible or conceptual cost that alters her future tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—“understand the mathematics of mercy”—is declared but never tested in a concrete dilemma; no visible price is paid. Escalation is atmospheric (brighter light, writhing trees) rather than causal. One micro-turn (deciding to enter the clearing) lacks tightening of options or felt trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—unlocking overlooked histories—surfaces late and is never tested in a concrete beat; pressure escalates atmospherically but no option is foreclosed, so the tightening is textural rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: can ghosts be given voice before site is erased? One meaningful intensification: reading logbook shifts her from observer to carrier of stories, narrowing exit options. Cost is quiet—perpetual stewardship—but present when she smiles into “weightless burden.”

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—compress eternity into a moment—is declared late and remains abstract. Pressure is diffuse: “subtle changes,” “ripples through reality,” but no single beat narrows options or exacts a visible price. The rupture is the inciting incident, yet its consequences are narrated rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—reimagining a lost civilization—drives every beat. Escalation is textural: each artifact and verse adds weight until the final crystallization. No external antagonist; pressure is internal and accumulative. One deepening turn: shard’s glint shifts from curiosity to talismanic burden.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake—“to find the place where explanations fail”—is declared, not tested; no tightening or trade-off occurs. Pressure is atmospheric, not causal; the grotto symbols appear and are deciphered without resistance or cost. Escalation is poetic accumulation, not option-narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are subtle—the risk is creative failure versus epiphany—and escalation is delivered as increasing artistic pressure rather than external peril. The final reconfiguration satisfies that one tightening turn with a visible internal price.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—“to understand why flowers bloom at night”—is poetic but diffuse; pressure remains contemplative, never sharpening to a hard trade-off. A single deepening occurs when the glass narrative “speaks,” but the narrowing is interpretive rather than visceral. Because the cost is unembodied, escalation scores only solid-mid.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—“uncover the truth”—is signaled early and reiterated, but the only escalation is the gradual deciphering of debris patterns; no option is foreclosed or price visibly paid. Pressure is atmospheric, not causal, aligning with the Accumulative lens. The parley deepens knowledge yet does not tighten the protagonist’s choices. A single meaningful intensification is hinted at but not realized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—reviving the town—is signaled early; pressure escalates through memory reconstruction, but the decisive tightening (the first dawn action) is summarized, not dramatized, so the cost is inferred rather than felt. Escalation is textural, not causal.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.5)
    A single dominant stake—archiving emotions—is declared early, but pressure does not tighten; the prophecy intensifies mood without narrowing options or exacting a visible price. No beat forces the scribe to choose between competing goods or to renounce a path. Escalation is tonal, not causal.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—“preserve the balance”—remains abstract; no concrete loss or trade-off is dramatized. The vortex’s hum intensifies, yet pressure stays atmospheric rather than option-narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—how to attune to the sanctuary’s rhythms—tightens once when Ember redirects her attention from sirens to bell. The pressure is coherent but diffuse; the cost of this shift is gestured at rather than dramatized, limiting escalation intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are thematic (“find strength in vulnerability”) rather than dramatized; no concrete risk or irreversible choice tests them. Pressure is ambient, not escalating; the janitor’s sweeping never meets resistance that narrows options or exacts a price.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—preservation of unspoken words—tightens once when the recluse opens the box and absorbs the memories. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens; the cost is the emotional weight now carried, though it could be more viscerally staged.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—“understand the texture of time passing”—is signaled early and deepened by the capsule’s repair, yet the pressure curve is flat; no visible trade-off or narrowing of options occurs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—finding harmony in imperfection—is signaled early. Pressure remains ambient; no tightening beat narrows options or forces trade-off. The kite’s snap is external coincidence, not escalation. Closure arrives via mood shift, not agency-driven cost. Escalation is atmospheric, not causal.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—create lasting interspecies respect—is declared early. Pressure is diffuse: no scene-level test of the harmony goal, no visible trade-off forced by dwindling time. Escalation is textural (orchard “flourishes”) rather than causal; cost is elegiac rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—“understand the chemistry of homecoming”—is signaled early and tightens once via the entity’s appearance, but the cost is atmospheric rather than concrete; no irrevocable forfeiture or narrowed option is dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake: battlefield-to-garden transformation. No escalation; Declared twice, never tested or opposed—conflict is purely internal resolve that never wobbles. One tightening choice (scatter seeds), cost implied but thin. Stake feels abstract rather than urgent; pressure flattens.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“find life for barren land”—propels both scavenging and riddle; spring appearance deepens rather than resolves tension, carrying quiet cost of prior exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—turning confusion into purposeful exploration—is signaled early and tightened once: the glimpse of light forces Aria to decide whether to follow. The cost is implicit in the “trepidation” of stepping into the unknown, satisfying the single meaningful intensification required at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—“sky is wrong”—is declared early. Escalation is a single smooth ascent: reach chamber, swap pieces, sky fixed. No reversal, no narrowing of options, no visible cost. Pressure is atmospheric, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stake is the void left by the interregnum; pressure tightens as the trio commits to “unbind the past.” Agency is collective, diffuse; no single protagonist’s cost is dramatized. Escalation is tonal rather than causal, yet the final poise carries felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—unlocking forgotten truth—signaled early. Pressure tightens once when visions flood the seer, but escalation is more atmospheric than causal; the stone’s visions do not force a trade-off until the final gesture. Agency is present but the cost of seeding the new reality remains abstract. One meaningful turn, yet its price is not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled early and tightens once when the decoded labyrinth forces confrontation. The cost is felt in the final thaw, but the middle lacks a visible forfeiture that alters tactics; pressure is more atmospheric than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—“price of forgiveness”—is declared repeatedly but never tested in a beat that narrows options or exacts a visible price. Pressure accumulates lyrically rather than causally; no concrete trade-off is dramatized before the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—decode or drown—is signaled early and escalates via oxygen debt. One meaningful tightening: last match of pockmarks under fading consciousness. Cost is visceral (collapse, gasp) but external rather than foreclosing a future path.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—capture fleeting beauty—is signaled early and re-weighted at closure. Escalation is gentle; the oasis deepens the stake rather than narrowing options. Cost is conceptual (exposure of hidden world) rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—proving quiet intent can span oceans—is signaled early and deepened through the beckoning ritual. Pressure tightens once via the crescendo of “vibrations,” but the visible cost is conceptual rather than concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming the geography of loss—is signaled early and reiterated, but pressure escalates only through lyrical accumulation; no single beat narrows options or exacts a visible price before the dawn tableau.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—tempering involuntary honesty—tightens when cures are found; the cost is felt in the “unease” and the final resolve to keep the eye. One clear escalation: discovery of relic → discovery of cures → decision to experiment.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake—decode stranger’s gesture—never translates into concrete risk or trade-off. Pressure neither tightens nor deepens; the stranger walks away intact. The story mistakes twilight hush for escalating stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—fulfill the promise—remains abstract until the final note. Escalation is accumulative: each trial deepens wonder but doesn’t narrow options or raise stakes. Agency is present (she chooses a path), yet the cost is emotional rather than tactical; no resource is visibly lost.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—unravel the dreams—is signaled early; pressure deepens via bleeding starlight’s intensification. One tightening beat: she steps into the grotto, foreclosing retreat. Cost is declared (“change her forever”) but not yet felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes—“unlock the shell’s secrets”—stay abstract; no concrete test or loss sharpens them. Pressure is atmospheric (glow, rustle) rather than causal. The single “tightening” is interpretive, not dramatized. No visible price is paid, limiting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—turning chaotic dreams into coherent narrative—is signaled early. Pressure deepens via intensifying dream saturation, but escalation is more atmospheric than causal; no concrete trade-off or resource loss on page. Agency is contemplative, not decisional. Cost is conceptual (accepting nostalgia) rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stake—revealing “ordinary miracles” through occluded perception—is declared early but never narrowed; no external or internal obstacle escalates. The screw offers potential pressure (memory, pain, risk) yet remains a contemplative prop. One meaningful tightening is required; instead we get iterative restatement of the same insight. Consequently the conflict plateaus rather than intensifies.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single escalating stake: the tea-platform tremors escalate to the sunset climax. One decisive intensification suffices; storm delay offers coherent pressure rather than coincidence, but threat realisation remains more atmospheric than concretely constrained.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—deliver an apology that may never be heard—escalates through sensory intensification rather than external opposition. The tightening is palpable in the rising hum and glowing bottle, but the price (risk of rejection, loss of pride) is implied rather than enacted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“unify fragmented truths”—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each step inward/outward intensifies cosmic attunement until the hiccup crests. Agency is present but abstract; a concrete, on-page trade-off would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—“to understand what clocks really measure”—is declared early but never tested; no tightening trade-off or visible price emerges. Pressure is atmospheric, not causal, so escalation remains flat.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=4.1)
    Stakes (“revolutionize interaction”) stay abstract; no on-page tightening or deepening forces a trade-off. Pressure is diffuse observation rather than escalating conflict; the final beat merely restates intent without visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—helping father beat addiction—is signaled early. Escalation is incremental: each subway ride deepens insight, but no single beat narrows options or exacts visible cost. Pressure remains intellectual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—sustaining anonymous connections—stays static; no escalation or tightening alters the operator’s tactics or risks. The “loop” restates rather than intensifies pressure, and no felt cost is extracted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—“preserve the weight of small moments”—is declared early but never tested by opposition or trade-off. No escalation beyond deepening nostalgia; pressure remains atmospheric rather than causal. Closure lacks a felt price that narrows future options.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—curing loneliness—is clear, but escalation is atmospheric rather than causal. The “gentle virus” of kindness spreads without visible trade-offs or narrowing options. No beat tests commitment; tension remains ambient.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is internal: mapmaker’s need to understand sorrow. Pressure tightens via intensifying melody and constellation pause, but escalation is atmospheric rather than tactical. No visible forfeiture or narrowing of options; cost is conceptual. Sufficient for length but not high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—mending narrative reality—tightens when the anomaly responds to her nib-work; the single deepening is sufficient, though the weeds’ failure could have sharpened the cost further.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to the unheard—is signaled early and deepened through the signing sequence. Pressure escalates via the crowd’s gathering hush, but the final shift is atmospheric rather than a narrowing of options; no visible price is exacted from the advisor.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—rescuing the promise—signals early. Pressure escalates through the artistic trail, each piece narrowing options until the alcove reveal. Yet the tightening is more textural than causal; no tangible resource is lost or risk escalates beyond symbolic stakes, keeping the cost legible but mild.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake: preserve the shared dream against inevitable fade. Pressure rises only via lyrical intensification (“drumming grew more insistent”) rather than narrowing options. No credible loss or trade-off is dramatized; the sorrow is aesthetic, not tactical. The final poise is graceful but lacks a visible price that alters next moves.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—“prove whispers travel farther”—is declared but never materially tested; no escalation forces a trade-off. Pressure remains static; the stranger’s whisper is happenstance, not a consequence of her tactics. Agency is observational rather than decisional; no visible price is paid. One mild tightening occurs when she enters an unexplored sector, but it does not alter options or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stake—“teach darkness the value of stars”—is declared but never tested on the page; no pressure tightens or deepens. The guardian’s calm merely persists; no option is foreclosed, no price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—“forests of second thoughts”—stays abstract; no concrete opposition or escalating cost tests Elian’s resolve. Pressure plateaus after the grotto vision; the synchronized displays appear as fait accompli. Agency is contemplative rather than decisional, so escalation remains atmospheric, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—freedom from imposed identity—is signaled early and tightened by the whale’s call that “detach[es]… like the shedding of a worn skin.” The single deepening beat (entering the water) narrows options and carries bodily risk. The cost is implied (loss of former self) but could be sharper on the page; still, agency drives the escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—can Echo transmute grief into bearable art—tightens as the bouquet’s memory intensifies longing. One deepening: narrations grow more emotionally charged until silence becomes the only remaining move. Agency is Echo’s cessation of speech; cost is the unspoken loss. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no external coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—artistic transcendence versus safe boundaries—is signaled early and deepened through accumulating lyric intensity. Yet the escalation is purely textural; no single beat narrows options or exacts a visible price. The “dissolving boundaries” remain metaphorical; the reader feels no forfeiture or irreversible loss on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—awakening others to imperfection’s beauty—is signaled early but escalates only through gentle accumulation of admirers, not a tightening choice. The painter’s agency is observational; he arranges plants and watches reactions rather than risking loss or renunciation. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes, satisfying the lens but lacking a visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—“discover the texture of connection”—is declared early but never tested by a narrowing choice; pressure is ambient rather than escalating. One soft tightening occurs when the lens is cleaned, yet no option is foreclosed and no price is paid.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is reviving the maker’s wilted passion; pressure tightens as each origami incrementally brightens the curtains, forcing a final craft act. Cost is conceptual—grief transmuted—but still legible. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals required.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stated stake—“map cultural patterns lost in the crashes”—remains thematic; no concrete test or trade-off appears. Pressure is atmospheric, not causal; the night’s work changes nothing we can see.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—uncover forbidden knowledge—is clear early. Escalation is textural (density of nostalgia) rather than causal; the tightening is a single visionary beat, not a narrowing of options with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—stemming the “shadow unbound” that feeds on collective fear—is declared early but never tested in a beat that narrows her tactics. Pressure is atmospheric, not causal; the footage reveals a pattern yet never forces a choice with visible cost. Escalation is implied rather than enacted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—balancing self-respect and compassion—is signaled early and deepens through reflection, but escalation is more textural than causal; the final shift is a soft crystallization rather than a narrowing of options with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—“to read the stories in scars”—is signaled early and tightens once when the chamber’s light unfurls them. Yet escalation relies on atmospheric intensification rather than a visible trade-off; the plants’ whispers complicate but do not foreclose an option with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—“find where unused love is stored”—is signaled early. Pressure intensifies via accumulating letters, but no tightening choice or forfeiture occurs; the climax is revelation, not agency. Cost is atmospheric, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—freeing creativity—is clear early. Pressure intensifies via aurora’s “hypnotic spell,” but the tightening is atmospheric rather than causal; no option is foreclosed, no visible price paid. Agency is passive reception rather than active decision.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—guardian must nurture hidden sparks—signaled in paragraph three. Escalation is Accumulative: shimmer intensifies, clock ticks, glow reaches zenith. One tightening beat when Asa kneels to restart the clock; cost is the blurring of her form, a visible forfeiture of bodily integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—“unravel the mysteries of this newfound ability”—is announced but never tightened; no on-page test or trade-off occurs. Pressure remains atmospheric rather than causal. The translocation sequences are repetitive and consequence-free. No visible price alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—“find where unused courage waits”—is declared but never tested in scene; no on-page reversal or cost escalates pressure. Travelers’ resolve thickens via summary, not action. The vigil is atmospheric, not crucible. Closure arrives without a trade-off or forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the silence is worth the safety—is declared early but never tested by a concrete beat; pressure remains atmospheric. The single micro turn (the figure tightening the bolt) is external and does not tighten the bellhop’s options or raise the cost of remaining.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—preventing the pretender’s claim—is declared early and reiterated, yet pressure is static; no mid-story tightening forces Kael to recalibrate tactics. The “pause of constellations” functions as abstract deadline rather than live clock altering moves. Resolution arrives via the rune’s off-stage power, not a choice that narrows options or exacts visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.9)
    A clear dominant stake—understanding vanished paths—tightens through data immersion and rising tide awareness, but escalation is interior (curiosity to acceptance) more than externally tested; last beat trades off certainty with quiet acceptance instead of palpable loss on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—recover lost conviction—tightens once when the hum forces a stance crystallization. Escalation is tonal (thunderous serenity) rather than causal; cost is conceptual (she must return to fight) and legible, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake—unlocking evolution via the embryo—is clear early. Pressure escalates through plant agitation and script shimmer, but the tightening beat (decoding the tail) is too frictionless; no credible loss or trade-off is dramatized before the orb is simply retrieved.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—reconciling trauma with future hope—is signaled early. Pressure deepens via somatic markers, but the tightening is gentle; no clear trade-off or forfeiture is dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake: transform fractured reality into usable art. Pressure rises via the act of untangling; one meaningful tightening when threads reveal hidden patterns. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, slightly softening escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—uncover why time slows—drives pursuit. Pressure tightens when ink patterns fade, forcing Kael to crest the ridge. The final shared gaze narrows options: knowledge gained, but no action taken, so cost is conceptual rather than visceral. Escalation is modest but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to release dangerous truth—tightens once when Aria commits; the pressure is coherent but the price (personal risk) is under-dramatized, keeping it just shy of high-band intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake—preserve oasis of peace—remains static; no external or internal force seriously threatens it. Visitors arrive, but they admire rather than test; the sword is never lifted; the tower rubble stays outside the dome. One micro-turn (stone becomes talisman) deepens texture yet alters no tactical choice. Pressure plateaus; escalation is decorative, not causal.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—family empire at risk—is announced early but never tightened through an on-page test or trade-off. Pressure is atmospheric (“scandal that could topple”) rather than causal; no beat narrows Adelaide’s options or exacts a visible price. The “orbits of regret” motif floats above the action without forcing a concrete decision.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—“hush the dissonance of old guilt”—is signaled early, but pressure plateaus rather than tightens; the haunted firmware and folding time are atmospheric complications rather than escalating forces that narrow options or extract cost.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—finding meaning amid internal chaos—is signaled early and tightens through mandala’s emergent pattern. Escalation is textural, not causal; pressure deepens via lilac unease rather than narrowed options. Cost is felt but diffuse, limiting upper-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming the plaza through mercy—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the vision forces the renaming. The cost is conceptual (accepting perpetual brokenness) but less viscerally felt than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming coherence from fractured time—is signaled early. Pressure tightens via the garden’s rearrangement, but the escalation is more atmospheric than causal; the cost remains diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—illuminate hidden pathways via art—is signaled early and escalates through each swirl of light. A single tightening occurs when the static shock recalibrates perception, narrowing her options to the geode-led method; the cost is the telepathy pill loss, but it remains backgrounded.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.7)
    Dominant stake—“to become the voice of the unknown”—remains abstract; no tightening trade-off or visible price is dramatized. Pressure is atmospheric, not causal; the final cavern spectacle complicates nothing.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the prophecy’s living form—is signaled early. Pressure accrues texturally via cataloging, but no single tightening beat narrows options; escalation is diffuse. Agency is observational rather than decisive until the final smile, which carries diffuse cost.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stake—“find where unused courage waits”—is clear early, yet pressure plateaus; the apparition offers comfort, not a narrowing of options or felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.7)
    A single dominant stake—waiting for the traveler—is signaled early but never tested or escalated. No reversal or deepening occurs; the woman simply arrives. Pressure is atmospheric, not causal. The coachman’s agency is limited to gentle urging of horses; no visible cost is paid.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are thematic (understanding resistance to change) rather than tactical; pressure rises via sensory accumulation, not narrowing options. No visible price is paid—Akira simply leaves with the glass—so escalation remains mild.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—bringing light to shadows—remains thematic rather than tested; no single choice narrows options or exacts a visible price. Escalation is atmospheric, not causal; the oars’ rhythm deepens mood but doesn’t force adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.3)
    Single dominant stake (preservation vs. self-forged independence) signaled early, but tension escalates chiefly via contemplation.  No external pressure tests the choice until the final declarative image; cost registers rhetorically, not viscerally. Closure is Earned Stasis but without fresh narrowing—options foreclosed are abstractions.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—Lena’s search for universal connection—signaled early. Pressure deepens as she moves from observer to participant, but the tightening is gentle; the cost (loss of anonymity/observer safety) is implied rather than viscerally felt, keeping escalation modest under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are declared (“restore balance to the universe”) but never narrowed to a personal price or risk; the interference action succeeds without complication or trade-off. Pressure is static—static hum becomes pattern becomes victory—so escalation is rhetorical rather than causal. No visible cost alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—uncover the lost key—is signaled early. Pressure escalates via the organ’s pull and the crystal’s awakening, but the tightening is asserted rather than felt; Lyra’s agency is largely observational. No visible price is extracted before the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes—“solve cold cases by feeling”—surface early, and pressure tightens via empathy deficit rather than external threat. Tightening is thematic: intuition must balance reason. Cost accrues internally rather than through external obstacle; still, a single decisive intensification occurs when the artist decides the painting must carry empathic truth. Coincidence does not resolve; mist merely underscores irresolution.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=4.5)
    A dominant stake—uncovering the ancestor’s truth—is declared early, but pressure never escalates through reversible exile; the concept stays abstract. No tightening choice or visible cost occurs; the protagonist keeps reading without stakes rising. Coincidence and atmosphere substitute for agency-driven conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.8)
    A single dominant stake—“secrets must be spoken”—is declared but never forced into an on-page test. Pressure escalates atmospherically (music rising, fog lifting) rather than through narrowing options. No visible price is paid; the “weight lifting” is summarized, not dramatized. Coincidence (scaffold message) complicates without tightening the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stake is existential understanding: why paths circle back. Pressure is atmospheric, not escalating; no live option is foreclosed on the page. The tightening is intellectual—realizing stories matter more than destinations—without visible cost or trade-off. Agency remains observational.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake—“decode temple inscriptions”—is declared early but never visibly tested; no tightening or trade-off appears. Pressure is static; the breakthrough is narrated rather than earned through agency. Cost is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes are declared (“discover what mirrors don’t show”) but never sharpened; no escalating trade-off or irreversible cost appears. The frozen confession releases information without forcing a new tactic. Pressure plateaus rather than tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—“to find the intersection of dreams”—is declared early. Pressure escalates atmospherically via maze shift and vision flood, but no single tightening choice or trade-off is dramatized; the climax is passively received. Cost remains conceptual rather than visceral, limiting escalation depth under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“to patch holes in her soul”—is signaled early and tightens through the spell-weaving. One clear deepening occurs when the trees “lean in,” narrowing her options to finish or fail. The cost is atmospheric rather than tangible, keeping it just below the 8.2 threshold for visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming purpose after public failure—is signaled early. Pressure intensifies via memory and restlessness, but the decisive turn (resolve to “wrestle” the future) is not tested on the page; no option is foreclosed. Cost is emotional abstraction rather than tangible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake is the re-establishment of inter-realm connection; pressure intensifies through accumulating resonance of seed and spirit memory, but the cost—her intellectual certainty—remains more conceptual than viscerally felt, softening the final punch.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.1)
    Dominant stake—“preserve wonder in routine”—is stated early but never tested by an on-page reversal or narrowing of options. Pressure remains atmospheric; no beat escalates cost or forecloses a path, so the conflict stays conceptual rather than experiential.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—dissolving internal walls to connect—is signaled early. Pressure tightens via reflective deepening rather than external opposition; the cost is conceptual (emotional exposure) rather than concrete. One micro-turn suffices but lacks visceral bite.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.7)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.6)
    Central stake—finding the mythical library—stays abstract; no tightening turn forces a trade-off or deepens cost on the page; pressure is lyrical rather than intensifying.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—dream versus empire—is announced early but never tested in scene; pressure remains rhetorical. No tightening beat narrows options or exacts a price. The “perforated destiny” concept hovers as theme, not active constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake: “capture one last spark before oblivion.” Pressure intensifies texturally—colors saturate, hum deepens—but no decisive beat narrows options or exacts a visible price. The threat of stillness recedes without forcing a choice; tension remains aesthetic rather than consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=3.7)
    The dominant stake—“to find the source of contentment”—is declared early but never tested or escalated; pressure remains flat. No meaningful tightening or trade-off occurs; the cycle-of-rebirth concept is repeated without altering options. Closure arrives via thematic assertion, not a choice that forecloses a path with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—freeing the client from suffocating certainty—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: the chimes’ whisper and mirror shard deepen the conscience’s understanding, narrowing options toward the “unhooking.” Cost is conceptual (the conscience’s own vulnerability) but remains abstract; no tangible forfeiture alters tactics. Meets the single-tightening bar for 600–800 words.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake is student’s comprehension of vanishing. Pressure tightens via withheld details and trance deepening, but escalation is gentle—no live option foreclosed, no tangible price paid. Agency lies with researcher’s pacing, not student’s risk.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—mastery of navigation without motion—remains abstract; pressure accrues via dust and pulse but never tightens into a decisive trade-off. The final synchronization feels inevitable rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—creative rebirth—is signaled early and intensifies as Eira approaches the keystone. The unstrapping beat is the single tightening, but it resolves too easily; no visible price is paid. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens but lacks a felt cost that would foreclose a path.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—“unlock luminous vows”—narrows options once; lantern release provides soft external tick-tock. Cost remains atmospheric rather than tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—“align with purpose”—is declared but not tested; no tightening of options or visible price. Escalation is atmospheric (stars brighten) rather than causal. Agency is observational until the final swallow.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—bearing witness to forgotten sacrifices—escalates via density, not causality. A single cadence shift (crystallization) tightens the cost, but the lack of external opposition keeps pressure internal and diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—“right a cosmic imbalance”—is signaled early and tightened through the ritual’s precision. Pressure is coherent but abstract; the bell’s repair is the single meaningful turn, and the cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stakes are framed as “harmonizing logic and intuition,” yet pressure never escalates past gentle wonder; the crystal’s activation complicates nothing and demands no trade-off, leaving the dominant stake conceptually static.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (preserve peer trust) is signaled early; pressure deepens through iterative revision of data, but the tightening beat is more textural than causal. No visible price is exacted on the page, so escalation feels moderate rather than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes (“defeat emotional numbness”) are declared but never tested under tangible pressure; the dominant conflict remains internal and static. The clone custody war is backstory flashback, not a live antagonistic force. No escalation beats—the brain jar never shifts meaning, complementary opposites never create escalating tension, and “history rewrites itself” exerts zero consequence on tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—transform the seed into a new escape-room theme—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: accumulating imagery and ideation rather than narrowing options. No on-page reversal or trade-off; tension is atmospheric. Cost is deferred to future business risk, not dramatized. Coincidence (anonymous package) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—restore lost laughter—is signaled early. Pressure tightens via the crescendo of summoned memories, but agency remains largely atmospheric; the laughter’s return feels bestowed by the setting rather than wrested through a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—safeguarding knowledge vs. crushing isolation—is signaled early. Pressure tightens via the mist’s thickening and the statues’ gaze, forcing her to interiorize exteriors. Cost is conceptual (perpetual vigilance) but not viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—shatter stifling destiny—is signaled early and tightened through successive approximation; the final reconfiguration forecloses the old path. Cost is implied in the “trepidation” on the alchemist’s face, but not viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—uncover the shard of hush—remains abstract; tension is atmospheric, not option-narrowing. No on-page reversal or trade-off; pressure accumulates but never tightens. Cost is diffuse wonder rather than forfeiture. Coincidence (finding the fragment) complicates acceptably, yet agency stays interpretive.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—uncover the truth of the vanishing ferry—is signaled early. Pressure intensifies via pattern discovery, yet the cost remains conceptual; no concrete option is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—“to discover the texture of connection”—is signaled early but remains abstract; pressure escalates via accumulating color and distortion rather than narrowing options. No concrete trade-off or visible price is paid on-page. The final shift is tonal, not tactical; tension diffuses into awe rather than cost.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are declared—unlock cosmic mysteries—but never tested or tightened on the page. No reversal or deepening complicates the lesson; students simply “begin to grasp” and then disperse. Agency is observational; Lyra neither risks nor forfeits anything. Pressure stays flat, so the closure feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—reassure the grieving woman—is signaled early and met without resistance or escalation. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the woman’s sorrow simply eases under Aria’s words. Coincidence (meeting at the exact spot) is allowed under Situational lens but does not complicate. Closure is peaceful but lacks a visible or felt price that would push the score higher.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes (retrieve codex, escape before tide) are declared early and re-stated, but pressure plateaus: no mid-story tightening, no resource lost, no option foreclosed. The phase-transition escape arrives as sudden solution rather than earned escalation. One mild deepening—realizing cables can be used for travel—doesn’t carry visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—preserving the dying language—is clear early. Escalation is textural: patterns intensify, whispers swell. Yet the storyteller’s agency is observational; no decisive trade-off or irreversible cost is dramatized. The tightening is aesthetic rather than tactical, limiting the score to the high 6s.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—“make sense of the chaos”—stays abstract; no concrete resource or relationship is risked. Pressure escalates only by volume of voices, not by narrowing options or raising cost. Lena’s agency is limited to listening; the arrowhead resonance is received, not wielded. No visible price is exacted on the page, so the tightening required for 8+ is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—free the statues and revive beauty—escalates as Luna’s melody “softens their rigid forms,” a clear tightening under Accumulative pressure. Agency is hers, but the price she pays is off-stage; the statues bear the visible transformation. One meaningful intensification occurs, sufficient for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—cross undetected to deliver hope—is signaled early and tightened once when the drone’s gaze forces the decisive sprint. Cost is present (risk of capture) yet remains abstract; a tangible forfeiture on the page would secure the higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.7)
    The dominant stake—“to interpret silence as possibility”—is announced early but never put under pressure; the oasis encounter does not test or deepen it. No meaningful tightening or trade-off occurs; the carpenter simply receives a lyrical confirmation. Escalation is atmospheric, not causal.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes—“finding the place where stories live”—stated early but escalate through description alone; no reversal, resource loss, or narrowing choice under pressure. The scarf’s "shimmer" moment reads as intensified mood rather than tightened limitation. Closure is renunciatory stasis, not a cost-drenched choice.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—decipher the cipher—is clear early, yet pressure never escalates; each sunrise is another identical attempt. No beat narrows options or exacts a felt price, so the conflict stays decorative rather than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—freeing the trapped idea—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the lock yields, releasing the idea. Cost is conceptual but legible. Escalation is atmospheric rather than causal; pressure intensifies via thickening air, not narrowing options. Coincidence (star’s position) is allowed under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—recovering stolen memories—is signaled early and reiterated. Pressure intensifies atmospherically but never narrows options or exacts a visible price on the page; the tension remains prospective rather than operative.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—reversing exile—signaled early; pressure tightens through the archivist’s growing confidence and subsiding nervous habit. One meaningful deepening occurs as the tea-leaf geometry reveals longing, narrowing options toward mentorship. Cost is present but soft-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake—“preserve the color of wonder”—is announced early but never tested; no opposition or resource scarcity complicates Aria’s task. Escalation is tonal (lyric crescendo) rather than causal; the single “tightening” is the seed taking root, yet it solves rather than complicates. Cost is absent; the earth is simply healed.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—freeing spirits—signaled early. Escalation is textural: each untied knot thins the hush until the final release narrows her future to perpetual return. Agency is continuous, renunciatory; cost is the silence she now bears. No external reversals, but the deepening pattern suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the henge’s silence—tightens via iterative observation; no external antagonist needed. The cost is opportunity/time rather than a visible forfeiture, so pressure is textural but coherent under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding surrender—intensifies through each relic discovered, tightening from curiosity to melancholy acceptance. Pressure is textural rather than causal; the cost is conceptual (transience acknowledged) yet still felt in the red-rimmed eyes. One tightening beat suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—articulate the ghost’s unspoken needs—tightens once: each graffitoed symbol raises the stakes until refusal is impossible. Agency is exercised through encoding; the storm’s pressure externalizes internal urgency. Cost is aesthetic and spiritual rather than material, but legible in the “expectant hush” and the irrevocable change left behind. One clear deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the diary’s secret—remains abstract; tension is contemplative rather than pressing. No tightening beat narrows options or exacts a price; the conflict is resolved by revelation alone. Escalation is gentle pattern-deepening under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—memorializing the storm and proving empty spaces remember—is signaled early. Pressure is lyrical, not causal; no tightening choice narrows options or exacts a visible price. Escalation is tonal deepening rather than actionable conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—capture the infinite before loss—escalates through sensory compression and the artist’s accelerating brushwork; the cost is the inevitable demolition, but agency is mostly contemplative rather than a decisive act that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—discovery of hidden location—is signaled early; pressure escalates via pattern recognition rather than narrowing options. No visible price is paid on the page; the tightening is intellectual, not tactical or emotional.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the hall of mirrors—is signaled early and achieved, yet the pressure curve is flat; no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs between discovery and entry, so escalation feels decorative rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are communal flourishing; pressure is gentle and external (harness nebula energy) rather than urgent or contested. No single character faces a narrowing choice or irreversible cost; the conflict is logistical collaboration. Escalation is additive—more pathways glow—rather than a tightening that forecloses options. The brambled hope feels more mood than risk.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—preserving temporal balance—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: deepening hush and slowing dusk mirror rising solemnity. No decisive tightening of options or visible price is dramatized; the lullaby succeeds without evident trade-off, muting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—restore the labyrinth before night frost—is signaled early and met. Escalation is linear rather than tightening; the frost deadline is announced but never presses her resources or forces a trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—transform grief into meaningful connection via science—is signaled early. A single tightening beat occurs when the foam insight forces a redefinition of her work’s purpose. Cost is felt in the irrevocability of Sofia’s absence; no external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—guardianship vs. discovery—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: incise urge versus vendor creed. The refusal forecloses the path but the price is only conceptual (“she would never see the world in the same way”); no tangible loss or external consequence is dramatized, keeping cost legible but light.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—absorb and smooth remorse—is signaled early and tightens once when the flood threatens to overwhelm her. Agency is present (she “stood firm”), but the cost is more conceptual than visceral; escalation is single-note yet coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—“connect the disparate elements of her community”—is declared early but never sharpened by a tightening choice or visible trade-off. Pressure remains atmospheric rather than causal; the conversation with the elevator does not foreclose an option or exact a price. Escalation is gentle pattern-deepening, not decisive intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—unlock entangled memories—is signaled early and deepened by the flood of foreign recollections. However, escalation is tonal (mystical reverie) rather than causal; no option is foreclosed and no visible price is paid. The tightening is aesthetic, not strategic.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—uncover forgotten combinations—tightens once when the doodle becomes a map; cost is felt in the reluctant exit, but pressure plateaus rather than spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—reawakening empathy through music—is signaled early and escalates via incremental resonance rather than reversal. The tightening is textural: silence thickens until the grove vibrates. Cost is atmospheric, not personal, keeping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are abstract: "uncover a new truth," "beauty in the difficult." Pressure is atmospheric, not incremental; no tightening beat narrows options or exacts a visible price. The conflict is internal and static, lacking a catalytic test.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering the diary’s secrets—is declared early but never truly pressured; the clasp opens effortlessly. No escalation or trade-off narrows options; silence as a concept accumulates texture but doesn’t tighten the conflict. Agency is limited to passive reading and reflection. Cost is absent; the fireworks’ arrival is external and irrelevant to the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—access to the undercurrent of wisdom—tightens as the tide’s thought turns; the corpse flower’s brief bloom narrows options to a single inhalation that reconfigures her world. Agency is present but cushioned by lyric inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the orchard’s resilience—escalates through the accelerated growth trail, but the final discovery feels gifted rather than wrested; the cost is observational, not paid.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—understand the crash to prevent recurrence—is signaled early. Pressure tightens via accumulating wind data, but the turn is informational, not actionable; no option is foreclosed on the page. Cost is deferred to future action, not dramatized here.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—“unfetter the sculpted hush”—is clear, but pressure escalates more by lyrical accretion than by narrowing options; cost is aesthetic rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—unlock empathy’s math—tightens as each star vanishes, a visible countdown. Agency is Echo’s decision to finish the print despite erasure of the sky; cost is the irreversible darkening. No reversals, but pressure deepens under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake—“coax wonder from the routine”—is declared early but never tested; no tightening or trade-off appears. The meeting with the pale woman raises wonder yet imposes no cost or limitation. Pressure stays flat; the story coasts on mood rather than escalating stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—proving emotional absorption—is declared early but never put to a test that could fail; pressure is atmospheric, not consequential. No meaningful tightening narrows options or exacts price. Escalation is poetic accretion, not risk.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—reconnecting across silence—is signaled early, but escalation is textural rather than causal: the puzzle and weaving deepen mood without narrowing options or raising cost. No decisive reversal or trade-off occurs on the page; the tension plateaus. The “impossible distance” stays abstract, never tested by an on-page obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“coax resilience from rubble”—is signaled early and escalates through each hammer blow; the silk’s success tightens the smith’s resolve into azure defiance. Cost is present (hours of solitary labor) but generalized; no single irreversible trade-off is dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—uncover the withheld truth—is clear early. Pressure escalates texturally through kaleidoscopic shifts, but each world blurs into the next without a tightening choice that forecloses an option. The final “clarity” arrives as declaration, not a tested trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—protecting the lighthouse’s safety—is signaled early and tightened through the lamp failure and anonymous letters. Escalation is textural: each image (glass, letters, cairn) deepens the ache rather than narrows options. A visible price is implied but not dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes—“shape the coming day”—remain abstract; no concrete consequence of failure is tested on the page. Pressure tightens only in cadence, not in options foreclosed. The herald’s agency is absolute; she steers without resistance, so escalation is atmospheric rather than causal. A single tightening beat is present but lacks visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake—“learn the secret of allure”—is declared early but never tested; no tightening or trade-off occurs. Escalation is purely contemplative; the wing’s beauty intensifies, yet Kaito’s options do not narrow. Cost is absent on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—heal the sextant by deconstructing sorrow—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once when the storm and heartbeat sync, but the cost is diffuse; the worker’s sorrow eases without visible forfeiture. Agency is present yet cushioned by the miraculous frame.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—rekindling a dying realm—is declared early and reiterated, but pressure is atmospheric rather than narrowing. The tightening is a soft brightening, not a trade-off or forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—unearth wisdom in a past mistake—is signaled early and revisited at the end. Pressure tightens once when the message reframes the invitation, but the escalation is contemplative rather than consequential; no tangible resource or relationship is risked. The cost is conceptual, not viscerally felt. One meaningful deepening, but stakes remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—finding the sacred in the ordinary—remains more thematic than viscerally tested. Pressure accumulates through repeated visits and seasonal shift, but no single beat forces a trade-off or visible forfeiture. The tightening is atmospheric rather than option-narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—“preserve the essence before oblivion”—is declared early but remains abstract. No visible price or narrowing of options occurs; the pattern of frequencies is revealed without forcing a trade-off or irreversible choice.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—thwart The Shadow—signaled early. Tension escalates through proximity and recognition, narrowing to sunrise standoff. Cost is atmospheric (fragile peace) rather than concrete loss, so escalation feels mild under Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.7)
    The dominant stake—“why some people carry weather”—is declared but never tested; pressure does not tighten. The stranger’s appearance resolves tension by coincidence, not agency, so no visible cost is paid.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—creative blockage versus release—is signaled early and tightened through the act of drawing itself. Escalation is textural: each stroke deepens the resonance until the cave answers, but the visible cost (a forfeited memory? energy?) remains implied rather than explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost candor—remains abstract; pressure escalates only as “long and arduous” travel, not through narrowing options or visible cost. The chamber discovery feels inevitable rather than earned by a final trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.8)
    Dominant stake—“preserve the color of wonder”—is stated early but never tested or opposed; pressure plateaus. No meaningful tightening or trade-off appears; the sculpture’s upgrade proceeds without friction. Agency is observational; coincidence (iceberg arrival) initiates, not complicates. Cost is metaphorical, not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—resolve inner static or be consumed by it—is signaled early and tightened when the burn forces a live choice: flee or contain. Escalation is one decisive intensification under a situational lens; coincidence (magnetic north shift) complicates timing but does not resolve the conflict. Cost is visible in the charred landscape and the irreversible shift in Aria’s self-concept.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.4)
    The dominant stake—“uncover the truth behind the mailbox”—is declared but never escalates; Emilia faces no opposition, ticking clock, or resource loss. Agency is limited to asking questions and reading stories; no beat narrows her options or forces a trade-off. The mystery’s resolution is gifted through exposition, not earned by her actions. Cost is absent; tension plateaus.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—escape via self-encoded strength—is clear early, but pressure plateaus. The spider’s web supplies a lyrical clock yet doesn’t tighten options; Aria’s agency at the climax is asserted, not forced by a visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—recovering deleted memories—is signaled early and escalates through gravitational pull toward the crystal. Yet the tightening moment is the crystal’s agency, not the lighter’s; pressure grows atmospherically rather than through narrowed options. A visible cost is implied but not enacted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stake—“understanding secrets of old buildings”—is declared late and never tested on the page. Pressure remains atmospheric; no tightening choice or forfeiture occurs. Escalation is poetic, not causal.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.0)
    A single dominant stake—reclaiming suppressed memory—is declared early but never tested on the page; pressure does not tighten. The seashell’s whispers intensify, yet Lyra’s agency remains passive—she listens, remembers, then walks away. No visible cost is extracted for the retrieval of memory.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—subverting an unjust text—is signaled early and held. Pressure tightens via the “calibrated treason” line, but the actual escalation is atmospheric rather than tactical; no option is foreclosed on the page. Cost is gestured at (“subtle manipulation”) yet never made visible or felt.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why some echo—is signaled early and held throughout. Pressure intensifies via the song’s spell, but escalation is atmospheric rather than causal; no option is foreclosed or price visibly paid. The final deepening is more resonance than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—“salvage something pure”—is declared but never sharpened by an on-page test or irreversible trade-off. Pressure is atmospheric (whispers, visions) rather than causal; no single beat escalates cost or forecloses an option. The final widening of “windows of connection” feels like expansion, not tightening. Agency is contemplative; no decision or renunciation carries visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake is abstract: “grasp hidden truths.” Pressure never tightens; no live option is foreclosed. The walk along the moon path is atmospheric, not tactical escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—truth versus legend—is signaled early and tightens once when letters reveal orchestrated liquidation. The cost is conceptual (comfortable lies shattered) but not yet viscerally paid; escalation is single-step rather than deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—“shaping a new dawn”—is declared early but stays abstract; no on-page tightening forces a trade-off or visible price from the visionary. Pressure escalates only in summary (“prophet’s influence grew like wildfire”) without a beat where her options narrow or knowledge shifts. Conflict remains observational, not crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve beauty for future generations—is declared early but never tested; no concrete obstacle or trade-off appears. Pressure remains static; the dawn merely offers mood, not narrowing options. Escalation is tonal, not causal.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—“patient revolution”—is declared early and escalates via moon-tracking ritual. Pressure tightens as viaduct hum intensifies, but the decisive turn is atmospheric rather than an actionable trade-off; cost remains conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the young woman’s preventable death—remains abstract; pressure never tightens through a concrete test or trade-off. Escalation is emotional accumulation rather than narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake (how to turn apology into action) is announced early, but pressure plateaus; no decisive tightening or trade-off occurs on the page. Escalation is emotional summary rather than rising obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—uncover what happened to the missing employees—escalates via the recurring numbers and the warning “They’re watching.” The tightening is intellectual rather than visceral; the cost is the haunting absence, but it’s more stated than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—guardian’s burden to keep balance—tightens as each mirror glimpse costs emotional exposure. One clear escalation: from finding fragment to reconstituting whole, with the price of perpetual vigilance legible in the final beat. Agency remains hers throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—will the protagonist rejoin life or remain detached—is signaled early and tightens through physical labor and sensory immersion. Escalation is textural: repetition of “trawl” and “sound of approaching endings” deepens rather than reverses. Cost is felt but abstract; lacks a concrete forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding destined mismatches—signaled early but never tested under rising pressure. No narrowing of options; no trade-off or forfeiture. Escalation is atmospheric deepening, not causal tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—“preserve the echo of wisdom”—is declared early but never tested or narrowed. No reversal or trade-off surfaces; tension is ambient, not escalating. Closure arrives as earned stasis, yet the absence of a visible price keeps pressure modest.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—collective healing through art—stays abstract; no tightening choice or on-page trade-off appears. No beat raises the cost of continuing or forecloses alternatives. Tension remains one-note static rather escalating under lens pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—protect vs. share the decoded growth pattern—is signaled early. Escalation arrives via the summons, a single tightening beat. Agency is mostly reactive; the scholar’s resolve is asserted rather than tested on the page, so the visible cost is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—capture the intangible sound—is signaled early and deepens through pattern-building rather than causal reversals. One meaningful tightening: the moment the prophet realizes the sound is ambient, foreclosing further search. Cost is conceptual (accepting impermanence) and visible (abandoning the chalk). Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—preserving the sanctuary against cosmic collapse—is declared early. Escalation is textural: tremors intensify, Eli reinforces. Yet the tightening is narrated rather than dramatized; no single beat forces a trade-off with visible price. The final stillness reweights meaning but does not foreclose a live option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—helping Emma toward a peaceful death—is signaled early and escalates gently via breathing-matched music. However, the tightening is atmospheric, not tactical; no option is foreclosed for Lena, and the cost is Emma’s alone. Agency is present but low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—“find where shadows go at noon”—is announced early but never tested in scene; no visible cost or narrowing of options occurs. Pressure is static: Lyra researches, reflects, and “understands” without a beat where a choice forecloses a path. Escalation is asserted (“more pronounced after the reality-bending event”) rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—making sense of past trauma and finding new purpose—is signaled early and revisited, yet pressure stays largely reflective; no single beat narrows options or exacts a visible price. Escalation is emotional rather than situational, and the final shift feels more epiphanic than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—sharing stillness without fire—is signaled early and tightens through each polishing stroke. Yet pressure is ambient, not acute; no single beat forces a trade-off or visible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—healing from public exposure—is signaled early and tightened once by the stranger’s silent gift, which crystallizes her stance. Pressure is coherent but gentle; the cost is more atmospheric than concrete, nudging the score just below the 7.0 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—writer’s block versus creative surrender—is signaled early. Pressure tightens via accumulative pattern: each return of mist/shell/muse narrows the option of quitting. Cost is felt in the final image (“against the current”), though escalation is more cadence than causal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—restore communal connection—is signaled early and deepened by the song’s rising swell. Escalation is textural: each added voice thickens the tapestry. The final chorus crystallizes the stake, but the cost is collective euphoria rather than an individual trade-off, keeping pressure communal and diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—translate heartbeats into maps—tightens once: the seal demands life-force, a visible price that narrows options and crystallizes the final image under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—“to understand the harvest of echoes”—remains conceptual; no concrete test or narrowing of options occurs. Escalation is atmospheric, not causal; the season’s “healing” parallels completion but does not force a decision. Agency is observational; no price is paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stake—“collect the weights of burdens”—is announced early and tightened through weaving, but the cost is conceptual; no visible forfeiture or narrowing of options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake—containing grief—is signaled early and held. Pressure deepens via accumulative texture (rain, scrape, aroma) rather than a tightening choice; no live option is foreclosed. Agency is contemplative endurance; cost is emotional but not visibly paid on the page. Sufficient for length, yet lacks the decisive intensification required for 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—reconciling eroded ambitions—is signaled early and revisited, but pressure plateaus rather than tightens. No visible resource loss or trade-off alters tactics; escalation is atmospheric, not causal.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—“new equations for hope”—is declared early but remains abstract; the resurrection proceeds without meaningful tightening or trade-off, and the maze of intentions never tests Maya’s commitment with a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—reconcile vocation with abandoned dream—is signaled early. Bear’s approach supplies the single tightening beat, but Elian makes no on-page decision that forecloses an option; escalation is atmospheric, not tactical. Cost is implied, not visible, capping intensity below the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes—gaining hindsight clarity—tighten once when Lyra confronts her own false narratives; the deepening is coherent under the Accumulative lens, but the price is implied rather than palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes—“preserve ancient methods”—are declared but never tested on the page; no visible cost or narrowing of options occurs. The act of decoding is solitary and frictionless, so pressure plateaus. One soft tightening when fog thickens, yet it changes no tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—mapping the geography of healing—is signaled early. Pressure deepens through accumulative texture rather than causal turns; the act of writing becomes the tightening. Cost is felt in the snapped thread, but escalation is modest and largely internal.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.7)
    Single stake—restore beauty—is voiced early and tightened when assembly becomes irreversible; the palace’s thrum and the egg’s glow heighten stakes, and the final stillness carries undeniable, page-felt cost, satisfying accretive intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—healing a scarred world—escalates through accumulating sensory pressure rather than reversals; the grafting act is the single tightening beat. Cost is present but diffuse (emotional labor, ongoing vigil), not sharply dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—liberate trapped memories—is signaled early and tightened once when the glass shards confirm the path. Agency is present but low-grade; Aria follows rather than tests the trail. The cost (responsibility of guardianship) is declared rather than dramatized on the page, capping escalation below the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—transmit cosmic beauty without destructive fire—is declared early and held. Pressure tightens via image accumulation rather than choice; no on-page reversal or trade-off narrows options. Cost is conceptual, felt only in the final hush.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding grief’s shape—is signaled early and deepens as butterflies gather, but escalation is atmospheric, not causal; no option is foreclosed, no price visibly paid. The tightening is a cadence shift, not a decision.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes—self-forgiveness and shared balance—are declared not tested by an external dilemma. Single tightening scene (pick up handle → walk) lacks rising contradiction or resource loss; escalation is emotional, not causal. Agency is interior; no live option narrows in the scene window.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the echoes—is signaled early, yet pressure never escalates; the gardener’s task proceeds without complication or narrowing options. No visible price is paid; the crystal simply “hums” and understanding arrives.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—capture the broadcast to animate dust—is signaled early and tightened once when the lyrics clarify and dust responds. Escalation is accretive rather than causal, but the final swirl narrows options: the alcove is now a portal, solitude foreclosed. Cost is diffuse but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—Lena’s readiness to release the portrait’s emotional residue—emerges late and remains low-pressure. Escalation is a single soft deepening: the mask’s “longing” unsettles her, then she scatters. No narrowing of options or visible price alters later tactics; the cost is conceptual rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the “truth” beneath official narratives—is declared repeatedly but never tested in scene; no tightening choice or deepening forces Kael to risk or forfeit anything. Pressure is atmospheric, not causal. The story circles the same abstract conflict without escalation or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—preserving harmony amid vanishing arts—is declared early but never tested by an on-page obstacle; pressure remains static. No tightening choice or trade-off is dramatized; the final image reiterates rather than reweights the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake is Aria’s gentle rebellion against decay through creation; pressure rises elegantly via the celestial tide and seed’s imminent sprout. Cost is suggested—“a testament to beauty forged from the ruins”—but stays symbolic rather than sharp. One tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding the beehive’s failure—is signaled early. Pressure never escalates; the discovery is handed over via log rather than earned through risky action. No visible price is paid; the woman’s departure is frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding why some houses feel alive—is signaled early and deepens through the ritual. One meaningful tightening occurs when the shard amplifies perception, but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt, capping the escalation just above the 8-band threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—restoring meaning to the garden—is signaled early. Pressure deepens via accumulating historical fragments, but the cost is conceptual, not visceral. The statue’s agency is contemplative; no live option is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake (perpetual discovery) stays legible; each upward beat tightens to obsession’s spiral. One micro-turn—the roll’s randomness briefly ruptures deterministic hope—though the cost is largely conceptual rather than a live option surrendered.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—reviving lost languages through painting—is declared early. Escalation is textural: each brushstroke adds density rather than narrowing options. One meaningful tightening occurs when dawn forces cessation, but the cost is prospective (“return again and again”) rather than immediate. Agency is present but low-stakes; no irreversible forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—preserving cultural memory—surfaces early and intensifies as ice thaws to reveal bread histories. Yet the pressure is external (melting ice) rather than driven by Elena’s agency; she observes rather than acts. The tightening is more revelation than escalation of risk or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stake—unlock latent radiance—is declared early but never tested; pressure plateaus. The yoyo puzzle is the single beat, solved without visible trade-off. No escalation or narrowing of options under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.1)
    Stakes (“trick fear into revealing its weakness”) are declared but never tested; pressure plateaus after the mirror vision. No escalation or narrowing of options—protagonist is passive observer throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—transmuting landscape into music—signaled early. Escalation is textural: density of tones increases until silence becomes palpable. No concrete trade-off or loss is dramatized; pressure remains atmospheric rather than option-narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—uncover fate of expedition—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once via map reveal, but escalation is informational rather than option-narrowing; no visible cost paid by Lyra yet. Agency is present but abstract—she “sets out” rather than choosing under duress. Coincidence (crack reveals map) complicates but does not resolve, satisfying situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—rescuing truth from lies—is declared early, yet pressure never tightens; the archive yields its secret without resistance or trade-off. One micro-choice (picking up the letter) is not enough escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving stories against oblivion—is declared early. Pressure deepens via accumulative imagery rather than causal escalation; no single beat narrows options or exacts visible price. Closure is poetic but stakes remain abstract; cost is conceptual, not viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—uncovering honest origins—tightens once when the alternative hypothesis redefines the code. Pressure is intellectual rather than visceral; the cost is the irrevocable stamp mark, felt but understated.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—transmuting grief into light—intensifies via gem-polishing and crane-folding; pressure tightens once when Kaito releases the crane. Cost is lyrical rather than tangible, slightly blunting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—uncover a family secret while burdened by her own false histories—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the driftwood carving triggers a memory that makes the task personal. However, the escalation is atmospheric rather than causal; no option is foreclosed and no visible price is paid, so the tightening feels moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stake—“recycle mistakes into wisdom”—is declared early but never tested on-page; negotiations resolve off-stage. Pressure is atmospheric, not causal; no tightening choice or visible price is dramatized. The breakthrough is attributed to moon phases rather than negotiator agency.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—finding direction after divorce—is declared early. Escalation is gentle: compass fails → memory of pole trick → paddling. No tightening beat raises cost; the sea never tests him. Closure reconfigures stance but without palpable risk or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are declared—“kindle empathy”—but never tested or tightened. No reversal or deepening occurs; the path simply reveals itself. Pressure stays atmospheric, not actionable, and no cost is extracted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are declared—re-forge a bond, undergo metamorphosis—but pressure plateaus once the ritual begins; no tightening choice or cost alters tactics. The climax relies on cosmic spectacle rather than a narrowed option or forfeiture. Agency is largely ceremonial.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost parental time—is signaled early. Pressure tightens via associative deepening (memory → saucer → book) rather than a narrowing choice; no live option is foreclosed on the page. The final acceptance carries conceptual cost but lacks a visible price paid in the present scene. Escalation is textural, not causal.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.3)
    A single escalating stake—unlock the dimension—persists, but pressure never tightens via obstacle or fork; progress feels accumulative rather than conflict-driven, with no felt price paid for the final opening.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—“understand the texture of transformation”—is declared early, yet pressure never tightens; the prophecy gift resolves the tension without forcing a trade-off or visible price, leaving escalation flat.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.0)
    A single dominant stake—ignite the revolution—is declared early and achieved without meaningful tightening. No live option is foreclosed; the blackout merely enables rather than complicates. Agency is asserted, not tested; cost is absent on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—unlocking cosmic patterns via stardust—is signaled early and escalates through ritual precision; the final vision tightens options by revealing secrets, but the on-page cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt, keeping it just below the 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—self-reckoning via scars—is signaled early and deepened by storm-mirrored turmoil. Yet escalation is atmospheric rather than tactical; no concrete choice narrows options until the letter is opened, and that act carries minimal on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—“uncover the hidden overture to win the argument”—is signaled early and escalates through the fencing duel, but the tightening is intellectual rather than visceral; no concrete loss or forfeiture is dramatized. The sundial angles provide a causal escalation device, yet the cost remains abstract. Coincidence is absent, and agency is preserved, but the final victory feels unearned because the price is off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—finding refuge from grief—is signaled early. Pressure tightens only once, when she steps into the film world, but the beat is under-motivated and the cost is off-stage. Agency is largely observational; compasses flicker but do not force a trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—protect cultural memory before monsoon—is signaled early. Pressure escalates via iterative dream-interpretation montage, yet each beat feels interchangeable; no single tightening moment forces a trade-off or visible loss. Agency is diffuse, cost abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—finding the color of unspoken apologies—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the lace pattern crystallizes the apology hue, forcing the choice to release the compass. Cost is present (letting go of the relic) but understated; escalation is single-note yet coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens.

    Dominant stake (translating silence) never faces concrete test; "rectify discord" lacks escalation as tuning fork adjustment requires no meaningful trade-off or cost, reducing conflict to technical calibration.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.3)

Stakes remain abstract, unmoored from on-page choices.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake (understanding time) signaled early but pressure lacks protagonist agency—escalation driven by fragment's magic, not Elian's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes declared ("impede forces") but never tested—guards pose no real threat, allies signal conveniently. Zero escalation: pressure never tightens or forces trade-offs. Arrow/vault resolution feels coincidental, not earned by agency.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes ("to chart unseen paths") lack visceral escalation; cost ("ambered hush vibrated") feels conceptual but insufficiently dramatized. Pressure accumulates texturally without narrowing options or altering tactics under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (understanding thought origins) never tightens—Zeta’s passive observation lacks agency-driven escalation. No trade-offs or narrowed options; cost is abstract "realization" without visible forfeiture. Pressure dissipates in repetitive loop summaries instead of deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.4)
    No escalation: "unraveling the code" faces zero resistance; water damage "reveals" images effortlessly, making the conflict passive. Dominant stake remains abstract, with no narrowing of options or visible price paid during the process.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake ("swallowed truth") stays abstract despite early signaling; zero escalation under Accumulative lens—no tightening, deepening, or cadence shift narrows options as station inhabitants merely "grow accustomed," leaving conflict static and stakes untested on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (defeating numbness) tightens via humming intensification under Accumulative lens, but escalation lacks visible trade-offs; no tangible loss (e.g., physical strain, failed attempt) alters her approach.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes (recovering erased histories) lack escalation—no narrowing of options or visible price paid. Survivor’s "nameless identity" implies cost but remains undramatized; static pressure ("continued to layer") violates 8.8+ requirement for "visible price charging final image."

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake (preserving memories) signaled early, but escalation fails: "time runs short" is vague urgency without narrowing options or tactical shifts. Cost appears only at end as melancholy, unearned by prior pressure—no visible price paid during the "unsnarling" process.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.1)

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake (artistic renewal) signaled early but pressure lacks coherent escalation; fog's atmospheric presence never actively opposes her. No on-page tightening choice or deepening that alters tactics despite Lena's "spark reignite" moment.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes (certainty vs curiosity) tighten via sound-wave escalation into a vortex, narrowing Lena's options to embrace chaos.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (preserving names) static—song "coaxes emotions back" without resistance or narrowing options.

Accumulative density increase superficial without tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes (restoring trust) tighten through Accumulative pressure as glyphs reveal patterns, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the "breakthrough" happens passively ("words began to take on new significance"), and the felt cost ("silence dissipating") remains abstract without concrete on-page legibility like physical exhaustion or relational consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.2)
