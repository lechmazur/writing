  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake ("discover purpose") is signaled early but remains abstract and never faces a concrete on-page test. No tightening narrows options: the ledger strip reveals "a hidden message," she decides to retrace steps, frost "guides" her, and clarity "emerges"—all passive receivership without agency-driven reversal or visible cost. Coincidence (frost patterns echoing the code) complicates without pressure, and the resolution ("she had finally found her way") is declared rather than earned by a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—translating silence into music—is signaled early but remains abstract. No on-page reversal narrows options: the survivor and Eli work together, adjust frequencies, and succeed without friction or trade-off. "Rectify the discord" is mentioned but not dramatized as a cost or obstacle. The piece accumulates texture (vibrations, heat-map readings) but never tightens into a choice that forecloses a live path or imposes visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—giving rest a permanent address—is declared but never tested by a competing cost or narrowed option. The undertaker descends, repairs the lens, and restores the library without facing a single reversal, constraint, or trade-off. Escalation is replaced by summary: "weeks preparing," "years passed," and "task complete" evacuate all pressure from the closure window.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—community survival under sanctions—is signaled early but never tested by an on-page reversal or deepening. Akira's speech and the community's agreement constitute a single beat of affirmation without opposition, tightening, or cost. No choice narrows options; the sanctions remain abstract background. The story recounts past actions (midnight food runs, donations) in summary rather than dramatizing a present conflict that escalates or transforms.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—"to find where unused love is stored"—is declared but never tested by competing wants or live obstacles. The pilgrim provides the answer via breathing exercises without Aria risking, refusing, or paying a price. No reversal: she moves from curiosity → instruction → peace in a straight line. The "past life memory" surfaces off-page and imposes no present friction. Agency is absent; the protagonist receives rather than decides, and the resolution (feeling peace, knowing she will continue) forecloses no path with legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=3.7)
    The dominant stake ("discover the texture of time") is signaled early but never escalates or tightens through on-page choice. No reversal or complication arises; the fragment simply "begins to glow" and images grow vivid without Elian taking a risk, making a trade-off, or facing meaningful opposition. The resolution—gathering the fragment to use in future work—is stated intention, not earned consequence. Agency is absent: Elian observes and comprehends but does not act in a way that forecloses a path with legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake (distribute seeds to those who need them) is declared but never tested on the page. The liberator bypasses guards via unnamed "hidden pathways" and distributes seeds without opposition, cost, or tactical choice. The arrow as a signal from a fellow operative is mentioned once and never complicates or escalates pressure. No reversal or tightening occurs; success is narrated in summary ("as the seasons passed") without agency or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—capturing the sound of trust breaking—is declared but never tested on the page. No opposition, reversal, or tightening occurs; Lyra works, the sound "begin[s] to take shape," and she imprints it without complication. The prototype "hummed to life" as a convenient arrival rather than a choice that forecloses options. No visible price is paid; the ending offers forward-looking vision ("catalyst for growth") in place of present cost or escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake is declared as capturing "illuminated moments" and uncovering "destiny's secrets," but no on-page obstacle tests it. The couple remains oblivious; the flower code is deciphered instantly without friction. Lumina's agency is pure observation and a single photograph taken without consequence. No reversal, tightening, or cost alters tactics or narrows options. Coincidence (the convenient flower message) complicates the premise but does not escalate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake—"to craft safe zones for inquiry"—is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal, complication, or tightening forces Elian to weigh trade-offs or narrow options. The act of finishing the orb is completion without obstacle; no live choice, no visible price paid. The narrative summarizes purpose ("dedicated themselves") rather than dramatizing a decision under pressure that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the truth of identity after betrayal—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The decryption of the note offers one tightening beat ("the truth is in the shadows"), yet the message does not narrow options or force a trade-off; the protagonist simply decides to "step out of the shadows" with no visible cost or lost alternative. No resource is spent, no relationship tested, no tactic altered by the discovery. The final paragraph asserts readiness ("I was ready to face whatever lay ahead") without dramatizing a forfeiture or demonstrating escalation under pressure. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist agency drive a meaningful reversal or deepening that alters stakes on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=3.4)
    The stated stake—"draw a map of the endless night"—is declared but never tested on the page. No obstacle blocks the oracle, no option is weighed against another, no reversal tightens pressure. The storm "passes" off-stage without agency from the protagonist. The walk and return occur without friction, cost, or consequence; "the world was transformed" is narrated assertion, not earned escalation. Under the Accumulative lens, a single meaningful deepening or cadence shift is required; none appears.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—"to find where thoughts come from"—is declared but never tested on the page. The looped timelines are summarized retrospectively without on-page reversals or tightening choices. No visible cost or trade-off narrows options; the ending reports that Zeta "understood" and "found purpose" without agency, renunciation, or a decision that forecloses a path. Escalation is absent under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake—"to thaw mistrust with transparency"—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition, reversal, or cost. The registrar encounters no friction, makes no trade-offs, and forfeits nothing; she simply walks and feels resolve accumulate. The concert tickets are picked up and traced but generate no new complication or narrowed option. No meaningful tightening, deepening, or agency-driven escalation occurs before the summary ending.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=3.1)
    The dominant stake—"to prove that gardens know their gardeners"—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or reversal. No meaningful tightening, deepening, or turn narrows options; the dresser's actions (pruning, polishing, surveying) cycle without escalation or cost. Luck becoming measurable is mentioned but never constrains a tactic or forces a trade-off. The piece describes a static devotion without agency choices that foreclose paths or alter stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—proving time moves sideways—is signaled early but never tested on the page. Kaelin repairs the simulator without complication, activates it successfully, and touches the nexus without resistance or visible cost. No tightening or deepening occurs; the sequence is additive (repair → activate → touch → experience → return) rather than escalating. The "reluctance" to return is asserted in one line but immediately resolved without dramatized trade-off. Agency at closure (touching the nexus) is present but uncomplicated by competing impulses or prices.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=3.1)
    The dominant stake—unraveling the maestro's code—is signaled but never tested. No opposition or cost appears; Rachel tilts the program and the images "respond to her actions" without friction. The resolution arrives through passive observation rather than agency. What should be a climactic discovery ("the final words," "a sense of peace") is summarized rather than dramatized, and no option is foreclosed or price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—"to find the weight of a swallowed truth"—is declared but never tested through a concrete on-page obstacle or reversal. Aria's logbook note-taking accumulates without facing opposition or forcing a trade-off. The station inhabitants "watch with wariness" but never intervene, leaving pressure abstract. The resolution tells us she "grasped the truth" without showing a choice that forecloses a live option or imposes visible cost scaled to the quest.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—"to find the weight of a swallowed truth"—is signaled early and coheres across beats. Yet no escalation or tightening occurs: the explorer walks, listens to radio, discovers a logbook, and achieves satisfaction without friction, reversal, or visible cost. The radio-psychic interlude and valve wheel do not complicate or narrow options; they merely punctuate transit. No agency-driven turn forces a trade-off, and coincidence (stumbling upon the logbook) resolves the quest without earned causality. Pressure remains static rather than accumulating or deepening under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.5)
    No dominant stake is signaled or tested on the page. The chronicle keeper's task—to record events and witness change without judgment—faces no opposition, complication, or cost. The action of burrowing does not narrow options or force a trade-off; it simply continues the keeper's passive observation. There is no reversal, escalation, or tightening of pressure. The piece drifts through description and reflection without a visible price paid or a decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—Aria linking Eli to wonder and belonging—is signaled early but unfolds without meaningful tightening or reversal. Eli's arrival is the sole pressure point; he does not resist, question, or complicate the ritual, so Aria's music adapts without friction. The eclipse provides atmospheric escalation, not a dramatized choice that narrows options. No visible cost appears: Aria plays, Eli responds, they part satisfied. Under an Accumulative lens, one deepening or cadence shift is sufficient, but here the ending arrives as planned rather than earned through protagonist agency or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the silo's secrets—is signaled early but never escalates or tightens. Emilia encounters no meaningful resistance, no trade-offs, no cost; she simply reads, ponders, and departs satisfied. The "displaced axis" is mentioned as "a key to unlocking deeper meaning," yet this insight never narrows her options or forces a choice. No reversal or deepening occurs; the piece is a static procession of observations. The final departure carries no visible price or forfeited path.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=2.4)
    No dominant stake is signaled early or tested on the page. The Oracle "decides to orchestrate the meeting" but no opposition, trade-off, or tightening follows. The encounter is declared to "alter the course" but never dramatizes a reversal, price, or choice under pressure. The spycraft specs remain a curiosity with no escalating consequence. No meaningful escalation or cost legibility under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dominant stake—"unravel the stillness" and avert possession—is signaled early but never tested by reversal or tightening choice. The ritual proceeds in a single upward curve without narrowed options, trade-offs, or visible cost. Agency is limited to continued performance; no decision forecloses a path. The possession threat is resolved off-page ("had been averted") in summary, denying closure its earned cost. No escalation under the Accumulative lens; the soundscape "built to a crescendo" describes intensity without altering tactics or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—to "reignite the spark" and conduct unheard symphonies—is signaled early but never tested by on-page opposition or a live trade-off. The writer traces the map without impediment, exhaustion is mentioned as a future threat ("before exhaustion hits") but never materializes, and no reversal or tightening forces a choice that narrows options. Agency is passive observation; the resolution is declared rather than earned through protagonist alteration or renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake—"conquer the labyrinth of self"—is declared early but never tested through a choice that narrows options or exacts visible cost. The protagonist "overcomes" obstacles via "mastery of procedural generation" (told, not shown), and each reversal is resolved within its own sentence without escalation or trade-off. The ending announces victory and world transformation without a single dramatized decision or price. Coincidence does not resolve because agency never appears; the piece substitutes summary for pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=3.1)
    The dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness—is signaled early but never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; Aria experiments with drums and reversed melodies in a static loop, then the numbness simply "recede[s]" without agency or cost. The text declares "anticipation" and that "the air was heavy," yet no event escalates pressure or narrows options. Coincidence (the turning seasons) provides resolution rather than protagonist choice. No visible price is paid; the ending grants relief without dramatized struggle or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—whether to expose the laboratory—is signaled midway but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening occurs; the protagonist sits, ponders, and decides off-stage with no visible opposition or cost. The message arrives by coincidence (a pigeon landing), and the solution ("pieced together a coherent narrative") is summarized rather than dramatized. Agency is limited to passive contemplation; the story ends with declared intention rather than a choice that forecloses a path or incurs a price.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake ("impossible choices" facing humanity) is declared but never tested on the page through the poet's agency. She patterns stones and reflects, but no reversal narrows her options, no tightening forces a trade-off, and no visible price is paid. Escalation is absent; the night "wears on" and she "steps back" with "deep understanding" awarded off-page. The energy beings complicate nothing; coincidence does not even appear. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen via pattern break or cadence shift—none occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—"to find beauty in the unfinished"—is declared but never tested by a live choice that narrows options. The violinist's encounter with the storytelling group is coincidental, not driven by her agency, and the music "unbinds" sorrow without visible resistance or cost. No reversal or deepening: she arrives seeking beauty, witnesses warmth, plays, and departs affirmed, her tactics unchanged. The "chronic hush" lifts through assertion rather than protagonist action that forecloses a path. Coincidence delivers resolution without earned escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—crafting emotions for the fragrance chemist—is signaled early but faces no on-page opposition, cost, or tightening. The dealer simply works, finishes, and leaves without a reversal, complication, or decision that forecloses an option. No escalation occurs under any lens; "half truths" are declared but never tested against a counterpressure. The static emotional arc and absence of agency-driven turns prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—honoring silent contributors—is signaled midway but never tested. No reversal or tightening narrows options; Lena proposes community events, Sophia suggests a memorial fund, and their ideas "complemented each other" without friction. The mistaken envelope complicates nothing; it merely explains how they met. Agency is absent: no decision forecloses a path, no trade-off is dramatized. The ending recounts future plans ("began to make plans," "project took shape") in summary, erasing the present-tense pressure required for closure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—belonging—is signaled early but never tightened through on-page reversal or decision that forecloses an option. The tag search offers no meaningful obstacle or cost; it resolves immediately and easily. The arbor's community reception is summarized across years without visible price or tactical shift. No escalation or deepening under any identifiable lens.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—finding "the place where echoes are born"—is signaled early but never tested on the page. Lyra's spell succeeds without complication or reversal; the "interrupted cadence" she senses dissolves instantly. No meaningful tightening occurs: she aims to borrow time, does so effortlessly, and the giant's nap ending is framed as atmospheric rather than a source of tension. The resolution is convenience (she "knew she had found the place") without visible trade-off or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—unlocking "the mathematics of emotion"—is signaled early but remains abstract and untested by genuine friction. The ritual produces "a spark of understanding" without a visible trade-off, failed attempt, or cost that alters tactics. The "ambiguous loss" and "buried optimism" are emotional labels rather than dramatized pressures that escalate or deepen. No reversal or tightening choice narrows options on the page; the conjurer's agency is observation and contemplation, not decision under duress. The resolution (walking away with "buried optimism") is told, not earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—becoming visible—is declared but never tested. No reversal or tightening forces a trade-off; the dweller's work proceeds without resistance, loss, or adaptation. The city lights return, patrons arrive, treasures are noticed, all confirming the dweller's intent without friction. Agency requires foreclosing a path with cost; here the protagonist observes and arranges without consequence, yielding outline-like progression.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—Emilia's desire to transform—is signaled early but never tested by a reversal, trade-off, or visible price. The storm season "rages on" in summary without forcing a single tightening choice. Agency is absent: no decision, renunciation, or endurance forecloses a path with on-page cost. The piece declares escalation ("profound transformation," "deeper sense of purpose") without dramatizing a beat where options narrow or knowledge changes.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding the brooch and convergence—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the stranger's knowledge reframes the brooch as a catalyst for the water wars, narrowing the painter's understanding. However, the stranger appears conveniently at the end of the chase without prior setup, and the exchange itself is summarized rather than dramatized, dulling pressure at the peak. The resolution (creating art) feels thematically apt but the cost is abstract ("weight… bearing down") rather than a visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake—Aria's connection to unseen forces—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. The pilgrim's gift amplifies rather than complicates; no reversal or tightening narrows options. Aria's abilities simply "expand" without friction, and her "task" to magnify everyday magic is declared rather than forced by pressure. The piece lacks agency: no decision, renunciation, or endurance forecloses a path with on-page cost. Escalation is absent; the arc is one of passive enhancement.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—compiling fragments to help the community heal—is signaled early but never tested by on-page opposition or a live trade-off. The archivist encounters no resistance, resource scarcity, or competing priorities; the shopkeeper's "flicker of understanding" evaporates into cooperation. The community gathers and shares stories without friction. No reversal narrows options, and the resolution ("the community had been heartened") is summary declaration rather than earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=2.4)
    The dominant stake ("to find the fortress of unspoken truths") is declared but never tested by on-page pressure or a meaningful tightening that narrows options. Emilia walks forward without opposition, reversal, or trade-off; the phantom train ticket punch and arrow-cracks guide her passively to the goal. No escalation occurs—each step is functionally identical, and the climax (reaching the fortress) is summarized in abstract language ("secrets unfolded like a map") without dramatized action or visible cost. The resolution is convenience plotting: luck and ornamental objects solve the quest without protagonist agency, renunciation, or endurance that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—to unlock entangled memories via transcription—is signaled early but never faces a concrete test or trade-off. Emilia searches, finds the tile, transcribes symbols, and completes the task without reversal, obstacle, or visible cost. No tightening narrows her options; the whale songs and patterns "harmonize" conveniently, and the resolution ("peace settle over the tower") is delivered rather than earned through agency. Coincidence (finding the tile in a hidden compartment) initiates action but no protagonist decision drives escalation or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—discovering what happens after goodbye—is signaled but never tested by a choice that forecloses an option. Kael's manipulation of the magnetic fields and the duplicate's emergence occur without resistance, trade-off, or visible cost. The story escalates in declarative intensity (colors deepen, energy surges) but the escalation is scenic rather than causal. The resolution grants Kael knowledge and renewed purpose without requiring sacrifice, error, or renunciation; convenience plotting undercuts pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=4.9)
    The declared stake (political asylum for a client) never tightens on the page—the father's offstage "negotiation" and the director's unseen "reconsideration" deny escalation through protagonist agency. Lena's arc from passive observer to willing accomplice lacks a credible on-page cost or choice that narrows options. The "breach of protocol" is announced as imminent but never enacted, leaving no reversal or visible price. The mathematics-of-a-fair-trade motif is conceptual rather than dramatized through competing goods or unavoidable harms.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=3.4)
    One dominant stake—collecting textures—is signaled early, but it never faces opposition, tightening, or cost. The stationer completes her dawn charting, then walks and charts again; each beat is additive without escalation or trade-off. No reversal or deepening occurs; the lamp's hum fades simply because dawn ends, not because of protagonist choice. The resolution is not earned by any alteration or renunciation; she continues her work with no visible price paid or path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=3.6)
    The declared stake—reconstructing erased histories—is never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; the survivor collects fragments in a frictionless glide from beginning to end. The label is "carefully stored away" without cost, and the task is marked "complete" by authorial fiat rather than earned consequence. Coincidence does not complicate; nothing opposes or escalates.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake (decode the universal riddle) is signaled early but remains abstract and never narrows options or faces a concrete test. No on-page reversal or tightening occurs; the protagonist's actions (raising shell to ear, drawing it across cello strings, listening) unfold in a linear sequence without escalation. The climax is a declared triumph rather than a choice under pressure. Coincidence does not complicate, but neither does protagonist agency drive escalation—the "ephemeral compass" simply materializes without visible cost or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving the city's essence against gentrification—is signaled in paragraph five and repeated frequently. Yet escalation is absent: Ava begins leaving messages, the messages spread, unity grows, and the residents "stand ready" in a smooth accumulation without reversal, tightening, or on-page cost. No moment forces Ava to choose between competing goods or pay a price that alters later tactics. The "privatization deadline loomed" at the end, but no decision, renunciation, or act narrows options or forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—photograph endangered flora before it vanishes—is signaled early but never tested by competing pressures or scarcity that forces trade-offs. Dr. Patel's timed message warns of harsh conditions, yet Elara faces no on-page obstacle, resource limit, or tactical adjustment; she simply "set[s] up her camera equipment" and succeeds. The chemical-reaction timer "synchronize[s] her shots with the fleeting moments of optimal lighting" but this convenience arrives without prior setup or cost. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the mission proceeds as planned from start to satisfied finish.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—fixing the drone's navigation—is signaled early but never tightened or tested. Emilia encounters no setback, false lead, or trade-off; she methodically adjusts and succeeds in a single meditative arc. The ship's maiden voyage is presented as coincidental rather than a complication, and no agency-driven reversal or deepening alters her tactics. The final calibration tweak is told as a fait accompli ("she knew that she had succeeded") with no on-page cost or foreclosed alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—finding the convergence—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the condensation pattern is decoded, narrowing her search direction. However, no on-page reversal or visible cost alters tactics afterward; the decoded message simply permits continuation rather than forcing a trade-off. Agency at closure is continuation, not a decision that forecloses a path. The Cost clarity test in the final third is not met: no visible price or loss appears on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake ("restore shared balance") is signaled early but never tightened by opposition or cost. The tuner walks, the fork hums, the town stirs—no reversal, no choice that forecloses an option, no visible price paid. Accumulative lens allows for deepening via pattern break, but the rhythm remains uniform from first step to dawn without escalation or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—preserve the temple's memories before the energy dies—is signaled early, but pressure never tightens: no reversal or obstacle tests Kael's method, and "time runs short" is asserted twice without on-page consequences (no failed attempt, no tool loss, no tactical shift). The perfume vial pulses brighter "with each passing moment," but this is atmospheric rather than causal escalation. Agency is minimal; Kael works "with frenzied intensity" and succeeds in a summarized beat, bypassing the moment where cost or trade-off would be legible. The ending offers melancholy reflection, not a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=3.5)
    A dominant stake is declared ("uncover the truth") but never tested on the page—no reversal, tightening, or choice narrows options. The boy's journey is a tourist walk without agency: he notices scuffs, touches a lock, and stops. The phrase "before they found the bodies" suggests urgency but is never linked to a tactic or cost. No escalation under any lens; pressure is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—unlocking resonant awakenings—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. The alchemist's discovery occurs through passive contact with the bead; no decision narrows options or forces a trade-off. The ghost bride's presence is atmospheric rather than an active pressure that the alchemist must navigate. The resolution ("debt slowly being repaid") is told in summary without an on-page tightening or reversal that forecloses a live path. Coincidence (touching the bead) resolves the central problem it did not help create.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"to carve a path from ruin to reverence"—is declared but never encounters on-page opposition or tightening. Aria sews without friction; no reversal, deepening, or tactical shift occurs. The fabric glows, the night passes, dawn arrives—outline sequencing without pressure escalation. No visible cost, forfeiture, or trade-off appears; the resolution is asserted in summary ("her work was complete") rather than earned by protagonist agency under the selected lens.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (restore lost faith) is signaled but never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs—Maya excavates smoothly across weeks with no setback, cost, or forced trade-off. "The process was meditative" and she "felt her mind begin to clear" summarize rather than dramatize pressure. The resolution is asserted ("rebuilt something within herself") without agency-driven choice or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—completing an encoded letter—is signaled early but never tightens or deepens through reversal. No on-page opposition or friction tests Cipher's commitment; the process unfolds as smooth meditation. The final act (sealing the envelope) carries no visible cost or foreclosed alternative. Escalation under an Accumulative lens would require density increase or pattern break; neither materializes. Agency is present (transcription, folding) but uncontested.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake ("unravel conspiracies before the coup") is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or visible trade-off occurs—the embroiderer works without obstacle, and the chart's completion is narrated as success without dramatized cost or foreclosed option. The urgency is asserted ("sense of urgency," "just in time") but pressure remains static; no choice narrows tactics or changes knowledge under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—"to find the moment before deciding"—is declared but never tested on the page; no choice narrows options or forecloses a path. The apparition's appearance and dissipation occur without Aria's agency driving escalation; she "spoke to the apparition" in summary, and it "began to dissipate" with no causal link to her action. No reversal or tightening changes what Aria can or must do. The "weight lifting" is told, not shown as a cost that alters her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—grafting new meaning onto old wounds—is signaled but remains abstract; no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options. Kael "decrypts" the cast's message but the process and its content are summarized, not dramatized, and the result does not alter her tactics or foreclose a live option. The anesthetic provides a time pressure in principle but is used only to blur vision at the end, not to force trade-offs. Agency is observation and reflection, not decision with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—rediscovering lost joy through art—is signaled early but never meaningfully tightened. Lena encounters no on-page reversal or complication; the fragment's discovery, the exposed film's transformation, and the mural's success all proceed without resistance, trade-off, or visible cost. The resolution is declared ("she knew that she had rediscovered the lost joy") rather than earned through a decision that forecloses a path or alters tactics under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"what lay beyond the boundaries of her carefully restored murals"—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. Lena's mirror-work proceeds without failure, and the mural's transformation arrives as reward rather than trade-off. The "nested awakenings" and "crumbling certainty" are told in summary ("with each successive reflection, she felt") rather than dramatized through a choice that narrows options. No visible price is paid; the ending grants curiosity and pride without forfeiting anything on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=2.4)
    The dominant stake (protecting freedom of expression via coded messages) is declared but never tightened or tested. No on-page reversal, escalation, or cost appears—Lyra succeeds frictionlessly across all beats. The thoughts-tax legislation is told as background; no moment shows her losing stamina, social credit, or facing a surveillance threat. Agency is absent: she plants, waits, and her reputation grows without a single choice that forecloses a path with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—transforming pain into beauty—is signaled early but never encounters meaningful resistance or a trade-off. The poet sings, feels solace, and drifts into slumber without a visible cost or narrowed option; coincidence (the postcard slipping out) triggers reflection, but no reversal or deepening occurs. The piece lacks an on-page moment where the protagonist's choice forecloses a path or forces a price. Escalation under the Accumulative lens requires density increase or pattern break that reweights the stake with cost; here the mood simply shifts from longing to peace without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake ("preserve the sound of forgotten names") is signaled but never tested by a live on-page obstacle. No reversal, tightening, or deepening narrows options; the caretaker's song succeeds without friction, and the orchids glow. The final paragraph restates the opening condition with no escalation or cost. No agency choice forecloses a path; the task simply continues unchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—restoring trust after a misinterpretation—is signaled early but never dramatized through a live test or trade-off. Elara works alone without opposition, and the "symphonies of truth" reveal themselves without escalation or reversal. The warning "before paths diverge" implies future cost rather than forcing an on-page choice that narrows options now. Agency is limited to endurance (continuing work), and the resolution (breakthrough completion) arrives without visible forfeit or altered tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—harmonizing conflicting values—is signaled early but never tested on the page. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the encrypted message "finally begins to reveal" without dramatizing the attempt, failure, or trade-off. Kaelin's resolve "deepens" by assertion rather than agency-driven escalation. The ending grants unity and compassion without showing what she sacrificed or which value she prioritized. Escalation is absent under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=4.6)
    A dominant stake—maintaining secrecy while seeking connection—is signaled but never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening choice, or deepening occurs; Emilia performs her routine (attaching messages, watching dust motes) without opposition or escalating cost. The story tells us she "learned to trust again" across months without dramatizing a single decision that narrows options or forecloses a path. The final readiness is declared ("Emilia was ready") rather than earned through agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—"to discover why some thresholds feel sacred"—is declared but never tested by a choice with visible trade-off. The protagonist wanders, examines the logbook, follows a path, and finds the father without opposition or cost. No reversal, tightening, or escalation occurs: the terrace "shifts and morphs" but the protagonist's options never narrow. The ending grants the goal (reunion, understanding) without requiring renunciation or payment, and no persistent constraint shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=3.1)
    The dominant stake ("to learn the rhythm of belonging") is declared but never tested on the page; no opposition, constraint, or reversal narrows options. The astrologer's task unfolds as a sequence of passive sensing ("began to sense," "connection grew stronger") with no decision, renunciation, or trade-off. Pressure remains static throughout; the final paragraph asserts success without demonstrating cost, loss, or a foreclosed path. Coincidence does not complicate because nothing complicates at all.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.5)
    The stated stake—discovering why paths disappear—faces no on-page opposition or tightening; the scattered seeds provide a frictionless trail to the answer. No reversal or narrowing choice occurs; the protagonist walks, hums, follows, and finds. The climax is a tell-only epiphany ("flux and transformation") without a visible price paid or an option foreclosed. Agency is observational throughout; the recollectionist never decides between competing goods or unavoidable harms.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.6)
    One dominant stake is signaled: creating a captivating performance through orchestrated serendipity. No meaningful escalation or tightening occurs; the performance succeeds without complication, the audience applauds, and Elian packs up to repeat the cycle. No reversal, deepening, or cost that narrows options. Agency is absent—Elian's choices do not foreclose a path or impose visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=3.9)
    The stated goal—to capture cosmic essence in art—faces no on-page opposition, trade-off, or cost. Aria's dance proceeds without reversal or tightening; the verse simply appears "etched on her skin" as a reward for completion. The "nostalgia ban" is mentioned as backstory but does not complicate her present action. Agency is absent: no decision alters tactics, no credible loss shapes the outcome. Pressure remains flat; escalation does not occur under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=2.1)
    No dominant stake is dramatized or tested on the page. The declared motivation—"illuminate value in the mundane"—remains abstract and never forces a trade-off or tightening choice. The fisherman's stone creates visual ripples but no reversal, escalation, or narrowing of options. The protagonist's "sense of urgency" to "capture the essence of this moment" is told without consequence or visible cost, and no decision alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—Kael seeking enlightenment or transformation—is signaled but never tested. No reversal or tightening choice narrows his options: he walks, opens the box, reflects, and continues walking with unchanged trajectory. The declared internal conflict (pain, lost innocence) generates no on-page trade-off or visible cost. Coincidence does not resolve because nothing resolves; pressure remains static throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake—"puzzle out new equations for hope"—is abstract and never tested by a concrete on-page dilemma. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the visionary sequence is presented as affirming rather than complicating. Aria faces no trade-off, loss, or escalating cost. The story declares transformation ("crucial step forward") without dramatizing the pressure or price that would earn it.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding the estate's secrets—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal, tightening choice, or visible cost appears: the cartographer seeks, finds, reads, and continues with no narrowed options or forfeited path. "Legacy's burden" is theme-claimed, not dramatized as a trade-off. Coincidental discovery (film strip hidden in plaster, diaries in fireplace) supplies information without the protagonist's agency shaping escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake ("persuade mirrors to show possibilities") is declared early but never tested by concrete opposition or cost. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the painter paints, hums, and the mirrors "respond" without dramatized resistance or trade-off. The resolution is wish-fulfillment—"she knew that she had succeeded"—with no on-page agency, no price paid, no path foreclosed. Coincidence (the coded lullaby just works) resolves the conflict, and the protagonist's choices do not alter tactics or outcome under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—brokering peace—is declared but never tested by a concrete dilemma or reversal. No antagonist applies pressure; delegates simply "began to open up" without visible resistance or cost. The piece lacks escalation: the atmosphere "grew more charged" and voices became "more conciliatory," but these are assertions rather than dramatized turns. Agency is passive throughout; Elian observes and feels rather than choosing between competing goods with on-page consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring the land—is declared but never tested on the page. No opposition materializes; the "complex web of interests" is mentioned but never encountered. The protagonist walks to the center, raises her hands, and succeeds without obstacle, cost, or tightening. The drought and powerful interests are told-only context; no on-page reversal or escalating pressure narrows her options. Agency is absent: the climax is a summary gesture with no visible trade-off or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.1)
    Dominant stake ("defy the lullaby of conformity") is signaled early but never tested on the page. The untangling unfolds without opposition, cost, or reversal—each thread releases "echoes" in summary, no concrete price paid. The prism's glow arrives as external event, not protagonist agency. Escalation is asserted ("lighter, freer") rather than dramatized through a choice that narrows options. No tightening forecloses a live path or forces a trade-off with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.5)
    The stated stake—"to explore the ethics of storytelling"—remains abstract throughout; no ethical dilemma materializes on the page to test her commitment. The piece presents a single continuous action (working on a puppet show) without reversal, complication, or tightening that narrows options. Her prior "subversive puppet shows in seedy bars" are mentioned but never pressured by consequence or constraint here. The ending offers renewed purpose without visible cost—she has completed a creative session and will return, but no path has been foreclosed or trade-off made. Agency is setup and departure, not decision under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories—is declared but never tested on the page. Aria faces no opposition, makes no trade-off, and encounters no reversal; she builds structures and departs without narrowing options or paying a visible price. Escalation is absent: the story proceeds in a single affirmative register from meditative opening to meditative close. No agency decision forecloses a path, and coincidence does not even appear to complicate.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve forgotten names—is signaled early but never tested. Akira works "undeterred," the rope reconfigures successfully, and the hum emerges as desired. No reversal, trade-off, or visible price appears; the "painstaking" process is told rather than shown with escalating friction. Coincidence does not resolve because no problem arises. The ending asserts accomplishment without cost legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—discovering why paths choose walkers—is signaled early but remains abstract and never tested by a concrete trade-off or reversal on the page. The storm intensifies in parallel to the dream dive, yet no tightening narrows options; Hindsight moves through the dreamscape "with grit" and emerges enriched without visible sacrifice or foreclosed alternative. Coincidence (the storm's timing) frames the action but does not resolve it, and no protagonist decision alters later tactics or costs.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=2.4)
    Stakes are declared ("seal a covenant") but never tested on the page. No reversal, no tightening choice, no trade-off. The astronomer decides to raise a tile and the cosmos complies without resistance or complication. Escalation is replaced by a static crescendo of poetic assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—teaching release from resentment—is declared but never tested through resistance or trade-off. No on-page reversal narrows options; the audience shifts from pain to peace without dramatized friction. Elara's "moment to act" involves no visible cost or tactical adjustment. The ending's summary spans years without a single choice that forecloses a path or deepens pressure under any coherent lens.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—capturing a runaway dream—is declared but never tested on the page; no on-page obstacle resists her. The sequence is additive: she feels grounded, breathes, gathers materials, and succeeds without reversal or tightening. Synchronized breathing and sextant use could narrow options or impose cost, but both appear as smooth enablers. The ending reconfigures meaning (boundaries erased), yet the transformation lacks agency-driven escalation or visible price paid during the process. One outline-like deepening (dream becomes mirror) is present but unearned by prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—bridging generational wisdom—is declared but never tested by a meaningful on-page reversal or cost. Elara's work proceeds without opposition, failure, or tradeoff; the orchard thrives without setback. The seeds solve the problem they did not help create, and Aria's return is coincidental rather than earned by protagonist agency. The "accidental wisdom" framing undercuts intentional escalation, leaving pressure flat across the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—pursuing forbidden knowledge—is signaled early but never tested by a competing cost or live opposition. The robed figures appear cooperative, the curator follows without internal friction, and the breakthrough is granted rather than earned through a choice that narrows options. No reversal or tightening forecloses a path; the curator's final "sense of purpose" is asserted mood rather than a decision with visible price. Coincidence (stumbling upon the grove, being led to the bathroom) drives progression without protagonist agency shaping the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake (finding the library) is declared but never tested with a visible tradeoff. The shadowy pursuers create declared tension ("closed in") yet resolve without consequence. The renegotiation beat is summarized in a single sentence without depicting terms, cost, or the time traveler's hesitation. No meaningful tightening or choice forecloses a path with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=4.2)
    Dominant stake (find the Garden) is signaled early but never tightens—Lyra encounters clues, reads fragmented stories, and the ship drifts her to the cove without agency-driven reversal or trade-off. "Memories alter" and "past and present began to blur" gesture at complication yet dissolve without on-page consequence. No visible price forecloses a path; the "trapped freedom" metaphor remains decorative. Escalation is asserted ("drawing her closer," "getting close to the heart of the mystery") rather than dramatized through narrowed options or contested moves.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake ("translate confusion into clarity") is stated but never tested by on-page opposition or cost. No reversal or tightening forces Emilia to trade one value for another. The professor's rope work proceeds without complication, and the "hidden pattern" is simply revealed rather than earned through agency. Coincidence (the professor waiting, the rope already present) drives resolution without protagonist struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—restoring balance to the harmonic caves—is signaled early and remains coherent. The mapkeeper's examination of crack patterns provides one meaningful tightening (noticing the subtle shift), but escalation is weak: the energy beings adjust their resonance in response to her work without resistance or complication, and no on-page choice narrows her options or forces a trade-off. The "bloom of hush" arrives as a result of her study, but the cost is invisible—no visible price, no foreclosed path, no endurance with consequence. Pressure remains static rather than building to a charged final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—rekindling lost knowledge—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs: the custodian walks, touches objects, and succeeds without opposition, trade-off, or narrowed options. The shard "retrocognitively blessed" grants understanding without cost; the orrery lights on touch without friction. Coincidence (finding the shard, the orrery responding) resolves rather than complicates. No on-page escalation under the Accumulative lens; pressure remains flat from opening to close.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving collective memory—is signaled early but remains abstract and uncontested. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the archivist encounters no obstacle, doubt, or competing pressure. The storm clears conveniently, memories flow without friction, and she departs peacefully. Agency is observation, not decision with cost. No escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—overcoming creative hopelessness—is declared but never tested by a concrete on-page choice that narrows options or imposes cost. The fire-spinner observation and mosaic note function as external encouragements rather than reversals that force trade-offs. No tightening occurs; the narrative remains a sequence of observations that lift mood without escalating pressure or crystallizing a stance. The "surge of serious playfulness" is asserted rather than dramatized through a decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=3.5)
    The stated stake—"to discover the texture of time"—remains abstract and is never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or meaningful choice narrows options; the chronicler observes, ponders, and continues pondering. The two figures' pause offers potential conflict but is kept at a distance; their resumption of conversation does not involve the protagonist or create consequence. No agency (decision, renunciation, endurance with cost) forecloses a path. Coincidence neither complicates nor resolves because nothing resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—overcoming claustrophobia by collecting silence flavors—is signaled early and remains coherent. Yet no on-page tightening narrows options or forces a trade-off: Eli releases the doll, closes their eyes, absorbs silences, and opens to find peace arrived without friction. The inversion hour passes without complication, and the resolution ("no longer the dominant force") is granted rather than earned through protagonist agency under pressure. Cost is asserted ("one step closer") but no visible price—stamina, attention, a rejected alternative—alters tactics or charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—teaching silence to comfort—is declared early but never tested by opposition, complication, or tightening. The operator glides without obstacle; no reversal narrows options, no secondary pressure forces trade-off. The day simply ends with mission "accomplished" and residents "comforted," all asserted without dramatized consequence. Agency is observation and transit, not decision with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (reclaim the throne) is signaled early but never tested by a competing want or visible cost. Aria encounters no reversals, no forced trade-offs, no moment where the quest demands sacrifice or failure. The ruby flake and murals deliver solutions on cue; the staircase simply appears. Pressure is asserted ("weight of her quest") rather than dramatized through narrowing options. The ending grants success without demonstrating what Aria risked or lost, leaving escalation ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—reviving the fading threshold—is signaled early but never tested by a meaningful reversal or tightening that narrows options. The keeper's journey is a smooth descent without obstacles; the flame responds immediately to touch, offering no resistance or cost. No agency-driven escalation occurs; the sanctuary "stirs" and transforms passively. The resolution is told ("the keeper's task was complete") without a visible price or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—translating pressure into diamonds—is signaled early, but escalation is absent. Lyra experiments, machines behave erratically, pressure builds, then diamonds rain down without a reversal, tightening choice, or visible trade-off. Coincidence (the glitchy messages) enables the resolution rather than protagonist agency narrowing options. No on-page cost forecloses a path; the ending grants success without renunciation or price, failing the escalation and cost-clarity tests under any inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake ("uncover a hidden truth") is declared but never tested with on-page reversals or trade-offs. The text lists sensations and visions ("standing waves," "muses whisper") without any moment where the protagonist must choose between competing goods or pay a visible price. Pressure is asserted ("the dynasty ender's journey") rather than escalated through narrowing options or agency under cost.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake ("capture the shape of possibility") is signaled but never tested by on-page opposition or cost. The knight's actions (finding the program, murmuring allegiance, unsnapping the catch) proceed without reversal, resistance, or trade-off; each step succeeds as described with no tightening of options. The "shimmering entity" manifests and merges with the knight without any visible price paid or path foreclosed. Agency is present (the knight initiates actions) but no decision forces a choice between competing goods or unavoidable harms, and the ending celebrates acquisition rather than confronting loss.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—magnifying small kindnesses—is signaled but never tested by a conflicting priority or visible cost. Emilia encounters no opposition, resource limit, or trade-off; the work simply unfolds as described. No meaningful tightening occurs; the final paragraph asserts hope and purpose without dramatizing what was risked or foreclosed. Coincidence does not complicate, but neither does agency drive escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake ("resist tyranny of indifference") is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening occurs; Aria walks to the lagoon, finds allies, speaks, and departs without opposition, cost, or altered options. The "plans unravel" timeframe is told but not dramatized—nothing fractures, no tactic fails, no price is paid. Coincidence assembles the gathering; protagonist agency is absent. Zero escalation under any lens; pressure remains static from first to last line.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=3.7)
    The dominant stake ("hush the prophecy") is signaled early but never escalates or tightens. No reversal, complication, or cost appears; the music succeeds without friction, and the mist cooperates. Agency is absent—no choice forecloses an option, no trade-off is dramatized. The piece proceeds in a straight line: play → mist calms → task complete. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or pattern break is required; none occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—decoding the message in falling leaves—is declared but never tested with a concrete obstacle, trade-off, or reversal. The seed sorter encounters no failure, resistance, or cost; she simply works, realizes, and succeeds off-page. The "prophecy of great change" is summarized rather than dramatized, and no on-page tightening forces a choice that narrows options. Pressure remains flat from beginning to end; escalation is absent under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—Elian seeking direction and clarity—is signaled early but never tightened or tested. No on-page reversal or escalation: the compass rose appears, guides his hands without friction, and the device completes successfully with no setback, sacrifice, or complication. The resolution ("felt a sense of clarity") is declared rather than earned through agency or cost. Coincidence (finding the heirloom) enables rather than complicates, and no price is paid for the transformation, violating the core escalation and cost requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—Elara's quest to redeem herself—is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the narrative compresses months into summary without a single moment where she faces a trade-off or pays a visible price. Agency is absent; transformation happens off-stage. Pressure remains static, and the resolution is asserted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—guiding a trapped soul to peace—is signaled early but never tightens or deepens through a meaningful reversal. The collector approaches, listens, hums, and the woman's energy dissipates without resistance, trade-off, or visible cost. No escalation under the Accumulative lens: the harp's discordant notes grow louder, then the collector's counterpoint calms them—opposition vanishes rather than narrows options. Agency is observation and presence rather than a decision or renunciation that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—confronting trauma to understand mercy—is signaled early, but escalation is weak: Elara walks into the forest, remembers pain, then grasps the truth without a meaningful tightening that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The forest "responding to her presence" and light "growing brighter" imply accumulative pressure, yet no on-page reversal or cost-legible choice occurs. The ending asserts relief ("sense of peace") and closure ("I remember") without demonstrating what was risked or forfeited. Agency defaults to endurance rather than decision with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake ("to honor overlooked histories") is declared in paragraph 17 but never tested on the page. No on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off; Lena moves from spotting the fragment to purchasing it to pondering it to descending with it, all without opposition, cost, or a meaningful tightening under any lens. The story asserts escalation ("vibrating with newfound intensity") but provides no causal trigger or price paid. Coincidence does not complicate; nothing complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the circus's secrets—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. Ezra's investigation proceeds smoothly: dust → compartment → logbook → ghosts solidify → exit. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows her options; the ghosts grow "more distinct" without consequence. The resolution is achieved through observation alone, with no agency-driven choice or visible price paid. "Weightless burden" names an emotional state without dramatizing the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=3.8)
    The declared goal (compress eternity into a moment) arrives past the midpoint and is never tested by opposition or scarcity. No on-page choice narrows options; the operator proceeds unopposed from discovery to final print without reversal, trade-off, or visible price. The whisper's release and the library's transformation unfold as atmospheric effects rather than escalating pressure, and the success is asserted in summary ("the operator knew that they had succeeded") without dramatized cost. Under the Accumulative lens, no density increase or cadence shift reweights the stake at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the asteroid's true history and resolving the dispute with colleagues—is signaled early and sustained. The shard discovery provides one meaningful tightening (a potential key to the truth), and her persistence through the storm deepens commitment. However, no on-page reversal or escalating cost (a colleague's interference, a resource limit, a discovery that challenges her thesis) tests her commitment with a visible trade-off. The ending crystallizes her new identity, but the path there accumulates rather than escalates.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—repair a music box that never played—is signaled early but remains abstract: what is at risk if Erebus fails is never made concrete. The "moment of truth" and "balance between sound and silence" are asserted rather than tested through a visible narrowing of options or a forced trade-off. Under the accumulative lens, density increases toward the box's song, but no on-page cost or reversal alters Erebus's approach or forecloses a path; the resolution feels inevitable rather than earned by protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—uncovering compass secrets andlagoon mysteries—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; the protagonist walks, receives visions, follows the needle, deciphers symbols, and achieves unity in a straight line. The compass "points towards a hidden grotto" and she follows without cost, alternate desire, or complication. Agency is reception, not decision, and the resolution is granted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.4)
    No dominant stake is signaled or tested. Aria seeks inspiration, finds it, and creates—no option is foreclosed, no tightening narrows her path, no price is paid. The "storm raging around her" poses no threat to her work or safety. Agency is absent: the slide arrives by coincidence and her response is passive reverie rather than a choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding nocturnal blooming—is signaled early but never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or cost-laden choice occurs; Luna sits, gazes, and eventually "began to understand" without friction. The lens (accumulative/textural) allows deepening via pattern, but no cadence shift or density increase reweights the stake. Escalation is absent, and the ending grants satisfaction without visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—uncovering encrypted diary secrets—is signaled early but never tested by on-page pressure. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; Naomi watches Ada, "begins to understand," and the codes "yield their secrets" via summary rather than a choice that narrows options. The "tension between revelation and secrecy" is asserted in narrator voice without a dramatized moment where Naomi pays a cost or forecloses a path. No agency-driven escalation under the Accumulative lens; the piece presents atmosphere without a pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dominant stake (ghost town revival) is signaled early but never tested on the page. The story presents pure contemplation followed by a decision to act, with no obstacle, reversal, or competing pressure. "The task was daunting, but the alchemist was undaunted" explicitly negates conflict. The ending offers summary ("the town began to flourish") rather than a single dramatized cost or tightening moment.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=4.0)
    The dominant stake—archiving emotional patterns—is signaled early but remains abstract and untested. No on-page opposition, reversal, or tightening narrows the scribe's options; the work proceeds smoothly until completion, with only asserted unease ("velvet disquiet," "trepidation") substituting for dramatized pressure. The "accidental prophecy" is declared as a phenomenon but never forces a choice or exacts a visible cost; the scribe's agency is observation and continuation, not a decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the vortex inheritance—is signaled early. The cap-blowing triggers visions, a meaningful tightening, but the protagonist remains passive observer throughout the sequence: "she saw," "she felt," "she realized." No on-page reversal forces a trade-off or narrows options; the decision to "spend the rest of her days tending to the vortex" is declared intent without visible cost or forfeited path at closure. The visions of past paradise and future wasteland raise conceptual stakes but never test the seed saver's commitment through a difficult choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding the sanctuary's microclimate—is signaled early and sustained, but escalation remains gentle and observational rather than driven by protagonist agency under pressure. The switch from sirens to bell represents a reorientation rather than a high-cost choice; no live option is foreclosed, and the "new role" feels granted rather than fought for. The solstice hush moment ("threshold, a zero hour") gestures toward escalation but delivers hesitation without a decision that narrows tactics or raises felt cost, keeping the piece in the functional-but-limited band under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=2.9)
    No dominant stake is dramatized; the janitor's "task" is to clean and empathize, but neither goal faces opposition or cost. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs—the protagonist sweeps, reflects, and departs unchanged. The claim "to find strength in vulnerability" is told repeatedly but never tested through a forced trade-off or visible price. Escalation is absent under any lens; coincidence does not even appear because no events complicate the protagonist's drift.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=4.5)
    The stated stake—preserving unspoken words—is declared but never tested. The recluse encounters no obstacle, competing pressure, or cost when opening the box and reading the letters. Tears fall, but no visible price (time, safety, relational trade-off, foreclosed option) is dramatized. The ghosts stir and then disperse without complicating the recluse's goal. The narrative is a sequence of observations with no tightening, deepening, or agency-driven escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—"understand the texture of time passing"—is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the timekeeper's task remains static from opening to close. Agency is observation without decision cost. The "response to one of their messages" hints at discovery but immediately deflates into summary ("their understanding grew") with no live dramatization or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—discovering beauty in the incomplete—is signaled but never tested by on-page pressure. The poet encounters no opposition, makes no trade-off, and faces no cost; she simply receives beauty passively. The kite-string snap offers a potential complication but deflates immediately without altering her stance or tactics. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs under the Accumulative lens; the protagonist's agency is limited to walking away after a completed epiphany. Under the chosen lens, one deepening or cadence shift that narrows options is required; none appears.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"foster interspecies respect"—is declared but never tested on the page through a dilemma, reversal, or choice that narrows options. No escalation occurs; the work proceeds smoothly ("the orchard began to transform," "flourished") without friction, failure, or visible cost. The terminal diagnosis could tighten urgency but instead functions as background context; no scene shows the caretaker weighing time against ambition or sacrificing one task for another. Agency is absent: the protagonist observes and records outcomes rather than making decisions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding the chemistry of homecoming—is signaled but remains abstract and untested throughout. No reversal or tightening occurs; the skeptic walks, contemplates, and arrives at an entity without obstacles, opposition, or meaningful narrowing of options. The final "convergence" imposes no visible cost or trade-off; the skeptic's "excitement and trepidation" are told, not dramatized through choices that foreclose paths. Coincidence (following footprints to an awaiting entity) drives the resolution rather than protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=3.4)
    A single dominant stake—restoring the land—is declared but never tested or complicated on the page. The coachman encounters no obstacle, dilemma, or cost; he "carefully selects" and "begins to fertilize" without friction. No reversal or tightening narrows options. Agency is absent: the protagonist enacts a pre-set ritual without adaptation, renunciation, or visible price. The resolution is summarized in future tense ("land would flourish") rather than dramatized as a change in present options or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake (finding the spring to revitalize the wasteland) is signaled midway and drives the journey. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lyra deciphers the riddle, narrowing their options to a specific destination. However, the journey itself is frictionless—no obstacles, resource constraints, or competing costs appear. The resolution (arrival at the spring) is earned by persistence but not by a choice with visible trade-off; luck (the spring exists and is reachable) resolves the quest. Agency at closure is contemplative (sitting, feeling connection) rather than decisional.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—Aria seeking to understand the flickering light and move beyond confusion—is signaled early. One tightening occurs when the compass aligns with the light and she begins sketching, narrowing her stance from aimless wandering to purposeful action. However, no visible price is paid; the "trepidation and excitement" are told rather than tested. Agency at closure is a first step forward with asserted promise, not a choice that visibly forecloses an alternate path under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake (restore celestial balance) is signaled early but never tested—Moonwhisper encounters no opposition, makes no trade-offs, and the swap succeeds on first attempt. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; "treacherous ice tunnels" are traversed without incident. Agency is present in the decision to proceed, but the resolution is frictionless and the cost invisible, failing escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=3.5)
    No dominant stake is signaled early or tested by a concrete reversal. The characters stand facing each other, a historian appears, they agree to an alliance, and walk together—sequence without escalation or cost. The proposed "unbind the past" quest never forces a trade-off or forecloses an option on the page. Coincidence (historian's arrival) initiates movement but no protagonist agency drives a turn, violating the lens requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—finding the lost language stone—is resolved instantly without opposition or cost. No reversal, tightening, or trade-off narrows options. The seer's magic to "seed a new reality" introduces a new capability at the end without setup or price. Coincidence solves the search ("a faint glow caught her eye"), and no agency forecloses a path with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (self-forgiveness) is signaled early but never tightens through a live trade-off or reversal. The tutor decodes the tapestry, walks to the labyrinth, and emerges forgiven in a linear sequence without escalation or cost legibility—no option is foreclosed, no price paid on the page. The labyrinth is described as "a maze of reflections" but no specific choice or renunciation occurs inside. Agency is missing: the resolution arrives through symbolic transit rather than protagonist decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=3.6)
    Stakes are declared ("uncover a truth," "ritual looming") but never tested in scene. No on-page reversal, tightening, or choice narrows options; the artist recites poetry and receives a vision without agency or cost. The "price of forgiveness" is posed as a rhetorical question, not dramatized. Coincidence (mist parts, spire reveals symbols) resolves the quest without protagonist action. No escalation or visible trade-off under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—decipher the statue before oxygen runs out—is signaled early and tightens through the breath-hold window. The matching task provides a concrete goal, but we never see a reversal or forced trade-off; Kaelin simply completes the task and surfaces. The phrase "dire enchantment" suggests high stakes, but the escalation is asserted ("desperate," "edge of oblivion") rather than dramatized through a choice that narrows options or raises cost.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=3.4)
    A dominant stake is never signaled or tested on the page. The painter paints at sunset, stumbles into a cave, decides to paint the oasis, then succeeds without friction. The "hidden promise to follow her own path" is told but never forces a trade-off—no live option is foreclosed with visible cost. No meaningful tightening or escalation under any lens; the mirror's crack is referenced as a turning point but occurs off-page in the past without present consequence. Coincidence (wrong turn) introduces the oasis; the painter's agency does not drive the discovery or complicate her path.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—"to prove that whispers travel farther than shouts"—is declared mid-story but never tested by an on-page reversal, obstacle, or trade-off. Elian beckons to the universe, feels energy build, then reports peace and purpose with no live option foreclosed or cost paid. No antagonist, no failure, no choice that narrows tactics. The beckoning action and garden scent are presented as successful without friction, rendering escalation non-existent under any lens. Agency is absent; the protagonist observes his own uncontested ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—navigate loss and reclaim the past—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page reversal or tightening forces a trade-off; the navigator simply walks, listens to calls, and arrives at peace. Cryptic messages offer "tantalizing clues" but never create a complication that alters tactics. The ending delivers acceptance without visible cost: no renunciation, no path foreclosed, no agency tested. Pressure is declared ("perilous journey") but not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=3.6)
    The stated stake—experimenting with rumored cures to temper involuntary honesty—is introduced late and never tested on-page. No reversal or tightening: the forager finds the glass eye, finds the cache, reads the book, and leaves; each beat adds information but no narrowing of options or trade-off. The "dark history" of the relic is summarized, not dramatized. Agency is observational; the decision to "continue to cultivate psychological safety" is asserted in the ending without visible cost or a prior choice that forecloses another path.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—decoding the stranger's gesture—is signaled early but never tightens into a live choice with visible cost. Kael's "investigation" involves passive observation; no reversal narrows his options or forces a trade-off. The stranger's departure and Kael's retrieval lack the escalation or deepening required under the Accumulative lens; pressure dissipates rather than crystallizes, and the final act feels like acceptance rather than a decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—fulfilling her father's promise—is declared but never tested by a reversal that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The trials in the cavern are summarized in one sentence ("each one testing her resolve") rather than dramatized with visible cost. No moment where Emilia must choose between competing goods or pay a price that alters later tactics. Escalation is asserted ("confidence grew") without on-page demonstration.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—unraveling the mystery of recurring dreams—is signaled early but never tested on the page. The queen's climb is unopposed: no reversal, no trade-off, no visible cost paid en route or at the ending. The companion, the darkness, and the bleeding starlight apply atmospheric pressure but no concrete obstacle that narrows options. The withheld "truth" at closure means no agency, no renunciation, and no foreclosen path is legible. Under any lens, escalation is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=3.6)
    Stakes are declared ("unlock secrets," "capture the density of presence") but never tested or tightened on the page. No reversal, cost, or trade-off appears; the alchemist works without obstacle, and success is summarized rather than dramatized. Coincidence does not complicate, but neither does agency—she simply "finished her work" with no visible price paid or option foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—"to distill chaos into narrative"—is declared but never tested by opposition or scarcity. No reversal occurs: the protagonist begins writing, continues writing, and finishes successfully. "Feral nostalgia" is named as a driver but does not narrow options or force a trade-off. The narrative substitutes summary of internal process ("the hours blurring together") for on-page escalation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=3.1)
    No dominant stake is signaled or tested on the page. Elara's motivation "to unveil ordinary miracles" is narrated thematically but never faces friction, cost, or a conflicting want. The screw-handling beat and fog-walking beat are meditative observations without reversal or tightening. No agency (decision, renunciation, endurance with cost) appears; the story moves and-then through reflection without escalation. Pressure remains static from opening to close.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—deciphering runes and recording hidden stories—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. Pressure is atmospheric (tremors, whispers) rather than escalatory; no reversal or trade-off narrows Kaito's options. The held breath offers a brief intensification, yet the writing flows "effortlessly" without visible obstacle. The closure shows satisfaction rather than a cost that alters future tactics. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is present (stillness to whispers to writing) but lacks a felt price that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake (reconnect with Astra) is signaled early but never escalates or tightens on the page. No reversal occurs; Lyra finds the bottle, deciphers the code offstage ("her mind weaving together the threads"), and the apology is sent via summary ("the air seemed to still"). The orchard's impending destruction is set up as a ticking clock but never intersects with Lyra's task or forces a trade-off. Agency is absent—no choice forecloses a path, and no cost is legible in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—unraveling cosmic illusions—is declared but never tested on the page. No opposition, scarcity, or competing good forces a choice with visible cost. The "universe's hiccup" is a convenience event that begins and resolves off-stage; Aria's walking and reading face no friction. The ending asserts success ("distortions cleared") without showing a single live option foreclosed or a tactic altered by prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=3.5)
    The stated stake—"to understand what clocks really measure"—remains abstract and untested; no scenario forces a trade-off or narrows options. Counting backwards is described but never creates friction or cost. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; the shepherd ends as watchful as he began. Escalation is absent under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—helping her father overcome addiction—is signaled early but never tested on the page. Elara faces no opposition, makes no trade-offs, and encounters no cost that narrows her options. The graffiti phrase and probability theory remain tools she considers, not pressures that force a difficult choice. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the ending restates her initial intention without escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=3.5)
    A dominant stake is signaled early (maintaining friendships through wrong numbers), but no on-page pressure escalates or tightens. The operator notices a pattern of repeat callers, but this observation triggers no complication, no reversal, no choice with cost. The loop is described as continuous without any meaningful turn or deepening that narrows options or changes knowledge. Coincidence does not even complicate; events simply recur without escalation, and no visible price is paid.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake ("preserve the weight of small moments") is declared but never tested by a competing pressure that narrows options. The archivist sits, gazes, walks away—no reversal or tightening forecloses a path. The summary leap to "years later" replaces on-page escalation with told outcomes. Coincidence does not resolve because nothing is resolved; the piece ends in static contemplation.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—finding the cure for loneliness—is declared in exposition but never tested on the page through a choice that forecloses an option. The "plan" (whispering rumors) happens off-stage; we see only summary ("atmosphere began to shift," "people coming together"). No reversal, tightening, or visible price alters Raven's tactics. The resolution—"they would never be alone again"—is asserted without dramatized cost or agency at the closure beat. Coincidence (the moon rock's "mystical properties") enables the outcome rather than protagonist decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—finding the stillpoint to understand emotional depths—is signaled early but never tested or tightened. No reversal, no complication, no trade-off; the mapmaker follows the melody and arrives without meaningful obstacle or agency-driven escalation. The journey is a straight line with pauses for description; coincidence (the notes grow louder) guides rather than protagonist choice. Closure lacks visible cost: the mapmaker gains insight without forfeiting anything on the page, and the stated sorrow/loss remains unaddressed in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding the pen's potential—remains abstract and unfolds without meaningful resistance or tightening. Aria encounters no opposition; the pen unbends and functions on first attempt, the ink flows effortlessly, and cosmic whispers cooperate. The misadventure with weeds is summarized background, not on-page complication. No reversal or deepening narrows options; the protagonist's agency at closure (dipping pen, writing) costs nothing visible—she gains power without forfeiture. Escalation is assertion rather than dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=3.5)
    The declared stake—"translate silence into music"—never faces on-page resistance or a choice that narrows options. The advisor "maps silence," "weaves the silence into a melody," and the crowd gathers, but no reversal, tightening, or cost alters tactics. The old man's cooperation is immediate; no obstacle tests commitment. The resolution is not earned by protagonist agency but by atmospheric description of a "symphony of silence" that simply happens. No visible price is paid, no path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.1)
    The dominant stake—rescuing the forgotten promise—is declared but never tested on the page. No antagonist, obstacle, or competing desire forces Elian to weigh costs or make a trade-off. The narrative summarizes artistic creation over "days" without a single beat where a reversal tightens options or a resource constraint (time, material, access) alters tactics. The ending announces resolution ("the promise that they had kept") without showing what was risked or paid to achieve it. Escalation is entirely absent; pressure flatlines in continuous summary.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—"breathe life into a shared dream"—is signaled early and coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs: drumming → lagoon responds → vision crystallizes → peace settles. Yet the escalation is more intensity of glow than narrowing of options; Aria's agency is continuous drumming rather than a forced choice with visible trade-off. The "auroral sorrow" fleetingness is noted but does not compel a renunciation or alter her path. The treatment context (experimental guinea pig) sets potential stakes but never tests them on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—proving whispers travel farther than shouts—is signaled early but never tested on the page. No escalation or tightening occurs; she walks, finds objects, encounters a stranger who whispers, then leaves. The stranger's whisper is told to carry farther, not shown through acoustics or distance. No option is foreclosed, no tradeoff dramatized, no visible cost paid. Agency is observational wandering, not decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake is never signaled concretely—"silent empathy" and "teach darkness the value of stars" remain abstract declarations without an on-page dilemma that narrows options. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; the guardian watches, the figure weaves patterns, they share "understanding," and part without friction or trade-off. Coincidence (the figure's emergence from mist) complicates nothing. Agency is absent: no decision alters later tactics, no visible price is paid.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—launching a "humble rebellion"—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or trade-off. Elian conceives the window-display plan in a single beat without complication, and the displays succeed off-page with no visible cost, failure, or adaptation. No reversal narrows options; pressure remains flat from inciting image to resolution. Agency is thought ("orchestrate...in his mind") rather than decision or renunciation that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—Kael's hunger to "find freedom in embracing her true nature"—is signaled early and present throughout. The whale's call provides a tightening moment, drawing her into the water, but the escalation feels more lyric than causal: the scrimshaw glows, the darkness envelops, the heart unlocks. No on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off with visible cost; the swim resolves tension rather than deepening it. The "disappearing island" as a state of being arrives as realization, not through a choice that forecloses a prior path. Agency reads as responsive (heeding the call) rather than a decision with a legible price.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"cultivate lightness in grief"—is declared but never tested by a reversal or tightening that narrows options. Echo's actions (whittling, foraging, narrating) occur without opposition or escalation; no on-page event forces a trade-off or demonstrates cost. The text describes an ongoing emotional project ("their art continued to evolve") rather than a single meaningful deepening or turn. Agency remains offstage; no protagonist decision alters tactics or forecloses a path with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=2.1)
    No dominant stake is dramatized or tested on the page. Lyra's desire to "stride through boundaries" is declared but never opposed, complicated, or made costly. The piece presents a single unvarying mood—contemplative observation—with no reversal, tightening, or deepening that narrows options. Agency is absent; Lyra passively receives inspiration and leaves. No meaningful escalation under any lens; coincidence and convenience drive the experience without earned cost or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—finding beauty in imperfection—is signaled but never tested with a trade-off or narrowing choice. The painter's motivation is asserted, not dramatized through want-versus-fear conflict or escalating pressure. No reversal: he arranges plants, others observe, the courtyard "became a hub" off-page. Coincidental inspiration (glassblower merely watching) substitutes for protagonist-driven escalation. No visible cost forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=3.4)
    The stated stake—"to discover the texture of connection"—remains abstract and is never tested by a concrete obstacle or trade-off. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the bell ringer simply moves through the laboratory coaxing forth melodies without opposition. The final "deep sense of satisfaction" is declared, not earned through prior causality or visible sacrifice. Coincidence does not intrude, but neither does agency; the protagonist encounters no meaningful resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake ("teach withering to bloom again") is signaled early but never tested on the page through a choice that costs something tangible. The jewelry maker performs ritualized actions (leaving origami, crafting a brooch) without facing a complication, reversal, or tightening that narrows options. Pressure is declared through metaphor ("curtains began to glow," "stars shone with increased intensity") rather than dramatized through agency or consequence. No meaningful escalation or deepening under any lens; the arc is a smooth upward trajectory from grief to peace without friction or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=3.5)
    The stated dominant stake—mapping cultural patterns post-cryptocurrency crash—is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or choice narrows options; the cartomancer works steadily through the night without opposition, setback, or cost. The piece summarizes her method and motivation but dramatizes no pressure that would force a trade-off or alter tactics. Agency is observation and notation, not decision with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—pursuing forbidden knowledge—is declared but never tested on the page. The historian receives the pagoda without conflict, gazes into it without obstacle, and emerges transformed without cost or trade-off. No reversal, tightening, or deepening narrows options; the colleague's arrival and gift impose zero pressure. The resolution is a summary of her later work, not an earned choice or renunciation with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving hope against encroaching shadow—is signaled early but never tested on the page by a forced trade-off or narrowed option. The protagonist studies footage, notices a pattern, feels determination, and walks away; no reversal or tightening alters her tactics. The shadow remains abstract metaphor rather than embodied opposition. Agency at closure is intent to share findings, not a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=3.4)
    The stated stake—balancing self-respect and compassion—remains abstract and is never dramatized through a choice that forces a trade-off or forecloses a path. No escalation: the night unfolds as meditative observation without reversal, tightening, or deepening that changes Lena's options. The chameleon's presence and Lena's reflection loop without raising cost or narrowing what she can do next. Agency is entirely internal and declarative ("she felt," "she knew"), never tested by an external complication or moral calculus with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake ("learn to read the stories in scars") is declared but never tested; no on-page obstacle or reversal forces Elian to alter tactics or pay a price. The dig proceeds without complication, and the chamber opens without earned cost. The ending asserts "closure" and "first step" without a tightening or deepening that forecloses a path. Coincidence (the chamber simply appears) replaces protagonist agency at the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake—"to find where unused love is stored"—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or cost. The protagonist's "mission to uncover the secrets" proceeds without obstacle, failure, or competing pull. No reversal appears; the vision simply unfolds, then ends. The "weight of unused love lifting" is told as outcome rather than earned through a choice that narrows options. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift that reweights the stake with felt cost is required; here the accumulation remains flat and the exit restates the entry without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is declared but never tested by an on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options. The dreamer performs a nightly ritual without encountering friction, opposition, or internal conflict that would escalate pressure. The resolution is asserted in summary ("barriers...begin to dissolve") rather than earned through agency or visible cost. No meaningful deepening or causal turn occurs; the story advances through "and then" sequencing and atmospheric description.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"cultivating the sparks"—is declared but never tested by opposition, scarcity, or trade-off; Asa faces no failure, resistance, or cost on the page. The archive "pulsing in harmony" and the dune "responding" provide atmosphere but no reversal or tightening that narrows options. The reactivation of the clock and the bloom intensifying are sequential description, not escalation driven by protagonist agency. No visible price paid or path foreclosed; the ending resets to her walking away with the archive "safe."

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"to rediscover the wild frontier of your mind"—is declared but never tested on the page. No meaningful tightening, reversal, or cost emerges; the philosopher walks, ponders, translocates, and returns with no visible price paid or option foreclosed. Pressure remains static across the entire piece. The ending declares insight achieved without dramatizing what was risked or lost to gain it.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"to find where unused courage waits"—is declared but never tested by an on-page reversal or trade-off. The star-stamp vigil is a ritual of commitment, but no prior want or fear forces a sacrifice; the travelers consent without visible hesitation or cost. The journey unfolds as unobstructed passage: mist swirls, they walk, Eira leads, they arrive. No tightening narrows options, no agency decision forecloses a path, and the ending delivers safe arrival rather than earned transformation or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake ("to understand the cost of safety") is signaled early but remains abstract and un-tested on the page. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options: the bellhop stands watch, sees a figure tighten a bolt, then returns to contemplation without a choice that forecloses a path. The figure's appearance could serve as pressure but dissolves without consequence. Escalation under the inferred Accumulative lens requires density increase or pattern break; instead, the text loops similar reflections ("silence," "cost," "strength") without reweighting stakes or crystallizing a final stance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—unmask the pretender—is declared but never tested on the page. Kael works "tirelessly" in pure summary; no reversal, no tightening, no moment where a message fails or the pretender adapts. The "final confrontation" telescopes from anticipation to "revealed in all their duplicity" without showing the exchange or its cost. Agency is absent: luck and exposition resolve everything off-stage. No escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—discovering why paths disappear—is signaled early but never tested on the page. Maya's actions (assembling drum, tapping, reviewing logs, making a map) proceed without opposition, reversal, or visible tradeoff. The final paragraph asserts she's found truth "in the rhythms of the sea itself" without demonstrating what was at risk or what she gave up to reach that realization. No meaningful escalation or tightening under any lens; the piece drifts without consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—rediscovering purpose after the rebellion's lull—is signaled early but never tightens with genuine opposition or cost. The journey to the circle unfolds without complication; the hum simply delivers the desired effect without the protagonist choosing between competing goods or paying a visible price. No on-page reversal or deepening alters her options; the resolution is handed to her rather than earned through agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—finding the embryo—is signaled early but never tightens options or forces a trade-off. Akira encounters no opposition, miscalculation, or cost; each step (spotting the kite, decoding, retrieving the orb, unsealing) unfolds as smooth discovery. The plants' agitation and her telepathic surge are atmosphere, not pressure that narrows choices. No reversal or deepening occurs; the resolution is granted without protagonist sacrifice or error.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—finding solace after trauma—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure is atmospheric rather than escalating: Amira walks, observes, feels tension ease, and departs with resolve. No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options; the arboretum grants relief without requiring trade-off or renunciation. The "pearl of stillness" moment registers as an internal shift, but lacks visible cost or a decision that forecloses a live alternative. One meaningful deepening occurs (stillness achieved), satisfying minimum scope, but agency is passive.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake ("What was the purpose of art?") is declared but never tested on the page through a choice with competing costs. The untangling action is summary-only; no reversal or tightening forecloses an option. The resolution ("redesign...complete," "darkness was not an end, but a beginning") is told, not earned through protagonist agency. Coincidence does not complicate because no complication occurs—the process is frictionless summary.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.5)
    The stated stake—understanding time dilation—is philosophical rather than situational, and no cost accrues when Kael "finds" the answer. There is no on-page reversal: Kael tracks, approaches, touches, and receives insight in a smooth glide. The missing person offers zero resistance or complication. The "glimpse into the mystery" is handed over in a single beat without tightening, trade-off, or visible price. Agency is observation, not decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—provoking conversation by releasing contraband truths—is signaled early but never faces on-page resistance or complication. Aria's action (transmitting the letter) occurs in a single paragraph with no reversal, trade-off, or visible price; the story immediately leaps to summary aftermath ("outrage and curiosity," "the world above the library would never be the same"). No antagonistic pressure, no escalation of cost, and no agency-driven tightening; coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=3.4)
    No dominant stake is tested on the page. Aria's desire to "weave continuity through chaos" is declared but never faces opposition or a trade-off; visitors come, marvel, leave, with no cost or complication. The sword on the wall is mentioned twice but never becomes a live option she must refuse. No reversal, tightening, or deepening narrows her choices or changes her knowledge. The escalation bullets require at least one pressure point; none appears.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—catching the goddess's echo—is signaled early but never tightened or tested. No on-page obstacle, reversal, or competing pressure forces a trade-off; the fisher walks, performs her ritual, and succeeds without friction. Coincidence does not complicate because nothing complicates. The narrative declares escalation ("the garden's energies gathering") but no protagonist decision or environmental resistance narrows options or raises cost before the echo is granted.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the scandal and freeing the family from "orbits of regret"—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options: Adelaide begins determined to intervene and ends equally determined, with no dramatized obstacle, miscalculation, or trade-off. The journalist's allegations are referenced but never tested; "proof by contradiction" is declared as a method yet no assumption is overturned on the page. Agency is intention without cost; the final descent and smile assert progress but do not foreclose a path or demonstrate a visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—hushing guilt via her art—is signaled but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the firmware whispers simply recede when she uses the cord without visible cost or trade-off. Clients report peace in summary, not scene. The letters' sorrow and the tattooist's guilt are told to converge ("she felt a kinship") without an on-page action that forecloses a path or crystallizes a stance.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—"to discover meaning in the mess"—is signaled early but remains abstract and never narrows to a concrete on-page test. No reversal or tightening forecloses a live option; the artist simply continues working until she "felt a sense of resolution." The tile flake's arrival could complicate, but she integrates it without friction. Agency is present in the form of "interject[ing] a subtle change," but no visible price is paid and no path is foreclosed. Under the Accumulative lens, one decisive intensification is required; none lands with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—"to cradle empathy in arms of steel"—is signaled early but never tested on the page; Aria faces no opposition, cost, or trade-off. The act of renaming occurs without escalation: no option is narrowed, no price is paid, and no reversal follows. The retrocognitive vision and the discovery of the tessera could complicate or deepen pressure, but instead they trigger only internal monologue. The ending asserts transformation ("the plaza was slowly being reborn") without demonstrating a before/after in Aria's options or the environment's state. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should cohere through density or pattern break; here it diffuses into repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake ("repair the fractured timeline") is declared but never tested on the page. Echo encounters no opposition, makes no trade-offs, and faces no reversal—she "begins to weave the echoes," the garden obligingly shifts, and the timeline "began to repair itself" without visible cost or complication. The piece substitutes atmospheric description for escalation. No agency, no price, no tightening under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—Luna's desire to devise a new creative method after the telepathy pill recall—is signaled early but never tightens or deepens through opposition or cost. No reversal occurs; Luna moves smoothly from examination to meditation to light painting without a misstep, loss, or forced trade-off. The recall is mentioned as a setback that "had become a catalyst for her growth," but this reframing happens in summary rather than through on-page struggle, and no live option is foreclosed by her choices. The story lacks escalation under the accumulative lens because no density increase or pattern break reweights the stake with felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—charting the unknown and becoming its voice—is declared early but never tested on the page. Aria encounters no opposition, risk, or trade-off; she walks, senses, and discovers beauty without friction. The narrative presents exploration as smooth accumulation rather than escalation with cost. The closure ("she was at peace," "ready to share") asserts fulfillment without demonstrating a tightening that foreclosed an option or exacted visible price. Under any lens, pressure must cohere and deepen; here it disperses into ambient wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"to spin a prophecy into raw possibility"—is declared but never tested by an on-page dilemma that narrows options or imposes cost. No reversal or tightening occurs; the turner catalogs buttons in a repetitive loop without escalation, opposition, or trade-off. The ending grants the goal without agency, renunciation, or visible price. Coincidence does not complicate; nothing opposes.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—"to find where unused courage waits"—is declared but remains abstract and never tested by on-page obstacles. The spy's search for codes in snow is abandoned immediately when the mist clears and a path conveniently appears, bypassing any escalation or complication. The meeting with her other self occurs without resistance or cost; no option is foreclosed, no price paid. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure should tighten through pattern breaks or intensity shifts, but the piece moves in a straight line from arrival to symbolic resolution without meaningful reversal or deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake—waiting for the traveler and fulfilling the "palimpsest promise"—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal or tightening occurs; the woman simply arrives as expected, boards, and they cross. The coachman's needlework and reflection do not narrow options or force a trade-off. The resolution ("stepped off the ferry, into a world that was full of possibility") is coincidental rather than earned by protagonist agency, and no visible or felt cost is legible on the page. Pressure remains flat throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—understanding resistance to change—is signaled by mid-story but remains abstract and internal. No reversal or tightening narrows options: Akira ponders, thrums, aligns with timelines, and arrives at an answer without obstacle or trade-off. The smoke's dispersal and the thrum are atmospheric rather than causal levers. Agency is present (she chooses to take the glass and leave) but the choice costs nothing on the page—no foreclosed path, no visible price. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake ("bring light into darkness") is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal, no tightening choice, no cost that narrows options. The rosebush's pruning is complete by paragraph two; the rest is atmosphere and summary. Coincidence (the boat's rhythm) provides mood, not complication. No escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"translate isolation into independence"—is told in paragraph six but never tested by a choice that narrows options. No on-page reversal or tightening occurs; Lyra polishes the sundial across uniform paragraphs without escalation. The "brittle awakenings" concept is invoked repeatedly but does not drive a decision. The ending's "weight lifting" and smile are summary, not agency with visible cost. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost is required; none appears.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—Lena's desire "to find the thread that connects all things"—is signaled early and pursued through observation and contribution to the art installation. However, escalation is minimal: no live option is foreclosed, no meaningful resistance arises, and the resolution (realizing connection is created, not found) arrives without visible cost or a choice that narrows her path. The art installation complicates her journey but does not force a trade-off or transform her tactics under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=3.4)
    A dominant stake (stopping cosmic tricksters) is declared early, but pressure remains static—Lyra tunes dials, finds a pattern, sends a counter-signal, and succeeds without reversal, complication, or visible trade-off. No on-page cost: the resolution is summarized ("reports of strange occurrences dwindling") rather than dramatized. The piece reads as outline beats linked by "and then" rather than escalating pressure under a coherent lens. Agency is present but consequence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the lost chronicles—is signaled early, but pressure remains static throughout. Lyra encounters no meaningful obstacles beyond a locked door, resolved instantly with the compass. The crystal's "spatial mutiny" complicates the scene but resolves itself without Lyra making a choice that forecloses options or pays visible cost. The ending recounts a transformation ("claustrophobia melting away," "newfound understanding") rather than dramatizing a turn where agency narrows stakes or alters outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake: the artist's quest to pierce her own "emotional numbness" via the detective's cold-case empathy. One tightening occurs when the ribbon fragment prompts the detective to explain and the artist to reflect, yet the move is reflective rather than a decision that narrows options. No visible trade-off or foreclosed path appears on the page. The detective "disappears into the mist" without agency testing commitment; the artist packs up with renewed purpose asserted but not earned through on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—uncovering hidden truth—is signaled early but never tested or tightened on the page. No reversal, trade-off, or foreclosed option appears; Emilia simply accumulates clues and continues. The declared uncertainty and "unsettling sense of kinship" are asserted in summary rather than dramatized through a choice with visible cost. No meaningful escalation under any lens—just iterative description of her determination.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=3.5)
    Dominant stake—recounting hidden story after amnesty—is signaled but never tested by on-page opposition or cost. No reversal or tightening: the fiddler contemplates, plays, feels lighter, leaves. The music's effect is declared transformative without showing what was risked or lost. The hitchhiker's disappearance, though mentioned as catalyst, remains off-stage summary. Pressure is static throughout; the ending asserts legacy and inspiration without demonstrating what changed or what was foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding why paths circle back—is signaled early but never tested through a concrete on-page choice that narrows options or imposes cost. Kael sorts foreign paper money, notices territorial markers, and reflects on his startup's fall, yet no reversal or tightening forces a trade-off. The accumulative texture does not deepen into a moment where agency (decision, renunciation, endurance) forecloses a path. Escalation under the Accumulative lens requires a pattern break or cadence shift that reweights the stake; here the final beat simply restates prior reflections.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake—decoding the temple inscriptions—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. Lyra works steadily; no reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs. The "breakthrough" hinted by the telegram is never dramatized, and the inscriptions "begin to reveal their secrets" without struggle, trade-off, or visible price. Agency is passive observation; coincidence (the telegram, the timing of dawn, the stars "guiding") complicate atmosphere but do not resolve conflict because no conflict materializes on the page. Pressure never escalates; the arc is contemplative summary rather than escalation with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—"discover what mirrors don't show"—is declared but never tested through on-page pressure or competing costs. The druid walks forward unopposed; the "grotesque" trees and "hostility" are described but never act. The ice-shattering moment arrives without escalation, consequence, or tactical choice; touching simply works. The "flesh-eating plant seed" is mentioned twice as "pulsating" and "stirring" but never used, never weighed, never at stake. No reversal, no foreclosed option, no felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"to find the intersection of dreams"—is declared but never tested by a live obstacle, trade-off, or cost on the page. Aria encounters no opposition, makes no difficult choice, and experiences no reversal; the topiary "shifts and reforms" to reveal the glade without her agency. The visions at the tree are granted, not earned through sacrifice or struggle. The ending asserts future possibilities rather than delivering a crystallized consequence or foreclosed path. No meaningful escalation under any drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—"to patch holes in her soul"—is signaled early but remains abstract; no concrete loss or trade-off tests it on the page. The spell-weaving sequence unfolds without reversal, complication, or visible price; darkness "began to recede" without agency or sacrifice. No tightening, deepening, or cost materializes—pressure is asserted ("the air thickening with otherworldly energy") rather than dramatized through narrowed options or forced choices. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist action; the orchard "responds" passively.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming purpose after public failure—is signaled early but never tested on the page. The phone call offers a potential tightening (an amplifier appraisal that could force Jack to confront his failure) but the conversation's content is withheld and summarized, eliminating any live pressure. No reversal or narrowing occurs; the ending's "spark of determination" and decision to "make notes" are assertions without dramatized cost or a path foreclosed. Coincidence (the caller's timing) sets up the potential conflict, but the piece resolves it by declaration rather than scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=3.6)
    Dominant stake ("reestablish connection") is signaled early but never tested by opposition or tightening. Elara faces no obstacle, makes no trade-off, and encounters no reversal; she simply thinks until the text declares success. The spirit's departure and the seed's glow are inert props, not escalating pressures. No cost is legible: the ending grants resolution without forfeiting or risking anything on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=3.5)
    No on-page conflict or escalation. The dominant stake ("to preserve wonder in routine") is declared but never tested by a complication or choice with visible cost. The librarian moves among shelves without opposition, reversal, or trade-off. No agency is demonstrated—no decision, renunciation, or endurance that forecloses a path. The piece flatlines at meditation without pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake is unclear: is it inspection, uncovering the pearl's stories, or personal transformation? No on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off. Aria's progression is declarative ("she knew that she would carry the pearl's latent radiance") rather than earned through resistant pressure. The "walls around her own heart" are mentioned as dissolved without dramatizing the cost or showing what was sacrificed. Coincidence (finding the pearl, then the shell) drives discovery rather than protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=4.2)
    The dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled early but never tested on the page through a choice that narrows options or imposes visible cost. No reversal or tightening occurs; Elara arrives seeking solace, plays the accordion, and departs with the same map and quest. The graffito "forgiveness is a map, not a destination" is cited but not dramatized as a friction that alters her tactics. Agency is observation, not decision.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—to find the library of unspoken words—is signaled early but never tested. The dreamer walks, opens a book, catches a slip of paper, writes in a journal, and steps through a doorway; no reversal narrows options, no trade-off imposes cost. The watch's "propagation delays" and the "unfolding cipher" are mentioned but not dramatized as obstacles or choices. Pressure remains static from opening to close, with the revelation granted rather than earned through agency.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake (weighing dream against empire) is signaled but never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or choice narrows options; the entire piece is Elian's internal summary of what she will do rather than a dramatized escalation. Coffee-stain divination is described as method but produces no consequence or complication. Declared intention without visible cost or agency.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake (infuse the emerald chip) is clear, and Aria's work progresses through stages (polishing, attuning, infusing). No meaningful tightening or trade-off occurs: the task succeeds without friction, the threshold recedes on its own, and Aria feels "ready to cross... whenever it might come" with no on-page cost or foreclosed option. The "one final task" framing promises a choice between completion and oblivion, but both are granted without sacrifice. Agency is present in the focused work, but escalation under the Accumulative lens requires a density shift or pattern break that reweights the stake—here the ending dilutes rather than intensifies.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—finding the source of contentment—is declared but never tested through on-page reversals or choices that narrow options. Aria's tasks (pruning, watering, climbing trees) proceed without opposition, complication, or price. The hairpin's significance is resolved entirely in summary ("she realized") rather than through a tightening that forecloses a path. No meaningful escalation or deepening occurs under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"to welcome nuance into certainty"—is told in a single paragraph but never tested on-page. No reversal tightens options: the conscience "realizes" the problem, then "finally unhooked" the cloak without dramatized resistance or cost. The client's absence removes any pressure crucible. The wind chimes and mirror are mentioned but do not force a trade-off or narrow tactics. The resolution is asserted, not earned by protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=3.4)
    The stated stake—teaching the art of vanishing to appear—never faces on-page opposition or risk of failure. No moment tightens options or forces a trade-off; the researcher simply narrates her method and the student passively absorbs. The trance deepens, words become measured, understanding dawns—all summary of internal states without a dramatized reversal or cost. Coincidence does not resolve because nothing was at stake to begin with.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dominant stake ("to learn to navigate without moving") is declared early but never pressured by opposition, cost, or a credible tightening. Centuries pass with passive observation; no reversal or deepening alters options. The "pulse left wandering" synchronizes with the skimmer's heartbeat off-page, a told resolution that bypasses agency. No on-page choice forecloses a path, no trade-off is visible, and coincidence (time passing) resolves what little tension exists.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—reigniting Eira's stagnant creativity—is signaled early, but no on-page reversal or tightening narrows her options. She touches the keystone and feels a "surge of energy," then walks away with hope; no trade-off, no foreclosed path, no visible price. Agency reads as passive reception rather than decision, renunciation, or endurance with cost. The unstrapping of the bindings is described as requiring "great care and precision," but this potential complication vanishes without dramatized difficulty or consequence. Under the selected Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through density or pattern, but the garden sequence feels static.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the luminous vows—is signaled early but never tightened by reversal, cost, or competing pressure. Kael's descent proceeds without obstacle, and his discovery arrives as atmosphere rather than a choice that narrows options. No visible price is paid; laughter and music from above remain unconnected to his internal arc. The "meteor hush" and soft glow substitute for escalation, leaving stakes abstract and untested.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=3.6)
    A dominant stake ("decipher the prophecy") is signaled early, but no on-page escalation or tightening occurs. The decision maker faces no reversal, no cost calculus, no failed attempt—only smooth, declarative progress from coins to distillation to fulfillment. The final act (drinking the droplet) is not tested by a prior mistake or constraint; luck and convenience grant the essence without struggle. No price paid, no option foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"to give names to nameless fears"—is declared but never tested by opposition or choice. The reaper succeeds in crystallizing echoes without cost, complication, or reversal; the process is described as "slow and painstaking" but no live difficulty appears on the page. No escalation occurs; the mood at closure mirrors the mood at opening. Agency is absent: the reaper performs a solitary ritual that no force resists and no decision alters.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dominant stake—righting a cosmic imbalance—is signaled early but remains abstract and untested. No reversal or tightening: the dripping-rate method works perfectly, the bell seals without complication, and the toll sounds as hoped. The mage's agency is execution without trade-off; no on-page cost (time, stamina, alternative forgone) shapes the outcome. The ritual's success feels declared rather than earned through protagonist struggle under the inferred Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—to heal the community through narrative—is signaled early but never tested. The warden encounters no opposition, makes no trade-off, and pays no price; the photographs accumulate without friction. No reversal or tightening occurs: the warden's goal and method remain unchanged from first paragraph to last. Under any lens (Causal, Accumulative, Situational), pressure does not escalate; the piece offers atmosphere in place of conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—harmonizing logic and intuition—is signaled early but never tested by genuine opposition or sacrifice. The crystal experiment succeeds without complication; no reversal narrows options or forces Elara to choose between competing goods. The starlings respond cooperatively, the orchard grows "more vibrant," and Elara continues her research unimpeded. Escalation is absent under any lens; pressure remains static from discovery through conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—mapping uncharted skies to preserve peer trust—is declared early but never tested on the page. Lyra encounters no opposition, reversal, or trade-off; she works methodically and succeeds without friction, cost, or a narrowing of options. The "watcher's burden" is asserted repeatedly but remains abstract; no on-page action dramatizes what she risks or forfeits, resulting in a flat pressure arc incompatible with the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"defeating emotional numbness"—is declared but never tested on the page by a choice that forecloses an option or imposes visible cost. No reversal, no tightening: Kaito meditates, feels energy, and achieves peace without friction. The clone custody battle and history-rewriting timeframe are mentioned but do not complicate or narrow his options in scene. Escalation is absent; the final paragraph asserts resolution rather than dramatizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=3.7)
    The dominant stake (restore lost laughter) is signaled early but faces no on-page opposition or tightening. The maestro's performance proceeds without reversal, failed attempt, or visible cost. Coincidence does not complicate; success is simply declared ("laughter echoed"). No agency choice forecloses a path, and the resolution arrives via summary rather than dramatized escalation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—"to make friends with uncertainty"—is declared but never tested by a choice that forecloses an alternative or imposes visible cost. The guardian's only action is waiting and receptive visualization; no reversal, tightening, or deepening narrows her options or forces a trade-off. The mist's clearing and the whispers' revelation happen to her rather than through her agency, and the final state of peace is granted without struggle. No escalation under any lens; pressure is asserted in description but never materializes in a dramatized beat that changes what she can or will do.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake ("interrupt a stifling destiny") is signaled early but never tested on the page—no live option is foreclosed, no trade-off forced. The alchemist's experiment proceeds without friction: gathering fragments, weaving energy, achieving transformation in a linear success arc. "The penny drops" and "moment of truth" are asserted labels rather than dramatized reversals. Agency remains observational; the climax summarizes outcome ("it was done") without showing a decision or cost that narrows future paths.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—uncovering a hidden truth—is signaled early but never tightened through reversal or cost. Aria encounters no opposition, makes no trade-offs, and faces no failure that narrows her options. The "shard of hush" and cryptic message arrive as gifts rather than hard-won discoveries; coincidence provides the chamber rather than protagonist agency forcing access. No meaningful escalation occurs under the Accumulative lens—each beat adds ornament without deepening pressure or altering what is at risk.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding the vanishing ferry—is signaled early but never escalates into a choice with visible cost. Deciphering the markings is presented as accomplished rather than tested; no reversal, failed attempt, or trade-off narrows Elara's options. The ending radioes Marcus and steps forward, but coincidence (finding the symbols) enables discovery without protagonist agency driving the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"searching for the texture of connection"—is signaled early but remains abstract and untested. No on-page reversal narrows options; the architect weaves, watches displays transform, feels "unsettling calm," and exits with the thread intact. The "final pattern" erupts into "color and light" without consequence or trade-off. Escalation reads as intensity assertion ("increasing intensity," "riot of color") rather than pressure that forecloses a path. Agency is observational; no choice alters tactics or imposes visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=3.5)
    The stated stake—teaching navigation by starlight—faces no opposition, complication, or cost. The lesson progresses from setup to mastery without a single moment where an option narrows or a price is paid. No reversal, tightening choice, or deepening alters what is possible. The discovery of aliens is mentioned as context but never dramatizes friction or forces Lyra to trade one value for another. Pressure remains flat from first line to last.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—reconnecting lost hearts—is signaled early, but no on-page reversal or tightening narrows options. Aria tracks the pulses, approaches, speaks comfort, and succeeds without complication or price; the woman accepts immediately. No live choice forces a trade-off, no escalation tests commitment, and the resolution arrives without agency-driven cost. Coincidence may complicate under Situational designs, but here convenience grants closure without pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—retrieve the codex—is signaled early but never tested by meaningful opposition. Lyra's journey is frictionless: she finds the logbook, reads it, takes the codex, and leaves. The tidal window provides a timer but doesn't force a trade-off or narrow options on the page. The "gold fleck illuminant" lock mechanism is mentioned as rumor but never dramatized as an obstacle. No reversal, complication, or cost-laden choice appears; the resolution is convenience rather than earned agency.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (understanding the digital ghost) is signaled early but never tightened by a reversal or complication that forces a trade-off. Akira's actions—clutching the shard, pouring ink, studying patterns—proceed without resistance or cost until the ghost "coalesces" and she releases the shard. No on-page price is paid; the resolution is granted by the narrative rather than earned through agency. The piece lacks a moment where options narrow or knowledge changes under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=3.7)
    The dominant stake—"translate texture into sound across the death of a language"—is declared but never tested by scarcity, error, competing priority, or visible price. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; the storyteller begins seeking patterns and ends having succeeded, with the task completed off-page. The flawed diamond is introduced as "the key" but never handled, risked, or traded; coincidence (the birds' flight, the canyon's response) supplies success without protagonist agency or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake ("unravel the mystery, restore balance") is declared but never tested by a concrete on-page dilemma that narrows options. Lena listens, feels energy, and walks away; no reversal or tightening forces a trade-off with visible cost. The static on the phone "grows louder" and "fainter" without causal linkage to her decisions. Escalation is asserted ("grim determination rising") rather than dramatized through agency.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"reawaken beauty"—is declared but never tested by opposition or cost. Luna plays, statues awaken without struggle, and she departs confident of future success. No reversal, tightening, or deepening narrows her options; coincidence (the orchard's inherent magic) does all the work. The mechanical world's "grip" is told to loosen but no on-page loss, trade-off, or adaptation shapes her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.4)
    One dominant stake (deliver package across border) is signaled early. Escalation is shallow: the drone pauses, the mailman crosses, no tightening or trade-off occurs. The handover lacks tension—no reversal, no visible price paid (stamina, social credit, tool loss) that alters later tactics. Coincidence (drone distraction) solves the border crossing rather than protagonist agency. No felt cost charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake: "to interpret silence as possibility" and find meaning in stillness. The carpenter follows the singer, discovers the oasis, and returns—but this sequence does not narrow options or force a trade-off with visible cost. The "wrong turn" is self-correcting; the singer vanishes without consequence. No escalation or reversal tests commitment; the resolution ("newfound sense of purpose") is declared rather than earned through a decision that forecloses a path. Pressure remains atmospheric, not causal.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"to find the place where stories lived"—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. No reversal, complication, or tightening appears: the librarian works, senses progress, succeeds. "Painstaking" is declared but not dramatized through failed attempts or trade-offs. The ending asserts vitality and peace without showing a path foreclosed or a price paid. Escalation is absent under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—capturing the cipher/runaway dream—is signaled early but never tested or tightened. Each dawn capture is identical; no reversal, deepening, or narrowing of options occurs. The stated longing faces no on-page opposition, and the ending explicitly defers resolution ("ever beckoning") without agency, renunciation, or visible cost. Pressure is asserted ("the cipher of longing begin to reveal its secrets") but not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—free the trapped idea—is declared but never tested. No on-page reversal or tightening occurs; the locksmith arrives, finds the tree, works, succeeds. "The air around them seemed to thicken, as if…resisting" gestures at opposition but dissolves without forcing a trade-off. The "soft click" resolves the task with no visible cost, no foreclosed option, no deepening. Escalation is absent; the piece is a single descriptive arc.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—recovering stolen memories—is declared but never tested on the page. Emilia encounters no obstacle, makes no trade-off, and pays no visible price; she finds the mushroom easily and walks away with resolve intact. The text substitutes rhetorical questions ("What would she find?") for dramatized pressure. No meaningful tightening or cost occurs under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—reversing the exile by annotating the shadow—is signaled early. However, escalation is summary-driven: "annotations grew more fervent," "uncovered a hidden pattern," "unlocked the secrets." No on-page reversal, tightening choice, or visible tradeoff narrows options or changes knowledge through protagonist agency. The tension in the archivist's shoulders "eased" without cost, and the resolution ("done their work well") asserts success without dramatizing a price or consequence that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.6)
    No dominant stake creates narrative pressure. Aria faces no resistance, cost, or meaningful choice; the withering trees recover without struggle or trade-off. The piece declares stakes ("succor the parched earth") but never tests them on the page. No escalation, reversal, or tightening occurs—success is smooth and inevitable. Agency is absent; Aria performs actions that succeed automatically without visible consequence or foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—grounding restless spirits—is signaled early but never tested. The restorer simply unravels knots in sequence without complication, reversal, or cost: no knot resists, no spirit turns hostile, no trade-off emerges. The "last knot fell away" moment arrives without agency or sacrifice, and the resolution (spirits dissipate, restorer continues) lacks the tightening or foreclosed option required under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the henge's secrets—is signaled early. However, no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; Elara faces no reversal, obstacle, or cost that narrows her options. The video footage "yields its secrets" without resistance, and the "threshold" moment is metaphorical rather than a dramatized choice under pressure. Agency is observational rather than decisional; no path is foreclosed with visible cost. The accumulative lens allows for deepening through density, but the findings remain abstract and the ending grants satisfaction without trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—"to understand the physics of letting go"—is stated but never tested by a live on-page dilemma that narrows options or imposes a trade-off. No reversal or tightening occurs; Eli explores, reads, untangles, and departs without a moment where agency (decision, renunciation, endurance) forecloses a path with visible cost. Pressure remains cerebral and abstract throughout, never escalating to a choice that changes tactics or knowledge in a way that charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=3.1)
    No dominant stake is signaled early or tested under pressure. The stated motivation—"to articulate unspoken needs"—remains abstract and never faces a concrete obstacle or cost. The storm intensifies around her work, but no reversal or tightening forces a choice; the balladeer creates art uninterrupted and departs at will. Closure is not earned by protagonist agency; the ghost's "response" is a passive breeze, and the final departure carries no visible price or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the diary's secrets—never faces on-page resistance or cost. Elara encounters no obstacle, makes no trade-off, and the "joy beneath anguish" remains abstract meditation rather than lived friction. The elevator's arrival and the shrine's revelation occur without reversal, deepening, or tightening; coincidence provides discovery, not agency.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—Lyra's desire "to prove that empty spaces remember"—is declared in reflection but never dramatized in a choice or tested by opposition. The storm system she tracks in the opening is mentioned as past ("had left a trail of destruction") and does not exert present pressure. Dr. Zhang's call is a brief check-in that deflates immediately without complication. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; Lyra works alone in introspection, and the clouds "calm" in sympathy with her mood rather than resisting her. The ending grants her "sense of peace" and confirmation ("she had found her calling") without visible cost, renunciation, or a path foreclosed—coincidental mood alignment replaces protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: completing the portrait (and capturing the infinite within finite bounds) before demolition. The artist's absorption and the ticking clock create situational pressure, and the coin discovery introduces a cryptic pattern that guides the work. However, escalation is atmospheric rather than choice-driven; the artist remains absorbed throughout, and the departure is contemplative rather than a forced tightening. No visible price is paid on the page—gathering belongings and leaving lacks the felt cost or renunciation that would elevate the ending. The demolition crew waits, but the protagonist's agency in response is passive endurance rather than a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—chart the luminance to discover its secret—is signaled early but never tightens. Eli faces no obstacle, resource limit, or competing demand; the crew's return could interrupt but does not. The luminance glows brighter in apparent response to Eli's work, suggesting external validation rather than protagonist-driven escalation. No on-page cost or trade-off alters tactics. The final sentence postpones action ("ready to set course") rather than executing a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—learning "the rhythm of repair"—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; Kael proceeds from library entrance to text discovery to door opening to hall arrival in linear fashion without opposition or trade-off. The prophecy is uncovered and the hall is found with no price paid or option foreclosed, reducing the arc to a tourist checklist rather than escalation under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—harnessing the nebula's energy—is declared but never faces opposition, resource scarcity, or internal conflict. No reversal or tightening occurs: Aria proposes, the settlers decipher and build, success follows. Coincidence does not resolve (no lucky break), yet agency is absent—no character makes a high-cost choice that forecloses an option. The "brambled hope" label claims fragility without demonstrating a credible loss or tactical constraint that shapes the final outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake ("vouchsafe the fragile balance of time") is declared early but never tested by a live dilemma. No reversal or tightening choice appears; the adjuster completes the task unopposed. The lullaby ending adds tonal weight but introduces no cost—no option foreclosed, no price paid. Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful deepening or cadence shift is required; here pressure flatlines and the resolution is declared rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (restore the labyrinth to guide travelers) is signaled early but never tightened—the caretaker faces no meaningful obstacle, resource limit, or forced trade-off. The night-frost deadline is mentioned twice but never narrows options or alters tactics. The mechanical birds circle but never intervene. No reversal or deepening occurs; the task proceeds linearly from blueprint discovery to completion. Coincidence (travelers emerging exactly when the work finishes) resolves the goal without protagonist cost.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—honoring Sofia's memory and translating separation into connection—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through Maria's reflection and scientific insight, but no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options with visible cost. The insight arrives as epiphany rather than through struggle or trade-off. The resolution is emotional (grief lifts, purpose found) but lacks a dramatized sacrifice, renunciation, or foreclosed path that would elevate escalation and cost clarity under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake ("to find where stories begin") is signaled early but never tested through opposition or sacrifice. Ember's decision not to incise the bottle reads as adherence to professional ethics rather than a genuine dilemma with competing costs. The subsequent "realizations" arrive serially without escalation: she notices patterns, feels harmony, senses belonging—each beat adds comfort rather than complication. No reversal tightens her options; the "lull on opening day" setting explicitly removes external pressure. The resolution grants her exactly what she wanted (purpose, belonging, understanding) without visible trade-off or path foreclosure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake ("to sandpaper rough memories, to smooth out the jagged edges") is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through imagery (fortress → dunes → tidal pool → pavilion) but no on-page reversal or tightening forces Elara to narrow options or pay a visible price. She seeks the pavilion, touches it, subsumes the memories, and feels peace—a linear progression without a moment where agency forecloses a path or a choice backfires. The ending asserts resolution ("no longer be a source of pain") without demonstrating the cost of her subsuming act in altered tactics or lost capacity.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.8)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: "construct bridges from silos, to connect disparate elements." No meaningful tightening or trade-off occurs; Emilia climbs, speaks, and the grain elevator agrees without resistance, misunderstanding, or cost. The "conversation was a dance" with "interspersing languages" is asserted but never dramatized—no moment where a word fails, a translation misfires, or the elevator resists. The ending declares success ("efforts had borne fruit") without showing a reversal, deepening, or price that foreclosed a path. Coincidence of cooperation resolves the stake without protagonist struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the observatory's secrets—is declared early but never tested by a competing cost or credible obstacle. Elara's work proceeds without reversal: she analyzes, restores, accesses memories, and returns "again and again" in summary. No meaningful tightening narrows options, no trade-off is dramatized, and the "flood of memories" arrives as convenient discovery rather than protagonist-driven escalation. Coincidence (the mirror simply works once repaired) resolves the central question without agency-driven cost.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake—"understanding the seeds of vigilance" and finding "where forgotten combinations hide"—is signaled early but never tested. The archivist encounters zero opposition, makes no choice that narrows options, and discovers the tomes exactly where the doodle-map leads her. The "hour when gravity inverts" is declared imminent but imposes no time pressure or tactical constraint. The ending declares "responsibility that came with knowledge" without dramatizing what she must give up, risk, or endure. No escalation, no cost, no agency—only a frictionless treasure hunt.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—creating felt music in a silent world—is signaled early, but pressure never tightens. The sculptor encounters stress cracks, analyzes them, finds an insulator, integrates it, and succeeds without obstacle or trade-off. No reversal: the analysis "unlocked a new level of understanding" without friction, and the final strumming achieves its goal immediately. Agency is present (the sculptor chooses to weave strings and strum) but no live option is foreclosed with on-page cost. The narrative is a sequence of additions rather than escalations.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—"to discover beauty in the difficult"—is declared but never tested on the page; no reversal or tightening forces a trade-off. The tutor's "method" of translating silence is described in abstract summary without a concrete application that narrows options or imposes cost. Exile is static backdrop, not active pressure. The walk away from the bench is motion without agency, consequence, or visible price. No escalation occurs under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake ("recover the secrets") is declared but never tested—Elara encounters no obstacle, cost, or trade-off. The clasp releases after one sentence of "tuning frequencies" without effort or failure. No escalation or tightening occurs; the piece moves from curiosity to fulfillment in a flat arc. The "path to empathy" remains abstract theme rather than on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—unlocking "the undercurrent of wisdom"—is signaled early but remains abstract and untested. No on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off; Lyra's tending of the seed proceeds without visible obstacle, cost, or pressure escalation. The bloom itself is an event she witnesses passively; coincidence (the decade-long cycle) delivers the resolution rather than protagonist agency. Under the Accumulative lens, a meaningful deepening or cadence shift is required, but the piece offers only summary description of epiphany ("she realized") without a dramatized tightening that forecloses a path or changes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—discovering the source of resilience—is signaled early, but no meaningful opposition or tightening emerges. Lyra's flight is unimpeded; the gravity inversion and accelerated growth enhance rather than complicate her mission. The "whirling silence" and gathering of echoes are encountered without cost, sacrifice, or foreclosed option. The resolution is purely informational (she learns the answer) with no on-page price or tactical trade-off that would elevate escalation above functional.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake is clearly signaled: understand the crash and cultivate foresight to prevent future disasters. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes "the crash was not just a random event, but a complex interplay of factors," narrowing her interpretive frame. However, no on-page reversal tests her commitment or forces a sacrifice; the progression is linear observation → realization → departure. The patch and wind patterns complicate understanding but do not force a trade-off. Cost remains thematic and internal ("hazy precision") rather than a visible forfeiture that reweights the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=2.4)
    The dominant stake—"to certify wonder as essential"—is declared but never tested by a live opposition or choice that narrows options. No meaningful tightening or escalation occurs; the sequence is: Elian sings → cavern shimmers → chisel strikes → success asserted. The sculptor's chisel strike is a coincidental event that resolves the goal without Elian's agency driving the turn. No visible price is paid; the ending asserts peace and purpose without forfeiting a live path.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—unlocking mysteries through the flute—is declared but never tested. No reversal, tightening, or choice narrows options; the protagonist enacts a solitary ritual without opposition, obstacle, or internal friction. The story asserts transformation ("felt changed") without showing what was risked, lost, or foreclosed. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation would require density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost, but the prose loops through descriptive paraphrase ("avalanchingly quiet," "canyon hush") without visible price or tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=4.1)
    One dominant stake is signaled early (understand emotion's mathematics), but no on-page reversal or tightening occurs. Echo arranges text, inserts the fragment, prints a maze—each step proceeds without friction or cost. The vanishing stars create a declared time pressure ("timeframe was limited") but Echo's actions do not accelerate or adapt. The final "crucial step" is asserted, not earned; no live option is foreclosed and no trade-off appears. Accumulative lens would require density increase or cadence shift to reweight the stake—neither lands.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake ("retrieve relics," "coax wonder") is declared but never tested by on-page pressure. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; Eira walks unimpeded, meets a stranger, and continues. The encounter with the moon-pale woman offers no cost, no alteration of options, and no agency—coincidence complicates nothing and resolves nothing because no conflict was dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—proving objects absorb emotions—is signaled but never tested on the page. No reversal, complication, or tightening occurs; the mystic studies patterns and experiences validation without friction. The mist clears as a symbolic softening, not a causal consequence of her actions. No trade-off, visible price, or foreclosed path appears. Agency is absent: she observes and intuits, but makes no decision that narrows options or imposes cost. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or shift; instead, it simply affirms.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—carrying a message across impossible distance—is signaled early but never tested through on-page conflict or trade-offs. The "raveling silence" is declared a threat, yet no scene dramatizes an attempt to breach it or the cost of that attempt. The puzzle assembly and weaving unfold without reversal or complication; the narrative summarizes that she "poured her heart" and "found a way to recommence" without showing a choice that forecloses an option or incurs a felt price. Agency remains passive: she works, pauses, rises, and vanishes, but no decision under pressure drives escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—crafting something that "would stand the test of time"—is signaled early but never tested. The silk-wrapping and forging proceed without complication; the sword emerges "gleaming" with no dramatized friction, failure, or trade-off. The apprentice's arrival in the final third introduces no reversal or tightening; the blacksmith's solitude ends without visible cost (no reluctance, no foreclosed alternative). The piece declares resilience and transformation thematically but offers no on-page escalation or narrowing of options. Coincidence (the apprentice simply appears) enables the ending rather than protagonist agency driving closure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake ("discover the weight of a withheld truth") is signaled but never tested on the page. The narrative summarizes movement through worlds without a single on-page reversal, tightening, or choice that narrows options. The protagonist's agency is passive observation; coincidence (the shard's glow) guides her rather than her decisions driving turns. No visible price is paid—she emerges "reeling" but unchanged in tactics or capability. Escalation is asserted ("intense light," "kaleidoscope") rather than dramatized through causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—to protect the lighthouse from darkness—is declared late and abstractly. The lamp flickering out is setup, but no escalation or tightening follows; the skipper performs a calming ritual and sails away unchanged. No reversal, no trade-off, no visible cost; the cairn-building soothes rather than complicates. Coincidence (finding the letter, the sea glass) seeds curiosity but does not test the skipper's commitment. Under an accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is required; here we see mood accumulation without a choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—"steer the dawn"—is signaled early but remains abstract; no tightening, deepening, or reversal occurs because the ritual proceeds without opposition or cost. The herald's actions are uncontested, and the dawn arrives on schedule with no forfeited option or trade-off. Coincidence ("stars above twinkled in rhythm") decorates rather than complicates. No escalation under any lens: causal because/therefore is absent, accumulative density does not increase, and situational pressure never crystallizes a stance.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding the wing's secrets—is signaled early but never tightened or tested. Kaito performs a single contemplative action (refracting light) without opposition, cost, or a narrowing of options. No reversal occurs; the "other occupants" watch passively and provide no friction. The ending asserts clarity and connection but dramatizes no choice, renunciation, or price—Kaito remains content, his exploration unchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—repairing the sextant and "deconstructing sorrow"—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal, tightening, or price appears: the worker begins the task, completes it in one uninterrupted beat, and the sextant glows whole. The storm and moonlight provide atmospheric escalation but do not narrow options or force trade-offs. Agency is absent; the worker's "lunar light" and innate ability resolve the problem without visible cost or earned consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—rekindling the dying realm—is declared early but never tested by a reversal or tightening that narrows options. The memory keeper encounters the mica window, hums, receives visions, and walks away with "renewed determination"; no turn forces a trade-off, no complication from the realm itself resists her method, and the closing assertion that "the realm began to flourish" occurs off-stage without agency or visible price. Pressure is static throughout; the protagonist's actions do not escalate or deepen under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=4.3)
    The dominant stake—unearthing wisdom in a past mistake—is signaled early but never tested on the page. No opposition arises, no options narrow, and no visible price is paid; Elys finds the book easily and the message affirms rather than challenges. The "nestled paradoxes" operate as theme rather than tactical problem. Under an Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is required; here the text offers only a declarative mood shift without foreclosing a path or imposing cost.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=3.7)
    Dominant stake ("to find the sacred in the ordinary") is declared in reflection but never tested by a live choice or reversal. No on-page tightening or deepening occurs; the noticer returns "again and again" with identical emotional valence and no escalation. The gardener's arrival does not complicate or force a decision; they work "in tandem" without conflict. Agency is absent—bread appears on the doorstep, the tea house exists, absolution "washes over" passively—leaving the protagonist as recipient rather than decider.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—preserve the luminous vows—is declared but never tested by opposition or scarcity. No reversal, tightening, or deepening narrows options; Elara searches, discovers a pattern, feels satisfaction, and departs. Coincidence does not complicate; agency is observation without renunciation or foreclosed path. No visible price alters tactics, and escalation is absent under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—finding the fob to uncover family secrets—is signaled early but shifts mid-story to thwarting The Shadow without clear integration. The vendor transaction passes without friction, and the standoff escalates only through atmosphere ("tension was palpable") rather than narrowing Lena's options. The resolution occurs off-page as tension "dissipates" into understanding; no on-page cost or trade-off forecloses a path. One tightening point (the fob exchange) exists, but it doesn't drive the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=3.5)
    No on-page reversal or tightening occurs. Aria's goal (to understand) is declared but never tested; she walks, the compass pulls, she arrives, and the "truth" is handed to her without agency, refusal, or visible cost. Coincidence resolves: a stranger who "carries weather" appears exactly where the compass leads, and touching them grants instant "understanding." The dominant stake is abstract and never narrows options or forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—overcoming creative blockage—is signaled early but never pressured by meaningful opposition or cost. Elara simply begins drawing, and the blockage dissolves without complication, reversal, or trade-off. The cave offers no resistance; the portrait emerges smoothly. No on-page loss, constrained resource, or foreclosed option accompanies the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (uncovering lost conversations) is declared but never genuinely threatened or complicated. Aria's search proceeds without opposition, resource limits, or competing goods. The "treacherous" journey mentions decay but no on-page obstacle tests her commitment or forces a trade-off. The ending asserts growth without showing what was risked or paid; no live option is foreclosed. Escalation under any lens is absent—pressure never tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=2.9)
    No dominant stake is tested on the page. Aria's goal to "preserve the color of wonder" is declared but never faces opposition, cost, or a choice that forecloses a path. The sculpture's completion occurs without struggle, reversal, or trade-off. No escalation: the bluff's energy "continues to build" in summary, and the transformation is ambient rather than earned by protagonist agency. Coincidence (the iceberg fragment arriving) enables rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—resolving inner static—is signaled early but remains abstract. The controlled burn opportunity emerges, yet Aria's containment work does not force a trade-off or foreclose a live option with visible cost. The fire is contained efficiently without struggle or consequence that alters later tactics. One meaningful tightening (the decision to contain) occurs, but the cost is asserted rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—solving the mailbox mystery—is signaled early but never tightens or forces a trade-off. Emilia encounters no obstacles: the mailman volunteers information, residents share theories, and the writer grants a meeting without friction. The investigation proceeds as smooth accumulation rather than escalating pressure, and the resolution (anonymous letters comforted the grieving writer) arrives without Emilia's agency altering tactics or paying a cost. No on-page reversal narrows options or deepens knowledge through earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—escape through code-breaking—is signaled but never tested on the page. No reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off; Aria's progress is summarized rather than dramatized through a meaningful tightening. The spider's web is offered as a timeframe but does not impose urgency or alter her tactics. Closure arrives via declaration ("felt liberation") without an earned turn driven by protagonist agency or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—finding where deleted memories go—is declared but never tested by opposition or cost. The lighter senses gravity pockets, reads coffee grounds, walks tunnels, and touches the crystal; each beat advances the plot without narrowing options or forcing a trade-off. No on-page reversal or tightening occurs; the whale "triggers a hidden pattern" off-stage, and the crystal delivers memories on contact. Coincidence (whale beaching) complicates the set-up, but the resolution is handed to the protagonist without agency-driven escalation or visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—hushing a prophecy—is declared early but never subjected to on-page escalation, tightening, or trade-off. The summoner encounters no opposition, friction, or complication; the ritual proceeds smoothly from intent to completion without a single moment where options narrow or cost becomes legible. The release of the wing at dawn is framed as triumphant satisfaction rather than a choice that forecloses a path, leaving the conflict inert.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—learning the language of old buildings—is stated but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening occurs; the tutor asks a question, the student answers, and the lesson continues without friction. The "interrogate" action promised in the prompt dissolves into gentle conversation. No live option is foreclosed, and the student's quest proceeds unchanged with no visible cost or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (reclaim suppressed memories) is signaled early, but escalation is passive: Lyra listens, memories "begin to unravel," and resolve "forms within her" without a tightening choice that narrows options. The peak moment—deciding to archive the whispers—occurs midway and does not force a trade-off; the memories arrive as gift rather than cost. The ending asserts transformation ("emerged stronger") across off-page days, displacing the pressure point. One micro-turn (sit and listen) does not constitute meaningful escalation under causal lens expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—subverting a historical text to reveal hidden truth—is signaled early but never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; the forger encounters no resistance, makes no trade-offs, and pays no visible price. The text flows "with a precision that was both wisely enduring and deeply intuitive," but pressure remains static from first paragraph to last. Under any lens, escalation is absent and agency at closure is missing.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=2.5)
    The dominant stake—learning why some people echo—is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or choice narrows options or raises cost; Aria sings, receives passive revelation, and continues unchanged. "Progressive disclosure" is mentioned as method but not dramatized through tactical adjustments or prices paid. The story offers no escalation under any lens: no causal because/therefore links, no accumulative density shift at closure, no situational pressure that crystallizes stance.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"to salvage something pure from the wreckage"—is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening occurs; the vision unfolds in a passive "and-then" chain with no protagonist agency driving turns. The snow globe "began to glow" and "windows of connection" open without Aria making a choice that narrows options or incurs cost. Coincidence (the vision arriving, the pattern forming) provides all movement.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=3.6)
    No identifiable dominant stake or on-page pressure exists. The protagonist seeks "hidden truths" and "profound understanding," but these remain abstract goals never tested or complicated. No reversal, tightening, or escalation occurs; she simply walks, reflects, and claims revelation. The final "sense of unity" is declared without cost, trade-off, or obstacle. Agency is absent—no choice forecloses a path or alters options.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—find the diamond and uncover the stillpoint—is signaled early, but pressure never tightens meaningfully. Aria encounters zero obstacles: the paper trail leads her directly to the clearing, the letters reassemble cleanly, and the location is reached without complication. The "feeling that she was being watched" is declared but never tests her commitment or forces a tactical shift. No reversal, no foreclosed option, no visible price paid; the ending offers access without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=2.6)
    The dominant stake ("shaping a new dawn") is declared but never tested on the page. No on-page reversal, tightening, or deepening—just a told progression of success. The visionary watches and listens without agency; the prophet's rise happens off-stage across years. Coincidence (fragmented radio frequencies conveniently delivering a mosaic) complicates nothing and no visible price is paid. Escalation is replaced by summary.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving beauty and connecting generations—is declared early but never tested by opposition or cost. The poet wanders, recalls, and writes without encountering friction, rejection, or a trade-off that narrows options. The music box winds, the words flow, the heart lightens: accumulation without pressure. No reversal, no tightening choice, no visible price paid. Under any lens, escalation requires at least one moment where agency forecloses a path; here all doors remain open and the protagonist's state improves without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=3.9)
    One stake is signaled early (protect the artifact) but no opposition, complication, or internal conflict ever materializes. The "delicate process" unfolds without friction, error, or trade-off; vibrational matching succeeds on first attempt with no visible cost or tactic adjustment. No reversal, deepening, or tightening occurs—Azure walks to the cabin, performs the task, walks back. The Accumulative lens cannot compensate for zero escalation or choice under pressure; the ending grants satisfaction without alteration, renunciation, or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—launching a "patient revolution"—is declared early but never tested on the page. No antagonist, obstacle, or internal trade-off materializes; the mapper walks, observes, and "raises hands" without friction or visible price. The viaduct's energy rising and moon tracking are ambient rather than escalatory; coincidence (full moon, frozen lake cycle) enables the climax without protagonist agency. The final assertion that "nothing would ever be same" lacks dramatized consequence or a choice that narrows live options, leaving pressure static across the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—solving the young woman's death—is declared but never tested on the page; no evidence is gathered, no hypothesis forms, no obstacles appear. The secondary stake (Maya's freedom from her past) unfolds through passive immersion without a single tightening choice. No reversal occurs; the dripping water and lantern light simply accompany her walk until she feels better. Coincidence (the tunnel's atmosphere) resolves both threads without agency, and the final peace arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—turning an apology into action—is signaled late and never tested on the page. The chaplain's visit to the shop lacks present opposition or a tightening choice; he listens, reflects, and departs unchanged in action. The young inmate case is backstory only, with no current cost or reversal. The proprietor's wisdom is offered without friction, and the ending declares future intent ("determined to help") rather than showing a present trade-off or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=4.0)
    The dominant stake (ring the unheard bell) is signaled early but never tested; no on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off. Zephyr's "transliteration efforts" and "determination" are asserted without dramatized failure, adaptation, or visible price. The resolution is convenient—algorithm understood, bell rung—without protagonist agency that forecloses a live alternative. Pressure remains flat across the accumulative structure.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the truth behind the missing employees—is signaled early and sustained. The recurring numbers provide a pattern of intensification, and the cryptic warning ("They're watching") hints at escalation. Yet no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows Lena's options with visible cost; she "dug deeper," "began to notice," "became convinced," all summary verbs that describe investigation without dramatizing a decision that forecloses a path. The resolution is discovery-driven rather than agency-driven, and the cost remains asserted ("both exhilarating and terrifying") without specific consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—finding peace or purpose post-suicide-attempt—is signaled early but never tested by a concrete choice. Volunteering is presented as backdrop labor without a moment where the protagonist must choose between escape and engagement with visible cost. "A fold in patience" is named but not dramatized as a tightening. The resolution is declared ("it was enough") rather than earned through agency that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.1)
    A dominant stake is declared ("nurture intersubjective understanding") but never tested on the page. The sentinel encounters the love-letter fragment, wanders, notices vine patterns, sits again—no reversal, no tightening, no cost-bearing decision. Coincidence does not complicate; protagonist agency is absent. The resolution is summary ("her task became clear") without dramatized escalation or forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=3.6)
    The declared stake—"preserve the echo of wisdom"—remains abstract and unchallenged throughout. No on-page reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; the line walker completes the task without friction, trade-off, or visible cost. Agency is absent: the protagonist observes and receives rather than deciding under pressure. Coincidence does not complicate; the prophet's arrival is convenient, and resolution arrives without protagonist alteration or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.5)
    A dominant stake ("collective healing" via photographs) is declared early but never tested: Luna faces no obstacle, resource limit, trade-off, or internal friction. The narrative offers a single unbroken move—photograph the field—without reversal, deepening, or cost. No agency choice forecloses a path; the ending restates serene intention rather than showing price paid or options narrowed.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake (decode the pattern) is declared but never tested on the page. The summons to testify arrives as external compulsion, not protagonist-driven escalation. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the scholar rises, retrieves the crystal, and walks without visible tradeoff or foreclosed path. The ending gestures at possibility rather than delivering a turn with cost. Agency remains observational throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"to capture the sound of growing older"—is abstract and never tested by on-page opposition or a forced trade-off. The prophet arranges driftwood without error, cost, or resistance; the fog "holds its breath" cooperatively. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the act is meditative and uncontested. The resolution ("she had found what she was searching for") is declared rather than earned by agency, and no visible price is paid. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through pattern or cadence shift, but the text loops its central claim without escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding the clock hand's mystery—is signaled but never meaningfully escalates. The earth tremors arrive as external coincidence unconnected to Eli's repair work, and his "restructuring" happens entirely off-stage in summary. No genuine reversal occurs: the problem (spinning clock hand) simply resolves itself when "the clock hand had stopped spinning" without dramatized cause. The philosophical musings about escape velocity and ephemeral moments remain abstract rather than tested by concrete choice or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake—"execute a flawless goodbye"—is signaled early but never tested. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; Lena's plan (hum, hymn the mundane, weave soundscape) proceeds without resistance or complication. Emma's cooperation is frictionless, her death arrives as scheduled resolution. The "blood work" timeframe sets a deadline that exerts no tactical pressure. Escalation is absent; the arc moves in one smooth descent from stated goal to declared success without cost, adaptation, or live choice under competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"where shadows go at noon"—is declared but never tested on-page with a concrete reversal or tightening that narrows options. Lyra's research is summarized across vague "days" with no escalation, no live obstacle, and no visible price paid. The climactic "understanding" occurs off-stage in a single sentence, then deflates into static reflection. No agency choice forecloses a path with felt cost. Pressure remains flat throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=3.9)
    No dominant stake is dramatized with on-page pressure. The story tells us Emilia seeks clarity after unsettling events, but those events remain off-page; we never see her facing a choice that forecloses a path or costs her something tangible. The tooth is "said to hold the power to reveal hidden truths," yet it triggers only interior monologue, not a reversal or tightening. The phrase "turn mistakes into constellations" recurs as aspiration rather than tested commitment. No escalation occurs—she enters reflective, exits inspired, with no visible price paid or option narrowed.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—sharing the pearl of stillness without fire—is signaled early but never tested or complicated on the page. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; the star watcher polishes glass without opposition, cost, or trade-off. Agency is absent: no decision forecloses a path, no renunciation carries weight, no endurance is dramatized. The resolution is a static declaration of tranquility rather than an earned outcome of protagonist choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake ("graft new meaning onto old wounds") is declared but never tested on the page. No on-page reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs—the figure's arrival and flower gesture do not narrow options or force a trade-off. Aria's acceptance is passive and cost-free. The "healing" is summarized rather than earned through agency, renunciation, or endurance with visible sacrifice. Pressure remains static throughout; no escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—overcoming writer's block—is signaled early but never tested by on-page choices with visible cost. The woman's appearance is coincidental and solves the problem (words begin to flow) without the protagonist earning the shift through agency or renunciation. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the mist clears and she writes, with no price paid or path foreclosed. Escalation is absent; the piece moves from stuck to unstuck via external validation rather than internal alteration.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake (restore sacred practices to remedy villager disconnection) is signaled early but faces no opposition or complication. Elara's device succeeds immediately, villagers respond without hesitation, and the resolution is frictionless—no reversal, no choice that forecloses an option, no visible cost. The phrase "when everything aligns" is invoked twice but functions as thematic assertion rather than a causal trigger that narrows options. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through pattern or cadence shift; here the melody simply works and the problem dissolves.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake (enchant and seal the plate) is signaled early, but no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options. Aria proceeds from pattern-making to sealing without friction, opposition, or visible cost; the "turmoil of emotions" is told, not dramatized. The hum and glow at the end register as ambient validation rather than a pressure point or earned reversal. No agency-driven turn forecloses a path or forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding the device and "harvest of echoes"—is signaled early, but no live opposition or trade-off emerges. Elian's work is painstaking yet uncontested; time passes ("days turned into weeks"), but no reversal or complication narrows his options. The ending grants success without sacrifice: the device whirrs to life, he smiles, and departs enriched. Agency is present (he studies, reassembles), but no cost forecloses a path or tests commitment under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—"to collect the weights of different burdens"—is declared but never tested on the page. No opposition, no reversal, no tightening choice that narrows options. The weaver enters, weaves without friction, and completes her task; coincidence does not even complicate. The resolution is summary ("her work complete") with no visible price or trade-off. Agency is absent; the protagonist observes and executes without decision or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—containing grief through craft—is signaled early and sustained. The piece accumulates texture (tea ritual, wood selection, carving emergence) but lacks a meaningful tightening or turn that narrows options or imposes visible cost. The kettle reaches a boil, the carving completes, and "pain slowly begin to contain," yet no live choice or trade-off forecloses a path on the page. Under the Accumulative lens, one decisive intensification or pattern break that reweights the stake with cost is needed; the smooth progression from grief to manageable peace undershoots that bar.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"reconcile the eroded ambitions"—is declared but never dramatized as a choice with competing options. No reversal or tightening occurs; the scavenger walks, collects, and clicks without obstacle or cost. The carousel's halt is backstory, not present pressure. Agency is observation, not decision; the act of photographing is symbolic closure without visible tradeoff or consequence that narrows future options.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.4)
    The dominant stake—restore the terminal—is signaled early but unfolds without reversal, cost, or meaningful tightening. Maya's work proceeds via convenient epiphany ("By rerouting the pipes, Maya realized...") with no failed attempt, resource scarcity, or tradeoff dramatized on the page. No opposition (physical, social, or internal) complicates her goal. The "hours passed" summary skips all escalation; the ending declares success without showing a price paid or path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—reconciling the abandoned naturalist dream with clock-scribe life—is signaled early and sustained. Yet no on-page reversal or tightening forces a trade-off; Elian's decision to "find a way to reconcile" is declared without visible cost or tactical change. The bear's presence complicates emotion but does not alter options or impose a price. Pressure accumulates through reflection but does not crystallize into a choice that forecloses a path. The resolution is summarized rather than dramatized with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—finding the sundial—is declared but never tested. No obstacle, complication, or reversal appears; the search proceeds in a single smooth arc to discovery. Lyra's agency is limited to "scanning" and "picking out faint signs" without on-page decisions that foreclose options or incur cost. The "upheaval" and "clarity" are asserted at the end but carry no legible price or trade-off. Escalation under any lens is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving ancient methods—is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; the collector studies, succeeds without friction, and departs. The rope's "secrets" are summarized as decoded rather than shown through a turning point that narrows options or raises cost. Protagonist agency is absent at closure; she completes a task with no visible trade-off, refusal, or reweighting of price.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=3.6)
    No dominant stake is dramatized. The protagonist seeks "to understand the geography of healing," but this remains abstract and untested; no reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs because no live option is ever at risk. The thread snaps by itself rather than through protagonist decision, eliminating agency. Without a coherent stake or escalation under any lens, conflict cannot register.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake—reawakening beauty—is declared early but never tested by a live on-page dilemma or reversal that forces trade-offs. The prince encounters no opposition, makes no difficult choice, and experiences no visible cost. The device simply hums to completion and the world shifts in summary; coincidence resolves without agency.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—healing the tree—is signaled but never escalates or tightens. Aria arrives, grafts the branch, and succeeds without opposition, resource constraint, or a trade-off. No reversal or deepening occurs; the radio call and tree damage could be swapped for any fire scene without structural impact. The ending declares "unyielding compassion" but no visible cost or foreclosed path emerges. Coincidence (gentle rain) aids the outcome rather than complicating it.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake ("liberate trapped memories") is signaled early but faces no on-page opposition or complication. Aria's quest unfolds as a linear treasure hunt with no reversal, tightening, or choice that narrows options; the breadcrumbs lead her directly to the box, which opens without resistance. No cost is visible when she absorbs the memories or takes on guardian duty. The Accumulative lens requires one decisive intensification or cadence shift that reweights the stake—this piece provides neither.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=2.9)
    No dominant stake is signaled or tested. The stated goal—"to share light without using fire"—is never dramatized as a choice under friction; no scene shows the sentimentalist risking "flames of destruction" or paying a price to avoid them. The piece drifts through philosophical summary without reversal, tightening, or escalation. Sonar pinging and transit are described as methods but never face opposition or cost, and the ending declares success ("shared light without using fire") with no visible trade-off or foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"to discover the shape of collective grief"—is signaled late (mid-story) and remains abstract. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the carver finishes her work, the mentor nods approval, butterflies arrive, and she sits in stillness. The "discovery" is recounted as a realization ("she realized") without agency, renunciation, or a trade-off that forecloses a path. Escalation is absent; pressure does not cohere or grow.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—Elara's quest for absolution—is declared early but never tested by a concrete on-page reversal or tightening. She picks up the rake handle, reads inscriptions, and walks away; no option is foreclosed, no trade-off forced. The pause in the pendulum's swing is mentioned but does not constrain action or escalate pressure. Agency is absent; the protagonist receives insight rather than making a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake ("discover the shape of intentions") is signaled but never tested; no reversal or tightening forecloses an option with visible cost. The gardener's actions—entering, untangling, opening the case—proceed without resistance or trade-off. The "chess clock runs down" is mentioned once without time-pressure affecting tactics. Escalation is conceptual drift (echoes → tapestry → crystal → purpose) rather than narrowing options under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=3.7)
    The dominant stake—to seed innovation, break stagnation—is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; the cartographer faces no opposition, makes no trade-off, pays no visible price. The entire narrative is setup: retrieving the nib, thinking about the task, hovering. Escalation requires at least one meaningful pressure point; here the pen never moves, so agency and cost remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—unlocking dust's narrative capacity via the pirate broadcast—is signaled early but never faces a meaningful test or tightening. No reversal occurs; Emilia searches, finds, transcribes, and succeeds without complication or cost. The "presence behind her" and flickering lights hint at opposition but dissolve instantly, leaving pressure static. The resolution is coincidental (the broadcast airs; she captures it) rather than earned by protagonist agency, and no visible price narrows her options at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—Lena's relationship to transient art—is signaled early but never tested by a choice with cost. She performs her role without friction, and the conversation with Eli is exposition rather than a pressure point. No reversal, tightening, or credible loss alters tactics; the scattering itself is ritual completion, not a decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding the past through competing narratives—is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or decision narrows Kael's options; he digs, reads, and agonizes without visible cost or a moment that forecloses a path. The plague-ending timeframe and the cog's discovery are static backdrop, not sources of escalating pressure. Agency is absent: Kael observes and reflects but makes no choice that alters his situation.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—teaching the choir to unlearn hatred and sing in harmony—is declared but never tested on the page. No choir members appear, no rehearsal unfolds, no resistance or complication arises. Emilia's solitary zither playing carries no opposition, reversal, or trade-off; she simply affirms a pre-existing commitment. The story asserts escalation ("weight of her task") but shows none; pressure remains abstract summary rather than dramatized narrowing of options or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—creating a dish during the alignment—is signaled early but never faces opposition, complication, or a trade-off. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; Aria plants, cooks, and succeeds without obstacle. The alignment reaches peak and the dish transports diners as promised, but no on-page cost appears and no live option is foreclosed. Escalation absent; band guardrails for 8.0+ not met.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding the beehive's failure—is signaled early but never escalates or narrows options. The toll keeper faces no opposition, time pressure, or trade-off; the woman's presence adds no friction. The "cryptic riddle" ("When shadows dance, light reveals") is mentioned but neither solved on-page nor used to shape tactics. The resolution (the log revealing "adaptation") arrives as convenient exposition rather than protagonist agency, and the toll keeper's decision to repurpose the beehive is described in future tense without visible cost or foreclosed alternative. No reversal or deepening occurs; the investigation proceeds in a straight line from question to answer.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding why some houses feel alive—is signaled early but never tested. Eli's ritual proceeds without obstacle, doubt, or visible cost; she simply walks, places objects (never specified), and experiences a shift. No reversal or tightening narrows her options. The "expectant hush" and "heightened awareness" are asserted rather than earned through on-page pressure. The ending summarizes gratitude without showing what she risked or lost.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding the garden's downfall—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. The statue passively receives the parrotfish's tale, then the ampoule delivers "a sudden jolt of understanding" without effort or trade-off. No reversal, no narrowing of options, no felt escalation: the statue's telepathy solves every problem costlessly. The ending declares the garden "thriving" and the statue "a beacon," but we see no on-page tightening, no visible price, and no choice that forecloses an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—unlocking "perpetual motion" through mathematical proofs—is declared but never tested through on-page action or trade-offs. No meaningful tightening, reversal, or deepening occurs; the protagonist rolls dice and ponders abstractions in a static loop. Agency is absent: no decision forecloses a path, and no visible cost is paid. The piece lacks escalation under any lens, and the ending repeats the opening situation without reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—reviving lost languages to prove strangers remember kindness—is signaled but never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; the painter moves from contemplation to creation without opposition, tradeoff, or cost. Agency is passive (gazing, pondering, feeling) until the final act of painting, which proceeds without friction. Pressure remains static; coincidence does not complicate because nothing complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=3.6)
    No dominant stake is signaled early or tested under pressure. Elena's tour proceeds without opposition, reversal, or tightening—the ice simply thaws, revealing bread sculptures. No agency (decision, renunciation, endurance) forecloses a path with on-page cost; the final "sense of purpose" is asserted without tactical constraint or trade-off. Coincidence (thawing ice) reveals history but does not force Elena to choose or lose anything.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the hunger stone's latent radiance—is signaled early but faces no opposition. The clock maker descends, finds the yoyo exactly where legend promised, and reverse-engineers it with a mind that "worked tirelessly" in summary. No choice narrows options, no failure forces adaptation, and the resolution is given rather than earned. The puzzle's difficulty is asserted ("painstaking") but not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake ("to trick fear into revealing its weakness") is declared but never tested on the page through a choice with trade-offs. No escalation or tightening occurs; the protagonist passively follows the advisor's voice through a series of rooms in flat succession. The blackout and awakening are coincidental rather than earned by protagonist agency. No visible cost forecloses a path; the ending loops back to the beginning ("funhouse is always waiting") without transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—"to turn obstacles into instruments"—is declared but never dramatized through friction, reversal, or cost. No obstacles appear on the page; the prophet moves freely, strikes branches, taps driftwood, and departs without resistance or trade-off. Pressure does not escalate; the performance unfolds smoothly from inception to conclusion with no tightening or deepening. The prophet's agency is absent; coincidence or authorial arrangement drives every beat, leaving no earned stakes or visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: uncover the truth behind the lost expedition and confront the watchers. One meaningful tightening occurs when the shell cracks and the map/note are revealed, narrowing Lyra's options to a single path outward. The watchers' silent presence builds oppressive pressure, but Lyra's agency at closure is more stance crystallization than a choice that forecloses a live path with visible cost. The final step beyond the city reads as determination rather than a trade-off that alters tactics or exacts a felt price. No reversal tests her commitment; the map simply confirms what she already sought.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake (uncover truth behind a noble lie) is signaled early but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening choice narrows options; Emilia's task proceeds without obstacle, misinterpretation, or cost. The "carefully crafted" lies are declared formidable but yield immediately to her "practiced intensity." Agency is observation, not decision—she pores over documents and the truth "slowly, gradually" emerges without a trade-off or forfeiture. The resolution is granted rather than earned by protagonist alteration or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—documenting the pavilion—faces no opposition, reversal, or escalation. The surveyor's task proceeds smoothly from start to finish without a decision that narrows options or a price that alters tactics. The drawbridge rising signals day's end but creates no pressure on the protagonist's choices. Agency is observational; the inkwell retrieval and note-placing happen without dramatized cost or consequence that reweights the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—"trace honest origins"—is signaled early but never tightened or tested by opposition. Elara encounters a coded text and solves it through "alternative hypothesis" without visible friction, error, or competing pressures. No reversal or deepening narrows her options; the blackout and sunken setting impose no clock or resource constraint. The ending declares "hope" and "pride" without demonstrating a trade-off or foreclosed path. Escalation is absent under the causal lens; the narrative advances through "and then" rather than "therefore."

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—transforming grief—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or escalation. No reversal or tightening narrows Kaito's options; he moves from working on a lantern to releasing a crane without friction. The story lacks agency-driven pressure: coincidence (sunset, breeze) enables the final act rather than a costly decision. Under the Accumulative lens, we expect density increase or cadence shift; instead the piece loops thematically without deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding the drone strike's cause—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or scarcity. The "hunt" consists of told collaboration ("pored over the data," "refined their search") without visible setbacks or trade-offs. The "shocking revelation" that unused potential is a catalyst arrives without prior dramatized complication. No meaningful tightening occurs; the protagonist's stance at the end is identical to her intention after boarding the station.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (decode frequency) is clear and sustained, but escalation is absent: Lena follows signal → interprets carvings → finds chip → inputs data in a frictionless sequence. No reversal, no live cost, no tightening of options. The "sense of excitement and trepidation" is told emotion without on-page manifestation. Agency is present (she decodes, searches, extracts) but faces no meaningful opposition or trade-off. The resolution unfolds through discovery rather than choice under pressure, and the final "truth" arrives as summary rather than a stake-altering beat.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—"discover the weight of a withheld truth"—is signaled but remains abstract throughout. The walk and carving examination feel like contemplative drift rather than escalation. No live constraint or tightening choice narrows options; the protagonist's agency at the end is a declaration of resolve, not a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. Coincidence (finding a carving that triggers memory) complicates without forcing a trade-off, and the client's waiting presence never applies on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—achieving the prisoner exchange—is signaled early, but pressure is asserted rather than dramatized. "Stalled for weeks" and "tension ebb and flow" are told; no on-page tightening or trade-off narrows options. The breakthrough is summarized ("negotiations...began to flow") without showing the negotiator's agency, cost, or the mechanics of the moon-phase synchronization forcing a choice. Escalation is claimed but not enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=4.9)
    Dominant stake (finding direction after divorce) is signaled early. The paddle-out offers rhythmic calm but no reversal or tightening that forecloses an option. The utility-pole technique arrives as a solution without prior cost or friction. Jack's internal shift from turmoil to peace proceeds smoothly without a visible price paid on the page—no loss, renunciation, or trade-off that alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—"to kindle empathy where none remains"—is signaled early but never tested on the page through a choice with visible cost. Lena encounters the cryptic message and the baseball, yet neither moment forces a trade-off or narrows her options; she simply walks forward with growing attunement. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; the mist clears and a path appears without protagonist agency shaping the outcome. The ending's "weight of her past slowly beginning to lift" is an asserted emotional shift rather than an earned escalation with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—Aria's bond-reforging and Lyra's transformation—is signaled early. However, escalation is minimal: Lyra agrees to help immediately without internal resistance, the ritual proceeds without complication, and the apparition appears on cue. No reversal narrows Lyra's options; her "reluctant metamorphosis" unfolds as smooth expansion ("not a destruction… but an expansion") with no visible price paid or path foreclosed. The piece tells us transformation is "exhilarating and terrifying" but never dramatizes a trade-off, loss, or tactical constraint that would demonstrate on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—"to find where lost time accumulates"—is signaled but never tested by a reversal or tightening that narrows options. The cartomancer examines cards, recalls a memory, flips through a book, and arrives at acceptance without obstacle, cost, or agency-driven turn. No on-page escalation or deepening occurs; the narrative remains contemplative throughout, and the final "sense of peace" is asserted rather than earned by a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—"to push open a locked dimension"—is declared but never tested, narrowed, or escalated. No reversal or tightening occurs; Aurora simply completes stitching and the dimension opens without resistance, trade-off, or visible cost. Coincidence resolves (photographs "shimmer" at the right moment). No agency-driven choice forecloses a path or incurs a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=3.9)
    No dominant stake is dramatized—Aria's search for "treasures" and understanding of transformation remain abstract wants that never face a concrete test or trade-off. The old woman's gift arrives without cost, complication, or refusal. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the story drifts through coincidences that guide rather than trap. Closure is convenience (the universe hands her understanding) rather than earned agency.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—guarding and then activating the cradle—is signaled early but never tested by a competing pressure or cost. The figure's arrival and message are accepted without suspicion, internal debate, or tactical adjustment. The "silent revolution" succeeds in summary across multiple paragraphs without on-page resistance, setback, or visible price. No reversal or deepening occurs; the sentinel's initial goal (guard the cradle) smoothly converts to a larger goal (spread the revolution) with no friction, and coincidence (the blackout as catalyst) enables rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=3.7)
    The dominant stake—"unlock the hidden patterns"—is declared but never tested. No reversal, complication, or trade-off appears; the herder finds the dust, arranges rocks, and succeeds in a frictionless sequence. Coincidence (the stardust glints exactly where needed) solves rather than complicates. No visible price is paid, and the protagonist's agency is passive observation rather than decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding her scars—is declared but never tested by an on-page decision with competing costs. The poet stands, waits, then opens an envelope she wrote to herself; no reversal or tightening narrows options, and no visible price is paid (she simply "feels understanding" and remains at peace). The storm as external pressure is metaphoric only, never forcing a choice between staying or leaving, reading or burning, confronting or fleeing. Agency is passive observation rather than renunciation or endurance that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—winning the debate-duel and uncovering the hidden overture—is signaled early but never tightened. No on-page reversal forces a trade-off; the opponent "reels" and Aurélien wins in a summary paragraph. The coded sundial angles are mentioned as guiding arguments, but we never see an argument constrained or a tactic altered by them. Escalation is asserted ("as the duel reached its climax") rather than built through rising cost or narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (rebuild the library) is signaled early, but escalation is absent: no obstacles materialize, no tactic fails, no price is paid on the page. The poet's "daunting task" dissolves without friction; they simply begin to work and "the library began to take shape" by dawn. Coincidence (moon rising, dawn arriving) marks time but does not complicate. The vision to rebuild and the method (friendship and collaboration) are told rather than tested, and the resolution lands without agency—luck and assertion replace protagonist choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—finding refuge from past pain—is signaled early but never tested by a live obstacle or trade-off. The pianist plays, threads the reel, steps into the film world, and returns with her burden lifted, all without a reversal, cost, or narrowing of options. "Surprise fate" is declared as motivation but no on-page action enacts defiance; the "unplanned encore" occurs after the visit and resolves into a wistful smile. No antagonist or competing pressure; coincidence (the film's hidden sections) enables the solution without prior setup or protagonist agency shaping the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake (protect cultural memory before monsoon) is declared early but never tightened or tested. Aria encounters no obstacles, setbacks, or competing pressures; she plants the seed, interprets dreams, uncovers memories, and succeeds exactly as intended. The monsoon's approach is mentioned repeatedly but imposes no visible constraint on her methods or forces any trade-off. No reversal, escalation, or on-page cost appears; the resolution is summary of completed work.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"finding the color of unspoken apologies"—remains abstract and is never tested by a live choice with visible cost. The lace-making sequence unfolds without obstacle or trade-off; the compass release happens without consequence. No reversal or tightening narrows options. The protagonist moves through a predetermined ritual rather than escalating under pressure, leaving escalation inert.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is essentially no escalating conflict—internal or external—beyond Maria’s ongoing contemplation. The dominant stake (her understanding of reality/decay) is never under serious threat; there’s no real risk she will choose differently or suffer for her stance. The dust sample and storm aftermath don’t force decisions or trade-offs; they simply occasion reflection. As a result, pressure stays flat and the ending doesn’t feel earned through struggle, only through extended musing.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and very soft: curiosity versus disorientation, a desire for purpose in the pauses versus prior upheaval. There is no clear escalation point where stakes sharpen or a real alternative is foreclosed; she is mildly contemplative from start to finish, and nothing threatens her goal. The decision to “retrac[e] the steps of her ancestors” is framed as a natural extension rather than a pressured choice. As a result, tension remains low and the final peace comes without a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—whether they can make meaningful “music” in a noiseless world—remains almost entirely conceptual and under-tested on the page. The only concrete conflict is the mild “discord” in their composition, which they resolve smoothly by consulting the heat-map and tweaking frequencies. There is no serious risk of failure, interpersonal rupture, or moral trade-off, so escalation is minimal and consequence soft. The result is atmospheric but dramatically underpowered for elite-publication standards.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—revitalizing the distress signal and transforming the library into a haven—is stated, but pressure never meaningfully tightens. The undertaker encounters no real obstacles or reversals: preparation, descent, discovery, and repair all proceed smoothly, with no hard trade-offs or credible risk. Internal conflict (desire for stillness vs. undertaking a dangerous journey) is implied but not dramatized in real-time decisions. As a result, escalation feels flat and the ending, while conceptually neat, lacks a strong sense of price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=4.5)
    The central stake—survival and cohesion under sanctions—has real potential, but almost all conflict is summarized as already weathered rather than unfolding on the page. There is no concrete on-page obstacle, opposition, or hard choice during the meeting itself; everyone agrees, no one resists, and nothing threatens to fracture the community in the moment. The declaration scene does not foreclose options or force a trade-off; it merely articulates a consensus. Tension thus remains largely abstract and static, without a meaningful tightening or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.3)
    The dominant stake—Aria’s need to understand and heal the wound around “unused love”—is signaled early, but pressure on that desire stays soft. The arrival of the pilgrim of sparks and the breathing exercises create a nominal turning point, yet Aria never faces a meaningful trade-off or conflicting impulse; she simply accepts guidance. Stakes never sharpen into a choice that might cost her something concrete (e.g., giving up a comforting misbelief). The result is a gentle deepening rather than true escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes remain almost entirely conceptual: understanding the “texture of time” and the implications of being retrocognitively trapped. There is no real opposition or escalating pressure—no threat of loss, no deadline, no alternative path that might be foreclosed. The “disorienting yet exhilarating” experience is described but never concretely tests Elian’s resolve or forces a trade-off. As a result, escalation is shallow and the final beat lacks a sense of paid price.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are nominally huge (control over food resilience in a post-wall city), but on-page pressure is minimal. The “heavily guarded” vault and controlling forces are disposed of in a single, effortless move (“using their knowledge…to slip past the sentries”), with no reversal, near-failure, or trade-off. The liberator’s plan always works; there’s no moment where a live option is foreclosed or a meaningful sacrifice is made. As a result, tension barely escalates and the outcome feels guaranteed from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—Lyra’s quest to capture the sound of trust breaking—is articulated but never meaningfully threatened or complicated. There is no clear escalation; she moves steadily from working to success without obstacles, trade-offs, or reversals. Internal conflict (e.g., whether encoding this pain is ethically or personally fraught) is not dramatized, so the imprinting moment lacks tension. As a result, stakes feel abstract and the story reads as an extended vignette rather than a pressured arc.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict and stakes are minimal: nothing meaningfully opposes Lumina, and there is no risk attached to photographing the couple or taking the jar. The flower code intrigues them but does not force a trade-off or threaten loss; it merely adds another layer of wonder and forward motion. Escalation is almost nonexistent—tonal intensity rises slightly as “the fabric of reality” seems to shift, but no options are narrowed and no path is foreclosed. The piece functions as an extended mood vignette rather than a pressured scene.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and kept at a conceptual level, with Elian’s “daunting prospect” of leaving the familiar mentioned but never concretely dramatized or opposed. Stakes (crafting safe zones, embracing a new calling) are noble but abstract, and nothing in the scene forces a hard trade-off or tests their resolve. There is little escalation under any lens: no new pressure, deadline, or resistant force emerges after the premise is laid out. As a result, the story feels meditative rather than tense or climactic.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—whether he can move from paralyzing fear and identity shock to a more integrated, vulnerable self—is articulated but not pressed hard in scene. The only concrete task, decrypting the note, lacks escalating resistance or a meaningful trade-off; “after what felt like hours” compresses the struggle away. Internal and external pressures don’t particularly sharpen each other, so the final decision to change feels more like a declared intention than the result of tested commitment. The piece needs at least one moment where continuing the search costs him something tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can successfully “map the endless night”—is declared but never seriously tested. No opposing force, internal or external, complicates her effort; the storm simply fades, the silence deepens on cue, and her success is asserted. There is a tonal escalation (darker room, vibrating air, rearranged shadows), but not a tightening of options or a trade-off. Without clear resistance or price, the conflict reads as largely static contemplation.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—Zeta's desire to understand where its thoughts come from—is stated clearly but never really put under strain. The "looped timelines" suggest experimentation, yet these trials and their failures are summarized, so we don't feel options narrowing or a genuine risk of loss beyond a hypothetical broken violin. There is no concrete opposing force or dilemma that forces a trade-off or renunciation. As a result, tension remains low and escalation is minimal, making the final understanding feel relatively costless.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and largely abstract, framed as mistrust versus honesty without a concrete situation to sharpen the stakes. There is no real escalation—just repeated restatements of how secrecy is melting away and clarity is dawning. Her “choice” to embrace honesty and guardianship meets no resistance and forecloses no palpable alternative path. As a result, tension never tightens; it drifts steadily toward a preordained epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict and stakes remain almost entirely conceptual: the dresser wants to prove the garden “knows” them, but no opposing force or meaningful test appears. There’s no escalation or tightening—no moment where success or failure hangs in the balance, only reiterated flourishing and quiet satisfaction. “Mended deception” and measurable luck suggest deeper pressures that never materialize in scene. The ending registers as a gentle affirmation, not the culmination of real narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain almost entirely intellectual and emotional (curiosity, wonder), with no articulated danger, opposition, or meaningful trade-off. The only “tightening” is the simulator successfully manifesting the nexus; nothing resists Kaelin, and her goal is achieved without sacrifice or setback. Touching the nexus should be a pressured decision, but it reads as a straightforward fulfillment of desire. As a result, tension never truly escalates, and the climax feels more like a scheduled reveal than a tested choice.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the maestro’s hidden message and recovering inspiration—is present, but the story offers almost no real opposition. Rachel decides to “disrupt the tranquility,” tilts the program, and the mystery unfolds without meaningful resistance, risk, or trade-off. There is essentially one mild tightening (her decision to actively manipulate the water), but no serious test of resolve or option foreclosed. As a result, tension stays low and escalation is more rhetorical than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake is Aria’s need to understand the “swallowed truth,” but it remains intellectual and unopposed by any real threat or counter-force. There’s no concrete risk to her relationships, status, or body; the community’s “curiosity and wariness” never coalesces into pressure that demands a choice. Escalation is minimal: her investigations deepen but do not force a trade-off or foreclose an option. The final recognition of truth’s provisionality is interesting but reads as a reflective adjustment, not the resolution of built tension.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and remains low-intensity: the feeling of being watched, curiosity about hidden truths, skepticism versus eerie atmosphere. The dominant stake—uncovering a “weighty truth”—never sharpens into a concrete dilemma or trade-off; discovering the logbook produces interest but not a pressured choice. Escalation is mostly tonal rather than situational, with little sense of risk or loss if the explorer fails or succeeds. The final “satisfaction” is granted without any visible price or narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is minimal and largely internal, with the only discernible tension being between continued chronicling and the urge to burrow into silence. That urge never meets real resistance; there’s no articulated fear, obligation, or competing value that makes the decision difficult. Escalation is weak: long passages reiterate seasons drifting by and regenerative silence without introducing new stakes or narrowing options. The final state feels like a gentle slide rather than a tested or costly resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—can Aria help Eli connect to “ordinary magic” and find his place—is stated but barely tested. There is no meaningful opposition, risk of failure, or reversal; once Eli arrives, everything unfolds smoothly toward success. The eclipse could have tightened pressure but instead serves as a picturesque backdrop, with no scenario in which Aria’s attempt plausibly fails. As a result, escalation is minimal and the outcome feels foregone, reducing tension considerably.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is minimal to nonexistent: Emilia wants to uncover secrets, and nothing opposes her, complicates her, or forces a trade-off. There is no escalation beyond repetitive deepening of atmosphere; each new detail reinforces the same low-pressure goal. The diaries do not resist deciphering in a way that matters dramatically, nor does the tapestry ever force a choice. As a result, the story has mood but almost no tension or visible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes remain abstract: “life about to change,” “new understanding,” and “transpose their life into a new key” are asserted rather than linked to concrete risks or trade-offs. The arrival of the stranger is framed as a catalyst, but their conversation is entirely summarized with no on-page conflict, dilemma, or loss. The Oracle’s agency (deciding to orchestrate, guiding the flow of words) never runs into resistance or requires sacrifice. As a result, pressure does not genuinely escalate; it plateaus in a steady, vague mystique.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.0)
    Stakes are nominally high (“possession that had threatened to consume the land”) but remain entirely offstage and bloodless. Escalation is limited to repeated phrases about whispers growing louder and the soundscape reaching a crescendo; no new obstacles, reversals, or trade-offs arise. The resolution is announced rather than felt, so tension never truly tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are almost entirely internal and remain at a low simmer throughout: will the writer recapture inspiration and claim their role as “conductor.” There is no real opposition beyond vague exhaustion, and that pressure never forces a decisive trade-off or loss on the page. The “pace quickened” and “time bending” gestures suggest escalation but don’t translate into altered tactics or narrowed options. The result is a static, meditative piece with little true tension or tested commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.4)
    The dominant stake—conquering the labyrinth of self to gain reality-shaping power—is clear but remains mostly conceptual. The labyrinth “shifts and reconfigures itself” and presents “new challenges,” yet the story summarizes her overcoming them without a concrete, escalating test that forces a trade-off. There is no real reversal or loss; her success feels inevitable from the start, undercutting tension. As a result, stakes stay abstract and never bite into a felt dilemma or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—Aria versus her emotional numbness—is established, but the on-page conflict remains largely static. There is no clear turn where her efforts genuinely fail, complicate, or demand a tradeoff; instead, her humming and drum work gradually, gently “work.” The escalation is more a thickening of atmosphere (“air grew thick with anticipation”) than a meaningful narrowing of options or heightening of cost. As a result, the final peace lands softly, without a sharp sense of price or tested commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake (uncovering a dangerous hidden lab/quarantine zone while possibly being surveilled) is gestured at but never truly activated in scene. Being followed home and the shiver of being watched could create real pressure, yet they don’t change her tactics beyond a single “circuitous route” reference. The central conflict becomes purely internal and largely declarative—whether to act on the information—without a concrete, dramatized test of courage or risk. As a result, tension plateaus early and the vow at the end lacks the feel of an earned high-cost commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara remains trapped in grief or finds a new relationship to her memories—is present but soft and never faces a sharp test. Conflict is almost entirely internal and resolves without a clear trade-off or visible price; she releases sorrow and gains peace with little resistance. There’s no significant escalation beyond mood deepening when the ultraviolet lights come on; no option is meaningfully foreclosed. The piece reads as a static meditation rather than a pressured arc.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.2)
    “Impossible choices” and humanity’s options (adapt, resist, flee) are named but never concretely tested in scene. The poet encounters no opposition—no character, event, or internal fracture escalates pressure beyond contemplative arrangement of stones. Stakes remain abstract; there is no moment where a live option is foreclosed or a visible price is paid. As a result, tension is atmospheric rather than structural and does not genuinely build.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake is emotional: can she transform the oppressive hush into something bearable through connection and art. Pressure rises modestly when she discovers the group and is invited in, but she never truly risks rejection, failure, or deeper loss. Playing the violin functions as a decision, yet it is framed as intuitively right rather than a fraught choice with alternatives or visible price. As a result, conflict remains low-grade and the story reads more like a lyric meditation than a test of commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict and stakes are very low: she has a task, completes it, and leaves, with no serious obstacle, doubt, or opposing force. The half-truth nature of her work never generates a concrete dilemma or a price on the page. There’s no escalation beyond accumulating description; tension does not meaningfully rise. As a result, the story reads as static and meditative rather than dramatically engaged.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.8)
    There is almost no real conflict: every development arrives as a gift, from the locket’s recovery to the instant rapport and community project. Stakes (honoring “silent contributors”) remain abstract and untested; no one resists, doubts, or pays anything on the page. The emotional trajectory is a flat upward glide without a meaningful tightening or dilemma. As a result, the final decision to start a project feels nice but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—Kael’s need to belong through art—is stated clearly but remains abstractly safe throughout. The tag hunt offers mild curiosity rather than genuine tension; there is never a sense that failure would cost Kael anything significant, emotionally or socially. Once the tag is found, everything proceeds smoothly to success without a turn that tests Kael’s commitment or exposes them to rejection. The piece reads more as a sequence of affirmations than as conflict escalating toward a costly resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.0)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the infinity symbol to reach the birthplace of echoes—is clearly stated, but almost no genuine opposition arises once Lyra decides to act. Borrowing time from the giant is framed as daring, yet it unfolds frictionlessly; there’s no moment where she might fail, harm the city, or be cut off by the giant’s waking. As a result, pressure barely escalates, and the ending lacks a sense of trade-off or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—gaining insight into the “mathematics of emotion”—is clear but largely unopposed, so tension remains low. The orchard’s silence and the weight of “ambiguous loss” suggest potential pressure, yet no real obstacle, reversal, or trade-off materializes as the ritual progresses. Her understanding arrives smoothly, with no decision that forecloses a path or exposes a tangible price. As a result, escalation is more implied by tone than enacted in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—being seen/acknowledged while remaining hidden—stays mostly conceptual and untested by concrete opposition. There is little escalation; the work in the pipe chases at the end differs in tone (“newfound sense of urgency”) but not in kind, with no real narrowing of options or dilemma. No antagonistic force (human, environmental, or internal) presses the dweller into a specific trade-off beyond continued secrecy. As a result, the “step closer to being seen” reads as an incremental mood shift rather than a pressured turn with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.0)
    The central conflict—whether Emilia will cling to control or accept metamorphosis—is stated but never put under real stress. Storm season and anxiety provide a situational pressure, but nothing escalates beyond restated unease; there’s no concrete test where holding on visibly costs her something specific. The “turn” is essentially a decision to reframe her attitude, with minimal felt sacrifice. Stakes remain conceptual and gentle, limiting tension.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=5.0)
    The dominant stake is internal—understanding the brooch/convergence to “thresh meaning” from trauma—but pressure remains low and mostly unopposed. The only significant external friction is the art-for-information barter, which is resolved quickly without real dilemma or loss on the page. There is little escalation; the story moves linearly through discoveries rather than tightening options or introducing costly trade-offs. As a result, the ending reads reflective rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is minimal: there is no real opposition, danger, or hard trade-off—only a gentle invitation to deepen a gift she already wields with ease. The core stake (Aria’s understanding of magic) never feels at risk; accepting the pearl and going deeper into the cave bring only benefits, and no false step, doubt, or loss complicates that progression. As a result, escalation is largely rhetorical, and the ending carries little felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—helping a traumatized community recover its sense of identity—is stated, but the story soft-pedals tension; there’s no serious resistance, failure, or ethical friction around her project. The main “tightening” is her decision to create public installations, yet this choice faces no on-page obstacles or trade-offs and unfolds as an easy success montage. Internal conflict (e.g., doubt about imposing a narrative, fear of reopening wounds) is absent, so pressure never truly escalates. As a result, the piece functions more as a thematic vignette than as a story with live stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are almost entirely abstract—“hidden truths,” “ancient knowledge,” “unspoken words”—and never face a tangible test or real opposition. Emilia’s path is strangely frictionless: no wrong turns, threats, or conflicting desires challenge her drive to reach the fortress. The closest gesture toward escalation is the deepening mist and colder air, but these never force a trade-off or change of tactic. As a result, the journey reads as a ritual passage rather than a conflict with rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the tile’s secrets and understanding the entangled memories—never meets real opposition, internal or external. Emilia decides to search, finds the compartment, deciphers patterns, and succeeds in a straight line with no setbacks, alternatives, or trade-offs. There is no credible loss, moral tension, or narrowing of options; stakes stay abstract and untested. As a result, tension remains low and escalation is essentially a gentle increase in awe rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.3)
    The primary stake—Kael’s existential boredom and question about what happens after goodbye—is stated, but never placed under serious threat or dilemma. Using a “cursed” fragment carries no on-page danger; there is no moment where Kael might lose something he values, or must trade one good for another. The appearance of the duplicate resolves the question almost immediately rather than testing Kael’s commitment or introducing new pressure. Escalation exists in terms of energy intensifying, but there is little genuine conflict or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—securing political asylum at the risk of being caught in a protocol breach—is articulated clearly but almost entirely held at arm’s length. Conflict is largely off-stage (in the adjoining office), while on the page Lena mostly “waits,” thinks, and then resolves to be ready. The proposed breach does raise abstract tension, yet we never see a concrete narrowing of options, reversal, or on-page test of that risk. The escalation is therefore conceptual rather than experiential, which blunts pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is essentially no external opposition and only the faintest internal tension; the protagonist wants to collect textures and simply does so without obstacle. The hum grows and fades, but this is not framed as a pressured window where failure would matter, just as a natural cycle she rides along with. Stakes remain abstract—“world’s essence,” “invented histories”—without being tested. As a result, there’s no real escalation; the piece maintains a steady, contemplative plateau.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is essentially no antagonistic force—internal or external—beyond time’s abstract passage. The “task” of layering stories encounters no friction, and no choice carries visible risk or trade-off; the survivor simply continues doing what they intend to do until they’re done. Stakes remain conceptual (erased histories vs forgetting) and never crystallize into a concrete cost or dilemma. As a result, pressure does not genuinely escalate, and the ending feels more like a continuation than an earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the universal riddle/ephemeral compass—is declared but never truly tested. There is no antagonist, no risk of failure, and no trade-off beyond generic intensity as the whispers grow louder. The so-called escalation (hums growing, whispers becoming cacophony) is purely descriptive; it doesn’t force her into a hard choice or foreclose an option. As a result, the climax (“ephemeral compass click into place”) feels inevitable and low-cost, undermining tension.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.2)
    The central stake—loss of the city to privatization—is signaled, but conflict unfolds as smooth success: Ava acts, the residents are inspired, unity spreads, and by the end they are ready. There is no concrete scene of resistance meeting pushback, no reversal, and no moment where a real option is foreclosed or a price is paid. Pressure and stakes remain conceptual, never viscerally tested. Escalation is thus more rhetorical than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—capturing images before the flora disappears—is stated, but the conflict is soft and mostly uncontested. Dr. Patel’s warning and the need to “outlast the harsh conditions” hint at pressure, yet we never see concrete obstacles or genuine risk to Elara’s success. There’s one clear tightening (the time pressure of imminent disappearance/dawn), after which things proceed smoothly to success. Without visible cost or a hard trade-off, escalation feels conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—can Emilia get the drone to fly true?—is clear, but the pressure around it hardly escalates. Emilia encounters no real setbacks, no genuine risk of failure, and no competing demand from the outside world; the ship’s maiden voyage operates as auspicious backdrop rather than a live clock or constraint. Her agency is present but never tested, so the final success feels inevitable and low-cost. The result is a beautifully textured vignette with very soft conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are asserted as enormous (“world would be remade,” “one of its greatest secrets”) but remain almost entirely abstract on the page. There is little real opposition—no hazard in deciphering the pattern, no test of belief in the falcon omen, no concrete risk in crossing the lake beyond a faint creak. The main “turn” (cracking the code and deciding to leave) happens without friction, sacrifice, or a forced trade-off. As a result, tension stays low and escalation feels more like repetition of urgency than a narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes remain almost entirely abstract: the “revival” of the town is declared important, but there is no concrete opposition, deadline, or risk of failure on the page. The rhythm “grows stronger” and the town “responds,” yet nothing meaningfully threatens this process or forces the tuner to adapt. Escalation is more repetition than tightening; the night simply passes. Without a live contest or visible trade-off, conflict feels ornamental rather than driving.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—saving the temple’s memories before the energy dies—is declared early, but on-page pressure stays abstract. The “time runs short” motif never manifests as a concrete ticking clock (no near-failure, no forced shortcut), and her process of “unsnarling” reads as effortful in language but frictionless in outcome. Internal conflict (duty vs. loneliness, memories of loved ones) is mentioned but doesn’t force a real trade-off or reversal. As a result, escalation feels more like steady description than a tightening vise.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and low-grade: a desire to uncover secrets with no active opposition beyond vague trepidation. The “heavy-looking lock” and ominous mention of future-discovered bodies imply stakes that never actually bite—he neither fails to open the door nor confronts reasons not to. There is no meaningful reversal or narrowing of options; each beat is another step in the same direction. As a result, pressure never truly tightens, and the final choice to “press on” reads as a continuation of baseline intent, not a tested or costly commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes stay abstract: awakening flora and repaying a karmic debt are potentially rich, but no concrete threat, deadline, or opposing force sharpens the choice to take the bead. The alchemist never seriously considers not acting; there’s no real alternative path, risk, or sacrifice on the page. The ghost bride’s internal conflict (helping vs. harming, or debt vs. letting go) is asserted but not tested in a specific pressured moment. As a result, tension is gentle and static, with minimal escalation beyond “and then everything awakened.”

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes remain almost entirely conceptual: the “broken world” and Aria’s mission are asserted, but no specific danger, opposition, or risk of failure ever manifests in-scene. There is no meaningful escalation; she begins weaving with hope and ends having woven, without reversals, setbacks, or trade-offs. The “weight of her task” is mentioned but never concretely impacts her options or behavior. As a result, tension stays low and the piece reads more like an extended premise meditation than conflict-driven fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—Maya’s need to reconnect with heritage and faith—is clearly declared but stays abstract. Conflict is almost entirely internal and low-friction: excavation proceeds smoothly; there are no setbacks, competing obligations, or moral trade-offs on the page. The main “escalation” is temporal (days into weeks) and cumulative detail, rather than a genuine tightening of pressure or narrowing of options. As a result, the ending is emotionally framed as significant but hasn’t been properly stress-tested by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.7)
    There is effectively no on-page conflict; Cipher’s goal (prepare and send a letter) encounters no resistance, dilemma, or meaningful risk. Stakes remain abstract (“a piece of Cipher’s soul,” “beauty in the slow, deliberate dance of surface mail”) without any concrete fear, loss, or opposing pressure. The only implied tension is the vague anticipation before mailing, which never tightens into a choice with consequences. As a result, escalation is minimal and the piece reads as static despite its lyrical layering.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are theoretically high (a coup that could upend the observatory) but remain distant and undifferentiated, with no specific consequences or antagonistic force on the page. Conflict is almost entirely internal and abstract, expressed as “urgency” rather than dramatized choices or obstacles. There is no real reversal or escalation beyond repetition: the embroiderer keeps working, days pass, urgency grows, then completion happens. As a result, pressure never truly tightens in a way that forces a costly decision.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—confronting the sorrow and regret bound up in the unsent letters—is clear but remains abstract and largely internal. There is mild escalation as the spirits’ singing intensifies and the entity coalesces, yet Aria is never forced into a painful trade-off or a visibly costly choice; her agency is steady and unopposed. The climax (facing the manifestation) reads more as a ritual completion than a pressured decision point. As a result, tension is present but muted, and the stakes never fully bite.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can reframe her trauma and anxiety—is almost entirely internal and largely static. The only nominal escalation is the anesthetic “taking hold” and her racing to interpret the cast, but this never becomes a genuine pressure point; nothing is at risk if she fails or stops. There is no meaningful reversal or narrowing of options, just deepening repetition of the same emotional register. As a result, the resolution reads as a gentle slide into peace rather than a pressured, earned turn.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lena can overcome creative stagnation and reclaim lost joy—is articulated but barely pressured. She encounters no real resistance: the orchard yields inspiration, the fragment is conveniently found, and the mural’s creation is summarized rather than dramatized through obstacles or tradeoffs. There is no genuine escalation or narrowing of options; her path from listlessness to fulfillment reads as smooth inevitability. As a result, tension is low and the “win” feels emotionally soft, with no evident cost or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Lena’s need to break out of stifling certainty into a more open, enchanted relationship with her work—is present from early on. There is an escalation from quiet restoration to an experimental feedback maelstrom, but resistance or genuine jeopardy (emotional, artistic, or physical) is largely absent; nothing substantial threatens to go irretrievably wrong. Her agency drives the central turn (rearranging mirrors to “bewitch” reality), yet this decision is almost frictionless, with no hard trade-off or visible loss beyond a vague letting go of certainty. Tension remains mostly atmospheric rather than genuinely pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are declared (freedom of thought versus taxation) but never really tested in scene: Lyra’s plan faces no obstacles, surveillance, or missteps. There’s no escalation; once the method is described, everything proceeds smoothly via summary to a flourishing network and lasting legacy. Without reversals, trade-offs, or explicit risk, the tension remains conceptual rather than felt. The result is a static conflict frame rather than a tightening sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—whether she can transmute her accumulated pain and longing into sustaining beauty—is stated, but the pressure on that desire barely tightens. Her solution (singing/writing) appears without serious obstacles or alternatives, so there is limited sense of risk, trade-off, or failure. The shift to a calmer, renewed purpose reads more like a gentle mood modulation than a hard-won stance. As a result, conflict is present but remains soft and largely untested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving forgotten names and extinct feelings—remains entirely uncontested on the page; the song works, the balance holds, and nothing resists her aim. There is no concrete threat to the library, the orchids, or the museum, so tension never escalates beyond a generalized wistfulness. The cracked chime suggests potential loss but never forces a trade-off or adaptation. As a result, the piece reads more like a mood piece than a story with active stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=4.8)
    The central stakes—Elara’s need to redeem herself and avoid renewed isolation—are declared, but on the page the conflict remains mostly internal and untested. There’s no concrete obstacle to decoding the text, no antagonist, and no moment where she might fail again in a visible way. The supposed clock (“before paths diverge”) is gestured at rather than enacted, so pressure doesn’t truly escalate. Her “major breakthrough” arrives without a clear trade-off or foreclosed path, keeping tension modest and static.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.2)
    The central stakes—harmonizing historical preservation with modern safety and community needs—remain conceptual and untested in any concrete dilemma. There is no on-page obstacle, opposition, or trade-off where she must choose one value at the expense of another. Escalation is essentially emotional restatement: her “resolve deepened” but nothing in her situation closes off options or raises prices. Without at least one sharpened choice or loss, the conflict feels static and the stakes abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.2)
    The central conflict—balancing secrecy and connection, living with a patched history and lost songs—is conceptually present but under-pressured on the page. There’s no clear beat where her secrecy or falsified paper trails visibly threaten a relationship or outcome; opposition is almost entirely internal and static. The ritual with the dust motes offers a form of agency (choosing balance) but doesn’t arise from escalating stakes so much as from habit. As a result, the final sense of peace lands gently rather than as the resolution of sharpened tension.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.3)
    The dominant stake—understanding sacred thresholds and no longer being “lost”—is stated but never truly pressured; nothing substantial opposes the narrator. The path revealed by the code presents no credible risk, sacrifice, or chance of failure; following it is frictionless. Internal tension (fear vs. desire for knowledge, ambivalence about the father) never surfaces in action. As a result, escalation is minimal and the resolution feels like a gentle slide into insight rather than a tested, costly stance.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are purely internal and expressed in abstract language: learning rhythms, finding belonging, securing “luminous respite.” There is no meaningful opposition, reversal, or escalation; nothing in the facility resists the astrologer’s goal, and their inner state never meaningfully wavers. The “pressure” of time and place is declared (“air was heavy with anticipation”) but never forces a trade-off or hard choice. This makes the piece read as a prolonged mood rather than a conflict-driven story.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why paths disappear—is clearly stated, but on-page pressure is very low and never truly tightens. Each apparent obstacle (missing paths, mystery of the seeds, dense crystal cluster) yields quickly without forcing a difficult choice or trade-off. There is little sense that failure, delay, or misinterpretation would cost her anything beyond a mild extension of her “cheerful gloom.” As a result, escalation feels more like a smooth rise in wonder than a conflict with real stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes remain extremely low throughout: Elian wants to create wonder, and he does, without encountering opposition or risk of failure. There is no antagonist, no serious possibility his method will fail, and no moment where he must choose between competing goods or costs. The middle and ending do not escalate beyond the opening premise; each performance feels equivalent in pressure. As a result, tension is largely absent and the piece functions as descriptive exposition of a talent rather than dramatized conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain mostly abstract—will she capture a “cosmic verse”—and there is little sense of what failure would mean beyond mild disappointment. The only real “pressure” is her internal uncertainty before she decides to dance, and once she chooses, everything unfolds smoothly toward success without reversal or genuine test. The nostalgia ban and exile could generate conflict but instead function as backstory without on-page friction. As a result, escalation is weak and the climax reads as an inevitable payoff rather than a hard-won threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is effectively no conflict beyond a very soft, internal urgency to “capture the essence of this moment.” No opposing force, risk, or visible price tests that desire—nothing meaningful is lost or foreclosed if she fails. The fisherman and the prism atrium offer images rather than antagonistic or complicating pressure. As a result, stakes never escalate; the emotional temperature remains nearly flat from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes remain abstract: the “devastating impact of wildfires” and his lost innocence never become a concrete, contested decision in the present scene. The only semblance of a turn is when he opens the box and looks into the mirror, but this does not narrow his options or test him; it simply cues more reflection. There is no external or internal pressure that escalates—no fear of what he might see, no risk in accepting or rejecting the “enlightenment” offered. As a result, the conflict reads as a static meditation rather than a tightening arc with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict and stakes remain almost entirely abstract: Aria wants to “bring light into the darkness” and help parallel timelines, but nothing on the page genuinely resists her. The main “pressure” is the scale of the vision briefly overwhelming her, yet it doesn’t force a concrete decision or sacrifice—she simply recognizes she’s on the right path. There’s no clear tightening where an option is foreclosed or a price paid; the journey from contemplation to reassurance lacks teeth. As a result, tension feels low and largely declarative instead of dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes stay largely abstract—“uncovering secrets,” “understanding legacy”—with no external opposition or time pressure and minimal internal resistance. The discovery of the film and diaries could have been tightening beats, but there’s no sense of risk, danger, or potential loss attached to pursuing them. The cartographer essentially moves from curiosity to more informed curiosity to acceptance, without a meaningful test of commitment. As a result, conflict feels static and the emotional price of the final stance remains low.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are declared—unlocking secrets “beyond the veil of reality”—but never really bite; nothing tangible opposes her, and failure seems to carry no on-page consequence beyond mild disappointment. The closest thing to escalation is the progression of the bells and the mirrors’ gradual response, yet each stage simply deepens success. There is no meaningful tightening in which options narrow or a trade-off is forced, so tension remains low and static. As a result, the “surge of excitement” at the first bell reads disproportionate to the very gentle pressure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—ending a devastating, long-running conflict—is powerful in theory but remains abstractly declared rather than viscerally felt. There is no concrete opposition on the page, no specific dispute or moment where peace nearly collapses, so tension never truly escalates. Elian’s agency is mostly implied (“his approach proved a balm,” “negotiations edged closer to a breakthrough”) rather than dramatized through contested beats. As a result, the eventual hope reads more like a foregone summary than a hard-won turn.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—restoring the land and preserving the echo of extinct birds—is articulated clearly but remains largely abstract on the page. There is a mild escalation as thunder grows louder and the “lull” closes, yet no real opposition or sacrifice tests her commitment. She never seriously risks anything or weighs competing harms; once she walks to the center and raises the egg, success arrives without price. As a result, tension plateaus rather than tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant conflict—her desire to defy conformity—is presented but seldom dramatized as a struggle; society’s “shroud” is invoked, yet no specific obligations or relationships push back. The main turning point (the completion of untangling threads and the prism’s glow) happens without genuine risk or a tested alternative, so escalation feels more like a steady drift than a tightening. Stakes remain conceptual (freedom vs. conformity) rather than grounded in an on-page loss or sacrifice. The resolution is clean but low-tension, with little visible price for her liberation.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is almost no concrete conflict on the page: the “heated argument” occurs before the story, and once in the dome Amaranth encounters no resistance, dilemma, or real test of her mission. Stakes (“explore the ethics of storytelling,” “subvert and challenge her audience”) are declared but never dramatized or put at risk. The internal process is uniformly positive—soothing, inspiring, satisfying—so pressure never tightens. The result is a contemplative vignette rather than a story with escalating tension.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Aria can honor fragile, overlooked histories—remains almost entirely internal and unopposed, with no real escalation beyond a deepening of tone. The arrival of the moth wing and the finishing of the final knot are framed as significant, but they don’t close off alternatives or force a trade-off. There is no antagonist, no real risk of failure, and no moment where she must sacrifice something tangible. As a result the piece reads as a contemplative tableau rather than a scene with growing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can preserve the sound of forgotten names—is declared but never truly pressured in scene. There is no real opposition, reversal, or moment where her method looks likely to fail; the process unfolds smoothly from start to finish. Internal tension about her past mistakes is summarized as already resolved, so it doesn’t create live conflict. As a result, escalation and cost remain abstract, and the climax reads as a foregone conclusion rather than an earned test.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.0)
    The dominant stake—grasping the nature of the decaying directive and path/chooser dynamic—is signaled, but conflict remains almost entirely internal and strangely unopposed. The storm, the ancient power, and Hindsight’s limitations are gestured at but never corner them into a trade-off or risky decision; entering the dreamscape is frictionless. Escalation is mostly atmospheric (storm intensifies, dream symbols “dance”) rather than a tightening of options. The concluding stance feels like a gentle alignment with destiny rather than a choice with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are declared as immense (a covenant that will “forever change” the universe), but on the page the astronomer encounters no resistance—social, material, or internal—that would test their resolve. The central pressure is a desire to decode and then to bind celestial and terrestrial realms, yet there is no risk of failure, doubt, or meaningful trade-off dramatized. Escalation reads mostly as intensifying rhetoric (“overwhelming urge,” “badge of office,” “life’s work was complete”) rather than constrained options or raised costs. As a result, tension remains flat and the climax has little bite.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—helping people relinquish resentment—is declared early, but pressure on it never truly tightens; there’s no sense that Elara might fail or pay a meaningful price. The key “turn” is the melody’s resurgence and reality’s shift, which conveniently empowers her spell rather than testing her resolve. The listeners’ transformation is swift and unopposed; their “faces a mask of pain and anger” dissolve almost instantly once she acts, which undercuts tension. As a result, the conflict feels more like a foregone conclusion than a hard-won change.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are almost entirely internal and remain abstract: the desire to capture a dream and cross into a liminal realm. There is no real resistance—no failure risk in the ritual, no competing value (safety, relationships, obligations) to make her decision costly. The closest thing to escalation is the blurring of self and dream as the mirror nears completion, but this surfaces as description rather than a pressured choice point. The result is a beautiful mood-piece with minimal actual conflict or tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes—healing a wounded place, repairing a generational breach—are conceptually significant but never come under strong on-page pressure. There is no real resistance to Elara’s work, and the breach of contract remains a past event rather than an active source of conflict; she simply decides to tend the orchard and everything steadily improves. Aria’s return, though emotionally positive, arrives without friction or real risk, so there’s little sense of what might be lost. As a result, escalation is more a soft accumulation of good outcomes than a tested commitment with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is very soft: the curator feels “disquiet” and mild fear before robed figures but encounters no real resistance or dilemma. The Order is “rumored to pursue forbidden knowledge,” yet there is no concrete threat, taboo, or sacrifice when they choose to follow and accept the book. Stakes are framed as potentially immense (“forbidden knowledge,” “change their understanding forever”) but are never tested on the page. As a result, escalation is mostly a series of curiosities rather than tightening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.5)
    The stakes are conceptually strong—beat the shadowy pursuers, secure the diary, and find a once-lost library—but the external conflict remains mostly notional. “Rescue missions,” “treacherous shelves,” and “avoiding the shadowy pursuers” are glossed over without a single detailed, escalating scene where Elara must pay a tangible price or sacrifice an option. The renegotiation at the climax is too easy; there’s no serious pushback from the time traveler and no hard trade-off with the pursuers. Tension exists in outline but never tightens into a felt squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=4.2)
    The dominant stake—finding the Garden—is stated but never truly tested; nothing on the ship resists Lyra beyond mild confusion. Her moment of mental disorientation (“past and present began to blur”) is brief and quickly overridden by “she knew that she had to keep moving forward,” so there’s no genuine dilemma or sacrifice. There is little sense that failure is possible or that success costs her anything. As a result, tension remains low and escalation feels nominal.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain abstract—intellectual enlightenment about “fables of absence”—with no strong opposing pressure, time limit, or risk of failure. The ritual proceeds smoothly; neither Emilia nor the professor faces a hard choice, setback, or sacrifice. As a result, tension is low and escalation is minimal despite the heightened language around time distortion and energy.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=4.8)
    The central stake—restoring quiet—exists, but opposing pressure from the energy beings and the cave’s turbulence never escalates beyond being stated. Once the mapkeeper begins examining the ice and “conjuring” the bloom, nothing pushes back; there’s no reversal, narrowing of options, or visible cost. The energy beings quickly “sense the change” and harmonize without resistance, which reads as convenient. As a result, tension is low and the resolution feels foregone.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—reviving lost knowledge/hope after collapse—is declared but never meaningfully pressured. There are no obstacles, reversals, or hard trade-offs; once the shard appears, everything proceeds smoothly to success. Internal conflict (doubt, fear of failure, misreading of coincidences) is absent, so tension stays low throughout. The climax (touching the orrery) pays off the setup but doesn’t feel costly or dangerous, undercutting dramatic momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain almost entirely internal and abstract: will she embrace her role as guardian of memory, a role never seriously in doubt. There is no antagonist, no meaningful threat that she might reject or mishandle the collective memory, and her “task” never strains her to a visible breaking point. The moment of touching the crystal is framed as significant, but it immediately yields understanding and peace rather than complication. As a result, conflict barely escalates and tension is low throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—Lyra’s battle with hopelessness—is named but never truly pressured or escalated; she’s mildly blocked, then progressively soothed by external stimuli. There is no reversal or tightening where she risks failure, renounces an option, or pays a visible price; the note simply tips her from “struggling” to “inspired.” As a result, tension stays flat and the story reads as mood-piece rather than conflict-driven fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and extremely low-grade: the chronicler ponders “transition periods” in a state of calm curiosity, never genuinely torn or forced into a trade-off. The two figures’ “difficult conversation” sits off to the side; we never feel the stakes of their tension or see it materially affect her. There is no real escalation—only reiteration of the same contemplative state—so pressure does not tighten under any lens. The result is thematically coherent but dramatically flat.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Eli can expand beyond claustrophobia through this ritualized hour—is established, but pressure remains low and largely internal. There’s little on-page resistance: Eli does not seriously consider fleeing, refusing, or misusing the experience; conflict is more conceptual than dramatized. The gravity inversion and hush intensify mood but do not force a hard trade-off or visible sacrifice. As a result, the resolution feels gentle and somewhat inevitable rather than earned through escalating tension.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes—teaching silence to comfort the residents—remain almost entirely conceptual and untested by opposition. There is no concrete obstacle, resistance, or moment where her goal is jeopardized or meaningfully complicated. The day simply unfolds as intended, with no escalation beyond reiterated attentiveness. This yields a meditative vignette rather than a story with pressure or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.8)
    The nominal stakes are enormous (restoring a planet, claiming a throne before sunrise reveals “too much”), yet on the page, Aria meets no actual opposition—no adversary, trap, or internal hesitation ever truly escalates pressure. The murals provide information but never force a hard choice; the ruby flake simply guides her unerringly. As a result, tension remains abstract and flat, and the final ascent lacks a felt sense of risk or sacrifice. Conflict is more implied by premise than realized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—saving the sanctuary’s fading essence—is stated, but the pressure never truly tightens; each action (linking through scars, descending, touching the flame) proceeds without resistance or trade-off. There is no real reversal, test, or visible price beyond generic emotional weight, so stakes stay abstract. The internal conflict between preserving isolation and re-opening to the world is gestured at but not sharpened into a difficult decision point. As a result, tension is low and escalation feels more described than experienced.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the pressure-to-diamonds process/quantum promise—is clear but under-pressured. Strange lab phenomena are mentioned, yet they never truly threaten Lyra, the project, or her values; success arrives in a single untroubled burst. Lyra’s experimentation with the messages is framed as risky but yields only positive outcomes without trade-offs. As a result, the climax feels like an inevitability rather than the culmination of escalating, contested effort.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—uncovering a universe-changing truth—is announced but never really tested. There is no opposition, risk, or dilemma; turning the crank simply works and continues to work, with the only “escalation” being louder hums and richer visions. We never see a trade-off between the dynasty ender’s goal and any competing value, nor any credible fear of failure or harm. As a result, tension stays flat and the climax reads as an inevitable extension of the premise rather than a pressured turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and extremely low-friction: once the knight feels the connection, everything proceeds smoothly toward transcendence. Stakes remain abstract—“shape of possibility,” “presence growing stronger”—without a vivid sense of what could be lost or damaged. There is minimal escalation beyond intensifying language; no real resistance, dilemma, or reversal tests the knight’s allegiance. As a result the climax reads more like an extended mood piece than a pressured turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict here is largely implied: Emilia’s heartbreak versus her emerging sense of calling, but that tension never sharpens into a difficult trade-off or meaningful test. There is no external pressure or time constraint, and no real escalation beyond “more discoveries lead to more purpose.” The story’s central decision—to continue this work as her vocation—is framed as natural and costless. Without a felt price or narrowed options, stakes remain low and static.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.8)
    The central stake—resisting the “tyranny of indifference” by rejoining the movement—is stated repeatedly but never tested through real opposition or irreversible tradeoffs. Aria’s journey to the lagoon and participation in the gathering proceed without obstacles, reversals, or ethical friction. There is no clear escalation beyond tonal intensification as more rebels appear. The ending reads as a continuation of her stance rather than the result of pressured, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—soothing a community’s unease over a coded prophecy—is declared but never tested in a concrete way. There is no opposition beyond vague “unease,” no real risk that her tactic might fail, and no visible pushback or complication as she plays. Escalation is minimal; the music simply deepens and the mist responds more elaborately without narrowing options or forcing a trade-off. As a result, the climax reads more as a prolonged mood than a pressured turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is effectively no opposition; everything she does works, and nothing resists her goal of decoding the leaves. Stakes are declared as “prophecy of great change,” yet no concrete risk, moral tension, or meaningful trade-off ever tests her commitment. The line about the hush being “fragile, fleeting” hints at potential danger but never manifests as genuine pressure or a narrowing of options. The result is a static, contemplative piece rather than a story with escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain almost entirely internal and largely abstract—Elian wants “a new sense of direction” but never faces a concrete dilemma that could go meaningfully wrong. There is no real antagonistic pressure or escalation beyond the compass glowing more and the device taking shape. His “choice” at the end to step into the unknown isn’t set against a vivid alternative (staying in safe stasis, sacrificing something specific), so the price of that choice is murky. The result reads as a mood progression rather than genuine conflict under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=4.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s need for redemption and renewed purpose—is verbally clear but never meaningfully tested on the page. There is no concrete opposition beyond past disappointment; the piece moves from regret to resolution without a real escalation or a moment where she might genuinely fail or choose an easier path. “She set about creating a new experiment” is the closest we get to a pressure point, but no specific risk or trade-off is articulated. Tension remains low and static, closer to reflective essay than story under this standard.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=4.8)
    The central stake—guiding a trapped soul to peace—is understandable but never truly pressured. The collector meets no resistance beyond the woman’s initial restlessness, and that restlessness dissolves promptly once the confession begins. There is no reversal, hard trade-off, or threatened failure; success feels guaranteed from the outset. As a result, tension stays low and the resolution, while coherent, lacks a meaningful on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.4)
    The central stake—whether Elara will face her trauma in the forest to achieve some kind of redemption—is signaled and followed through. Yet escalation is flat: once she decides to go, nothing significantly tests or redirects that commitment, and the forest’s intensifying light doesn’t translate into concrete dilemmas, trade-offs, or visible losses. Her epiphany arrives without a real on-page reversal or narrowing of options; it feels granted rather than fought for. As a result, the resolution reads more like a smooth fulfillment of an intention than a pressured choice with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and largely unopposed: Lena wants to understand the anchors and then decides to honor forgotten histories, with little resistance or trade-off. The “urge to unfasten them” never meets a concrete obstacle or moral dilemma on the page. Stakes remain conceptual (hidden histories, between-worlds balance) rather than viscerally felt, and no live option is clearly foreclosed. As a result, pressure doesn’t truly tighten; it just accumulates mood and intention.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes stay low and largely abstract—Ezra wants to uncover hidden stories, and nothing in the environment seriously resists or complicates that goal. The dust-trail-to-compartment beat is the only real “tightening,” but it’s more a mild puzzle solve than a pressured turn. Ghosts, financial ruin, and “forgotten dreams” are treated as atmosphere rather than sources of concrete conflict. Without a visible trade-off or cost at the climax, tension never rises beyond gentle curiosity.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is almost entirely notional: releasing the whisper “will be a rupture,” but the operator opens the bottle without resistance and encounters no on-page opposition. The dominant stake—creating an eternal moment that destabilizes systems—never becomes a dilemma where any option carries visible cost; everything proceeds smoothly. Escalation registers only as accumulating description (more prints, louder “rustling awakenings”), not as narrowing options or heightened risk. As a result, the climax feels like a foregone ritual rather than a pressured turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are largely internal (her drive to uncover and reimagine the lost civilization and herself) and are declared rather than tested. The shard could have introduced sharper pressure (danger, institutional opposition, ethical dilemma), but instead it mainly prompts further reflection. The storm and uncanny time effects suggest risk but never corner her into a costly decision. As a result, tension plateaus and there is little sense of narrowing options or genuine sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring a lost song as a way of “reclaiming light”—is present but never moves beyond a quiet technical challenge. There is little escalation beyond increasingly elevated language; no obstacles, failures, or trade-offs test Erebus’s commitment or force altered tactics. The “moment of truth” arrives smoothly and resolves without visible cost, making the outcome feel foregone. As a result, tension remains low, more contemplative than genuinely pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain mostly abstract—the desire for revelation and mystery—without concrete jeopardy or a trade-off she might regret. The “pressure” is largely an internal sense of anticipation; no external obstacle, no meaningful reversal, and no real test of commitment beyond following where the compass points. The line “with a sense of trepidation and wonder” gestures at conflict, but nothing on the page forces a real choice. As a result, escalation is minimal and the climax feels like a predictable extension of the opening premise.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict and stakes are notably underdeveloped: the storm never feels truly dangerous, the GPS failure is already over when the story begins, and no real threat or sacrifice complicates Aria’s process. Her central aim—unlocking the slide’s meaning and creating a sculpture—is never seriously challenged, and each step proceeds without reversal or meaningful risk. The “timewoven alliances” idea remains purely reflective, not something that could fail or cost her. As a result, the piece reads as a meditative vignette rather than a story with escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict and stakes are minimal: Luna wants understanding and, over time, receives it without real resistance, sacrifice, or risk. There is no clear antagonist force—internal or external—that pushes back against her desire; the world seems fully cooperative with her quest. The “pressure” is essentially her curiosity, which does not escalate into a dilemma or ultimatum. As a result, the ending feels like a continuation of tone rather than the resolution of sharpened tension.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.1)
    Stakes—Naomi’s need to “uncover the truth” in the diary—remain almost entirely abstract, with no concrete risk or counter-force on the page. The main turn (initiating parley with Ada) is asserted as important but not dramatized with resistance, dilemma, or consequence. After that, pressure doesn’t escalate; the piece repeats that Naomi understands more and will keep following clues. Without a visible price or narrowed options, tension feels static despite the evocative setup.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.8)
    The central stake—reviving/reimagining the town—is stated repeatedly, but there is almost no concrete opposition: the task is called “daunting,” yet the alchemist is explicitly “undaunted,” and no real price is paid on the page. Escalation is mostly verbal intensification and repetition rather than new complications or narrowing options. The dawn turn to action lacks a felt trade-off, and the town’s subsequent flourishing arrives without any depicted struggle. The result is a largely static conflict profile that undercuts tension.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and remains low-grade; the scribe’s slight trepidation never hardens into a dilemma or forces a meaningful trade-off. The “accidental prophecy” is declared but not dramatized as a live risk, and no antagonistic force—internal or external—applies escalating pressure. The emotional temperature rises marginally as the air “thickens” and the patterns “pulse,” but this is descriptive rather than choice-driven escalation. The scribe’s final withdrawal feels like a continuation of their role, not a pressured decision with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving cosmic balance and the world’s cycle—is stated as immense, but on-page conflict is almost entirely internal and largely unopposed. The vortex offers intense sensations and visions, yet there’s no serious risk she might fail, flee, or be damaged; her “trial” reads as strenuous but foregone. Escalation is more a steady lyrical amplification than a meaningful narrowing of options or visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict and stakes are the weakest dimension: there is no real antagonist, deadline, or concrete risk opposing Ember’s desire to listen. The suggested tension between sirens (safety) and bell (beauty) remains conceptual and untested—no storm, no supervisor, no moment where choosing the bell could carry immediate consequences. The “zero hour” at the bell rope hints at a pivotal choice but never tightens into a true dilemma. As a result, escalation is minimal and the narrative reads as a meditative progression rather than a pressured story.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is almost entirely absent: there is no opposing force, no concrete dilemma, and no escalation beyond deepening reverie. The “stake” (finding strength in vulnerability) is declared but never tested by any on-page event or challenge. The lantern’s re-positioning and the dawn departure are soft turns that don’t foreclose alternatives or exact a price. As a result, tension is minimal and the piece reads more like a meditation than a story under this standard.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the recluse will engage with the memories in the box—is present but under-pressured. Opening the box and reading the letters proceed without meaningful resistance, risk, or moral dilemma, and the ghosts’ stirring never becomes an actual threat or demand. The “tangled covenant” is gestured at as catastrophic, yet no concrete on-page choice engages or alters it, so the scale of declared stakes and the actual conflict are mismatched. The ending offers a stance (continuing as guardian), but escalation en route is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes remain vague: the world is “timeless,” but nothing bad happens if the timekeeper fails, nor is any trade-off dramatized if they succeed. The conflict is almost entirely conceptual and unopposed; no force resists their investigation. The “hidden pattern/code” discovery lacks a sharp turn or price—responses arrive conveniently and produce excitement rather than dilemma. As a result, pressure doesn’t truly tighten, and the journey reads more as methodical curiosity than story-level conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict and stakes are extremely soft; the only real “tension” is between perfection and accepting incompleteness, but it never sharpens into a felt dilemma. The poem is “tended” without real risk, and the kite snapping feels more like a decorative memento mori than a forcing pressure. There’s no clear escalation—her stance at the end is very close to where she began. As a result, the piece has mood but little narrative grip.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—using remaining time to reshape the orchard as a legacy of interspecies respect—is stated, but conflict remains almost entirely abstract and unopposed. There is no real resistance (social, physical, or internal) to the project; the medic, the land, and other beings never push back, so escalation is minimal. The six-month diagnosis should create tightening, yet the narrative voice glides calmly through “weeks” and “months” without concrete tests or trade-offs. As a result, the ending’s endurance carries concept but little felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes remain almost entirely conceptual (“understanding,” “homecoming”) and are never concretely threatened or complicated. The walk toward the entity is filled with anticipation language, but nothing on the page can actually go wrong or demand a trade-off. The encounter itself is serene and frictionless, with no test of the skeptic’s doubts or rebelliousness. As a result, there’s little true escalation or visible price paid at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=3.0)
    Stakes are stated (reclaiming a battlefield, healing a dying reef) but never become felt pressure on the page. The coachman encounters no opposition—internal, environmental, or social—and never has to trade one value against another. “Fertilizing the soil” unfolds without risk or uncertainty, so there is no real escalation or cost. The result is a tableau of intention rather than conflict-driven story.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—finding the hidden spring and potentially revitalizing the wasteland—is signaled, but it remains largely abstract and untested. Conflict is almost frictionless: there are no real reversals, threats, or hard choices between competing goods or harms. The only “pressure” is distance and uncertainty, which the text sweeps past with summary rather than specific hardships. As a result, escalation is minimal and the eventual success feels pleasant but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and low-stakes: confusion/alienation versus curiosity/hope. The glimpse of the flickering light provides a mild escalation, and the choice to step into the unknown is a turn, but there is no credible opposition, risk, or sacrifice on the page. The “temporally stretched existence” and pariah status never sharpen into dilemmas or real costs, so tension never tightens meaningfully. As a result, the piece reads as contemplative scene-setting rather than a pressured story.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.2)
    World-scale stakes (“when the sky is wrong, the very fabric of reality began to unravel”) are asserted but never dramatized through concrete peril or resistance. There is no tightening: once the mission is briefed, Moonwhisper walks in, swaps the pieces, and succeeds without interference, trade-off, or moment of doubt. Internal conflict is likewise absent; “cautious abandon” and “sacredly playful” are labels rather than forces that drive painful choices. The result is a functional but low-pressure arc where the climax does not feel hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is largely notional: the interregnum and “void left by the missing leader” are invoked but never dramatized as obstacles. The alliance forms without resistance, there is no significant opposition or trade-off, and the walking-pattern action faces no impediment. Stakes (“unbind the past,” “shape the future”) stay abstract and never narrow options in a felt way. As a result, tension barely escalates; it drifts rather than tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain mostly abstract—knowledge, buried talents, “the shape of home”—and are never seriously tested. The seer encounters no resistance: she finds the stone, accesses its power, and reshapes reality without friction or sacrifice. There’s essentially no escalation beyond an increase in descriptive intensity; pressure does not narrow options or force trade-offs. This leaves the piece feeling like a mood-piece rather than a conflict-driven story.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.0)
    The core stake—can he forgive himself for his past failure—is stated clearly. Yet conflict remains almost entirely internal and largely unopposed; once he decodes the tapestry, no serious obstacle (moral, emotional, or practical) complicates his decision to walk into and through the labyrinth. The labyrinth promises high-stakes testing but delivers generalized “facets of his soul” rather than specific, escalating trials. Consequently, tension plateaus instead of genuinely tightening toward the end.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=4.7)
    Conflict and stakes remain largely abstract: the “price of forgiveness” and the coming ritual are talked about as heavy, but the story doesn’t stage a concrete dilemma or loss. The primary escalation is tonal—the poetry grows more fervent, the mist swirls, the spire seems closer—without a corresponding narrowing of options or a substantive test of her values. The final “choice” is essentially a serene acceptance of insight with no visible trade-off or foreclosed path. As a result, tension stays low and the piece reads more as a meditation than as a conflict-driven story.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stakes—uncovering the statue’s secrets and risking bodily collapse while holding her breath—are stated, but they don’t escalate in a strongly felt way on the page. We are told her vision blurs and air grows stale, yet the narrative comfortably fits long reflective passages that weaken the sense of a live clock; the tension between finishing the task and survival never forces a real trade-off. There’s one main “tightening” when she matches the final pockmark and finishes her narration, but no significant reversal or narrowing of options. The resolution costs her only a brief moment of near-fainting, so the conflict lands more as a mood exercise than a hard-tested choice.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes remain almost entirely internal and low-pressure: will she remain true to her own artistic path and hidden promise. There is no genuine antagonistic force—social, environmental, or internal—testing her conviction beyond declarative sentences. The “wrong turn” and mirror-crack backstory hint at possible upheaval, but no on-page choice carries visible cost or forecloses a meaningful alternative. As a result, tension is modest and escalation is minimal, closer to a meditative sketch than a story under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—proving that whispers travel farther than shouts—remains almost entirely conceptual and unopposed. Elian wants something the universe never resists; his “beckoning” leads smoothly to a crescendo of sweetness without any setback, alternative path, or price. There is some internal tension in handling overwhelming tenderness, but it never forces a trade-off or hard stance. As a result, escalation is more about volume of language than genuine sharpening of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she can navigate grief and reclaim some relation to her lost world—is present but stays largely abstract. The text repeatedly asserts peril (“It was a perilous journey”) and fluctuating capability, yet no specific obstacles, trade-offs, or concrete tests of resolve are depicted. The main “turn” is essentially when the moon reaches fullness and she finally sets out, but even that reads more as a scheduled event than a pressured choice. As a result, tension never genuinely tightens, and the price she pays is conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how to blunt the pain of involuntary honesty—is conceptually strong but never undergoes a real stress test on the page. Discovery after discovery occurs, yet nothing forces a hard trade-off or visible sacrifice; the forager simply decides to “experiment with the rumored cures.” Internal and external pressures don’t meaningfully escalate; the unease in their stomach remains largely static. As a result, the story feels contemplative rather than truly conflict-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.3)
    Conflict and stakes remain largely abstract and internal, centered on whether Kael will understand or commit to decoding the stranger’s gesture. Pressure does not markedly escalate: Kael observes, speculates, then decides to hold onto the boutonnière, with no real counterforce or cost testing his resolve. The stranger’s departure happens without confrontation, so there is little sense of a foreclosed path beyond a generalized “burden of memories.” The result is meditative rather than tense, which will read underpowered for a top-tier market.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.0)
    The primary stake—honoring her father’s promise and uncovering the maps’ secrets—is present but stays abstract and largely untested. The rising creek and vanishing path hint at pressure, yet no concrete, specific dilemma or sacrifice is forced on-page; she never appears in real danger of failing. The “series of trials” and “doorway of decisions” are invoked without being dramatized as difficult trade-offs. As a result, escalation is conceptual rather than tangible, and the final choice of a path feels low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are stated as enormous (“fabric of reality begins to unravel”), but on the page the only tangible risk is vague unease about entering the grotto. Opposition is atmospheric, not active: darkness “seems” menacing, others “seem” to watch, yet nothing tests her resolve or forces a hard trade-off. The primary “choice” is simply to keep walking deeper, with no credible alternative path dramatized. As a result, pressure does not truly tighten; the piece describes foreboding more than it dramatizes conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and very gentle: she wants to “capture the density of presence” and succeeds without substantial friction. The whispered phrase momentarily reframes her approach but does not threaten failure or demand a trade-off. There is no true escalation—no time pressure, no risk of misinterpretation with a cost, no relationship strain—so the emotional stakes never tighten. For a top-tier market, the piece feels more like a static vignette than a narrative with tested commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.5)
    The central stake—can the narrator transform disorienting, painful nostalgia into coherent narrative and purpose—is clear but remains almost entirely internal and low-friction. Pressure does not meaningfully escalate; once the narrator starts writing, there are no setbacks, doubts, or moments where stopping or failing feels like a real possibility. The “chronologically confused” issue never seriously blocks the task, and no path is visibly foreclosed by the ending stance. As a result, the resolution reads more like a calm affirmation than a choice paid for with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and largely resolved via reflection, with no on-page opposition pushing back against Elara’s aims. Her dominant stake—how to continue meaningful work without smell—is stated, but never put under pressure through another person, a hard choice, or even a concrete test in practice. The emotional arc goes from dulled and reflective to purposeful and calm without any genuine escalation, reversal, or visible cost. As a result, tension remains flat and the stakes feel abstract rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and remains low-pressure: Kaito wants to unlock runes and release his past, but there’s little on-page resistance beyond vague instability and ambient “forces of nature.” The tremors and storms are atmospheric rather than truly threatening, and his urge to shed his past is quickly rewarded by whispers and inspiration instead of tested. Escalation is minimal—the whispers arrive, he writes, and things resolve smoothly. Without a concrete obstacle or significant trade-off, the stakes feel more declared than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—reaching Astra with an apology—is signaled, but there is almost no escalation: Lyra feels regret, performs the ritual, and senses success without challenge or setback. The narrative never tests her commitment (no risk of failure, backlash, or moral trade-off), so tension remains low and static. The orchard’s impending destruction could have been a powerful secondary pressure or ticking clock, but it doesn’t materially affect her decisions. As a result, the story reads more like a lyrical vignette than a conflict-driven arc.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.8)
    The stated stakes are vast—cosmic discord, illusions clouding reality—but on the page there is no resisting force, no real test, and no escalation beyond repeated assertions of deepening attunement. The “hiccup” in the universe promises pressure but never actually corners Aria into a difficult choice or sacrifice. Her goal is never genuinely endangered or complicated. The result is a static, contemplative piece rather than one shaped by conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=3.5)
    The only real stake is the abstract desire to understand time and keep the clocks synchronized, and this is never tested by opposition, risk, or real possibility of failure. There is no escalation—no malfunctioning clock, no external pressure, not even a credible internal conflict about duty versus doubt. “Counting backwards” doesn’t force a trade-off or narrow options; it simply continues. As a result, tension remains flat and the ending does not carry a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=4.2)
    The dominant stake—Lena’s desire to “understand” and perhaps revolutionize perception—remains highly abstract and is never placed under meaningful pressure. There is no external opposition and barely any internal resistance; she walks, observes, reflects, and concludes. No clear tightening or irreversible trade-off occurs, so the sense of escalation is minimal. As a result, the ending carries little felt cost despite the language of breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—helping her father confront a potentially lethal addiction—is weighty in concept but remains almost entirely abstract on the page. Conflict is internal and lightly sketched; there’s no scene where her need for control, her father’s patterns, or institutional resistance actually push back. The heart attack and gambling are off-stage, so pressure never tightens beyond repeated reflections. Her “turn” to resolve and design a program arrives without any real escalation or forced trade-off, muting tension and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=3.9)
    There is effectively no real conflict: no opposing force, no risk that the loop might break, and no tangible stakes beyond the abstract idea of “connection.” The “pressure” is a gentle philosophical one—how to relate to anonymous callers—that never sharpens into a dilemma. The operator does not face a hard trade-off or renunciation; they simply notice a pattern and interpret it optimistically. As a result, escalation is minimal and the ending doesn’t feel hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict and stakes are almost entirely internal and very soft: curiosity about the couple and commitment to preservation. There is no real escalation—her documentation proceeds smoothly, unopposed, and no event tests her resolve or forces a trade-off. The regenerated covenant, archives, and rediscovery are all referenced as faits accomplis rather than pressure points. As a result, the ending lacks a sense of earned cost or narrowed paths; it feels like a continuation of what was always going to happen.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—Raven’s loneliness versus the possibility of connection—is stated, but on-page pressure is minimal. The plan encounters no resistance: rumors spread smoothly, the crowd shifts with no real setbacks, ethical dilemmas, or trade-offs. There is a soft deepening as Raven’s loneliness “begins to lift,” yet no moment where they risk rejection, failure, or loss to test their commitment. As a result, escalation feels more like a steady descriptive ramp than a tightening that forecloses options or demands costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.2)
    The central stake—reaching the stillpoint to resolve inner sorrow—is declared but remains almost entirely unopposed. Escalation is minimal: musical notes get louder, anticipation thickens, and then the goal is reached without meaningful resistance or trade-off. The internal conflict (“labyrinth of sorrow and loss”) is not dramatized in the present, so tension stays abstract and gentle. As a result, the story reads more as an extended mood piece than as pressured conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Aria can restore and responsibly use a history-editing pen—is present but soft, with minimal resistance. The “wrong seeds” are already a fait accompli when the story opens, and repairing the pen unfolds without setbacks, trade-offs, or visible cost. Pressure nominally rises as the anomaly “responds,” yet nothing truly forces a hard choice or narrows her options. The ending lands more as a contemplative activation than as a resolution to a tested conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—giving voice to the unheard—remains almost entirely abstract, with no real resistance, risk, or possibility of failure on the page. The advisor encounters no obstacle in understanding or orchestrating; the crowd is instantly receptive, so pressure never tightens. There’s no meaningful trade-off or foreclosed option at the climax, just a swelling of lyric description. As a result, the narrative feels more like a mood piece than a conflict-driven story, which sharply limits tension and escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.5)
    The declared stakes—uncovering the truth behind the vandalism and fulfilling a forgotten promise—never encounter tangible resistance or meaningful risk. Pressure doesn’t genuinely escalate; Elian decides to create the art trail and then, in summarized time, simply completes it without setbacks, reversals, or moral dilemmas. The internal and external conflicts remain largely static, with no moment where a real option is foreclosed. This keeps the piece from generating the kind of tension required for high-level literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Aria can meaningfully nurture the shared dream/connection in the face of memory fragility—is present but soft. Conflict is almost entirely internal and largely uncontested; there is no real antagonist force beyond time and transience, and even that operates at a conceptual distance. Escalation is limited to the drumming and light intensifying, followed by a vision of an ideal world, but no choice forecloses options or demands a felt sacrifice. The ending resolves into acceptance and hope without having forced Aria through a sharper tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—proving that whispers travel farther than shouts—is announced but never meaningfully stressed or endangered. There is essentially no opposition: no one doubts her, no conditions make the test difficult, and the stranger’s whisper is an unchallenged, convenient confirmation. The geomagnetic storm, unknown sections of the labyrinth, maps, and key all suggest possible higher-stakes conflict that never materializes. As a result, escalation remains minimal and the resolution feels low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=3.9)
    Conflict is almost entirely atmospheric; no concrete goal is threatened, and no external obstacle pushes either character. “Stillwater tension” is asserted repeatedly, but it never escalates beyond a quiet, contemplative mood. The encounter shifts from tension to calm, yet without a hard choice, trade-off, or genuine risk. The result reads as a static vignette rather than a pressurized scene.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are essentially conceptual: whether the town embraces pause and reflection through this “humble rebellion.” There is no on-page opposition, risk, or sacrifice; once Elian decides to act, everything unfolds smoothly, with the rebellion succeeding immediately and universally. The magnetic grotto and synchronized displays do not introduce genuine jeopardy or narrowing of options. As a result, pressure barely escalates, and tension stays low despite the revolutionary language.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—Kael’s desire for inner freedom—is clear, and the whale’s call offers a decisive pivot from dock to deep. Yet there’s almost no real on-page resistance or alternative; she “without thinking” follows the song, so commitment is never tested. Internal and external stakes don’t intensify so much as smoothly align, giving the piece a meditative rather than pressurized feel. The resolution is peaceful but relatively costless, limiting the sense of conflict and consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict and stakes are almost entirely internal and remain largely declarative: Echo grapples with grief, emptiness, and the legacy of forced happiness. There is no clear escalation beyond “Echo feels this more intensely now,” and no moment where a choice visibly forecloses a path or imposes a new cost. The bouquet, narrations, and turbines add texture but don’t drive reversals or tighten pressure. As a result, tension stays flat, more meditative than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—Lyra breaking past old artistic boundaries—is clear but faces almost no resistance. There is no antagonistic force, internal or external, that escalates pressure beyond an abstract sense of “possibility.” The shift from uncertainty to certainty feels inevitable and untested, so there’s no meaningful trade-off, loss, or narrowed option to charge the climax. As a result, tension stays low and the piece reads as a static revelation rather than a conflict-driven arc.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is essentially no opposition or real risk; everyone wants roughly the same thing—beauty in imperfection—and they achieve it without friction. The painter’s “awakening” arrives smoothly, without him having to relinquish something or choose between competing values. The concept of “bartered awakenings” is introduced as if it might demand a price, yet no specific barter or sacrifice is depicted. As a result, stakes feel purely conceptual and never bite on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is effectively no on-page conflict: the bell ringer wants to explore and understand connection, and the world offers no resistance. “Questioning assumptions” is claimed, but never dramatized as a risky or pressured act, and no meaningful options are foreclosed. Stakes remain abstract (understanding connection) and never tighten beyond a gentle curiosity.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—moving from grief to renewed creative purpose—is clear but faces almost no resistance; every tool the character invents works as hoped. There is no genuine reversal, setback, or difficult trade-off; the origami method and curtains succeed smoothly, and illumination arrives without a cost. This keeps tension low and makes the climax feel more like a gentle crest than an escalation. The conflict remains largely abstract, and stakes never become viscerally pressing.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and philosophical, framed as a quest for understanding rather than a struggle under pressure. There is no meaningful escalation: she begins devoted to her task and ends equally devoted, with no reversal, narrowed option set, or visible trade-off. The crypto crashes are invoked as massive stakes, but on the page they never force a concrete dilemma or loss. As a result, tension remains low and the piece reads as a tonal vignette rather than a story with consequential stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain largely abstract: gain deeper, “forbidden” knowledge or not, with no on-page risk beyond some poetic “anguish.” The main turn—choosing to use the pagoda—faces no meaningful resistance, and the mandate to “avoid patterns” never generates concrete difficulty or trade-offs. Internal conflict is minimal; she wants what she gets, and the price is framed as bittersweet but not dramatized. As a result, pressure hardly escalates, and the ending lacks a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—resisting an encroaching psychic darkness to preserve hope—is stated but remains abstract on the page. Conflict is mostly internal and conceptual, with no concrete opposition to her research or to her decision to share her findings. Escalation is mild: noticing the shadow, realizing its nature, then resolving to act, without any real test or narrowing of options. As a result, tension feels static and the outcome never seems genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Lena can reconfigure her convictions without losing either compassion or self-respect—remains almost entirely interior and static. There is no external test, opposition, or concrete dilemma that forces her to choose one value over another or incur visible loss. Pressure does not clearly tighten; instead, similar sentiments about “shedding layers” and “reconstructing” recur with minor variation. As a result, the eventual sense of peace feels more like a meditative decision than the culmination of tested conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—reaching the hidden chamber to unlock reality’s scars—is stated but remains abstract, and opposition is largely passive (fatigue, earth) rather than dramatized. There is some escalation in depth and exertion, culminating in the breakthrough into the chamber, but turns are mild and not clearly forced by difficult trade-offs. Elian’s agency is steady rather than pressured; the piece reads as a continuous approach fulfilled, not a conflict tested with visible loss or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain almost entirely abstract: uncovering the “secrets” of unused love, with no articulated downside if the gazer fails or misreads. The pressure barely escalates; phrases like “the atmosphere thickening, like the hush before thunder” promise a tightening that never materializes into a real dilemma or trade-off. The protagonist never has to choose between competing values or risk harm—once the film is picked up, the path to revelation feels frictionless. As a result, the conflict feels static despite rich language.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.2)
    The central stake—unlocking blocked creativity—is stated, but conflict is almost entirely internal and largely unopposed: nothing meaningfully pushes back against her beyond abstract “doubts and fears.” Escalation is mostly rhetorical (the aurora intensifies, her connection deepens) rather than through concrete tests or trade-offs. The resolution arrives without her facing a sharp dilemma or giving something up, so the sense of cost and pressure is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are declared—safeguard the archive, nurture dormant sparks in a devastated world—but they remain mostly abstract. There is no antagonist, setback, or substantive resistance; every “turn” (reactivating the clock, merging with the dune, re-solidifying) proceeds smoothly. Internal conflict is minimal, so there’s no true trade-off or felt price for her choices. The piece reads as a ritual being successfully performed rather than a conflict meaningfully escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict and stakes remain almost entirely internal and largely untested: he wants understanding and… receives more understanding without resistance. The “hum of insight” grows louder, but nothing real threatens him or his goal—no risk in translocating, no danger in expansion, no competing desire to stay grounded. Escalation is mostly rhetorical (“hum… grew louder,” “probable miracles”) rather than event-driven. The result is a meditative drift rather than a sharpened arc under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are declared—finding “unused courage” to face future trials—but on-page conflict is almost entirely internal and abstract. The group never encounters a concrete obstacle, threat, or dilemma during the ridgeway journey; tension is mostly a generalized “expectant hush.” The vigil functions as a minor tightening (commitment is ritualized with the star stamp), yet the travelers are never forced to pay a visible price or choose between competing harms. This keeps pressure low and prevents the ending from landing with real dramatic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central stake—whether the bellhop’s silence/safety is worth its personal cost—is clear but largely static. Aside from the figure’s brief appearance, there is little escalation or tightening; the pressure doesn’t meaningfully narrow options. The bellhop’s endurance at their post qualifies as a kind of earned stasis, yet the endurance is never really challenged. As a result, the resolution feels contemplative rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are declared very high (“sunder the very fabric of reality,” throne, cosmic alignments) but on-page conflict is surprisingly frictionless. Kael encounters no setbacks or real tests of strategy; we’re told their messages “grew more urgent” without seeing what that costs them or how the pretender pushes back. The final confrontation is resolved in a couple of lines with “gentle rebuke” and instant exposure, undercutting the build-up. Overall pressure escalates in language, not in felt constraint or hard choices.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are almost entirely internal and contemplative: Maya’s desire to understand the disappearing paths and the meaning of the torn map. There’s no real escalation—her activities (tapping, assembling a drum, reading logs, making a new map) proceed at one emotional temperature without a clear tightening or moment where an option is foreclosed. The late “revelation” that the truth lies in the rhythms of the sea isn’t forced by any on-page crisis or trade-off. As a result, the piece feels like a sustained mood study rather than a pressured conflict arc.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.2)
    The central stake—recovering purpose in a post-rebellion lull—is stated, but tension remains low throughout, with no serious risk that she will fail or pay a price. The journey to the circle and the ritual encounter unfold without resistance or trade-offs; the hum simply delivers the desired renewal. There is one broad escalation (approaching and entering the circle) but no moment where options meaningfully narrow or a live path is foreclosed. As a result, the story reads more as a gentle visionary vignette than a pressured narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.2)
    The declared stakes—unlocking a “new era of evolution”—are enormous, but on the page Akira encounters no real opposition, danger, or credible risk of failure. The plants are supportive, the hot springs pose no threat, and the decoding process never produces a meaningful setback or dilemma. As a result, tension never truly escalates; the stakes remain abstract rather than viscerally felt. The climax functions, but it does not feel hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—whether she can find a livable stillness after trauma—is present but only lightly tested. Once she arrives, pressure largely decreases in a smooth glide toward calm; there is no clear tightening where she must trade off avoidance vs. engagement or confront a painful memory in a new way. As a result, tension plateaus rather than escalates, and the resolution feels more like a gentle fade-in than a choice under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake is her internal crisis over the purpose of art and how to live with “fragmented reality.” Pressure, however, remains fairly static: the walls “close in” in language, but we don’t see a concrete worsening or a moment where an alternative path is meaningfully foreclosed. The act of untangling threads reweights her stance but does not come at an evident on-page price. As a result, the conflict reads contemplative rather than truly tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.2)
    The external stake (find the missing person) is nominally present, but there’s no real opposition or danger; once Kael spots the ink and follows, success feels inevitable. The internal stake (understanding time dilation) is mostly conceptual and not forced into a painful trade-off or decision. Pressure does not noticeably escalate past mild curiosity; the final encounter is calm and contemplative, with no path meaningfully foreclosed. As a result, conflict reads as static and low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are declared high (“upend the fragile peace,” “scandalize the status quo”), but there is no meaningful resistance—no security, countermeasures, or rival agents complicate her plan. Internal conflict is referenced but not put under pressure in the moment of choice; she decides and succeeds without a credible loss or narrowed option set. The one tightening beat (from reading the letter to choosing dissemination) is more conceptual than experiential. As a result, tension stays relatively flat despite the large-scale implications.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=3.8)
    The declared stakes—peace versus chaos, life versus the legacy of violence—never face a concrete test in scene. There is no escalation: Aria is peaceful at the start, peaceful at the end, and no person or event threatens her sanctuary on the page. Refugees arrive, but only as summary; their presence doesn’t force a hard trade-off or visible loss. Without a live dilemma, the “conflict” remains conceptual and the story reads as static meditation rather than pressured narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and largely untested: she wants to catch the echo of a goddess and then does, without resistance or meaningful risk. The legend hints at difficulty (“required a deep understanding”), but on the page, nothing threatens failure or imposes a trade-off. Escalation is minimal; the hum simply grows louder until the goal arrives. Without a visible price—fear, doubt, exhaustion, or a threatened loss—the stake remains abstract rather than tense.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are declared as potentially empire-toppling, but no specific consequence or adversarial force appears in scene to pressure Adelaide. Conflict is almost entirely anticipatory and internal, yet even internally there’s little escalation: the piece reiterates legacy, regret, and truth without a clear moment where a viable opposing path is nearly chosen and then foreclosed. The “plan” is largely a restated intention to investigate, rather than a pressured choice with visible downside. As a result, tension plateaus rather than tightening toward the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central stake (will she remain trapped in haunted, guilt-ridden recursion or find a stable, non-haunted practice?) is clear but under-pressured. Time folding and haunted firmware suggest danger, yet the escalation plateaus quickly and resolves once she tethers herself and reframes the phenomenon. Internal conflict between guilt and connection is described but not fought through in sharply escalated scenes; the letters’ sorrow is assimilated rather than truly testing her. The result is emotionally gentle and coherent but lacks a decisive narrowing of options or a palpable price at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—finding meaning and orientation amid inner “turmoil” and “unlearning”—is clear, and the textural lens gives a sense of soft escalation as the whispers grow louder and the hush inside her intensifies. Still, the pressure never sharpens into a concrete risk or trade-off; she is uneasy but never truly cornered into a difficult choice. The tile’s message and her interjections into the mandala feel more like incremental deepening than genuine reversals. The resolution reads as a gentle, almost costless acceptance rather than a pressured decision that forecloses alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the plaza remains defined by loss or is re-authored through compassion—never faces real opposition. Pressure does not materially increase; Aria moves from noticing to remembering to renaming without credible risk, doubt, or alternative path. “Aberrant mercy” is invoked as a high-stakes idea but isn’t dramatized in a concrete, contested act. The result is a static, reflective conflict with minimal escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—Echo trying to repair her fractured timeline and find peace—is clear, but on-page pressure is very low. Once she finds the coin, there’s no genuine resistance or risk; weaving echoes leads smoothly to success without reversals or meaningful jeopardy. The labyrinth and “brink of despair” are invoked but never tested in concrete terms. As a result, escalation reads as increased description and volume rather than tightened options or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are largely conceptual—Luna wants to tap the collective unconscious and rewire her creativity—and they remain almost entirely untested on the page. The telepathy pill recall and its dangers could generate real tension, but in the scene they never threaten her or force a risky decision; she simply proceeds with the safer, intriguing geode. There is a mild escalation from meditation to intense light painting to dawn, but no concrete reversal, sacrifice, or narrowed options. As a result, pressure feels static and the ending, while pleasant, is not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is essentially no sustained conflict: Aria encounters no opposition, risk, or hard trade-off in pursuing her mapping. The “labyrinth” is described as daunting, but in practice it offers no real challenge or forced decision. Emotional pressure never escalates beyond mild awe and a brief, abstract “exhilarating and unsettling” sensation that resolves instantly. Stakes remain abstract (mystery, voice of the unknown) and untouched by concrete consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is effectively no opposition: the turner wants to uncover hidden patterns and simply does so; nothing pushes back, and no option is foreclosed. Stakes remain abstract (truth, wisdom, prophecy) and are never tested by a real risk, loss, or dilemma. The canyon echo’s release and the “truth unraveling” don’t change what the turner can or must do; they just restate the same mission in loftier terms. As a result, pressure never meaningfully tightens, and the ending carries little sense of earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=4.2)
    The dominant stake—whether she can find and reclaim her “unused courage”—is clearly stated but faces almost no on-page opposition. The codes in the snow, the path, and the mysterious figure all yield to her with no meaningful obstruction or trade-off, so the choice to approach her double is framed as mildly tense but not actually risky. There is no visible loss, renunciation, or cost to crystallize the change; the world simply accommodates her healing. Conflict is present in concept but weakly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—waiting for the traveler and fulfilling a vague inner promise—remains largely abstract. There is minimal escalation: time passes, the traveler arrives, and they cross without real obstacle or sacrifice. Internal and external conflicts don’t meaningfully test one another; nothing substantive would break if the woman had simply appeared in the opening paragraph. Tension lives mostly in tone, not in decisions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding why places resist change—remains abstract and largely uncontested on the page. There is no substantial external pressure or internal counter-want that forces a difficult trade-off; Akira’s trajectory is contemplative rather than embattled. The “tightening” beats (smoke flattening, deeper thrum) change mood more than stakes. Without a concrete loss, foreclosed path, or sharpened dilemma, the conflict feels static.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict and stakes remain almost entirely internal and abstract: there is no real opposition, only a gentle decision to continue tending and “instilling” light. The loss of the rose’s last petal could be a sharper turning point, but it elicits reflection rather than crisis. No option is genuinely foreclosed; the gardener’s role is affirmed rather than tested. As a result, the emotional and narrative stakes never truly escalate, which limits impact.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict and stakes remain almost entirely internal and abstract, with minimal escalation: Lyra reflects on brittle awakenings, polishes the sundial, reflects more, then feels better. There’s no clear moment where she must choose between competing options or bear a tangible cost; her “task” never comes under threat. The hum of the stones and the sundial’s mysteries soothe and occupy her but don’t force decisions or reversals. As a result, tension stays flat, and the final sense of ease doesn’t feel hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict and stakes are almost entirely internal and remain low-intensity; Lena is mildly searching for meaning, with no real opposition or risk if she fails. The arrival of the artists and her contribution are frictionless, so escalation reads as a gentle unfolding rather than tightening pressure. There’s no moment where a real option is foreclosed or a genuine trade-off must be made. As a result, the ending feels pleasant but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story declares large-scale stakes (cosmic tricksters, community disturbances) but on the page the conflict is Lyra turning dials until she succeeds on her first major attempt. There is no escalation in opposition—nothing pushes back, fails, or forces her to alter tactics. As a result, her climactic interference feels procedural, not hard-won, and no meaningful option is foreclosed. The tension dissipates rather than spikes when the counter-signal works immediately and cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—finding the lost key/chronicles—remains mostly conceptual and never faces a serious on-page test beyond mild uncertainty and awe. There is a single escalation beat when the crystal activates and reality seems to tear, but Lyra is swept along rather than forced into a difficult decision with visible trade-offs. Internal conflict between fear (claustrophobia) and drive is stated but not dramatized in a moment where turning back is a live option. The ending offers a reweighted understanding rather than a resolution that clearly exacts cost.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and largely declared; neither character faces a concrete dilemma or trade-off in scene. The stakes (“awakening empathy,” “thawing a heart”) are high in the abstract but remain untested by any opposing force or risky action. The pressure does not meaningfully escalate; the detective explains his epiphany, and the artist more or less adopts it without resistance. As a result, the ending reads like a gentle continuation, not the culmination of mounting stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=4.3)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the hidden truth/map while honoring her ancestor—is stated, but there is almost no on-page opposition or concrete risk to pursuing it. Pressure escalates mainly via repeated invocations of dread and kinship with the sailor rather than through new constraints, reversals, or hard trade-offs. Emilia’s “choice” is essentially to keep researching, which never reads as costly or dangerous in a specific way. As a result, tension remains conceptual and static, without a meaningful tightening that narrows her options.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and remains low-intensity: whether to keep carrying secrets versus embracing the amnesty and telling their story. The authorities’ offer and the hitchhiker’s disappearance are high-potential conflicts that stay off-stage, so the fiddler’s “choice” to change feels largely declarative. The scaffold-wrap message and music don’t actually corner the protagonist into a difficult trade-off or visible loss. Stakes are framed as “redemption” and “transformation” but never sharpened into a concrete risk or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=4.4)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and low-pressure: Kael is mildly disillusioned and reflective, but not truly torn between incompatible impulses on the page. There is no concrete opposition—no person, circumstance, or decision that meaningfully narrows his options in scene. The nominal stakes (what to do with his failure, how to understand these “paths”) remain conceptual and are resolved by a calm realization rather than a tested choice. As a result, escalation is minimal and tension remains flat.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.3)
    The dominant stake—decoding the inscriptions to unlock a civilization’s wisdom and ease present burdens—remains almost entirely abstract. There is no concrete opposition on the page: no deadline, no intellectual blockage dramatized, no human cost visible in scene, only declarations that the task is “daunting.” As a result, escalation is flat; the night simply passes until she feels better and the words “begin to reveal their secrets” without a discernible tightening choice. The lack of a visible price or real risk keeps the conflict from registering strongly.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.3)
    The dominant stake—discovering “what mirrors don’t show”—is clear but remains largely intellectual, with little visceral or situational pressure. The appearance of the frozen figure is a potential tightening beat, yet there is no real dilemma or risk: touching the ice produces revelation without apparent danger or trade-off. The flesh-eating seed and hostile trees hint at higher stakes but never actually press the druid or complicate their path. As a result, tension is mild and escalation shallow, with no tangible cost paid at or after the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is largely declared rather than felt: we are told of transformed seekers and blurred temporal boundaries, but Aria encounters no concrete obstacle. The maze’s “ominous shadows” and tightening hedges never force a hard trade-off or present a credible threat to her goal. Stakes are conceptual (discovering the “intersection of dreams”) but never risk loss, harm, or sacrifice on the page. As a result, tension plateaus; the story flows from curiosity to reward without a meaningful escalation or price.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can mend her damaged inner self—is clear, but the conflict is almost entirely internal and largely unopposed; once she decides to weave the spell, nothing seriously challenges or complicates her effort. There’s no reversal or tightening that forces a trade-off; the darkness recedes smoothly as she works, with no risk that the bartered destiny might misfire, exact a price, or fail. As a result, tension plateaus and the eventual sense of “dusky resolve” feels granted rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Jack will remain paralyzed by past failure or recommit to his vocation—is present but under-pressurized. The only on-page external pressure is the phone call, which he answers without serious hesitation or consequence; internal stakes are repeatedly stated but not tested by concrete choices. Escalation is minimal: there’s no sharp beat where he must genuinely risk something or foreclose a valued option. As a result, his closing determination reads more like a mood shift than a hard-won stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are nominally high—restoring balance between living and departed and grasping the “physics of transition”—but no concrete threat, deadline, or opposition ever manifests. There is no real escalation: Elara thinks, notices the seed glowing, and then we are told the balance is reestablished; nothing forces a trade-off or tests her resolve. The repeated verb “reestablish” stands in for conflict rather than arising from it. Consequently, tension never gains traction, and the resolution feels inevitable and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is mostly implied: the “pressure” is abstract (time losing meaning, identity migrating) but never concretely dramatized. There’s no inciting disruption that forces the librarian to adapt; their motivation “becomes clear” in exposition rather than emerging from a tested dilemma. The only quasi-stake—preserving wonder in routine—is never meaningfully threatened on the page. As a result, escalation is minimal and the final stance feels declared rather than wrestled toward.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are almost entirely internal and conceptual—Aria’s task to “uncover the stories” and dissolve her own emotional walls. There is no opposing force or credible risk of failure beyond vague trepidation, and no real escalation; after finding the pearl, each subsequent move reiterates the same insight with slightly different metaphors. The result is a static conflict in which the protagonist is never forced into a difficult trade-off or a visibly costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s path to self-forgiveness—is clearly declared but never truly pressured in scene. There are no concrete obstacles, reversals, or costs; her heart simply feels lighter as she reaffirms ideas she already believes (“forgiveness is a journey, not a destination”). The stopping of medication and her guilt remain abstract and untested, so escalation is largely flat. The final decision to walk on is gentle rather than hard-won, which keeps stakes from registering strongly.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—reaching the library of unspoken words—is stated but never meaningfully threatened; there are no concrete obstacles, competing goals, or real trade-offs. The watch and cipher add mystery but not genuine tension or cost. The closest thing to escalation is the sense of anticipation as the dreamer writes, leading to the doorway, yet nothing truly narrows their options or risks a loss. As a result, the piece reads more like moodful progression than conflict-driven narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=4.8)
    The central conflict—Elian’s dream versus the weight of the empire—is articulated but never dramatized beyond interior summary. The only on-page “turn” is her decision that she must act before her promise loses its glow, yet we don’t see any real narrowing of options, threat from the empire, or concrete sacrifice. Stakes remain conceptual, and there’s minimal escalation beyond repeated restatements of destiny and resolve. This leaves tension soft and the final resolve relatively low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Aria succumbs to the threshold of stillness before completing her final act of beauty—is articulated but not truly tested. Conflict remains largely internal and abstract, with no moment where failure feels possible or where a concrete trade-off is forced. Her decision to “resist” and focus on the emerald reads as straightforward rather than pressured by competing goods or harms. As a result, escalation is more a deepening of mood than a tightening of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes remain almost entirely abstract—Aria wants “the source of contentment”—and nothing in the grotto or her circumstances seriously challenges or threatens that pursuit. The closest thing to a pressure point is her curiosity about the hairpin’s meaning, but this never risks loss, regret, or moral tension. There is no genuine escalation; her state moves smoothly from pondering to insight without a testing moment or trade-off. As a result, the closure reads as a serene conclusion rather than the outcome of conflict or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.2)
    The central stake—loosening the client’s suffocating certainty—is stated, but almost no real resistance or complication appears on the page; the “complex web of fears” is asserted, not experienced. The conscience never faces a meaningful dilemma or cost; their process succeeds smoothly and entirely off-stage. Pressure does not truly escalate; it simply accumulates more language about nuance and doubt. As a result, the resolution reads conceptually tidy rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are almost entirely abstract: a student either understands or doesn’t, without any real consequence or tension. There is no tangible opposition, and no escalation beyond “the trance deepened” and “anticipation” language. The student is always receptive, so the outcome feels guaranteed from the outset. As a result, the climax (moment of understanding) lacks pressure and sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.3)
    Stakes remain abstract throughout: the skimmer wants understanding and harmony, but there is no real threat, urgency, or competing value to make that pursuit costly. The wandering pulse could have provided internal conflict, yet it aligns smoothly with the skimmer without resistance or risk. There is no clear midpoint tightening—no moment where options narrow or a path is foreclosed—just accumulating restatements of patience and observation. As a result, tension is minimal and escalation under the accumulative lens is very weak.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.0)
    The dominant stake—recovering creative purpose in an automated age—is conceptually strong but never faces genuine on-page resistance. Unstrapping the keystone and mist walking are framed as delicate and demanding yet play out without mishap, alternative options, or visible price. Pressure does not noticeably tighten; the story moves from problem to solution in a single smooth arc. As a result, the internal and external conflicts feel more asserted than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are almost entirely internal and remain abstract—“understanding the luminous vows” and “color of sound” never face a concrete test or risk. There is no antagonist, deadline, or meaningful trade-off; nothing threatens Kael’s body, status, or relationships. The main “tightening” is simply moving deeper into the library, but the pressure does not noticeably increase or foreclose options. As a result, the climax at the window is contemplative rather than tense, and conflict feels underdeveloped for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding the prophecy to align with the universe’s purpose—is stated but not sharply dramatized. The main turn is the choice to drink the distilled essence, but this decision is treated as a foregone, reverent step rather than a conflicted risk. There is no real opposition—internal or external—to the project, so tension stays low and flat. As a result, the story reads as a ritual being completed, not as a conflict meaningfully escalating toward a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the reaper can meaningfully articulate and comprehend ancient sacrifices—is almost entirely internal and never materially threatened. There is minimal escalation: the act of crystallizing echoes is the lone intensification, but it proceeds smoothly without real risk, opposition, or trade-off. No option is foreclosed, and the reaper’s agency is contemplative rather than pressured. As a result, tension feels static, and the ending’s small shift in understanding lacks a corresponding sense of paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—repairing the bell to address a cosmic imbalance—is stated but not meaningfully tested. There are no setbacks, doubts, or external pressures; once the mage decides to act, the ritual proceeds smoothly and succeeds. Internal conflict about “brittle devotion” remains reflective, not dramatized in any moment where the mage nearly stops or fails. As a result, tension is low and escalation minimal, limiting the felt cost of the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=3.8)
    The central stake—helping the community heal by uncovering a forgotten memory—remains abstract and untested on the page. There is no real opposition, time pressure, or moral dilemma; the warden walks, notices, and photographs without resistance or reversal. “Expunging pain” is declared but never forced into a trade-off or conflict with preserving memory, which is the obvious tension the premise suggests. As a result, pressure doesn’t meaningfully escalate; it just accumulates more of the same mood.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s quest to reconcile logic and intuition through her research—is clearly signaled but remains largely abstract. The discovery and activation of the crystal offer a mild escalation, yet there is no real risk, opposition, or trade-off; failure would merely delay insight, and success brings unalloyed gain. Her key actions (using the flame, decoding the patterns, continuing her studies) never force her to relinquish anything or choose between competing goods. As a result, tension stays gentle and meditative rather than tightening into a genuinely pressured conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—completing revisions to preserve trust and advance the mission—is stated but never truly pressured. There are no concrete obstacles, reversals, or time-based constraints beyond the vague passage from night to dawn; Lyra simply works and then finishes. Internal conflict (fatigue vs. duty, fear vs. curiosity) is gestured at but not dramatized in specific decisions with costs. As a result, tension remains low and essentially static throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.8)
    The stated stakes—overcoming emotional numbness and an identity crisis—are significant, but on the page the conflict is largely static: Kaito meditates, feels tension, and then attains peace without any real reversal or cost. The “brain in a jar watching him” and the warping reality suggest potential pressure, yet nothing forces a difficult trade-off or tests his resolve. There is no clear escalation beyond repeated intensifiers (“surge of determination,” “vibrate with energy”). The final stance feels more like a smooth uplift than the outcome of sharpened, contested stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dominant stake—what the seed means and whether/how to use it—is never really under pressure: she faces no opposing force, deadline, or real downside. Her “conflict” is simply moving from curiosity to inspiration, with no competing desire (e.g., fear, suspicion, obligation) that bites. There’s no genuine escalation; the night “wears on” but the tension doesn’t tighten, it just lingers at the same contemplative level. Consequently, the final decision to design a plant-themed room feels inevitable and low-cost rather than tested or earned.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—reviving lost laughter—is declared, but opposition is almost entirely conceptual, so pressure never really tightens. Once he decides to play, the outcome feels inevitable; no beat forces him to reconsider, adapt, or pay a visible price beyond exhaustion. The “torrent of memories,” whispers, and hums occur without on-page risk, setback, or genuine doubt. As a result, the final restoration reads more like a foregone ritual than an earned escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.8)
    The core conflict—guardian crushed by responsibility versus longing to embrace uncertainty—is clearly stated but remains largely internal and untested by external pressure. Waiting for the mist to reveal itself and then surrendering to reverie provides a mild escalation, yet there is no sharp reversal, no real risk that her choice might go wrong on the page. The stakes (her sanity, sense of belonging, the library’s safety) are suggested rather than dramatized in a concrete moment of jeopardy. As a result, the final peace reads more like a smooth slide than a hard-won stance.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are declared as world-shaping and destiny-breaking, yet on the page the process is oddly frictionless. There’s anticipation and atmosphere, but no meaningful obstacle, risk, or trade-off that forces adaptation or a hard choice. The “moment of truth” and “penny drops” are treated as foregone crescendos rather than contested outcomes. As a result, tension remains conceptual and static, with little true escalation beyond intensifying rhetoric.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and largely unopposed: Aria wants to discover a hidden truth and then…does, with no real resistance. Stakes remain abstract—knowledge, wonder, “beginning in every ending”—and are never put under concrete threat. The main tightening is her descent to the hidden chamber, but this does not force a trade-off or foreclose alternatives. As a result, tension plateaus early and the climax reads more like an expected crest of mood than a pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the truth behind the vanishing ferry and possibly “merging parallel timelines”—is conceptually high but remains abstract on the page. There is no real resistance, danger, or alternative path dramatized; Elara moves from curiosity to discovery to commitment without meaningful obstacles or reversals. Marcus’s warning to “be careful” gestures at risk without making any concrete. The ending’s choice reaffirms her desire but doesn’t register as a hard trade-off or a narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.1)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and very low-pressure: she wants to understand a concept and the gallery cooperatively reveals it. There’s no meaningful opposition, risk, or trade-off—no possibility of failure or loss, and no competing desire that complicates her pursuit. The closest thing to escalation is the visual intensity (“erupted into a riot of color and light”), but this doesn’t narrow options or force a choice. As a result, the stakes remain abstract and the climax reads as a volume increase rather than a true tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are almost entirely abstract—“understanding the universe,” “unfolded horizons,” “a new era”—with no concrete risk or opposition. Lyra and her students never face a dilemma, failure, or real-time test of their skills or beliefs. The lesson “progresses” and the students “grasp” edge geometry, but nothing meaningfully tightens or forces a trade-off. As a result, tension remains flat and the ending’s sense of “great adventure” is unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—helping a grieving woman reconnect with a lost sister’s memory—is clear but remains emotionally and situationally low-pressure. Conflict is minimal: the woman is desperate, Aria wants to help, and nothing meaningfully opposes their goals. The main tightening is the reveal that the sister Aria has been tracking is the woman’s sister, but this recognition produces no real dilemma or cost; reassurance follows almost automatically. As a result, escalation is gentle and the resolution feels more like a smooth slide than a test.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are identified (retrieve the codex, survive the tides, honor the dead researchers), but they never truly bite: Lyra encounters no serious resistance, danger, or reversal. The time pressure from the tidal change appears late and functions as a nominal clock rather than a mounting threat. Her abilities, the gold fleck, and the cables all work on first try, so there’s little adaptation or sacrifice. The resolution feels like a smooth success run, with minimal escalation or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—Akira’s need to understand the digital ghost and her own mortality—is present but never feels truly at risk; there is no clear “or else.” Conflict is almost entirely internal and contemplative, with minimal real opposition or narrowing of options. The main tightening comes from the ghost coalescing and Akira’s growing insight, which reweights the situation but without a visible price or hard trade-off. As a result, tension remains gentle and static rather than building toward a pressured decision.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict and stakes are almost entirely abstract: the “death of a language” and urgency to preserve it are declared but never dramatized as a narrowing field of options or a hard sacrifice. There’s no explicit antagonist, which is fine, but also no concrete obstacle beyond time’s vague erosion and no moment where the storyteller must risk or relinquish something. The move from listening to creating a new lexicon doesn’t feel forced by pressure; it reads as an inevitable unfolding. As a result, tension stays low and flat.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are declared—understanding “harmony untamed,” unraveling a cosmic disruption, confronting inner darkness—but almost no concrete, on-page test of those stakes occurs. Conflict is primarily conceptual and unopposed: Lena listens to confessions, feels energy, and then decides she’s determined. There is no credible threat, reversal, or trade-off that forces her to risk something tangible. As a result, tension plateaus, and the final resolve to “face [mysteries] head-on” feels like a restatement rather than a hard-won stance.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is essentially no opposition: Luna’s music works immediately, the statues’ transformation proceeds without complication, and the “mechanical world” is never concretely present to push back. Stakes are declared in lofty terms (reawakening beauty, loosening a “mechanical grip”) but never tested against a risk of failure or harm. No real tightening or reversal occurs; pressure does not grow, it simply unfolds linearly toward success. As a result, the emotional and narrative stakes feel low despite the grand language.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—crossing a surveilled border to deliver contraband—is clear but never truly bites. The mailman times the drone and crosses with no close call, loss, or forced compromise. Internal and external stakes (healing broken promises vs. avoiding drones) never collide in a way that demands a hard choice. As a result, tension plateaus rather than escalates toward the handoff.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake (finding meaning in the misting hush/silence) remains abstract and low-pressure. Following the song and getting “lost” in thicker mist gestures toward danger, but there is no credible threat, trade-off, or tangible loss. Escalation is minimal: the wrong turn leads almost immediately to a reward (the oasis) rather than a test. The final return to work is serene rather than hard-won, so tension never truly tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is effectively no opposition: her goal is never challenged, no alternative path or failure is even gestured toward, and the “process” unfolds without friction. Stakes remain abstract (“reawaken stories”) and are not tested by any concrete obstacle or dilemma. The only hint of escalation is the “increasing urgency” of her pencil and the hum of stories, which is descriptive rather than consequential. As a result, the outcome feels foregone and the piece lacks true tension or a meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.3)
    The dominant stake—capturing or deciphering the dream/cipher—is entirely internal and never meets a concrete, escalating test. Elian faces no real obstacle beyond the abstract elusiveness of the dream, and there are no meaningful turns that narrow options or increase cost. The repetition of the ritual suggests endurance but doesn’t sharpen tension; nothing truly threatens the pursuit or forces adaptation. As a result, pressure stays flat, and the ending does not feel earned by any escalated conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are almost entirely conceptual—freeing an idea so it can “inspire and transform”—and never face concrete resistance beyond the vague sense that the “air…seemed to thicken.” The locksmith’s success feels assured from the outset; there is no credible alternative outcome or real dilemma, so tension remains low. Escalation is minimal: the only tightening is the lock finally yielding, without a preceding beat that genuinely threatens failure. The result reads as an extended vignette rather than a pressured narrative movement.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering stolen memories and understanding underlying patterns—is stated early but never truly tested in scene. There is no concrete antagonist, obstacle, or time pressure opposing Emilia; she finds the mushroom without resistance and contemplates the stars without consequence. The tension is largely conceptual and anticipatory, so escalation reads as repeated restatement of resolve rather than narrowing options or raising costs. As a result, the ending resolves a low-pressure situation, muting dramatic impact.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the archivist can decode the shadow to begin reversing exile—is stated, but the conflict remains almost entirely internal and low-resistance. We see a mild tightening as their annotations grow “more fervent” and their nervous habit eases, yet no genuine obstacle, time pressure, or moral trade-off complicates the task. The soul’s fate stays abstract; the archivist’s “quiet triumph” arrives without any evident risk of failure or real sacrifice. Tension exists at a conceptual level but does not escalate in a way that would satisfy a high-stakes literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are declared (“succor the parched earth,” “preserve the color of wonder”) but never genuinely tested; there is no resistance, doubt, or risk of failure. The central actions—pruning, planting, weaving a spell—unfold smoothly without reversal or tightening of pressure. There is no visible price paid for success, nor any trade-off between competing goods or fears. As a result, tension remains flat, and the ending’s serenity feels preordained.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.0)
    The main stake—bringing peace to the spirits—is stated, but tension is low because success feels guaranteed and unopposed. Unraveling knots is described as painstaking, yet there’s no specific setback or risk that alters her tactics. Pressure “escalates” mostly through repetition and intensification of hush rather than changed options. The final release of the last knot functions as a climax, but with minimal sense of potential loss or genuine test.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the henge’s secrets and, implicitly, a piece of herself—remains abstract and unthreatened. There is no counterforce, risk of failure, or meaningful obstacle; “hours poring over footage” and a shiver at the boundary are the nearest thing to pressure. The comparisons “yield their secrets” without complication, and Elara’s arc resolves without any visible sacrifice or foreclosed option, leading to very low tension and virtually no escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—a quest to understand the “physics of letting go”—is clear but remains largely conceptual, with little on-page pressure or consequence for failure. The main tightening is the discovery and decoding of the net’s message, which deepens the theme but doesn’t force a real trade-off or difficult decision. Internal and external conflict barely escalate; Eli moves from curiosity to insight without being cornered by competing impulses. The piece thus reads more as an essayistic meditation than a scene under true narrative strain.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—achieving communication/understanding between artist and ghost—is signaled, but there is almost no genuine resistance or risk. The “storm brewing” and heightened energy suggest danger without ever concretely threatening her or the connection. Her path from intent to success is linear, with no meaningful reversal, narrowed option, or visible price. As a result, tension remains low, and the ending feels like a fulfillment rather than an earned, costly resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict and stakes are minimal: Elara wants to decode and understand the diary, and she simply…does. There are no obstacles, reversals, or genuine risks to her goal, internally or externally, and no alternative paths being foreclosed. The supposed stake—finding joy beneath anguish—never faces a serious challenge, so the emotional arc feels pre-resolved rather than earned. This lack of escalation keeps the piece from functioning as robust narrative rather than reflective vignette.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain largely abstract: Lyra wants to memorialize storms and validate a metaphysical belief, but nothing opposes or complicates that desire on the page. There’s no real escalation beyond deepening rumination; the storm has already passed, Dr. Zhang applies no pressure, and Lyra’s choices are never costly. The final sense of “peace” and calling isn’t purchased through struggle or trade-off, so tension stays flat. As a result, conflict feels gestural rather than operative.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—capturing something essential before the library’s destruction—is present but under-exploited. The demolition clock is referenced (“pre-demolition stillness,” crew outside) yet never forces a concrete dilemma (e.g., abandon the work vs. save more artifacts), so pressure never fully tightens. Conflict is largely internal and philosophical, framed as the futility of capturing the infinite, but it’s resolved without a clear on-page test of commitment. The result is a gently rising tension rather than a meaningful escalation with a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is minimal and mostly implied: Eli versus the puzzle of the luminance/code, with no real resistance or risk of failure. The stakes of “discovery of a lifetime” remain abstract, and nothing concretely bad happens—or plausibly might—to oppose Eli’s goal. There’s no escalation beyond curiosity deepening into more focused work; each step succeeds without friction. The ending’s “ready to set course for the unknown” doesn’t feel like a pressured choice between competing costs, so tension never truly tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes remain almost entirely abstract—Kael wants understanding, and nothing on the page threatens that goal or offers a meaningful alternative. There are no obstacles deciphering the prophecy, no risk in opening the door, and no personal or moral trade-off in entering the hall. The story lacks a clear tightening of pressure; discovery proceeds smoothly from clue to reward. As a result, the ending doesn’t feel earned by conflict, only granted.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is largely frictionless: once Aria decides to harness the nebula, the settlers’ puzzlement at the chalk messages is mild and quickly replaced by “excitement and anticipation.” Stakes are declared at a planetary scale, but no concrete risk, opposition, or potential failure is dramatized. There is no meaningful reversal or tightening that narrows options; the effort proceeds linearly toward success. As a result, the achievement at the end feels conceptually large but dramatically untested.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.0)
    The stakes—balancing time and soothing “the savage heart of existence”—are immense but remain entirely abstract and untested. There is no on-page resistance, complication, or credible threat of failure; each “minute adjustment” succeeds without friction, and the lullaby simply works. Pressure deepens texturally (daylight fading, hush thickening) but does not narrow options or force a trade. As a result, the conflict feels more like a devotional ritual than a genuine problem under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=5.9)
    The nominal stakes (reactivate labyrinth before frost to save travelers) are established, but the on-page pressure is low: she encounters no real resistance from the trees, environment, or birds once she acts. The night frost deadline and eerie surveillance promise tension yet never force a hard choice or sacrifice; everything proceeds as hoped. As a result, conflict reads as a task successfully completed rather than a test that narrows options or exacts a price.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—moving from lingering grief and guilt toward a meaningful way to honor her sister—is clear. However, the conflict is almost entirely internal and progresses linearly without real escalation or reversal; there is no moment where she seriously resists or risks anything to keep her old stance. The scientific insight arrives smoothly and immediately reframes her emotions, undercutting any sense of genuine struggle or price paid. The result is contemplative but low-pressure, with stakes that remain largely abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=4.8)
    The only real conflict is Ember’s urge to incise the bottle versus her duty to preserve it, and that tension is resolved quickly and cleanly. After she opts for “quantifying absence,” there is no further complication or new cost; everything flows toward reassurance and affirmation. Stakes are abstract (understanding hidden narratives, finding purpose) and never face a concrete test or loss. As a result, escalation is minimal and tension flatlines well before the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.7)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can bear and “smooth” the fortress’s and pavilion’s remorse—is stated clearly but remains abstract. There is a nominal tightening as she moves from tasting ambient bitterness to actively seeking the pavilion and then enduring the flood of memories. Yet the conflict is largely one-sided: no real alternative path or meaningful risk of failure is dramatized beyond a single sentence of being “threatened to overwhelm.” The resolution feels almost frictionless, undercutting tension and perceived cost.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.8)
    The stated stake—rehabilitating silos and uniting the community—remains abstract, with no concrete antagonistic force on the page. The “willing” grain elevator offers no real resistance, and their dialogue is rendered as a harmonious dance instead of a pressured negotiation. As a result, there is effectively no escalation; the situation merely deepens lyrically.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the observatory’s abandoned dreams—is stated early, but opposition is largely absent and pressure remains low. Elara never confronts a real risk in proceeding, nor is there a meaningful alternative path she could take; she simply does the thing she set out to do. The “flood of memories” is presented as intense but not as a tested limit that forces a trade-off or sacrifice. As a result, escalation feels more like a linear deepening of description than a genuine tightening of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering hidden knowledge—is signaled, but conflict is largely notional: she wants something and then efficiently gets it. The hour of inverted gravity and the mysterious grotto could introduce danger, trade-offs, or missed chances, yet nothing truly resists her beyond atmosphere. There’s no clear tightening where an option is foreclosed or a serious risk is accepted; the “urge to reenter” is indulged, not fought. As a result, tension plateaus and the ultimate gain of knowledge feels untested by meaningful loss or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is the story’s weakest axis: the silence is described as a world-scale wound, yet it never resists the protagonist’s efforts. The sculptor encounters no opposition, setback, or meaningful trade-off; they discover the insulator, use it, and succeed without friction. Stakes (“bring empathy into motion”) remain lofty but untested in concrete terms, and no genuine option is foreclosed. The result is a pleasing mood piece with minimal tension or escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are largely conceptual: find beauty and new truth before the next moon phase, reclaim an inner sense of meaning in exile. There is no external antagonist, concrete obstacle, or real-time dilemma that forces difficult trade-offs; pressure does not intensify so much as restate itself. His “vow” and subsequent walk away read as a continuation of the same internal state, not a tested or costly pivot. The result is a contemplative sketch with minimal escalation or tension.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is minimal and largely abstract: an “overwhelming urge” to know the diary’s secrets versus an implied duty as its keeper, but this tension is never explicitly dramatized. The clasp glows and opens without resistance, removing any real obstacle or cost. Stakes are framed as “understanding empathy” and “lost threads of connection,” yet nothing tangible is at risk in the scene—not the friendship, not Elara’s integrity. Escalation is mostly atmospheric (deepening quiet before fireworks) rather than a tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the corpse flower’s wisdom and Lyra’s deeper calling—is never truly under threat. She acquires the seed easily, tends it without obstacle, and the bloom arrives on schedule; no alternative path or real jeopardy is dramatized. Internal conflict (fear of failure, doubt about the seed, or tension between ambition and serenity) is absent, so pressure never tightens. As a result, the climactic fragrance reads as a reward rather than an earned turn with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering the orchard’s secret—is present but remains largely intellectual; Lyra’s life, relationships, or moral commitments never feel imperiled. The only real tightening is the anomaly of hyper-accelerated growth drawing her toward the clearing, but nothing resists or complicates the pursuit. There’s no antagonist force (environmental, personal, or ethical) that forces a trade-off or visible sacrifice. As a result, tension stays low and the resolution asks little of her beyond attention.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding the forces behind the crash and learning from them—is clear, but on-page conflict is minimal and mostly internal. Pressure does not meaningfully escalate; she never encounters resistance, risk, or a forcing choice that narrows options, and the wind patterns are noted rather than actively tested against a critical decision. Her “obsession” and the oppressive silence hint at psychological stakes, yet no beat forces her to choose between, say, comfort and deeper inquiry. As a result, the ending’s determination feels like a continuation rather than an outcome of tested stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—liberating the sculpted hush to prove wonder’s essentiality—is articulated but never meaningfully endangered. There is a build-up of anticipation, yet no opposition, real risk of failure, or trade-off that would force Elian to sacrifice something or change course. The “crescendo” and chisel strike function as a scheduled payoff rather than an earned escalation. As a result, tension remains conceptual and mild, more ritualistic than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and largely declared rather than dramatized—her “insatiable urge” and desire for insight face no clear on-page resistance. The act of playing the flute brings awe and a touch of fear (“both beautiful and terrifying”), but there is no real possibility that she might refuse or fail, and nothing concrete is visibly at risk. Stakes remain abstract (“mysteries,” “secrets,” “shadows of her own soul”) and never force a trade-off or renunciation. As a result, escalation reads more like a steady thickening of atmosphere than a tightening conflict trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict and stakes are almost entirely internal and conceptual: Echo wants to unlock the “mathematics of emotion” before the stars vanish. The vanishing stars gesture toward urgency but never corner Echo into a hard trade-off or genuine risk; the work simply proceeds to completion. There’s no substantial reversal or tightening beyond an increase in intensity of description. As a result, tension remains low and abstract, more premise than dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict and stakes remain very low-level throughout: Eira’s jitters and general loneliness are gently soothed rather than truly challenged. The pendant and the brief meeting with the aurora-woman do not force any trade-off or difficult stance; there is no moment where an option is genuinely foreclosed. The “task” of keeping wonder alive is declared rather than dramatized under stress, so escalation never really happens. This reads as a mood piece with implied stakes rather than an escalating story.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and even there remains underdeveloped: no clear opposition, risk, or credible failure mode is dramatized. The dominant stake (proving emotional residue in objects/communion with the world) is declared but never truly tested or threatened. Pressure does not noticeably escalate; the mystic observes, interprets, then receives a revelation without resistance. Consequently, the stakes feel abstract and the resolution unchallenged.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—reestablishing connection across “impossible distance”—is stated clearly but never materially tested on the page. Conflict remains almost entirely internal and contemplative, without a credible external or internal obstruction that forces trade-offs. The main tightening is her shift from passive longing to active resolve, but that turn isn’t meaningfully opposed. As a result, escalation feels modest, and the cost of her resolve stays largely notional.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is minimal: the protagonist’s goal (craft an extraordinary sword) meets virtually no resistance, internal or external. The forging runs smoothly, with no risk of failure, no competing need, and no meaningful sacrifice beyond generic “patience and persistence.” The arrival of the apprentice offers a potential new stake (mentorship vs. solitude), but this is accepted without struggle or ambivalence. The result is a pleasant arc with declared stakes, rather than a narrative where pressure visibly escalates and forces a charged decision.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=4.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering a withheld multiversal truth—is signaled, but conflict and cost remain largely abstract. There are no concrete obstacles, antagonistic forces, or meaningful trade-offs; the shard guides her smoothly, and her determination is never tested by a genuine risk or loss. “Threatened to overwhelm her senses” hints at pressure but never results in a real narrowing of options or a decision with consequences. As a result, escalation is more a matter of repeated intensifiers than of sharpened stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict remains almost entirely internal and low-grade; the lamp going out never produces concrete jeopardy or urgency. The dominant stake—preserving a sense of safety against encroaching darkness—stays abstract and faces no real test beyond mood. The stone-stacking and decision to protect the lighthouse are gentle deepenings, not escalations that foreclose options or demand sacrifice. As a result, tension hums but rarely tightens, limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are mostly declared (“role was more crucial than ever”) rather than dramatized through risk or opposition. The ritual proceeds smoothly from start to finish; there is no credible chance of failure, no counterforce, and no moral or emotional dilemma. The only “pressure” is the abstract responsibility to shape dawn, which is never concretely tested. As a result, tension remains flat and the narrative functions more as a mood piece than a conflict-driven story.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—Kaito’s desire to understand the allure of “story-magnet” people—remains abstract and unopposed. He encounters no resistance, moral risk, or real dilemma in pursuing this knowledge; he simply continues to look and think until he feels clarity. The “iridescent caution” is gestured at but never tested; no alternative path is genuinely foreclosed. As a result, tension is low and there is virtually no escalation beyond a mild deepening of contemplation.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.0)
    The dominant stake—deconstructing sorrow/healing the astronomer’s damage and the worker’s own—is present but remains abstract and low-pressure. There is no real resistance, time pressure, or potential failure; once the worker begins mapping dreams, success feels guaranteed. The “storm intensifying” echoes their heartbeat but doesn’t actually alter their options. As a result, the story reads as a meditative vignette rather than a conflict-driven narrative with escalating stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.8)
    The declared stakes (“rekindle a dying realm”) are enormous, but on-page conflict is minimal, and nothing meaningfully resists her efforts. Once she hums, everything moves smoothly toward blooming, light, and visions; there is no real trade-off, risk, or threatened failure. The piece lacks a clear tightening where an option is foreclosed or a price is paid; escalation is mostly an increase in glow and volume. As a result, the narrative reads more like a ritual tableau than a pressured story beat.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—Elys’s need to re-evaluate a painful mistake and their chosen isolation—is clear but remains almost entirely internal and reflective. There is one meaningful deepening when the note catalyzes a new understanding of their past, but no real escalation or narrowing of options on the page. The masquerade invitation could have embodied an external test, yet it never becomes a decision with consequences, only a symbol. As a result, tension is mild and the sense of price paid is more asserted than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict and stakes remain extremely low-level and largely interior; her desire for “tenuous absolution” is stated but never concretely challenged. There is no inciting disruption beyond the mysterious bread, and that mystery generates no real dilemma or consequence. The relationship with the gardener is harmonious from the start—no tension, status shifts, or difficult trade-offs. As a result, escalation is minimal and the ending is more a gentle fade than a pressure-tested resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are largely abstract—the preservation of meaning and memory against “oblivion”—and they remain at the same conceptual register throughout. The story repeatedly claims urgency (“racing against time,” illusions fading) but never materializes this as specific pressure, opposition, or cost on the page. There are no meaningful reversals or tightened options; Elara is never blocked, doubted, or forced to sacrifice anything to continue her work. Conflict is thus minimal and static, which sharply limits tension and narrative grip.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stakes—stopping a rival and uncovering family secrets—are stated but never concretely tested; there is no specific scheme by The Shadow that Lena disrupts. The central confrontation is largely a prolonged stare-down with one whispered line and a “menacing chuckle,” so pressure does not escalate in a meaningful way. The “truce of hush” and crowd tension are interesting but don’t culminate in a trade-off or foreclosed option. Calling the mission “a success” retroactively inflates stakes without any clear on-page cost or decisive act.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—Aria’s desire to understand the world’s hidden forces and her grandfather’s gift—is established but remains largely internal and unopposed. The main “tightening” is the ring’s activation and pull, which is more an invitation than a pressure point, and Aria never seriously considers resisting or paying a price to follow it. The stranger’s presence resolves her quest without demanding a trade-off, sacrifice, or even a difficult decision. As a result, tension stays low and the resolution, while coherent, lacks bite.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.2)
    The central conflict—Elara versus her creative block—is clear but remains largely static and internally declared rather than sharply tested on the page. Once she decides that “the true key lay not in the lock itself, but in the act of creating something new,” there is no real resistance; drawing immediately works and the block dissolves without setbacks or trade-offs. Stakes are important to her personally but never feel precarious in the scene, and no external pressures complicate her choice. As a result, escalation is mild and the final release feels more like a gentle exhale than a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—Aria’s desire to uncover the repository of lost conversations and thereby understand what’s been lost—is clear but remains abstract and largely untested. The journey through the undercroft is summarized as “long and arduous” without concrete obstacles, reversals, or trade-offs that force her to pay a tangible price. There is little escalation: once she decodes the map, events proceed smoothly to success. As a result, the emotional and narrative tension never meaningfully tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is essentially no antagonistic force or meaningful resistance; events unfold in a state of destined harmony. The dominant stake—bridging words and the “language of the heart”—remains purely conceptual and never faces a concrete test or trade-off on the page. Aria’s decision to use the iceberg fragment comes without hesitation, conflict, or risk. The “muted vigor” of the inhabitants implies pressure but never manifests as an actual dilemma or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.2)
    The core stake—Aria’s need to quiet her internal static via the controlled burn—is present but stays largely abstract. The external conflict with the fire has almost no resistance: no malfunction, miscalculation, or genuine risk of failure, so tension plateaus quickly. Her internal conflict is mostly summarized rather than manifested in hard choices with trade-offs. The result is a story that moves, but with muted escalation and limited sense of price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.0)
    The nominal conflicts—courtyard serenity vs. outside intrusion, mystery vs. ignorance, grief vs. comfort—are never put under real pressure. Emilia encounters no resistance in questioning people, arranging a meeting, or re-interpreting the locket; every move works on the first try. Stakes remain abstract (“prove that listening heals”) and are never tested by a hard choice or risk, so escalation is essentially flat. The mailbox “mystery” resolves effortlessly, undercutting any sense of earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.3)
    Stakes are declared—escape from an "underwater tomb" and transformation of weakness into strength—but there is almost no active opposition or real obstacle. Aria never fails, backslides, or must sacrifice anything; she simply reflects, dances, writes, and then leaves once she "feels" liberated. The spider/web and dice imply mounting tension, yet no concrete consequence looms if she does not finish in time, and the exit offers no resistance. As a result, the conflict remains largely static and abstract, with minimal escalation or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering where “deleted” memories go—is mostly abstract and never faces friction; nothing threatens the lighter or meaningfully resists their inquiry. Once the whale beaches, the protagonist follows the path presented with no real risk, sacrifice, or wrong turn, so tension remains low. Touching the crystal produces an instant, benign reward rather than a tradeoff or tested commitment. The piece functions as a mood-piece quest rather than a story with escalating conflict and visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—preventing a world-disrupting imbalance—is announced, and the summoner undertakes a defined method to address it, which gives at least a nominal conflict. Yet the process unfolds without obstacles, reversals, or trade-offs; the silence simply grows as intended until success is declared. There is no external interference or internal doubt to force adaptation, so tension never meaningfully escalates. As a result, the climax (releasing the wing) reads as a foregone conclusion rather than a pressured turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is very soft: the closest thing to pressure is the tutor’s decision to “interrogate” the student about their true motivation. Stakes—understanding the “secrets” of buildings—remain conceptual and are never tested or opposed on the page. The question does deepen knowledge but doesn’t force a trade-off or visibly foreclose an option. As a result, escalation is minimal and tension remains low and static.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.2)
    The central conflict—remain safely isolated from painful memory vs. risk re-experiencing loss to gain independence—is conceptually strong, but it rarely tightens on the page. There’s one main inflection when she chooses to “archive the seashell’s whispers,” yet this decision costs her nothing visible beyond a noted sadness. From there, the pressure does not clearly escalate; each subsequent paragraph confirms rather than complicates the same internal move. As a result, stakes feel abstract and the journey largely frictionless despite the thematic potential.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.5)
    The nominal stakes—committing treason by subverting a historical document used to justify “great injustices”—are potentially high but remain abstract. There is no antagonist, surveillance, deadline, or internal moral struggle that escalates pressure; she simply works until she succeeds. “Calibrated treason” is a label for what is happening rather than a live, tightening conflict on the page. As a result, tension never truly rises, and the resolution costs her nothing visible.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict never really sharpens beyond the generalized quest “to learn why some people echo,” and there is no opposing force or concrete obstacle on the page. Aria’s song deepens, but nothing tests her commitment or demands a trade‑off; no path is foreclosed, and no option becomes more dangerous or costly. The webs of intrigue are entirely conceptual discoveries, not pressures pushing back against her. As a result, escalation is minimal and stakes feel purely rhetorical.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.3)
    Stakes remain abstract—“expose hidden patterns,” “salvage something pure”—without a concrete threat, antagonist, or clear risk to Aria if she fails. The central actions (meditating, touching the globe, walking out) encounter no resistance and involve no visible trade-off. Pressure does not meaningfully tighten; the shipwreck vision is evocative but not a test of her resolve or values. The result is a contemplative vignette with minimal conflict rather than a story with felt escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=3.7)
    Conflict and stakes are largely absent: her goal (understanding hidden patterns) meets no resistance, and every step simply reassures her she’s on the right path. There’s no escalation, reversal, or real risk—only accumulating beauty and affirmation. The “turn” at the clearing is more a volume increase of the same mood than a tightening that forecloses alternatives. As a result, tension stays flat, undercutting narrative force.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the truth about the diamond and stillpoint—is declared but never tested by real resistance. Following the paper trail and assembling the letters proceeds without setback, and the hinted menace (“feeling watched,” ominous trees) never materializes into concrete threat or hard choice. Her final move is simply walking to and standing before the glow; no path is foreclosed, no sacrifice or danger is made legible. The piece reads more like a guided tour than an escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=3.2)
    The declared stakes (worldwide shift in allegiance, birth of a new era) are enormous, but on the page there is virtually no conflict: no opposition, no risk that the prophet fails, no challenge to the visionary. “As days passed” and “weeks into months” signal time moving, not pressure tightening. Her “work” consists of continued listening and narrating without visible cost or trade-off, so escalation remains conceptual rather than dramatized and never forces a real choice.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—whether his life will remain bitter and purposeless or be partially redeemed through his role as “translator between generations”—is signaled, but pressure remains low throughout. The conflict is almost entirely internal and contemplative, without a sharp moment where he might give up, break a jar, leave, or otherwise risk loss. His decision to sit and write reads more like a gentle affirmation than a stressed turn with cost. The result is a pleasant emotional inflection rather than a true escalation and test of commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.0)
    The dominant stake—safeguarding and adapting the artifact—is verbally present, but it never faces a concrete on-page threat; no one opposes her, and the environment never endangers the process beyond mild creaking ice. As a result, there is minimal escalation: she begins focused and ends satisfied, without a moment where her goal seems in serious jeopardy. The tuning procedure is described as delicate and demanding, yet there’s no credible risk of failure or visible cost if she falters. Tension thus remains conceptual and low-grade rather than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are declared as nothing less than a world-changing revolution, but on the page the mapper encounters no resistance, no real dilemma, and no risk beyond generic caution. The “old order” is mentioned as dangerous, yet never exerts pressure in scene. Escalation is mostly rhetorical—wind picking up, humming intensifying—without a true tightening of options or a price. The climax feels inevitable but too easy.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=4.9)
    The nominal stakes—uncovering a preventable death and freeing herself from past control—are substantial in concept, but on the page the pressure remains almost entirely internal and largely static. There is no real escalation: no new clue, danger, or emotional reversal once she’s in the tunnel, just steady rumination toward an already-declared determination. Her “choice” to be free feels less like a hard-won tradeoff than a thematic decision the narration has preordained. Without a moment where she risks or loses something specific, conflict and cost stay muted.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=4.8)
    The central stake—whether the chaplain can move beyond guilt and inaction toward meaningful reparation—is declared but never truly tested. There is no countervailing pressure or serious alternative; he is not forced to choose between competing goods or costs, only to accept a comforting reframing. The proprietor’s counsel is gentle and unopposed, so escalation is minimal, more a deepening reflection than a tightening of options. As a result, the ending’s renewed purpose registers as emotionally mild and largely unpressured.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are mostly conceptual—the desire to understand the yearning algorithm and ring the unheard bell—with virtually no resistance or consequence opposing Zephyr. The “conflict” is an untroubled research montage: she decides to transliterate, does so, adapts as the workshop evolves, and then succeeds without setback. Pressure never tightens; there is no moment where an option is foreclosed or a genuine trade-off is confronted.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the truth behind the disappearances / where deleted files go—is stated early and reiterated, but the conflict stays largely internal and abstract. Pressure “escalates” mainly via repetition of Lena’s growing obsession and the omnipresence of the numbers, rather than via specific obstacles or decisions that foreclose options. The revelation that nothing was truly deleted is interesting but arrives without a visible trade-off, cost, or hard choice on the page. As a result, stakes never feel urgent or materially risky despite the hints of surveillance and conspiracy.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict and stakes remain very soft: nothing pushes back against her goal, and no real alternative paths or losses are staged. The dominant stake—preserving balance between land and ice via understanding/empathy—is declared but never concretely threatened on the page. The process of reconstituting the crystal is serene and unopposed, more ritual than struggle, so escalation is minimal. As a result, the ending feels like a gentle deepening rather than a pressured resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will move toward life or remain in psychic proximity to death—is present but soft on the page. Conflict is largely internal and summarized; there’s little on-scene friction, opposition, or specific obstacle to volunteering or to embracing this “second chance.” The emotional arc trends steadily from numb detachment toward peace without a clear escalation point or sharp test of commitment. As a result, the final hopeful stance feels more like a gentle drift than the outcome of visible pressure or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.7)
    There is almost no genuine conflict on the page: no opposing force, no dilemma, and minimal internal tension beyond mild uncertainty about her “task.” Stakes—“nurture intersubjective understanding”—remain abstract and untested. The burned love-letter fragment is suggestive but never actually puts pressure on her; it simply prompts more reflection. Without a tightening of options or a felt trade-off, the narrative lacks escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—successfully consecrating a space to preserve the prophet’s wisdom—is signaled, but it never faces real jeopardy. Internal conflict is gestured at (“turmoil that lay beneath”) yet never escalates into a moment where failure or refusal feels possible. Pressure does not truly tighten; each step toward creating the clearing proceeds smoothly, with no trade-off or foreclosed option. The final stance (“they will continue to tend the conjured clearing”) reads as serene affirmation rather than the outcome of meaningful tested agency.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is essentially no on-page conflict: Luna encounters no resistance, internal or external, to her goal of taking photographs for healing. Stakes are asserted in abstract terms (“collective healing,” “transmute pain into a masterpiece”) but never tested in scene. Escalation is absent; each beat reiterates tranquility rather than tightening pressure or forcing a trade-off. The ending thus feels like a continuation of the opening state rather than an earned resolution with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether to leave the safe, silent library and risk testifying—is present but underdeveloped on the page. The main escalation is the arrival of the visitor and the dropped crystal, yet after that the scholar’s compliance feels almost automatic, with little friction or visible trade-off. Internal and external conflicts are aligned but lightly dramatized, so tension is more suggested than felt. The final resolve to testify reads as a modest stance crystallization rather than a hard-won choice.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—capturing/locating the sound of growing older—is clearly signaled but remains largely abstract. Conflict is almost entirely internal and static; arranging driftwood is gentle ritual rather than a pressured choice, and nothing meaningfully resists her beyond ambient fog and vague amnesia. There is a soft deepening when the statue appears and when the pattern “seemed to pulse,” but these moments don’t really foreclose options or force trade-offs. The resolution (realizing the sound is to be felt, not found) is conceptually tidy but not earned through escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict stays abstract: the “turmoil of the world below” and the earth tremors are stated stakes, but we don’t feel concrete danger or hard trade-offs as Eli reinforces the observatory. His work on the defenses and the clock hand proceeds without visible setbacks, competing obligations, or moral tension. The intensification (foundations shaking) does not significantly narrow options or force a painful choice; it mainly prompts more reflection. As a result, tension never quite tightens into a compelling crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—helping Emma achieve a peaceful, meaning-suffused death—is clear but faces almost no resistance. The blood-work revelation is treated as a simple trigger to begin the goodbye, not a moment of real dilemma, and nothing threatens Lena’s attempt to soothe Emma beyond generalized fear. Pressure does not significantly tighten; the scene proceeds as an untroubled execution of an already decided plan. As a result, the emotional stakes feel abstractly important but not viscerally contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—unlocking cosmic secrets / understanding where shadows go—is signaled, but pressure remains almost entirely abstract. There’s no antagonist, deadline, or meaningful obstacle; Lyra works, reflects, and concludes she understands something, with no genuine risk of loss. Escalation is more a restatement of her goals and method than a tightening that forecloses options. As a result, the ending stance feels untested, and conflict never rises above a gentle research vignette.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake is internal—Emilia’s need to make sense of unsettling past events and her own doubts—but it’s framed in abstract terms and barely tested. Once she discovers the tooth, there’s no meaningful escalation: no new obstacle, competing desire, or risk that forces a trade-off. The “tension between nostalgia and innovation” is named yet not dramatized through conflicting options or sacrifices. As a result, the resolution feels more like a smooth thematic affirmation than an earned stance under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is almost entirely absent; the star watcher encounters no external obstacle and no genuine internal resistance. The dominant stake—conveying a “pearl of stillness” to others—is stated but never put under pressure or risk of failure. There is no escalation beyond incremental intensification of the same serene mood. As a result, the piece reads as pure contemplation rather than a story with stakes and turns.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—Aria’s need to recover from public exposure and reclaim herself—is stated but not strongly tested on the page. The main “turn” is the man’s arrival and flower proffer, which provides uncomplicated comfort rather than a pressured choice or loss. There’s little escalation: no new threat, dilemma, or real cost beyond summary of past pain, so tension stays flat and gentle. The resolution feels granted by the garden’s atmosphere and kind stranger more than earned through difficult agency.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake (whether she will overcome her block and write) is articulated early, but conflict remains almost entirely internal and declarative. The appearance of the woman in white is framed as a turning point, yet it doesn’t create new pressure so much as conveniently dissolve resistance, with no real trade-off or loss. There is little escalation; the emotional temperature stays in the same muted key throughout, with repetition (“she knew she had to continue writing”) in place of new complications. As a result, the resolution feels lightly earned and low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can remedy the village’s disconnection—is stated but never truly pressured. There are no meaningful obstacles, reversals, or trade-offs; the device works on the first try and the villagers respond with immediate, unanimous enthusiasm. Elara never has to choose between competing goods or face visible risk of failure, social or otherwise. The result is a pleasant, low-tension progression rather than escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—completing the enchantment and sealing the plate—is signaled early, but there is almost no actual resistance or escalation; each step of the ritual unfolds as expected. Descriptions of stillness, anticipation, and a “faint hum” suggest importance but don’t materially threaten failure or force a trade-off. Aria never faces a moment where her goal is in jeopardy or where she must genuinely sacrifice something tangible or relational on the page. As a result, the story reads as a graceful process description rather than a pressured conflict with tightening stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is very soft: Elian faces a broken mechanism and the abstract challenge of understanding it, but there are no setbacks, competing aims, or genuine risks. The stakes remain conceptual—comprehension, wonder—without any concrete consequence if he fails or takes too long. The passage of time (days to months) is noted yet does not heighten urgency or demand a trade-off. The final success reads foregone, so there is minimal escalation and no visible price paid in the process.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are largely abstract: “understanding burdens” and preserving balance are important in principle but never sharpen into a concrete risk or dilemma on the page. There is no genuine escalation—her task is difficult in concept but not contested in scene, and nothing threatens failure. The legend framing provides a sense of significance without dramatized pressure or visible loss. As a result, tension stays flat and the narrative reads more like a vignette than a fully pressurized story.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central conflict—how to endure the “here and gone” of her husband’s death—is present but remains largely static. Her tactic (carving while the kettle boils) is in place from the outset and is never significantly tested or modified. There is a mild deepening as the carving takes shape and her grief becomes “manageable,” but no clear beat where options narrow or a visible price is paid. The stakes feel real but under-pressurized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=5.3)
    The dominant stake—whether the scavenger can reconcile with their own ghost and find a measure of peace—is present but remains abstract. There is minimal escalation: the gathering of fragments proceeds at one emotional volume until the sun’s setting signals a vague endpoint, and the final click is more a symbolic punctuation than the outcome of hard-forced trade-offs. No specific options are narrowed or sacrificed in-scene; the scavenger could have taken this photograph at almost any prior moment. As a result, tension is low and the resolution, while coherent, doesn’t feel hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are articulated—revive a dead terminal, find a “new equation for hope”—but they remain conceptual rather than felt, since nothing seriously threatens her physically, emotionally, or morally. There is almost no escalation: once she has the idea to reroute the pipes, the work proceeds smoothly with no meaningful setbacks or trade-offs. The “pressure” of abandonment doesn’t intensify or corner her into a difficult choice; it’s a backdrop for a foregone, successful restoration. As a result, the ending lacks a sense of price paid or path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake is Elian’s relationship to his abandoned dream, but on-page pressure remains gentle and largely unopposed. The bear’s appearance functions as a catalyst and does generate a soft tightening when it approaches him, yet no real alternative path or consequence is dramatized if he resists the pull of nature. Escalation is more a deepening of mood than a genuine narrowing of options. The final decision feels low-risk, limiting the sense of stakes and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—finding the sundial and gaining its promised clarity—is established, but pressure never meaningfully tightens. Lyra’s “search” proceeds smoothly; the environment offers hints rather than resistance, and no option is truly foreclosed. The internal revelation appears without being forced by a specific dilemma or cost on the page. As a result, conflict feels largely static and tension low despite the mythic setup.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering and preserving the secret weavers’ knowledge—is declared but never truly tested. There is no meaningful opposition, time pressure, or risk; her success in decoding feels inevitable, and the fog’s deepening never tightens options or raises the price of continuing. Internal conflict is nearly absent; her desire and circumstances align smoothly. As a result, the piece reads as a meditative vignette rather than a scene with escalating pressure or a consequential turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and remains abstract: melancholy versus a desire for connection and understanding. There is no external pressure and very little escalation; the narrator never faces a real dilemma or trade-off. The act of beginning to write does not feel costly or contested, and the resulting “peace” arrives without having endured or refused anything significant on the page. Stakes stay atmospheric rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the prince can rekindle the world’s lost beauty—is clear, but the opposition is almost entirely abstract. Pressure rises slightly via the humming device and shuddering palace, yet he never faces a concrete risk, hard trade-off, or genuine possibility of failure. His despair at the outset softens into purpose without being tested by a meaningful reversal. As a result, escalation feels more like a volume increase of mood than a tightening of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain largely abstract: a single damaged tree and Aria’s internal sense of purpose, with no real opposition or risk of failure. The grafting scene offers potential for conflict but unfolds smoothly, without complication or trade-off. Internal stakes—her need to “prove that scars can sing”—are told but not seriously tested by events. As a result, pressure barely escalates; the story reads as a meditative vignette rather than a conflict-driven arc.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.8)
    The central stake—liberating trapped memories and reviving the city—is declared, but on-page conflict is almost entirely absent. Aria faces no opposition, danger, or genuine uncertainty beyond a light “excitement and trepidation” at the box. The breadcrumbs lead her efficiently to success, and her vow to be guardian is consequence-light rather than a pressured trade-off. As a result, tension never meaningfully tightens, and the outcome feels assured from early on.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—conveying cosmic light without “igniting the flames of destruction”—is conceptually stated but never put under real pressure. The sonar pinging “grows more frequent,” yet there’s no concrete threat, reversal, or choice that narrows options or exacts a visible price. The sentimentalist essentially glides from intention to fulfillment without resistance. As a result, tension and escalation remain flat.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—her need to understand and reconfigure her grief—is present but faces minimal resistance. Pressure barely tightens: the ghost’s arrival and the poem nudge her inward, yet nothing genuinely threatens her current stance or forces a trade-off. She more or less drifts into acceptance, with no vivid sense of what she risks by changing. As a result, escalation feels static and the ending lacks a palpable price.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s struggle to move beyond guilt into “incremental absolution”—remains largely internal and abstract, with no concrete test or external pressure on the page. There is minimal escalation: her turmoil is stated early, and the discovery of the rake handle resolves it rather than deepening or complicating it. The inscriptions act as a neat solution rather than something she must wrestle with or potentially reject. Consequently, tension stays low and the final shift feels relatively unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the meaning of the echoes—is signaled, but it remains abstract and largely untested. There is no real counterforce, risk, or dilemma; the gardener simply continues their decoding work until it yields insight. The chess clock and night’s passing are mentioned, yet they never tighten decisions or foreclose options. Escalation is minimal and largely rhetorical, so the ending doesn’t feel like a hard-won or costly point.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are declared (“for too long… stagnation took hold”), but no concrete antagonist, deadline, or countervailing force pressures the cartographer in the moment. The entire piece is one extended poised state without a clear escalation or narrowing of options under the chosen lens. There is no reversal or deepening—once the task is named, the pressure neither sharpens nor complicates. Consequently, the final stance costs nothing on the page, and tension stays largely theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Emilia will successfully capture the pirate broadcast and translate it into dust-stories—is present but largely abstract and unopposed. The strongest potential escalation (the presence behind her and flickering lights) fizzles without consequence; it doesn’t force a trade-off or decision beyond clutching her cloak and continuing. There is one gentle tightening as the broadcast grows clearer and dust begins to move, but no concrete loss, narrowed option, or moral tension. The conflict remains mostly atmospheric, which limits urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and quite diffuse: Lena feels “drawn” to a piece and contemplates impermanence and safety. There is no real opposing force or sharp dilemma—she never seriously considers not scattering the ashes, nor is there any jeopardy to her values or role. The arrival of Eli doesn’t heighten pressure; it simply provides thematic exposition. The result is a gentle meditation rather than a story with escalating stakes or a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal: Kael versus the “official story” and his own competing narratives. He “agonizes” over contradictions, but the on-page pressure does not materially escalate, and there is no clear moment where a viable alternative (joining the rebuild, abandoning the past) is nearly taken and then renounced with cost. The ending reaffirms his existing posture rather than resolving a sharpened dilemma, so the stakes remain largely abstract and static. This keeps the piece from delivering a compelling story beat rather than a mood study.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving harmony and unlearning hatred through art—is declared but remains largely abstract and untested on the page. There is no concrete obstacle, antagonist, or on-scene resistance; the choir and “hatred” exist only as summaries. Pressure does not really escalate: her resolve at the end is essentially a restatement of her initial mission, with no real narrowing of options or trade-off. As a result, tension is more conceptual than felt, keeping conflict and stakes modest.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.8)
    The stakes remain abstract—create a beautiful, memory-charged dish during a rare alignment—without concrete risk, opposition, or credible possibility of failure. There is little escalation; the alignment approaches, but Aria encounters no setbacks, doubts, or counterforces that alter tactics. Discovering and planting the seed happens smoothly and leads directly to success without complication. As a result, tension is low and the ending’s “achievement” feels largely preordained rather than wrested from pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict and stakes are extremely mild: there is curiosity and a civic unease about imbalance, but no resistance, jeopardy, or real risk if they fail to understand the beehive. The investigation faces no obstacles—access is granted, the log is simply found, and its explanation is immediately accepted. There’s no hard choice or loss; the “cost” is largely conceptual, which is fine, but it isn’t sharpened into a pressured decision. As a result, escalation feels more like information drip than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—Eli’s desire to understand and perhaps awaken a house’s “aliveness”—never sharpens into a dilemma or meaningful risk. Her experiment proceeds without resistance: the shard works, the atmosphere shifts, and she gains insight without challenge or loss. There is a mild escalation from wandering curiosity to heightened perception, but no beat where a real option is closed or a price is paid. As a result, tension remains almost entirely theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes remain almost entirely abstract: understanding the “secret of the garden’s downfall” and welcoming nuance into certainty. There is no meaningful resistance, dilemma, or price to the statue’s insights; every move flows smoothly toward harmony. The ampoule’s arrival could have introduced danger or cost but instead offers effortless enlightenment. As a result, pressure barely escalates and conflict never crystallizes beyond a wistful tone.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal: curiosity versus confinement, determinism versus chance. However, there is no clear inciting incident or meaningful on-page test that forces a new choice; the narrator simply continues climbing and reflecting, with pressure staying abstract. “Rupture” is invoked conceptually but doesn’t map to a distinct turning event that alters options or raises cost. The final acceptance of endless climbing is more of a restatement than a sharpened trade-off under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is minimal: there is no active obstacle, and the painter faces only a faint, generalized discouragement from the city’s indifference. Stakes—reviving lost languages and proving kindness—remain largely conceptual and are never concretely threatened or tested on the page. The main “turn” is her roused sense of purpose leading her to paint, but this shift isn’t forced by any escalating pressure or real trade-off. As a result, tension barely rises and the piece reads more like a mood piece than a story under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is largely absent; the group is passive, and Elena encounters no resistance, risk, or genuine dilemma. The “rosewater dread” and “tense” atmosphere are asserted rather than earned by concrete stakes. The only real “turn” is the ice thawing to reveal bread sculptures, but this functions as a gentle revelation rather than an escalation that narrows options or forces a trade-off. As a result, the story reads as a guided meditation on heritage more than as a pressured scene.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake is internal—unlocking the hunger stone and transforming himself—but it remains largely abstract and untested. Conflict is minimal: there is no resistance from the environment, no risk that the puzzle will fail, and no meaningful trade-off required to gain the radiance. The process of reverse-engineering is summarized rather than dramatized through specific challenges. As a result, escalation feels flat, and the climactic surge of energy lands as inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.7)
    The dominant stake—psychic/spiritual danger versus the lure of forbidden knowledge—is present but mostly abstract and internally focused. Escalation occurs in an accumulative way (objects and lore growing stranger until the mirror encounter), yet the protagonist remains largely passive, following the advisor’s commands rather than making pressured trade-offs. The mirror scene, where stakes should crystallize, lacks a clear decision point; the character looks and is overwhelmed instead of actively choosing risk or refusal. Consequently, the cost is more implied aftermath than an on-page price paid at a turn.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is effectively no antagonist, obstacle, or dilemma; the prophet encounters no resistance in pursuing her singular goal. The “stakes” remain abstract—making music that harmonizes with clouds and atmosphere—without any on-page risk, loss, or tradeoff. Escalation is purely in complexity of sound, not in pressure on the character or her options. As a result, tension is minimal and the piece reads more as a descriptive vignette than a story under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the truth about the expedition and the watchers despite fear—is signaled and maintained, with a clear escalation when Lyra inadvertently cracks the shell and learns of the “terrible fate.” That discovery reasonably raises the conceptual stakes for pressing on. However, opposition remains abstract; nothing on the page actively resists her, and her decision to leave the city faces no real tactical or moral obstacle. As a result, tension escalates more in rhetoric than in felt, consequential conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the truth of a distorted historical event—is declared, but never meaningfully tested on the page. Emilia encounters no opposing force: no time pressure, danger, institutional resistance, or true risk of failure. The “work” is summarized (“She pored over the documents… and slowly, gradually, the truth began to emerge”) without on-page friction or reversal. As a result, tension stays flat and the ending’s victory lacks dramatic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict and stakes remain almost entirely internal and low-intensity: the surveyor wants to “wrest the stories from the silence,” but nothing opposes or complicates that desire. There is no escalation beyond deepening reverence; discovery of the inkwell does not force a meaningful trade-off or risk. The ending doesn’t crystallize a hard stance under pressure so much as affirm a stable belief. As a result, the story feels meditative rather than dramatically shaped.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is largely internal and diffuse: the main tension lies in resolving “discrepancies” in the text and testing an “alternative hypothesis,” but no clear negative consequence or urgent opposition is dramatized. The blackout and submerged city are mentioned yet never actively press her; they don’t close off options or sharpen choices. The hypothesis shift is the only real deepening, and it occurs smoothly, without risk or setback. As a result, stakes feel academic and the story reads as contemplative process more than conflict-driven narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Kaito can bear and transform his grief—is clear but remains largely internal and untested by concrete obstacles. There is a soft tightening around the release of the crane and his decision to keep working, yet those moves don’t visibly foreclose a path or force a painful trade-off. The basilica as a potential site of transcendence never becomes an actual on-page dilemma (go/stay, seek/help), so tension never spikes. As a result, conflict feels meditative rather than escalating, limiting stakes impact.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding the forces that destroyed her wedding by tracking “unused potential”—remains highly abstract and never faces a concrete test or opposition. Once Amira reaches the observatory, there is no real resistance: the data yields patterns, the revelation arrives, and her new purpose emerges without sacrifice or risk. The “circuit breakers cooling” is framed as a window but doesn’t generate genuine time pressure or forced trade-offs. As a result, conflict stays conceptual and flat, with minimal escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—finding the chip as part of decoding a mysterious frequency—is present from early on, but conflict remains almost entirely notional. There is no real opposition, time pressure, or risk; Lena moves through a sequence of tasks that unfold smoothly. The discovery of the chip and activation of the console don’t force a difficult choice or trade-off, so escalation is flat. The internal conflict about belonging is asserted at the end rather than sharpened through on-page dilemmas.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=5.8)
    The core conflict—whether to pursue a dangerous, unsettling truth versus remaining complicit in comfortable fabrication—is present but kept largely abstract. Pressure doesn’t truly escalate; her unease increases, but no concrete external consequence, deadline, or relational threat is introduced. The shore sequence feels like a mood-deepening interlude rather than a sharp tightening of stakes. By the end, “no matter the cost” is declared without the story having shown even a small, specific price she must pay or risk in choosing forward.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—the success of the prisoner exchange and its emotional meaning—is stated clearly but never put under on-page pressure. We hear that negotiations have “been stalled for weeks” and then that they “now began to flow,” without a concrete beat where a decision, objection, or concession forces a new tactic. Internal and external conflicts blur into a single smooth progression with no genuine tightening or cost. As a result, tension stays abstract and the resolution feels assured rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake is Jack’s ability to move past regret and find direction, but it’s never truly tested by on-page resistance once he chooses to paddle. Internal conflict is mostly summarized rather than dramatized in shifting, pressured beats, so there’s no genuine sense of risk that he might backslide or fail. Escalation is weak: the story moves from “very sad” to “less sad” without a meaningful turn that narrows options or extracts visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.2)
    The central stakes—Lena’s attempt to escape/understand her past and rekindle empathy—are declared but never truly tested on the page. There is no opposing force, ethical dilemma, or material risk slowing or complicating her progress; every development (box, ball, path) arrives as a gift. As a result, there’s minimal escalation: the “labyrinth of choices” is asserted rather than dramatized, and the final decision to follow the path feels inevitable and low-cost. The story functions more as a prologue vignette than a conflict-bearing unit.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=4.8)
    The nominal stakes—Aria’s attempt to reconnect with the dead and Lyra’s looming metamorphosis—are high, but on the page they face no meaningful resistance. Lyra agrees to help almost immediately; the ritual proceeds smoothly, with no price exacted, no risk of failure, and no moment where Lyra must choose between her steady life and this dangerous change. Her “reluctance” never manifests as an on-page dilemma. As a result, tension remains low and escalation is more a matter of rising rhetoric than sharpened conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding “cloudbound repentance” and where lost time goes—is signaled, but it stays abstract and unopposed by any concrete alternative or risk. The pressure does not meaningfully escalate; each new object prompts more reflection without narrowing options or deepening cost. Her “peace” at the end is not clearly weighed against any live, painful alternative (e.g., refusing the insight, facing guilt as a mother). As a result, the story feels emotionally static rather than truly conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are declared as immense—unlocking a dimension, bearing the weight of humanity’s memories—but on the page the conflict remains almost entirely internal and largely unopposed. The “perilous journey” of shadow work never manifests as a real threat or dilemma; there is no moment where she might fail, turn back, or pay a visible price beyond a gentle, almost serene fading. The stitching proceeds without resistance, and the dimension opens without complication, so the story lacks a meaningful tightening or reversal. As a result, tension stays flat, and the resolution feels inevitable rather than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is effectively no opposition: Aria walks, receives a prophetic gift, and attains peace without any meaningful obstacle or trade-off. The hush growing “louder” suggests rising intensity, but it doesn’t force a difficult decision or foreclose a path. The prophecy is accepted quickly, and the lightning bug bottle is pure boon, not a complicated burden. Stakes stay abstract (“understanding the universe”) rather than viscerally felt, so tension never really escalates.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are proclaimed as enormous (the fort’s existence, a revolution) but on-page conflict is minimal. The apparent threat in the darkness immediately resolves into an ally, and there is no risk in decoding the message or activating the cradle. No one opposes her, internally or externally; the “revolution” costs her nothing visible. As a result, tension barely escalates past the initial rustling-in-the-dark moment.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—unlocking sacred patterns via the stardust ritual—is declared but faces no real resistance or complication. The process unfolds without setbacks, hard decisions, or trade-offs, so pressure barely escalates. The only “tightening” is the growing pattern of rocks and the ensuing vision, which read as expected payoff rather than earned under duress. As a result, conflict feels largely notional.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.3)
    The dominant stake is internal—whether she will confront what she has hidden from herself—but the pressure around that choice is low. The main escalation is simply moving from abstract turmoil to opening and reading the letter, which happens without real resistance or complication. There’s no meaningful sense of what it would cost her not to read it or to misread it, and no countervailing desire pushing her to keep the envelope sealed. As a result, tension feels static, with the storm’s fury not translating into escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.0)
    The central conflict—intellectual and physical dominance in a duel—is clear but largely abstract, as we never feel a meaningful on-page risk if Aurélien loses. The duel sequence lacks a concrete reversal or specific tactical challenge; “swords clashing in a flurry of steel and sparks” is generic and uninflected by the story’s unique elements. Internal and external stakes (his philosophical project, his status as duelist) don’t visibly collide in a way that narrows his options. The outcome is a clean win without visible cost, so tension stays modest.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—can the poet help rebuild the library/city and embody the “blooming resistance”—is stated, but the on-page conflict remains largely internal and low-resistance. There is one real “turn,” when the poet shifts from contemplation to commitment and action, yet they face no opposing force, resource obstacle, or ethical trade-off; everything proceeds as aspiration. Stakes stay mostly abstract; we’re told of conflict in the city, but the rebuild is never truly tested on the page. As a result, escalation is modest and the cost of the choice feels theoretical rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central conflict—seeking refuge from grief versus accepting that she must rejoin time and uncertainty—is coherent and threads the piece. Escalation occurs through her choice to step into the film and then her recognition she cannot remain, leading to the encore as an act of defiance. Still, tension stays soft; there’s little sense of risk beyond abstract emotional stakes, and options never feel sharply narrowed. The price of leaving refuge is acknowledged but not viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving collective memory before the monsoon—is declared clearly but remains abstract and untested. There is no active opposition, setback, or concrete risk beyond the generalized idea that memories might be “washed away.” Aria never faces a moment where she might fail, change methods, or sacrifice something tangible; pressure does not truly tighten as the monsoon nears. As a result, the piece reads as a static ritual rather than escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Kaito can transform his regret into a livable peace—is present but under-pressured. There is effectively one turn: the discovery of the compass leading to the decision to perform the lace ritual; once that’s chosen, there’s no real threat that it will fail or demand sacrifice beyond letting go. Internal conflict is largely summarized rather than dramatized in moment-to-moment hesitation or competing impulses. The resolution, while fitting, feels low-cost and not seriously contested, limiting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=2.0)
    There is no effective opposition; the "whispers" increase in volume but never force the priest to alter his tactics or face a dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=1.9)
    There is virtually no conflict, internal or external; the protagonist faces no obstacles, opposition, or difficult trade-offs. The stake (becoming a "conductor") is achieved through a passive realization without any struggle or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=2.7)
    There is no genuine conflict or escalation; obstacles are mentioned ("challenges and obstacles") and immediately dismissed via the protagonist's competence.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=3.5)
    The primary conflict (the negotiation) occurs off-page, and the protagonist's on-page decision meets no resistance. Stakes are declared ("freedom," "safety") but remain abstract and unfelt.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=2.5)
    There are no stakes or obstacles; the stationer faces no opposition from the environment, the task, or herself.

    There is no external opposition or concrete obstacle; the conflict is entirely abstract ("task at hand").

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=1.2)
    Conflict is abstract and macro-scale ("gentrification," "privatization") without a specific on-page antagonist or obstacle to test the protagonist in real time. There is no escalation of immediate pressure, only a generalized description of resistance over days.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=2.5)
    Stakes remain abstract and declared ("brink of extinction") rather than dramatized through obstacles. The central conflict—outlasting harsh conditions—is mentioned in a text message but never shown; the character faces no physical difficulty or hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=2.5)
    Conflict is non-existent; the drone offers no resistance, and the repair process is described as "meditative" rather than difficult. There is no escalation of pressure, leading to a flat narrative arc where success is inevitable and purely atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=2.5)
    Conflict is absent; the boy faces no opposition, external or internal, as he moves through the space. The "weight of legacy" remains an abstract assertion, never forcing a tradeoff or heightening the immediate danger or cost of his actions.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is a near-total absence of conflict or opposition; the protagonist desires the bead, the ghost helps her get it, and the magic works immediately. The "stakes" are purely theoretical ("unlocking secrets") and never tested by failure or consequences on the page. Escalation is nonexistent as the story moves smoothly from desire to fulfillment.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=1.5)
    There is virtually no conflict, opposition, or pressure; the character faces no risk of failure and pays no price for her success.

The narrative lacks tension, as the outcome is assured from the start and no trade-offs are made.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=2.2)
    There is virtually no conflict; the earth yields easily ("brushing away dirt"), the tomb reveals secrets willingly, and Maya experiences no external opposition or internal doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=4.2)
    No active opposition or rising pressure; stakes are purely cognitive—will she see the pattern?—and never tighten. The story starts after the destructive event, so the only possible escalation is intellectual, but no new obstacle or loss complicates her investigation. Because no option is foreclosed and no cost is extracted, the dominant stake remains abstract. Agency is limited to noticing and philosophizing; no reversal or trade-off occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—“find purpose in the pauses”—is declared early but never materially tested; no tightening narrows options. Pressure is ambient, not actionable; ledger decoding has no visible obstacle or price. Escalation is a soft accretion of images rather than a beat that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—“translate silence into music”—is signaled early; pressure deepens via heat-map color feedback that forces real-time frequency correction. One meaningful tightening: the final joint adjustment before lights dim, narrowing options to this shared symphony. Cost is present but soft—no tangible resource lost—so entry to 8-band wavers.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes begin as “revive a distress signal” and deepen into “create eternal refuge,” but the mid-story escalation plateaus once the lens clicks; no new obstacle or trade-off emerges. The tightening is singular rather than progressive, so pressure feels accumulative-textural rather than causal-crescendo.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stake—community survival under sanctions—is declared, yet no on-page shortage, conflict over distribution, or risk appears. Pressure is static; the midnight food runs are summarized, not dramatized, so no tightening or trade-off is felt. Escalation is replaced by iterative affirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—“find where unused love is stored”—is signaled early and tightens through the breath sequence; each exhale surfaces more of it, foreclosing emotional dormancy. Agency, however, is largely passive: Aria receives the pilgrim’s guidance without resistance or complicating misbelief; the breathing method does the work rather than a crucible choice. Visible cost arrives only in the pilgrim’s withdrawal, not in any forfeiture Aria actively risks.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.7)
    The dominant stake—“discover the texture of time”—is signaled early but remains abstract; no concrete resource or reputation is risked. Pressure does not escalate through a narrowing choice; instead, wonder accumulates until the fragment glows. The retrocognitive trap should tighten options, yet Elian’s agency is passive—he is “drawn,” “realized,” “felt themselves becoming attuned.” Without a visible price or foreclosed path, the escalation is atmospheric, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—get seeds to dry soil—announced late and remains abstract; no single seed packet is named or mourned if lost. Escalation is linear: obstacle → bypass → success, without a mid-story tightening that forecloses an option or exacts on-page forfeiture. The “heavily guarded” vault yields immediately to hidden pathways, nullifying pressure. Cost is deferred to future seasons rather than paid in the scene, so the beat feels like a checklist, not a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—capture the sound of trust breaking—is signaled in para 3 and tightens through each failed timbre until the crystalline shard succeeds. Pressure is purely accumulative: color-whispers grow sharper, silence grows heavier, forge glow intensifies; no causal antagonist beyond memory. Single meaningful deepening occurs when mother-memory surfaces mid-calibration, narrowing options to “imprint or abandon.” Cost is visible—once printed, the device will replay trauma; Lyra accepts complicity. Agency is decision, not confrontation; fits situational lens. Lacks persistent external constraint, so stays below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—“listen to destiny’s whisper”—is declared early but remains abstract; no concrete loss or trade-off is risked. Escalation is atmospheric: moonlight intensifies, energy thickens, but options do not narrow. Agency is observational; the shutter click does not alter destiny’s path or Lumina’s. Cost is implied only conceptually; no visible price alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—crafting safe zones—is declared late and never tested; no opposition, resource loss, or option foreclosure appears. Thawing serves as textural intensifier, not causal obstacle. Escalation is lyrical accumulation (ice melts, orb brightens) rather than pressure that forces adaptation. Cost is asserted (“daunting prospect”) but not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—proving vulnerability can be power—stays abstract; no visible social, physical, or vocational cost is risked or lost. Escalation is muted: decoding the note is the single middle turn, but it neither narrows future options nor raises the price of failure. Pressure is entirely internal and static; the external world (stunt bosses, audience, even the library) offers no counter-push or ticking clock. Closure re-declares intent rather than forcing an irrevocable trade-off, so stakes never tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—“to draw a map of the endless night”—is signaled early; pressure escalates via accretion of sensory density rather than option narrowing; no visible price or foreclosed path is dramatized on the page, so the tightening is atmospheric, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—“to find where thoughts come from”—remains internal and abstract; no external pressure narrows options or raises cost. Looped timelines are narrated as retrospective observation, not escalating beats that force adaptation or trade-off. The violin stays inert, so its beauty never becomes a temptation or hazard that tightens decisions. Without a tightening turn that forecloses a path or exacts a price, escalation is static; the ending reiterates understanding rather than confronting a sacrificed alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—transparency vs mistrust—is signaled early. Pressure is ambient, not adversarial: no opposing force or trade-off appears. The only escalation is her deciphering more doodles while walking; no option is foreclosed, no price exacted. Closure feels affirmative but not earned through a costly turn.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—proving the garden reciprocates care—never tightens; no beat risks measurable luck dropping or a graft failing, so pressure stays ambient rather than option-narrowing; the midpoint “first bloom” celebration merely repeats the opening condition.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are declared—prove sideways time—but never tested; the nexus simply invites her in. One escalation beat exists: simulator activates → nexus appears, yet Kaelin’s agency is limited to reaching out. No option is narrowed or forfeited; the trip sideways is consequence-free. Pressure remains conceptual, not tactical, so the tightening required for 8-band is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—decode the ghost’s secret—remains abstract until late; escalation is atmospheric, not tactical. Only the final tilting of the program narrows options and forces concrete cost, a single meaningful tightening under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake: can Aria surface a truth without breaking the station’s epistemic frame? Escalation is textural: each marginal smudge increases social tension and semantic instability until the only option is departure—an earned forfeiture. No coin-flip rescue; the mist simply reclaims her. Cost is visible: she abandons the community whose data she defaced.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.1)
    Dominant stake—“find the weight of a swallowed truth”—stated early yet never sharpened into tangible risk or trade-off. Pressure is ambient (dark, decay, watched feeling) but does not escalate; options don’t narrow. Absent antagonist or credible loss, tension is flat-line. Closure image is internal satisfaction, not a priced choice, so escalation never lands a cost.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving impartial witness—stated early but never tested by an external pressure that would force adaptation; tension is atmospheric, not tactical. No beat narrows options or exacts a visible price; the burrowing merely deepens mood. Under Accumulative lens, a single intensifying pattern break is present (silence thickens), yet it fails to foreclose a live alternative path. Closure feels like continuation, not consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake: awaken Eli’s lifelong wonder. Pressure is gentle atmospheric accumulation, not escalation—no trade-off, no option foreclosed. Eclipse functions as coincidental backdrop rather than tightening force; Aria never risks failure or loss. Stakes remain abstract, cost unrendered.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—uncover the silo’s secrets—signals early and tightens once: illegible final diary entry halts reconstruction. No visible price paid (time spent is abstract; no tool breaks). Escalation is accretive: each artifact adds atmospheric density rather than foreclosing options. Agency is observational; the only narrowing is the diary’s charred gap, which feels logistical, not costly.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=3.0)
    No stake is ever tested; “life transposed into a new key” stays metaphorical. No visible price, no narrowing of options—Oracle drifts from tavern to lighthouse to desk without obstacle. Stranger’s arrival is pure coincidence; conversation loops on theme instead of forcing decision.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are abstract—“prevent unnamed possession”—so pressure is atmospheric rather than tactical. Escalation is textural: density of whispers and vibration increases, but no live option is foreclosed. The priest’s agency is pure endurance; cost is conceptual silence, not a visible trade-off. Sufficient for 600-word lyric mode, but not the tightening that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake—“become the conductor of unheard symphonies”—is signaled early, but escalation is purely textural: light strengthens, shell pulses, map unfolds. No reversal or narrowing of options occurs; the writer’s task proceeds exactly as planned, merely intensifying in mood. The dawn deadline is announced but never threatens to cut off action; exhaustion is mentioned only after the task is complete, so pressure stays atmospheric rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—mastery over fractured timelines—signaled in paragraph one and tightened once when the glow "intensifies" then "fades," marking the power siphon. Agency is present in every beat (she generates, confronts, integrates), yet the tablet never pushes back; escalation is a smooth ramp rather than a wrenching trade-off. Cost is atmospheric ("darkness coalescing") rather than a concrete forfeiture we can weigh; the price is felt but not specified. Still, the lens holds and the single deepening re-weights options, satisfying the short-form bar.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=4.1)
    Stakes—defeat numbness—stay abstract; no tightening beat narrows options or forces trade-off. The seasons’ “rustle” is decorative coincidence rather than rising pressure, so escalation remains flat.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stake—uncover hidden lab—emerges late and remains abstract; no on-page consequence yet threatens her safety, time, or resources. Escalation is a single cognitive leap; tension plateaus at “shiver run down her spine” and never tightens again. Agency is purely interpretive; she neither acts nor sacrifices, only decides to act later. Coincidence (pigeon arrives to her alone) supplies the complication without complicating her options further.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—making peace with memory’s ache—is signaled early and deepened once via the UV-reveal pattern break. Agency is present but soft: she breathes, weeps, and replaces the vial—an endurance that forecloses lingering sorrow. Cost is felt (tears, empty vial) yet not visibly persistent; no external consequence alters later tactics. Escalation is a single cadence shift rather than a narrowing of options; still, it satisfies the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes (“adapt, resist, or flee”) are declared abstractly; no concrete test forces the poet toward any option. Pressure is static: each paragraph re-describes the same wonder rather than deepening cost or narrowing possibility. The energy beings function as off-stage backdrop, not active opposition, so escalation is atmospheric, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—“find beauty in the unfinished”—is signaled early; escalation is an accumulative deepening: chronic hush → communal storytelling → music release, each layer adding density rather than narrowing options. Agency is present (she enters, sits, plays) but no credible loss or tool forfeiture occurs; the unbinding is symbolic, not tactical. Therefore cost is legible as atmospheric shift, not visible price, capping entry to the 7-band. No reversal or trade-off is forced upon her, so pressure coheres but stays soft.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake—deliver nuanced counterfeit emotions—remains static; no tightening or trade-off appears. Pressure is atmospheric (grotto glow, dusk deepening) rather than tactical; the dealer never risks discovery, resources, or self. No option is foreclosed; the task simply finishes. Cost is aesthetic, not consequential, so escalation stays in the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—belonging—is signaled early and tightens when the tag is discovered, but the tightening is emotional rather than tactical: no live option is foreclosed, and the community’s acceptance is unconditional. Escalation is textural: each glimmering tree adds evidence that Kael is already enmeshed. A visible price (time, risk, social capital) never materializes; the ache simply evaporates. Thus the required cost-legibility for 8.8+ is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are declared—“find the place where echoes are born”—but the canal offers no resistance; the spell proceeds on first attempt. Pressure exists only as ambient legend and distant tremor, never narrowing Lyra’s options or forcing a trade-off. The interrupted cadence is sensed, then solved, without escalation or reversal. Closure carries conceptual cost (giant stirs), yet the protagonist’s path is never genuinely endangered, keeping tension moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“quantify the unquantifiable” loss—is signaled early. Pressure escalates via textural deepening: orchard hush → ritual intensity → spark of insight, but no visible price is paid (no energy drain, tool crack, or irreversible forfeiture). The climax is cognitive, not tactical, so options never visibly narrow; ambiguity remains intact but static. Sufficient for mid-band, yet the lack of a felt cost keeps it below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake—“be seen”—is signaled early, yet pressure is static: no beat forces the dweller to risk exposure or abandon the cache. The outage flicker is decorative; it neither complicates nor deepens tactics. Closure reiterates the same desire, so escalation is decorative, not causal.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—will she surrender control?—is announced early, but pressure stays atmospheric, not tactical: no scene where control actually slips and costs her. Storm season supplies ambient urgency yet never narrows options or forces a public choice. The single deepening is internal summary ("she understood that she had to reconstruct her approach"); no external test proves the stakes. Cost is conceptual, not visceral, so escalation feels like mood music rather than a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—thresh meaning from ruins—signals early and tightens once: the brooch must be decoded or the obsession stays hollow. However, escalation is mostly informational (each clue simply adds lore) rather than option-closing; no rainstorm traps him, no rival claimant threatens, no sleepless hallucination forces a false reading. The exchange with the stranger is the single beat that forecloses secrecy, but the price paid (one painting) feels light. Cost is conceptual, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are announced—magnify hidden magic—but never sharpen into a tangible loss or trade-off; Aria’s task intensifies cosmetically, not consequentially. The single “tightening” is the pearl’s unpredictable energy, yet it never endangers her sight, reputation, or relationship with pilgrims; escalation is atmospheric, not operational. Because coincidence (the pilgrim) sparks the change and no option is foreclosed, pressure stays low and abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake—restore communal memory—remains abstract; no visible opposition, resource limit, or ticking clock narrows options. Pressure plateaus at “community began to gather,” a passive escalation that costs no one anything on the page, so the conflict stays ceremonial.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are declared—“fortress of unspoken truths”—but never tested; Emilia faces no obstacle, loss, or narrowing of options. The single “tightening” is a light appearing; she walks toward it unchanged and unchallenged. No visible price is paid (time, effort, risk), so pressure remains atmospheric rather than causal. Escalation is therefore only decorative density under an Accumulative lens; without a felt cost the stake never truly intensifies.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—“unlock entangled memories”—is signaled early; escalation is textural: pattern density increases, whale song grows louder in her perception. No concrete option is foreclosed; transcription never risks failure, exhaustion, or irreversible change, so pressure plateaus. The tightening is aesthetic rather than tactical, yielding a mid-band score for accumulative escalation without a palpable price.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—escaping existential boredom via spatial mutiny—is declared early, but pressure plateaus: once the duplicate appears, tension plateaus into philosophical dialogue rather than a narrowing of options. No visible price is exacted; Kael neither loses nor risks anything corporeal or relational. The storm intensifies outside while inside the conflict turns conversational, diffusing rather than tightening. Escalation is present but soft, lacking a felt trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—client’s asylum—signaled early; pressure tightens when director demands protocol breach. One meaningful deepening: Lena reframes director as mark, narrowing moral options. Cost is conceptual (criminal exposure) but still abstract until final breath; a visible price (e.g., father’s tremor) would sharpen escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—capture the dawn hum before it vanishes—is signaled in paragraph 3. Escalation is purely density/cadence: the hum grows louder, her pencil accelerates, then fades. No option is foreclosed; she simply finishes. Cost is aesthetic, not tactical, keeping pressure moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—recover erased histories via story-fragments—is declared early but never narrowed; no beat risks failure, stamina, or social cost. Pressure is atmospheric (tide echo, towering stacks) rather than an option-closing tightening; the lens allows accumulative deepening, yet the page never shows a fragment that can’t be gathered or a memory that resists layering. Escalation is mood gradient only.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—decode the riddle—stays abstract; no concrete test or forfeiture is staged. Pressure is lyrical repetition, not rising cost. One meaningful tightening is attempted via crescendo of hums, but it amplifies mood without narrowing options. Agency is passive receptivity, not a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve city soul vs. privatization—is declared early and escalates via each new graffiti tag; options narrow to “united front.” Cost is visible: authority could erase the art, residents risk eviction. The chip’s tactile presence sharpens the felt price. Missing a single micro-loss (tool, arrest, time) keeps it from 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—document flora before it vanishes—is declared early but never tightens; no visible resource is risked or lost. Escalation is purely atmospheric (dawn light improves) rather than option-narrowing. Agency is observational: she takes photos on a schedule that never slips. No price is paid on the page; outlasting the night is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stake is single: make the drone fly true. Pressure tightens only once—final tweak while the anchor breaks surface—yet that moment is pure cadence shift rather than option foreclosure. No tangible price is extracted from Emilia; the risk is all off-stage reputation. Enough escalation to satisfy short-form, but not punching into higher cost band.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=4.0)
    A single dominant stake—reach the convergence—is announced early, but pressure never escalates: no ticking clock, no rival seeker, no physical jeopardy, no resource lost. The falcon’s return is folklore flavor, not an on-page constraint. The “worrying tranquility” stays flat; without a tightening beat that forecloses an option, the tension curve is horizontal.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stake—“restore shared balance”—is announced early but remains abstract; no concrete obstacle or opposing force ever endangers it. Escalation is a slow volume-knob turn: the rhythm “grew stronger, more insistent.” That single intensification is too smooth to tighten options or raise visible price, so pressure plateaus rather than spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“preserve the ephemeral or lose civilizational memory”—is signaled early and personal. Pressure tightens only once, at the crystal heart; prior beats are lyric reiterations rather than new costs. Protagonist agency is present yet single-gear; no secondary trade-off or visible price paid until final silence. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens but remains one-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—“chasing hush to own the story”—is declared early, yet escalation is tonal (density of whispers) not causal. No option narrows; no price is extracted. Situational pressure ok, but without beat-level trade-off the promised “before bodies” clock feels ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes remain tonal—unlocking flora resonance—without external jeopardy or resource limit; pressure is affective, not tactical. The single tightening is the bead-triggered glow, a beat that deepens mood more than it narrows options, satisfying the accumulative lens yet staying modest.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake—“remake broken world into hope”—is stated early but abstract. Escalation is tonal intensification (glow, silence, weight) rather than option-narrowing; no visible price or trade-off shapes tactics. Agency is passive: the pattern “emerged of its own accord.” Under Accumulative lens the deepening is present, yet lacks a felt forfeiture to reach 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—ancestral reconnection—is clear, but pressure is static: each paragraph restates the same emotional gain without new obstacle or forfeiture. The “tomb” offers wonder, not resistance; no credible loss of time, tool, or social credit complicates tactics. Escalation is therefore atmospheric, not functional, capping score in mid-5s.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.2)
    Dominant stake—nostalgic value of slow mail—is declared repeatedly but never tested or tightened; no live option is foreclosed, no price paid. Escalation is purely rhetorical intensifier (“a testament,” “a fusion”) without causal narrowing. Protagonist agency is purely descriptive; coincidence and static wonder substitute for pressure. Closure offers felt aura, not visible cost under the accumulative lens, capping score at mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—“listen for unheard stories before the coup”—is signaled early, but escalation is atmospheric, not tactical: shimmer intensifies, candle brightens, silence thickens. No on-page reversal narrows options; the embroiderer never faces a visible trade-off or failure. Cost is conceptual (imminent chaos), not felt through forfeiture or blocked path.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes—“uncover the truth behind the unsent letters”—stay abstract; no concrete consequence awaits failure. Pressure escalates only in volume: spirits sing louder, mist thickens, messages appear, apparition coalesces; none narrows Aria’s options or forces a trade-off. No reversal or deepening occurs; the beat structure is iterative description, not rising cost.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—“unknot my own anguish by decoding another’s”—is signaled early; tightening occurs when decrypted cast messages mirror her fears, forcing acknowledgement. Escalation is textural (pattern density) rather than causal reversal; cost is the emotional vertigo under anesthesia, but no visible forfeiture or blocked option materialises on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—recover lost joy—tightens when the fresco fragment confronts her with obsolete film; the exposed roll becomes the price she pays to transform abandonment into art. One meaningful deepening: film converted to shimmering curtain narrows her options—she can’t return to photography—foreclosing the path with visible material cost. No antagonist needed; pressure is situational/accumulative, coherent under chosen lens. Cost is legible on the page (“she packed up her easel”) and lingers in the reclaimed orchard.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—exchange certainty for curiosity—signaled early. Accumulative escalation via intensifying sound/color loops deepens stake without narrowing external options; no tangible loss or irreversible trade-off materializes. Protagonist agency is present (she aligns mirrors) but pressure is aesthetic rather than consequential. Cost is conceptual only; visible price absent keeps score sub-7.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stake—evade thought-tax—is declared early but never tested in scene: no inspector appears, no near-discovery, no ticking clock. Middle offers only a list of planting steps; no tightening or trade-off. Cost is postponed to an abstract future where seeds “carry the message forward,” so pressure stays ambient. Without on-page endangerment or price, escalation remains decorative rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—transmute pain into beauty—is declared early; pressure deepens only through accumulated imagery rather than narrowed options. No credible loss or reversible risk appears; the “armistice” is backstory, not live tension. Escalation is poetic density, not stakes; cost is lyrical assertion, not visible price, capping it below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stake is atmospheric preservation; pressure is static—no live option narrows, no tactic changes. The song’s echo intensifies mood but does not raise cost or risk failure. Escalation is lyrical density, not consequential tightening. The conflict remains an elegiac loop without visible price or irreversible turn.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single dominant stake—redeem professional trust via decipherment—signaled early. Escalation is ink running low + temporal “before paths diverge”; these tighten options but never force a trade-off that risks actual rejection on-page. Cost is mostly opportunity (ink gone, future isolation); no credible loss of reputation, money, or tool beyond the abstract. Agency resides in endurance/renunciation (Earned Stasis), which fits situational lens, yet price stays conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—“preserve vs. safety”—is declared early but never tightened; no scene forces Kaelin to risk either value. Escalation is purely accumulative: repeated breathing-stone imagery and waxing sentiment, but no because/therefore linkage narrows her options. The encrypted message reveals “compassion and unity,” yet this discovery triggers no visible trade-off or price. Under Accumulative lens, a single pattern-deepening is present, yet absence of on-page cost keeps pressure abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake = self-forgiveness vs exposure; pressure is ambient (threat never specified). No tightening beat: tension flatlines at “paper trails blurred,” never narrows options or tests secrecy. Agency is contemplative—dust watching—rather than risk-taking; closure re-weights interiorly but no lived cost is paid on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stake—decode thresholds—stays abstract; no concrete test or forfeiture is staged; the logbook points the way but never risks loss or miscue, so pressure plateaus rather than tightens; reunion arrives as soft confirmation, not narrowed option.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“find belonging/rhythm”—stays diffuse; no external obstacle raises the price. Pressure is aesthetic (darkness, echo) rather than causal; the only tightening is the dawn clock, but sunrise does not force a trade-off, merely ends the vigil. No visible loss or resource spent; astrologer exits unchanged except for mood. Consequently escalation is present as cadence shift, yet cost remains conceptual, not visceral, keeping score solid but sub-8.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—“why paths disappear”—is signaled early and deepened by symbol-decoding, a meaningful Accumulative tightening. Yet the cost is purely conceptual; no live option is foreclosed, no tool lost, no path denied to her. Agency is observational: she “deciphers” rather than risks; tension accumulates but never crystallizes into a trade-off. The cheerful gloom tone modulates, but the emotional price stays off-page, capping escalation below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake is declared early: “captivate / serenade monotony.” Pressure never escalates—audience remains faceless, no heckler, no dropped card, no tide that might swallow the stage. The “meaningful tightening” is rhetorical (“heavier bishop”) rather than an option foreclosed. Thus escalation is textural repetition, not rising risk.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single dominant stake—capture cosmic verse on skin—is signaled early; tension accumulates via repetition of “gaps” and star-whispers rather than causal reversals. Mid-text deepening occurs when moonstone glow intensifies, narrowing her dance to stillness; this is the meaningful intensification required for lyric mode. Price is atmospheric, not tactical; no option is foreclosed and no resource lost, so escalation stays modest.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake—“capture the essence before everything shifts”—is declared early but remains abstract; no concrete consequence follows if she fails. The stone-cast ripple supplies a micro-turn that intensifies attention, yet it does not narrow her options or exact a visible price. Pressure plateaus at wonder; tension never escalates to trade-off or loss. Closure reconfigures meaning, not circumstance, keeping stakes literary rather than jeopardous.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake: convert private fire trauma into universal message. Pressure is internal—memory flashes increase density rather than narrow external options. One meaningful deepening: mirror confrontation reweights pain from burden to vocation. No external reversal or resource loss, so escalation feels lyrical not causal; cost is emotional resonance not tangible consequence. sufficient for short lyric mode but not high-band tension.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—“puzzle out new equations for hope”—stays abstract; no concrete risk or loss is attached. Pressure is static: arranging shells never tightens options, and the vision merely reiterates possibility. Under an Accumulative lens, the expected pattern-break or cadence shift never arrives; the final smile resets tension without cost. Escalation is absent, capping the score well below the 8.8 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—preserve crumbling estate memory—emerges late, signaled only after film/diaries discovered; earlier tension is diffuse. One meaningful tightening: half-burned diaries force cartographer to shoulder storyteller role, narrowing options from observer to keeper. Cost is conceptual (lifetime stewardship) rather than tangible; price legible but not viscerally felt on page. Agency remains observational; no irrevocable act forecloses retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: will the mirrors reveal hidden futures? Pressure escalates only atmospherically—colors deepen, bells approach—without narrowing options or forcing a trade-off. The protagonist’s tactics never change; she keeps humming and painting at the same tempo. Escalation is textural (density of color/music) rather than causal, adequate for short lyric mode but not viscerally costly.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—broker peace—never tightens; declared abstractly, it is neither tested nor sharpened into a trade-off. No beat shows Elian risking credibility, time, or physical safety; pressure remains atmospheric rather than tactical. The celestial “slow dance” offers lyric cadence but does not force stance crystallization or option foreclosure. Escalation is therefore decorative, not functional under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—restore life vs. powerful drought interests—is declared early; pressure heightens once as thunder’s lull tightens the release window. Agency is the single gesture of opening sluice/berm using the crack-map; no visible opposition or resource loss, so cost is atmospheric, not tactical. Escalation is poetic density—storm swell, egg fragility, cracked lines—rather than option-narrowing. Sufficient for 600-word lyric mode, but lacks a tangible price that forecloses future moves.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—freedom vs. conformity—signaled in paragraph 3 and escalates via density increase: each untangled thread releases real echoes that compress inside the prism. One meaningful tightening at the final thread; options narrow to irreversible change. Cost is visible: prism lights, then dims—power is spent, serenity becomes “alarming.” No coin-flip resolution; her agency drives the unlock. Could push higher if an earlier beat showed a concrete social consequence (lost client? scandal?) rather than abstract “expectation.”

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.2)
    Single stake—subvert narrative ethics—is declared, never tested; no tightening or price appears. Pressure is ambient (“eerie calm”) rather than option-narrowing; she never risks failure, loss, or contradiction. Because no beat forces a decision, escalation is static. Closure reweights meaning, not stakes, so Conflict score stays mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=4.7)
    Stake is abstract: “honor overlooked histories.” No external or internal opposition surfaces, no ticking clock, no visible price. Escalation is replaced by static contemplation; tension plateaus at wonder. The only micro-turn—wing lands, she knots—doesn’t narrow options or deepen knowledge; it merely continues the mood.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—“why do paths choose their walkers?”—is announced early but remains philosophical; no external or internal force threatens to close off that question. Pressure is atmospheric (storm) and intellectual (decaying directive) rather than actionable: Hindsight never faces a fork where getting the answer costs something tangible. The dream sequence deepens imagery without narrowing options; knowledge accumulates but does not escalate risk. Consequently the tension curve is flat until the lyrical tagline, producing a contemplative rather than conflictual arc.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—cosmic covenant—declared early, but pressure is atmospheric, not tactical; no option is foreclosed. Escalation is textural accumulation of dusk and starlight rather than a tightening that costs the astronomer anything tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—can resentment be unknotted without fight—is signaled in para 2 and tightened once: when the melody swells, Elara must decide whether to channel it into persuasion or let it pass untested. That single fork is enough at this length; the choice to speak costs her the safety of mere witness and forecloses the option of anonymity. No antagonist appears, but the aggregate faces of anger serve as coherent pressure. Cost is conceptual yet legible: the pin stays broken, proving harmony is purchased through permanent fracture, not repair.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—“capture the runaway dream”—is clear, yet pressure plateaus rather than tightens; each paragraph adds lyric density but no new risk or forfeiture. The mirror’s completion is never threatened; synchronized breathing works on first attempt. Because no live option is foreclosed and no visible price is paid (no cracked glass, no breath falter, no self-loss signaled as loss), escalation stays atmospheric, not consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—restoring generational contract through orchard—is declared early, yet pressure stays flat. Seeds sprout off-page; visitors arrive by summary; no tightening forces Elara to risk anything tangible. Escalation is observational, not agency-driven; coincidence (Aria’s return) delivers resolution without on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stake—“pursue forbidden knowledge”—is declared but never tested; no tangible price or foreclosed option appears. Pressure plateaus: humming grows louder but curator simply walks forward without resistance or trade-off. Escalation is atmospheric, not consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.1)
    Dominant stake—reach the library—is declared early but never tightened; the shadowy pursuers exert no on-page pressure beyond being mentioned. No credible loss (time, safety, social credit) alters tactics; the diary is found exactly where convenient. The single “renegotiation” is summarized in one sentence, so no narrowing of options or felt price surfaces. Escalation is flat; coincidence (hidden door revealed by simply pushing a shelf) resolves rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes—“find the Garden”—are declared early but remain abstract; no tangible price is risked or lost. Pressure accumulates atmospherically (thickening fog, creaking ship) rather than through narrowing options. The single micro-turn is the card drop, yet it prompts only reflection, not action. Escalation is atmospheric, not consequential; cost is asserted, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—“translate confusion into clarity”—stays abstract; no concrete consequence of failure or narrowing of options appears. Pressure is atmospheric (vibrating air, louder ticking) rather than causal; Emilia risks no loss, deadline, or competing obligation. The single “tightening” is the rope re-braid, but it is initiated and explained by the professor, not demanded by Emilia’s prior choice. Escalation is therefore observational, not agency-driven, keeping cost legible only at the conceptual level.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“find the quiet in the storm”—is signaled early and tightens through pattern accumulation rather than external opposition. Pressure escalates as crack patterns shift, forcing her to refine attention; the bloom’s arrival forecloses the option to leave the caves untended. Cost is conceptual but legible: lifelong vigilance exchanged for momentary hush. Agency is interior and observational, fitting the accumulative lens; a more visceral price (hearing loss, frost-nip) would have pushed this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake—“uncover hidden pattern”—is declared early but never tested; no reversal or resource lost. Shard and orrery yield answers without resistance; escalation is purely atmospheric brightening. Protagonist’s agency is receptive touching, not active problem-solving; coincidence is celebrated, not interrogated. No visible price alters later options, so pressure plateaus.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—“sculpt identity from collective memory”—is declared early but never tested by opposing pressure. No option is foreclosed; no visible price is paid. Escalation is atmospheric deepening, not tightening; the storm clears without forcing a tactical shift. The lyrical intensification is beautiful, yet stakes remain abstract, felt only as mood.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—defy creative despair—is signaled early; pressure accumulates via sensory density rather than external opposition. No reversal or forfeited option occurs; the mosaic note offers confirmation, not complication. Escalation is atmospheric deepening (dusk→night), not option-narrowing; cost remains conceptual, not visible. Sufficient for short lyric mode but below the tightening required for 8+ bands.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake is epistemic—will she grasp the texture of time inside this pause—but it remains cerebral, never tightened by an external test or forfeiture. Pressure is ambient: the couple’s unresolved conversation is scenery, not a threat that narrows her options. No visible price is exacted; her vigil ends at sunrise unchanged except in mood. Escalation is therefore atmospheric, not tactical.</answer>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade>
    <comment>Theme emerges organically: transition as lived suspension is rendered through sensory particulars, not thesis. Cicada, starlight, and dripping water quietly braid into a single motif of cyclical change; final image of dawn re-prices the night’s stillness without moralizing. The piece invites reflection on observant passivity itself as valid stance—complex ambiguity intact. Lost top tier because the insight remains general, not sharpened by a specific personal loss.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: will Eli harvest enough silence-flavor to dilute claustrophobia before gravity re-normalizes? Stakes tighten when the doll is let go—an irreversible micro-wager that the hush will return it. Cost is the risk of permanent panic if the experiment fails; the floating stillness makes that risk legible. No antagonist needed; pressure is situational-coherent, and the hourglass of inversion supplies the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—can silence be taught to comfort?—is declared early, but pressure remains static; no moment forces the operator to risk failure or recalibrate. Escalation is lyrical accumulation (hush deepens) rather than a narrowing of options. Because no visible cost is exacted, the stake stays conceptual; the reader feels no jeopardy. The absence of a reversible beat or forfeiture keeps the score mid-band.</answer>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
    <comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as active balm, not mere absence. The final image of silence breathing with the water reconfigures the concept without moralizing. Subtext resides in gesture—the residents’ gratitude, the vial’s hypnotic swirl—rather than exposition. The idea is delicate and non-didactic, but its lightness skirts the deeper moral complexity that would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stake is signaled early—reclaim throne—and sunrise supplies a ticking clock, but pressure stays atmospheric; no resource dwindles, no rule tightens. The murals deepen lore, not dilemma; ascension is never endangered by her own error or external opposition. Escalation is scenic (discovery of stair) rather than strategic; the final ascent costs nothing and narrows no future path.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.0)
    Dominant stake—“fulfill the quantum promise”—stays abstract; no visible price tightens options. Pressure escalates only as off-screen machine “build-up,” then instantly resolves into free diamonds. Lyra’s volunteer act alters no tactic; she is passive conduit, not agent. Cost is neither felt nor conceptual, so the required tightening under Accumulative lens never lands.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.2)
    The dominant stake—“uncover a hidden truth”—stays abstract; no concrete risk or forfeiture is attached. Escalation is recursive: each crank turn produces the same hum-louder-vision loop without tightening options. The standing waves are decorative, not a pressure mechanism that forecloses a path. Cost is absent; the protagonist exits peaceful, unchanged in circumstance.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes (“capture the shape of possibility”) stay abstract; no concrete forfeiture is risked or paid. Pressure escalates only atmospherically—light shifts, trees move—without narrowing the knight’s options or forcing a trade-off. The single micro-choice (unsnap) is initiatory, not climactic; consequence is cosmic but costless to him.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake “magnify small kindnesses” is declared early; pressure is textural—dust layers deepen, stories accumulate—rather than causal. One meaningful deepening: she moves from random box to deliberate sanctuary. No visible price or option foreclosure on-page; escalation is atmospheric. Fits Accumulative lens but lacks tangible cost that alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—resist erasure of history—is declared early but never tested on-page; no tangible consequence if she fails. Pressure plateaus: authorities stay off-stage, gathering proceeds undisturbed. One soft tightening: dawn approaching, yet no clock-forced decision or trade-off surfaces. Escalation is atmospheric, not tactical; cost remains conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—“will music silence prophecy?”—is announced early but never materially tested; prophecy remains off-stage and produces no counter-pressure. Escalation is purely textural (mist thickens, light grows) rather than a narrowing of options or knowledge. No visible price is exacted from the protagonist; peace arrives as atmosphere, not earned trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—“decode the message hidden within the falling leaves”—is signaled early and tightens once when the speck brightens to reveal the hidden leaf pattern. The escalation is a single, gentle intensification rather than a narrowing of options; no visible price is exacted on the page, so the pressure stays lyric rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—“find direction in a shifting world”—is signaled early but remains abstract; no concrete resource is risked or lost. Escalation is poetic, not tactical: the compass glows, leaves swirl, device hums—all texture, no narrowing of external options. Agency is present in the improvisation beat, but the only “cost” is accepting uncertainty, which feels internal and already embraced. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, yet stays light—one deepening, no trade-off with teeth.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—self-redemption through alchemical understanding—tightens once when the coin redirects her attention from failure to possibility; no further narrowing occurs, but the pressure stays coherent. Cost is visible in months of labor and the residue of “luminous regret,” though the escalation is more textural intensification than causal reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are intimate—one soul’s release—but escalation is flat; no live alternative path is foreclosed, no price exacted from the collector. Pressure exists but never tightens; the beat is ritual, not reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are declared early—“unfasten the anchors…release the secrets”—but on-page pressure is atmospheric, not tactical. The single meaningful tightening is spotting the tiny figure in the painting; it shifts her attention rather than closing an option. No credible loss (money, social credit, bodily risk) is dramatized, so cost stays conceptual. The lens fragment complicates but never endangers, keeping escalation within the mild band suitable for lyric accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are floated but never tightened: “stories to uncover” is an abstract wish, not a concrete liability that can rise or fall. No reversible choice or resource loss occurs; Ezra never risks safety, time, or money. The single micro-turn—finding the logbook—adds knowledge without narrowing options; pressure plateaus. Closure does not crystallize cost under Accumulative lens, because nothing materially changes in her world.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes—“compress eternity into a moment”—are announced early but remain philosophical; no concrete resource is risked or lost. Escalation is accretive: each print adds density until the air itself “charges.” This deepening satisfies the lens, yet the lack of a visible price keeps pressure intellectual rather than visceral. One meaningful tightening occurs at the golden light crescendo, but options don’t narrow—only meanings do.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—prove her civilisation theory—signalled early. One meaningful tightening: storm + time-visibility ratchet the unseen surveillance pressure, narrowing her options to ‘work on’ or surrender. Cost is time/stamina rather than a foreclosed path; no credible loss of reputation, tool, or data. Agency is internal (endurance) which fits situational lens; escalation is atmospheric, not causally irreversible. Fits 600-word allowance but stays mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—“reclaim the light stolen by midnight”—is declared early but never tested; no visible price or narrowing options. Escalation is textural (glow brightens, whispers deepen) rather than causal; tension plateaus until the note simply appears. No reversal or trade-off is dramatized on Erebus.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake—“find where explanations fail”—is declared early, yet pressure never tightens; each paragraph restates wonder without narrowing options or raising price. No reversal or trade-off occurs; the compass simply leads and she obeys. The ancient symbols complicate nothing—they decode instantly into the same transcendence already promised. Closure is a static epiphany, not an escalation, so the required felt cost under the Hybrid lens is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake (“unlock the secrets”) is declared, yet slide never resists or demands sacrifice; tension is cerebral. Single micro-turn: slide discovery narrows focus, but no subsequent trade-off or visible price. Escalation quoted, not felt: “creative energies surging” is summary, not on-page obstacle. Closure lacks persistent constraint; sculpture costs nothing.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—comprehension of night-bloom—tightens when cathedral glass offers an alternative epistemology that discolors her former bright style; the trade-off is legible. Escalation is textural: successive paragraphs desaturate hue and sound, culminating in the hush she chooses to preserve. Agency consists of attention and aesthetic renunciation rather than external confrontation, appropriate to accumulative design. Cost is conceptual (loss of chromatic identity) rather than visceral; still sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stakes are declared—“search for truth,” “secrets waiting”—but never specified or tested; no visible price (time, risk, social credit) is exacted across the beats. Pressure is ambient awe, not escalating constraint; the parley imparts information off-stage and Naomi leaves with the same goal intact. A single meaningful tightening or trade-off is absent, so escalation plateaus at ornamental curiosity.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—reimagining a civilization—remains abstract; no external or internal obstacle ever threatens it on-page. Pressure is declarative (“the task was daunting”) but static; neither time, resource, nor opposition tightens. Because no visible price is risked or paid here, escalation is rhetorical rather than operative under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—control over meaning-making via archiving—tightens when the act of recording flips the patterns into autonomous prophecy. One meaningful deepening: the scribe realizes the garden’s emotions are now “alive” and uncontainable. Cost is conceptual but felt: loss of archival mastery, future city now hostage to unreadable feelings. No secondary stake, so spread is limited; still, the single stake escalates cleanly under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake—“preserve cyclical balance”—is declared early but stays abstract; no concrete resource, relationship, or rule is jeopardized. Escalation is atmospheric (visions intensify) rather than causal, so pressure feels decorative; the “tightening” is a lyric crescendo, not an option-narrowing turn, leaving cost legibility weak.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—beauty of listening vs. duty of warning—is declared early but never tested by an opposing force or tangible loss. Escalation is a gentle accumulation of bell tones, not a tightening that forecloses options; the sirens remain functional and available, so the shift is elective. No visible price is paid, keeping pressure mild under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=3.7)
    No escalation: pressure is ambient, not rising. Stakes are declared—“find strength in vulnerability”—yet never tested by an on-page dilemma or trade-off. The janitor’s sweeping continues unchanged; the stars impose no cost. Coincidence-level calm prevails; no option is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—preserve the unspoken words—is signaled early and tightens once: the box opens, letters release, ghosts press close, options narrow to “read or retreat.” The protagonist’s agency is the act of reading that forecloses retreat; the cost is the sorrow that now permanently inhabits them. Under Accumulative lens, the cadence shift from hush to hum to dispersal constitutes meaningful intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—can meaning be re-stitched in a numberless world—stays coherent. Escalation is textural: each garage-sale message adds density, the capsule’s reveal tightens the pattern. No live option is foreclosed; risk remains intellectual rather than visceral, capping intensity. Agency is attention, not jeopardy—sufficient for accumulative mode but not grippingly costly.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—discover beauty in imperfection—is declared, not pressure-tested. No tightening reverses her options; escalation is atmospheric (mist lifting, kite lost) rather than decision-forcing. The single micro-turn is the feather’s arrival, which inspires but does not complicate. Agency stays observational; cost is contemplative, not tactical—adequate for lyric mode but sub-7 for conflict-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.6)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding the chemistry of homecoming—is declared early and returns as an atmospheric yearning rather than a tested dilemma. Pressure accumulates through sensory thickening, not narrowing options; no concrete trade-off or forfeiture occurs. The entity’s gaze is serene, not adversarial, so escalation is poetic density, not causal jeopardy. Cost is conceptual, felt in the final image, but not tethered to a visible price paid by the skeptic.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are declared—life versus desolation—but no opposing force or internal doubt ever tests them; pressure remains static. The single beat of scattering seeds neither narrows options nor raises cost; escalation is absent under an Accumulative lens. Coincidence is avoided, yet so is agency under strain. Without a meaningful tightening, the conflict reads as thematic backdrop rather than lived jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“find the spring to revive the wasteland”—is declared late but coherent. One meaningful tightening: riddle forces phonograph re-examination, narrowing search path. Cost is implied (long walk, thirst) rather than dramatized; spring discovery feels fortunate, not purchased by irreversible loss. Agency stays with Lyra/Kael, so escalation holds under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake: convert disorientation into purposeful motion. Pressure is atmospheric—silence, starlight, compass glow—rather than option-narrowing; no resource is lost or path foreclosed. The single “tightening” is the alignment of compass and distant light, a poetic rather than tactical narrowing. Cost is conceptual, not visceral; acceptable under Accumulative lens but keeps score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stakes—“sky is wrong and reality frays”—are declared cosmic, but on-page pressure is purely atmospheric: no personal loss, ticking clock, or antagonistic force emerges. The single “tightening” is the shiver that runs through the spire after the swap, a sensory intensifier, not an option-closer. Moonwhisper’s agency is ceremonial; risk is mentioned (“path fraught with danger”) but never dramatized. Escalation accrues texture, not cost.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—filling the leadership/interpretive void—surfaces early and tightens once when the alliance forms, narrowing options from standoff to collaborative walking. The cost is conceptual (embracing luminous absence) rather than visceral; escalation is lyric deepening, not rising external threat, adequate for 600-word lyric mode but lacking visible price that alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—unlock forgotten truth via stone—is signaled early. One meaningful deepening: visions reveal post-memory pain, narrowing options to “seed a new reality.” Agency sits with the seer, but cost is conceptual, not visceral. Escalation is textural (glow, thunder, shadow coalescence) rather than a forced trade-off.</answer>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—memory as wound, home as crafted reality—emerges through imagery, never sermonized. The stone’s shift from relic to catalyst reweights meaning. Subtext lingers in “hidden thunder,” inviting reflection. Ambiguity is purposeful, avoiding tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates because each decoded thread narrows his moral options: continue self-loathing or face the labyrinth. The labyrinth walk externalizes escalating pressure; each reflection forces stance crystallization under Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is felt: “weight of guilt slowly lifting” implies ebbing emotional debt. No external antagonist needed; the internal conflict is tested and foreclosed by his decision to leave the labyrinth renewed.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stake—“Can she uncover the truth of forgiveness before the ritual?”—is declared early. Pressure escalates only texturally: each poem refracts the mist denser, but no live option is foreclosed; her tactics never change, no tool is lost, no cost is visibly paid. The “tightening” is a repeated sensory crescendo rather than a narrowed path. Closure offers cognitive shift, not a trade-off, so the escalation feels like accumulation without bite.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—decode statue or suffocate—is signaled early; oxygen debt provides a live countdown. Tightening is single-track: each match burns air, but no reversal or trade-off complicates the path; success is linear. Cost is visceral (near blackout) yet predictable; the absence of an error or pattern mis-match flattens escalation. Under Accumulative lens, density increase is sufficient, but option-foreclosure never surprises.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—capture fleeting beauty vs. keep inner promise—surfaces early, but pressure plateaus: the cave discovery drops external opposition and the final beat is serene completion rather than trade-off. No visible price is paid on-page; the tightening is poetic, not tactical, capping escalation short of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake—“prove whispers travel farther”—is announced but never tested against external resistance; no live option is foreclosed. Pressure is atmospheric (sweetness, longing) rather than tactical; no visible price is paid or lost. The single “beckon” gesture is ceremonial, not a turn that narrows choices. Escalation is perfume density, not stake-driven causality; hence mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—“reverse migration through grief’s map”—is signaled early and narrows to the dawn plain where forward motion stops, a credible tightening. Agency is mostly receptive: follow calls, follow moon; a single active cartographic beat (discarding an outdated map, marking soil) would raise pressure. Stakes stay internal; no external jeopardy or resource lost, so cost is conceptual rather than visceral. Meets 600-word bar but lacks palpable price that alters next action.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—tempering involuntary honesty to reclaim psychological safety—is signaled early; pressure tightens when discredited cures are found. Yet the occlusion act itself is off-stage; we read “they began to experiment” rather than witnessing a moment where options narrow or cost is paid, so escalation is present but muffled.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake—“will Kael decode the gesture?”—is announced early but never tightens; no reversal or cost materializes. Pressure is atmospheric (mist, solitude) not causal; the stranger leaves on his own schedule. No visible price is paid by Kael, so the 8-band entry gate remains locked.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—fulfill father’s promise—signals early; pressure escalates through pattern accumulation (ants, map, doorway) rather than causal reversals, coherent with Accumulative lens. One visible tightening: receding flowers → exposed chamber forces final stance crystallization. Creek clock is decorative—“now swollen, now receding” marks beats but never truncates action or alters tactics; cost is conceptual (heritage found) not visceral. Agency present but mild—she obeys ant guides, complies with map puzzle; no trade-off or resource lost, keeping score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.0)
    Single dominant stake—penetrate the grotto to solve dreams—is signaled early but never tightened; the climb is atmospheric, not option-narrowing. No visible price (fatigue, injury, social loss) is logged; “trepidation” is repeated but does not alter tactics. Coincidence is avoided, yet escalation is purely descriptive intensifier (“darkness seemed to grow thicker”) rather than agency-forced trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.1)
    Stake is announced as “unlock secrets” but never tightens: each observation simply confirms beauty without falsifying a theory or costing a resource. No reversal or trade-off occurs; the shell cooperates the moment she looks “differently.” Pressure is ambient, not adversarial. Escalation plateaus at wonder; the whispered phrase complicates nothing.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—turn feral nostalgia into narrative—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates via dream density, yet no middle beat narrows options or exacts a price; the creative act itself never faces a trade-off, so escalation remains atmospheric rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—can she still practice her art without smell—never escalates; the answer is comfortingly “yes” from the start. Pressure is atmospheric, not tactical; no client, deadline, or self-doubt intervenes. The only deepening is fog lifting, which reveals rather than constricts options. Cost is elegiac, not tactical, so the tightening is gentle—enough for lyric but not for high-stakes band.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—transforming personal scars into written stories—is signaled early. Pressure escalates only once, when rune-whispers catalyze the writing surge; this is an external nudge rather than a narrowing of internal options. No visible price is extracted (no ink shortage, no platform lurch that endangers parchment). The closure reweights meaning but the protagonist’s agency is reactive, not a trade-off under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake—deliver apology—is declared but never opposed; Astra’s possible refusal is never entertained, so pressure is static. No meaningful tightening occurs; the orchard countdown is ornamental—time neither compresses nor changes Lyra’s tactics. Cost is absent: the bottle yields power without price, and the apology transmission succeeds on first attempt. Under Accumulative lens, the motif density grows, but without a trade-off or narrowing of options, escalation remains intellectual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are announced—“unify the fragmented truths”—yet never narrow to a single irreversible choice. Pressure plateaus; each paragraph re-describes the same stillness instead of escalating risk or deepening knowledge. The “universe’s hiccup” is atmospheric, not a clock that forecloses options. No visible price is extracted from Aria, so the tightening required for 8.0+ never arrives.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—“understand what clocks measure”—is signaled early but never narrowed into a testable dilemma; tension stays contemplative. Pressure accumulates via iterative dawn/ticking cycles, yet each iteration restates the same serenity rather than deepening risk. The shepherd’s agency is purely observational; no moment forces a renunciation or trade-off. Consequently, escalation is atmospheric, not tactical; the final image reconfirms rather than re-weights the status quo.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme of time’s unknowability emerges through iterated quiet rather than asserted thesis, avoiding overt moralizing. The backwards-counting conceit gestures toward conceptual depth but never re-enters the final image with new resonance, so the idea remains ornamental. No concrete particular reconfigures meaning at closure; the dawn light is lovely but generic. Subtext stays consistently whispered, yet the whisper never acquires unforeseen weight.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding permeable barriers—is declared early, but pressure stays cognitive; no concrete test or narrowing of options occurs. Escalation is textural: repetition of dusk walks, accumulating silhouettes, glow intensifying at dawn. No visible price is paid (time, social credit, physical risk); the breakthrough feels gifted rather than earned. Coincidence (sunrise sync with insight) complicates rather than resolves, acceptable under Accumulative lens, but cost legibility is low.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stake—father’s survival via probabilistic reframing—is clear early. Pressure escalates once: graffiti line reframes certainty as shadow, deepening Elara’s tactical shift. Cost is conceptual (illusion of control exposed), but because the father remains off-page, the price is vicarious; tension never tightens around a live choice for her, capping intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=3.5)
    No dominant stake is ever threatened or narrowed; wrong-number calls provide comforting stasis, not escalation. The loop deepens affection but never forces trade-offs, losses, or irreversible turns—pressure remains flat under an Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.5)
    Dominant stake—“preserve small moments”—is declared early but never tested by competing demand; no resource, risk, or ticking clock complicates it. Middle consists of iterative noticing, not tightening. Thus escalation is purely atmospheric; no visible price or foreclosed option appears on page. Meets short-form minimum (one deepening) but lacks pressure legible under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—“cure loneliness”—is declared early, but on-page pressure is collective, not individual: Raven’s own ache never faces a test or trade-off. No meaningful tightening; the rumor chain spreads unimpeded. Stakes spread thin across the crowd, diluting visceral risk. Closure reweights community, but protagonist’s personal cost is off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—emotional navigation of grief—is signaled early and tightens through sensory intensification rather than external opposition. No reversal or trade-off narrows options; escalation is purely textural (louder notes, thicker air). The stillpoint revelation reweights internal knowledge but does not foreclose a path or demand sacrifice, so cost is conceptual, not felt. Agency is limited to attentive walking; protagonist remains largely receptive.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—control over narrative/history—is signaled early; escalation is the pen’s gradual reactivation under anomaly pressure, tightening options from passive interpretation to active authorship. Agency visible: unbending nib, mixing celestial ink, writing new page. Cost is conceptual—once she writes, she accepts responsibility for edited realities—but not viscerally felt; hence stays below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—translation of silence into audible memory—is signaled early and deepens through the advisor’s conducting gestures; one meaningful tightening occurs when the crowd’s hush becomes the final instrument, foreclosing private communion. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: public sharing dilutes intimate silence. Escalation is accumulative density, not causal reversal; sufficient for lyric mode but lacks visible price on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—preserving the promise—signals early, but pressure escalates only texturally: each new artwork adds semantic weight rather than narrowing practical options. No credible loss (time, material, capture risk) is dramatized; the only “cost” is symbolic workload. The deepening is aesthetic, not tactical, so escalation feels gentle rather than urgent; still, the pattern break at the hidden alcove suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—“breathe life into a shared dream”—is declared early but never tested by failure or sacrifice; escalation is purely atmospheric (glow brightens, then dims). The only tightening is the lagoon’s inevitable fade; Aria’s agency remains observational drumming rather than a trade-off that forecloses an option. Cost is conceptual, not tactile, keeping pressure lyrical rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=2.9)
    No escalation: the stake (“whispers > shouts”) is declared but never tested under pressure; the stranger’s whisper is happenstance, not a narrowing of options. No visible price is paid or foreclosed; tension flatlines. The storm rages outside but never leaks into tactics or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stakes are atmospheric (“will the pattern reach the guardian?”) rather than personal; no option is foreclosed for either character. Agency is one-way: figure acts, guardian receives; no reciprocal pressure. Escalation is purely density-of-image; no cost or tactic shifts. Closure is mood-crystallization, not consequence, so pressure plateaus rather than tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stake—“plant forests of second thoughts”—is announced but never materially threatened; no time, reputation, or safety is risked. Tension plateaus: townspeople pause, look, then are “bathed in contemplation”; the display succeeds without counter-pressure. Single micro-turn (seeing cryptic passage) triggers no trade-off or deepening; options only widen. Cost is rhetorical (“weight of the world”) rather than dramatized, failing the visible-price threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—freedom via self-shedding—is signaled early; pressure escalates through sensory densification rather than causal twists. The whale’s call complicates but does not resolve; Kael’s final swim is agency-driven renunciation with visible bodily cost (darkness envelops, past detaches). Because escalation is textural—volume, glow, song—rather than tactical, the tightening is present but not option-narrowing; the price is atmospheric, not concrete. Still, the accumulative pattern cleanly reweights the premise, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is whether Echo’s narrations can keep grief manageable; pressure accumulates via bouquet’s return and narration’s rising longing. No external antagonist or reversal, only densification—valid under accumulative lens. The “remade hush” moment reweights options (silence now chosen) but the cost is oblique; we see no concrete forfeiture (time, tool, social credit). Consequently the tightening is felt but not vividly priced on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—artistic transcendence—signaled early and escalates through density increase rather than external opposition. The meaningful tightening is the surrender to the quartz pulse, which narrows options to total immersion; cost is the irreversible dissolution of prior aesthetic boundaries, felt in the final luminous image. Agency is lyric and internal, appropriate to accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake—celebrating imperfection—is declared early but never tested; no reversal, resource loss, or narrowed option results from it. Pressure is decorative: “artisans and visitors alike drawn” is summary, not an on-page obstacle. The reed’s arrival sparks no consequential choice; the glassblower’s shift to imperfection is effortless. No visible price paid; escalation is iterative description rather than rising cost.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—revive creative joy—is signalled early; escalation is textural (curtains brighten, mood lifts) rather than option-narrowing. No tangible price or risk is dramatized; success feels inevitable. The single “tightening” is the curtains reaching peak glow, but it complicates nothing—merely confirms success. Meets 600-800 word threshold for one meaningful intensification, but lacks visible cost that alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—mapping lost cultural patterns—remains abstract; no concrete risk, time limit, or resource loss tightens across the sequence. Pressure is ambient (“world outside struggled”) but never narrows her options or forces a trade-off under the Accumulative lens. The single “tightening” is a shift from night to dawn, not an escalation of cost or knowledge. Closure therefore lacks a felt price, capping escalation in the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are announced (“forbidden knowledge”) but never tested: no guard challenges her, no manuscript is damaged, no time or social cost accrues. The pagoda’s “purification” is handed over freely; the only escalation is the intensity of adjectives describing the vision. No option is foreclosed, no price is paid on-page, and coincidence (colleague arrives unbidden) drives the turn. Under the accumulative lens, a single intensifying image is permissible, but without a felt cost the pressure feels abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—“preserve the shape of hope”—is declared early; pressure deepens via footage-revealed disconnection and the shadow’s creep. No visible price is exacted from her; the cost remains conceptual (world losing its way) rather than personal loss or foreclosed option. Escalation is textural: density of shadow imagery tightens the mood, but agency stays contemplative. Enough for mid-band, but lacks a beat where hope’s endangerment narrows her choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can she keep compassion while stripping dogma?—tightens once via the chameleon’s fragility: its tail in her hand forces her to feel the brittleness of her own creed. Escalation is textural: each “shed” paragraph subtracts certainty, adds humidity, narrows options until only quiet poise remains. Visible cost is the forfeited old conviction, felt on page (“she wondered if she had been blind”), though no external loss complicates tactics. Sufficient for this length, but a second tightening beat would push it past 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—learn to read scars—is declared early; pressure escalates via accumulative density (digging, whispers, coffee-ring augury) rather than a tightening fork. No visible price is exacted on Elian: stamina, injury, or tool-loss are absent, so cost remains conceptual. The final image reweights meaning but does not foreclose a live option; hence the score stays below 7.0. Plant-telepathy, though named, supplies no obstacle or adaptation, leaving pressure one-note.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—“find where unused love is stored”—is declared early but never pressured; no option is foreclosed, no price is paid. Escalation is replaced by accumulation of letter-images, each re-stating the same ache. The sole turn is passive transport into the letter-realm; the gazer never acts to alter or claim anything. Consequently the conflict is decorative, not causal, and the cost is atmospheric rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake—freeing creativity—is declared early but never pressured by external obstacle or internal trade-off. Escalation is tonal (aurora brightens) rather than causal; no option is narrowed, no price exacted. The “unwritten calendar” promises ticking urgency yet remains abstract; meteor timing doesn’t force a critical moment. Resolution is atmospheric release, not earned reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—cultivate hidden sparks—is announced early but remains abstract; no concrete resource is risked or forfeited. Pressure is atmospheric rather than narrowing: the dune glows brighter, the archive hums, but Asa’s options do not shrink. The one micro-turn—restart the clock—unlocks harmony, not complication, so escalation runs backward into wonder rather than forward into cost. Without a visible price paid on the page, the conflict stays lyric, not stakes-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=3.6)
    Stake—“unravel the mysteries of translocation”—stays abstract; no external obstacle or ticking clock materializes. Pressure is static: the hum simply grows louder; philosopher keeps walking and listening without trade-off or reversal. Escalation is textural repetition, not option-narrowing; no beat forces a decision that costs him anything. Coincidence substitutes for agency: insight arrives because the gear vibrates, not because he risks or forfeits.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes—“find unused courage”—stay abstract; no concrete test or loss confronts the travelers. Escalation is atmospheric (mist thickens, dawn approaches) rather than causal. The vigil moment deepens mood but does not foreclose an option or exact a price.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake: “Is silence worth safety?” is declared early but remains static; no tightening event forces a live choice. Pressure is ambient—snow, stillness, slow nerve-healing—rather than causal; the bolt-tightening stranger supplies a micro-turn yet shares no stakes with bellhop. Escalation is lyrical accumulation, not option-narrowing. Closure reweights silence conceptually, yet no visible cost is risked or paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—prevent pretender’s claim—is declared early, yet never tightens: no deadline, no resource lost, no plan recalibrated. Escalation is purely atmospheric (“messages grew more urgent”) without visible price or option loss. The pretender arrives exactly when the stars align, so coincidence resolves rather than complicates. Agency is reactive: Kael waits, speaks, wins; no mid-scene adaptation or forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—“why do paths vanish?”—is signaled early. Pressure escalates only as accumulating detail, not through a narrowing choice or forfeited option; the drum never jeopardizes her data, the missing page never forces her to discard a hypothesis. The final acceptance is a stance crystallization, but the price (she will keep listening yet never know) is stated, not felt. Sufficient for a lyric short, but the beat stops short of a visible cost that alters her next dive or survey.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—claim the embryo to evolve tradition—signals early and tightens when the plants’ fevered pitch warns of surveillance or competition; retrieval is not guaranteed. One meaningful reversal: decoding flips the kite from trash to key, narrowing options to “open orb now.” Cost is legible—once unsealed, the destiny cannot be returned, only borne—though the price is more conceptual than visceral. Escalation stays causal under the insurgent lens; no coincidence rescues her.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—can she re-enter life after massacre—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: wind dies, internal stillness arrives; this is a single deepening rather than escalation of options. No visible price is paid (no forfeited action or object); cost is conceptual, legible but mild. Agency is receptive (standing, breathing) rather than decisive, sufficient for Accumulative lens but not high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake—“can art matter?”—is declared, never tested in scene. No external or internal pressure that narrows options; escalation is cadence repetition, not rising cost. No visible price paid; the untangling proceeds unimpeded. Under Accumulative lens, a single pattern intensification is sufficient, but it must reweight stakes—here it only re-describes them.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—recover the missing person—yields one soft deepening: the ink patterns reveal disappearance as art, not defeat. No visible price is paid; Kael’s anger never tests a new tactic or forfeits an option. Escalation is textural (density of ink traces) rather than causal; the lens is accumulative, so this suffices, but cost remains conceptual only.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—provoke the unspoken conversation—tightens once: the letter’s upload can’t be undone. Agency is intellectual, not physical, but still irreversible. Pressure is accumulative/textural: each paragraph adds a new ripple—archival taboo, network path, societal outrage—until the quiet becomes vertiginous. No tangible price is exacted from Aria on the page, capping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve oasis of peace—arrives early and stays coherent. Pressure is situational: more visitors, more chaos outside, but no concrete tightening narrows Aria’s options or forces a trade-off; she simply keeps gardening. Agency is caretaking endurance rather than a decisive fork; the sword never tempts, the dome never breached. Cost is conceptual (inferred future burden) not on-page, capping escalation at moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—hearing the goddess-echo—is signaled early and tightens only once, when she “voices silence.” No visible cost or foreclosed option accompanies the turn; escalation is atmospheric, not tactical. Under Accumulative lens, the pattern-break of constellations supplies the required deepening, but the absence of price keeps pressure conceptual rather than visceral. Enough for mid-high band, not 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are declared early (empire-toppling scandal) but remain abstract; no concrete risk materializes on the page. Pressure accumulates only as atmospheric swirl and internal rumination; no tightening beat forces a trade-off or narrows options. Escalation is therefore textural/accumulative rather than causal, and the price (determination to act) is emotional but not yet visible or felt. Sufficient for low-plus band but not the sharp cost spike required above 7.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—quieting old guilt—signals in paragraph 4 and tightens when letters force confrontation. One meaningful deepening: the firmware whispers intensify until she ties the cord, narrowing her options to “face or be consumed.” Cost is the surrender of the haunted sound-world for the unknown meteor hush. Agency is endurance/renunciation rather than external victory, consistent with accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake: find meaning in mess. Pressure escalates texturally—each sand grain adds density—but no lived option is foreclosed; the artist could walk away at any moment. Cost is conceptual (loss of certainty) rather than tactical; no credible loss of time, stamina, tool. Agency is attention-only, sufficient for Accumulative lens but below 8.8 threshold that demands visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: can she resurrect empathy without being immolated by memory? Pressure escalates via retrocognitive immersion—each tessera flash narrows her options, forcing the renaming act as defence against being trapped forever. Cost is visceral: she shoulders the plaza’s grief. No coincidence; escalation is driven by her handling of the tessera.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stake—repair the fractured timeline—is declared late and abstract; escalation is accretive imagery (“echoes swirled…garden vibrating”) rather than a narrowing of options. No tangible price or foreclosed path is legible, so pressure feels decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—access to collective unconscious after pill recall—is signaled early and tightens once: the geode must substitute or she loses her channel. Escalation is textural rather than causal: each sensory layer (scent → tingle → glow) ups the ante until the static shock delivers the single meaningful deepening that recalibrates perception. Cost is conceptual—the recall forecloses the chemical path—but the on-page price is mostly opportunity loss rather than felt forfeiture, keeping it below the 8.0 band. No reversal or trade-off beyond the shock moment; pressure plateaus after that.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stake—“map the unknown”—is declared early but never narrowed or endangered; no reversal or trade-off appears. Pressure is static wonder rather than rising cost. The final image glows, yet options are unchanged and no visible price is paid. Because agency is observation-only, escalation is aesthetic, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake: transform opaque prophecy into living possibility. Pressure accumulates through button catalog and sand-whispers, but no decisive tightening narrows options or raises visible price; intensity curve is flat. Protagonist’s agency remains steady excavation rather than riskier commitment. Cost is conceptual at closure but not felt earlier; escalation is present but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“find where unused courage waits”—is signaled early, but pressure plateaus: scanning snow for code is low-risk, and the mirror-self encounter is unforced, so no option is foreclosed. Cost is visible only in hindsight (she keeps the scars) rather than paid during the beat. A single meaningful tightening occurs when mist clears to reveal the path, yet agency remains observational rather than tactical. Escalation is poetic, not tactical; sufficient for Accumulative lens but short of 8.0 trade-off threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is the awaited traveler and the ambiguous promise she might fulfill; pressure is purely situational—waiting in mist. No meaningful tightening or trade-off occurs; the coachman’s stance remains unchanged from first to last line. Traveler’s arrival brings no reversal, cost, or new knowledge; options are not narrowed. Escalation is atmospheric, not causal, so tension plateaus rather than crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are abstract—“why places resist change”—so pressure is atmospheric, not tactical; the only narrowing is the smoke’s flattening, which reweights the premise conceptually rather than constricting real options. No visible price is paid; Akira leaves intact, so escalation is mild.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve city’s hidden beauty—signals early but remains static; no escalating obstacle or trade-off appears. Pressure is situational: moonlit hush and oar-rhythm deepen mood rather than narrow options. Gardener’s sole “choice” is to keep tending, identical to his opening action; no visible price alters tactics. Escalation is lyrical, not consequential—enough for short-form accumulative design yet below the threshold for high-band cost.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—is declared early but remains abstract; no concrete external obstacle tightens options. Pressure accumulates via mood and image, not causality; the only narrowing is her decision to “forge ahead,” cost conceptual rather than visceral. Sufficient for lyric mode, but lacks visible price or forfeiture that would push above 6.5.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—connection vs. solitary secrecy—declared early but remains low-heat; no live option is foreclosed. Escalation is textural: color and community gather, rather than a choice that narrows paths. The installation invites her contribution, yet rejection is never risked; cost is atmospheric, not tactical. Agency is receptive, not decisive, fitting Accumulative lens but capping tension.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—protect the town from cosmic tricksters—is signaled early and tightens once: the pattern emerges, Lyra chooses to interfere, the disturbances cease. Agency is hers alone, but the price is off-loaded onto the community (fewer reports) rather than rebounding onto her tactics or body, so the cost remains conceptual, not visceral. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the pattern is a message, narrowing her options to jam or ignore; jamming is chosen and succeeds. Pressure coheres under causal lens, but the lack of a personal toll keeps the escalation just below the 7.0 threshold where cost becomes palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake = find “vital key”; escalation = music lures, door opens, crystal awakens, cosmos invades. Each step is passively received; protagonist agency limited to following sounds and touching glowing object. Cost is poetic loss of former self, but price is asserted post-fact, not felt during beats. No meaningful narrowing of options—she gets everything except the ability to stay.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—artist’s thawing empathy—is declared late (“sparked something within her”) without early signal. No tightening forecloses an option; pressure remains ambient (“mist swirled”) rather than causal. Detective’s cold-case angst supplies backstory, not present-scene cost.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: decode sailor’s map-before-exile or be trapped in same pattern. Pressure escalates via density, not events—dread sponges up paragraph space until options shrink to “confront the truth.” No visible resource loss; cost is atmospheric. Reversible exile concept stays thematic, never narrows tactical choices, capping intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—“will they speak?”—is signaled late and remains abstract; the amnesty is overheard, not tested. Escalation is atmospheric: fog lifts, secret reveals, music plays—each beat intensifies mood, not jeopardy. No visible price is paid; the hitchhiker vanishing supplies backstory pressure but no live constraint. Consequently the conflict is a swell, not a squeeze, and the final notes fade without having to surrender anything tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is existential: can Kael redeem failure by re-valuing “paths.” Pressure is situational—echoing train and money serve as accumulative mirrors rather than active antagonists. One soft tightening: realizing the money’s transience reweights his own venture collapse, but no live option is foreclosed on the page. Cost is conceptual, not tactical, keeping escalation muted.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake—decode the inscriptions—stays static; pressure is ambient (the night passing) rather than escalating through new obstacles or knowledge reversals. The only tightening is the gradual dawning of literal daylight, which substitutes for a causal turn. No option is foreclosed, no price exacted beyond fatigue. Under the accumulative lens the cadence shift is legible but too mild to redistribute real risk.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—“discover what mirrors don’t show”—is declared early; pressure escalates through accumulating sensory menace rather than narrowing options. No meaningful tightening or trade-off occurs until mirror cracks, but that beat is gifted by external ice-shatter, not protagonist agency, so escalation lacks causal bite. Cost is announced (“truth shook them”) yet no live option is foreclosed; druid simply “stepped forward” along a cleared path. Under Accumulative lens, the single intensification (mirror fracture) reweights perception, satisfying minimal requirement for 600-word frame.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake—“find the intersection of dreams”—is declared early but stays abstract; no concrete want (rescue, escape, knowledge) is ever tested. Pressure escalates only through lyrical intensifiers (“fabric of time was about to be rent”) rather than narrowed choices or rising obstacles. Aria never faces a fork, sacrifice, or failure; the maze simply opens for her. Without a visible price or foreclosed option, tension plateaus at wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—barter destiny to mend soul—signals early and tightens through pattern accumulation: each inlayed object raises spectral attention until orchard leans in. Agency is present (she weaves, she trammels), but external pressure remains atmospheric rather than an opposing force that narrows live options; no visible price alters tactics mid-stream. Closure crystallizes stance without foreclosing a future path—“brighter future” is left open—so cost is tonal, not tactical. Sufficient for 600-word accumulative arc, but lacks a concrete trade-off beat that would punch 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake—replace adrenaline of stage with meaning in quiet life—signals early; pressure accumulates through sensory counterpoint (applause vs. silence) rather than external blocks. No reversal narrows real options; the only “tightening” is Jack’s vow to wrestle the future, which lands as declaration, not forfeiture. Cost is conceptual, not dramatized. Escalation is mood-deepening, not tactic-changing.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—“reestablish the connection between worlds”—is declared early, but escalation is purely atmospheric: mist thins, seed brightens; no concrete option is foreclosed. Agency is contemplative; pressure accumulates texturally but never forces a trade-off or visible price. One micro-turn: seed brightens; no tightening of consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.7)
    Stakes are existential—“preserve wonder”—yet never tested by opposition or tangible loss. Pressure is ambient (moon phase, tide) not antagonistic; no option is foreclosed. No beat of reversible consequence; escalation is purely cadence repetition. Thus no visible price shapes tactics or ending.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.7)
    A dominant stake (“uncover the stories etched into the pearl”) is declared early, yet pressure never escalates: no options narrow, no price is risked, no reversal occurs. The “heartbeat of hesitation” is named but not timed or dramatized; coincidence (finding both pearl and shell within steps) drives discovery rather than agency.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when Elara folds the map and rises: she chooses motion over recursive guilt. Pressure is textural: graffiti aphorisms and accordion lament accumulate meaning until the final note externalizes cost; no external antagonist required. Agency is present yet low-stakes; no concrete forfeit (money, tool, relationship) is risked or lost. Escalation is modest but coherent under Accumulative lens; meets 600-word depth requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—reach the library of unspoken words—is signaled early and reiterated, but pressure is atmospheric, not tactical: each paragraph adds another swirl of mist or whisper rather than a narrowed option. No credible loss (time, pages, social credit) is incurred; the journal is filled without resource limit or external opposition. Coincidence (the watch falling from the book) complicates but does not tighten choice. The single meaningful turn is the realization that the library is internal, but this is a conceptual pivot, not an escalation that forecloses a live alternative, so cost remains legible only as poetic aura.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stake—uncover violin history to prove perforated destiny—remains abstract; no external force narrows options. Pressure is atmospheric (sunset, ache) rather than tactical; one soft tightening: “promise losing its glow” motivates departure, but empire never pushes back on the page, so escalation is lyrical, not causal.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—capture beauty before oblivion—tightens once: the infusion choice narrows her future to “radiant hush” rather than annihilation. Pressure accumulates through density of light/color saturation rather than external blocking; cost is felt when the threshold recedes, leaving her in earned stasis. Sufficient for length, but a second visible forfeiture would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=3.9)
    Dominant stake—locating contentment—is announced repeatedly yet faces no obstacle, ticking clock, or forfeiture. Escalation is lexical (“deepened,” “increasingly attuned”) rather than dramatized; pressure remains ambient. No reversal narrows options; coincidence is absent but so is agency. Closure arrives as tranquil assertion, not as earned change with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stake—”welcome nuance into certainty”—is declared early but never materializes as a concrete test; the client’s suffocating certainty is reported, not shown. No on-page reversal narrows options; the unhooking is narrated as accomplished, not dramatized with cost. Pressure remains atmospheric rather than escalating; the wind-chime deciphering adds texture but no tangible obstacle or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stakes are abstract—“impart understanding of delayed revelation”—with no external or internal obstacle that could fail. Pressure is ambient (starlight, ripples) but never tightens; the researcher withholds details at leisure, risking nothing. No reversal or trade-off occurs; the student’s eventual comprehension is presented as inevitable. Under the accumulative lens, the pattern intensifies mood yet never forecloses an option or exacts a price.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake—“learn to navigate without moving”—is declared early but never materially tested; no external or internal force threatens failure, so pressure stays flat. The birds’ pattern offers knowledge, yet nothing is risked, forfeited, or foreclosed. Escalation is purely textural (more dust, more echoes) rather than a narrowing of options. Consequently, the stake remains atmospheric, not tactical; cost is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—“rediscover creative spark”—is signaled early; escalation is purely internal, no external test or rival. One meaningful tightening: keystone release → luminance flood → felt reconnection. Cost is emotional uplift, not forfeiture; no option is foreclosed, no price visibly paid. Agency is present but low-risk; tension peaks at wonder, not jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stake is “understand color of sound” — abstract, low-urgency. Pressure is atmospheric (dark, silence), not causal; no reversal or narrowing of options occurs. Escalation is a gentle accumulation of wonder, not a trade-off. Luck (happening to glimpse lanterns) cues the final insight;agency is passive.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.4)
    Single stake—decode coins to align with contracted universe—is clear early, but pressure is static: every action succeeds on first try. No meaningful tightening or option foreclosure; the prophecy was always going to work. Cost is deferred to off-page cosmic scale, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake is the reaper’s need to voice the “nameless fears” that haunt their own afterlife. Pressure accumulates through repeated sensory echoes rather than a narrowing causal vise; no external antagonist or ticking clock complicates the ritual. The crystallization itself is the sole tightening moment, but it does not risk failure or force a trade-off. Cost is diffuse—melancholy affirmed—rather than a concrete forfeiture that alters next steps.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes are declared—“brittle devotion,” “cosmic imbalance”—but never sharpened into a live trade-off. Pressure is atmospheric (sky colors, musical drips) rather than an option-narrowing threat. The mage never risks failure, loss, or renunciation; escalation is purely aesthetic. No visible price alters tactics, so the tightening is sensual, not consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—“heal the community via narrative”—stays abstract; no visible stake-holder appears, so pressure is spectral. Escalation is accretive mood, not narrowing options. No beat forces a renunciation or loss; thus no tangible price alters tactics. Emotional cost is suggested, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—“harmonizing logic and intuition”—is declared early but remains abstract; no concrete failure cost is risked. Pressure accumulates via atmospheric density, not narrowing options. The crystal activation deepens pattern recognition yet does not foreclose a path or demand trade-off; escalation is aesthetic, not tactical. Consequently the tightening required for 8.0+ is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“preserve trust by mapping unseen skies”—tightens once: dawn erases stars, forcing her to internalize the data, a non-reversible cost. No antagonist needed; environmental clock supplies pressure. Escalation is density-based: accumulating silence, cooling air, fading patterns. Agency = endurance; option foreclosed when light wins.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—defeat emotional numbness—is signaled early, but pressure plateaus; meditation deepens but never threatens failure or demands trade-off. No visible price is exacted; the practice succeeds without complication, so tension is atmospheric rather than tactical. The history-rewriting world remains a decorative backdrop; it complicates nothing on-stage. Escalation is present only as density increase under Accumulative lens, lacking a tightening that forecloses an option.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes are clear early: will the seed yield a viable creative challenge? Pressure escalates not through external opposition but via densifying associative thought—each theory thickens the seed’s symbolic cost. The protagonist’s agency is intellectual pacing and dawn outlining; the narrowing is the foreclosing of a blank-canvas night into a single themed room concept. Cost is present—sleep, uncertainty—but lacks a tangible forfeiture that would push the tension into the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes—restore lost laughter—are declared lyrically but never tested; no moment forces Elwes to risk failure or pay a price. Pressure accumulates through sonic density, yet the household’s response feels pre-ordained rather than earned. One visible cost (his exhaustion) is named, not dramatized; options do not narrow.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—safeguarding library secrets vs. longing for uncertainty—is signaled early. Pressure escalates via atmospheric density: mist thickens, statues grin, whispers reveal secrets. The tightening is a perceptual shift, not an option-foreclosing choice; no visible price is exacted. Sufficient for short-form lyric escalation, but lacks a tangible trade-off to reach 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—escape predestined failure—is signaled early, yet pressure escalates only atmospherically (energy crescendo) rather than through tangible obstacles or resource depletion. The single meaningful tightening is the final energy surge, but it lacks a mid-process reversal that would foreclose an option and show price. Agency is present—alchemist chooses to proceed—but consequence is postponed to the after-glow, not paid on the page. Meets baseline for short-form escalation but stays below the 8.2 gate where visible cost must shape tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—“uncover the hidden truth”—stays atmospheric; no concrete obstacle opposes Aria. Pressure escalates only via lyric accumulation: each motif returns with heavier adjectives. The single tightening is the discovery of the wall message, but it presents answers rather than narrowing options. Cost is purely affective; nothing is risked, forfeited, or foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.2)
    A single dominant stake—personal curiosity about the vanishing ferry—is signaled early, yet pressure never intensifies; the grotto markings merely confirm what she already suspects. No reversal, resource loss, or time-ticking threat forces adaptation, so escalation stays flat; the sideways-clock rule is named but exerts no tactical squeeze, leaving the conflict ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—“texture of connection” between rational and enchanting—is signaled early but remains abstract; no concrete resource is risked or forfeited. Escalation is tonal (color riot) rather than tactical; options do not narrow. Agency is contemplative; she endures wonder rather than testing commitment. Cost is atmospheric, not visibilized, so pressure plateaus.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—“will the students awaken to cosmic responsibility?”—deepens through accumulative star imagery, but Lyra herself faces no escalating cost or narrowing option; her pedagogy proceeds uninterrupted. Edge geometry is mentioned but never applied under pressure, so theintellectual risk stays abstract. The tightening is purely lyrical, not tactical, capping tension at moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—“reconnect lost hearts”—is declared early; pressure tightens once when the sister appears, narrowing Aria’s role from seeker to soother. Agency is gentle: Aria offers her hand, speaks reassurance; the outward cost is invisible, the inward cost (perpetual duty) only implied. No credible resource loss or tactic shift occurs. Coincidence delivers the sister rather than Aria’s tracking skill, so escalation feels atmospheric, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake: retrieve codex before tide turns—signaled early, tightens when pressure shift is heard. One visible cost: she must enter phase transition with no guarantee of return—price is felt in body-warping roar. Escalation is tidal and acoustic, not decisional; she never confronts a live trade-off (e.g., leave codex to survive). Consequently, tension plateaus rather than spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stake is single: wrest meaning from digital ghost before snow stops. Pressure is atmospheric, not option-narrowing; no concrete trade-off or tool loss occurs. Escalation is textural—ghost gains definition—rather than tactical. Cost is emotional hush, visible but not priced on-page, keeping it in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—saving the dying language—is signaled early and escalates by accretion of whispers, but no single beat narrows options or exacts a visible price from the storyteller. The tension is atmospheric rather than tactical; what might be lost if he fails is never concretized. Consequently the “cost” is communal, not personal, keeping the score below the 8-band where felt price is required.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake—grasp the “harmony untamed” before reality frays further—is signaled early but stays conceptual; no visible price is paid or option foreclosed. Escalation is textural: static voices layer density rather than force choice; the metamorphose is passive reception, not agency. No reversal or trade-off occurs; tension plateaus at mystical exposition. Closure image of “frostbitten hope” registers mood, not cost-based reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—“reawaken beauty”—is declared repeatedly yet never tested; no trade-off or resource lost. Escalation is one smooth wave, not a tightening; coincidence (music just works) does the work. Cost is off-loaded onto statues/setting, not protagonist. Agency is performative, not decisional.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes—deliver contraband bottle across drone line—are signaled early and tightened once: he waits for sensor drift, then sprints. That single beat carries visible risk; afterwards pressure plateaus rather than deepening. Escalation is minimal; no secondary trade-off or loss appears, so the story qualifies for “one meaningful tightening” but not the felt-price band above 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—“interpret silence as possibility”—stays abstract; no concrete trade-off or price emerges. Escalation is purely atmospheric (mist thickens, song nears) rather than option-narrowing. Wrong turn to oasis is coincidence, not agency-driven tension. No visible cost after singer encounter; carpenter simply returns and finishes horse.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—the runaway dream/cipher—intensifies by accretion: each sunrise adds another translucent layer until the closing line admits the chase is infinite. The tightening is felt as cumulative fatigue rather than a single forked choice; cost is the unspoken erosion of never arriving. Sufficient for high-band, but lacks a decisive beat that forecloses an option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.4)
    A single dominant stake — free the trapped idea — is signaled early. Pressure is ambient (thickening air) rather than option-narrowing; no visible price is paid, no tactic is altered. Escalation is poetic accumulation, not causal tightening, so the cost stays atmospheric rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—recover stolen memories—signals early and stays singular. Pressure escalates texturally: each sensory layer (scent → star pattern → mushroom pulse) deepens the mystery rather than narrows tactical options. No explicit reversal or trade-off occurs on-page; the “thread” remains metaphorical. Cost is atmospheric, not tangible, so escalation stays moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—“guide the exiled soul back”—is declared early but remains ethereal; nothing in the library physically resists or worsens if the annotation fails, so pressure feels atmospheric rather than tactical. Escalation is textural: repeated “as the hush deepened” intensifies mood, not risk. No visible price or option foreclosure is attached to the annotation act itself, so the tightening needed for 8+ bands is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.1)
    Stake—“preserve the color of wonder”—is declared early but never tested; no opposition, scarcity, or trade-off appears. The seed instantly succeeds; the earth instantly blooms. No reversal, deepening, or narrowing of options occurs under the Accumulative lens. Because nothing is risked or lost, pressure remains flat; the story is a single exhale of triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—free the spirits—announced early. Escalation is iterative, not a tightening turn: each knot equals one whisper, no rising jeopardy or trade-off. Because the lens is Accumulative, pattern break could suffice, yet the pattern simply completes; no option is foreclosed or price paid by her. Agency is steady but static; the task accomplishes itself.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake—“uncover the henge’s secrets”—is declared early. Pressure is situational but static: rain and silence evoke mood yet never complicate tactics or force a trade-off. The “re-opening” is accomplished by passive watching; no credible loss or narrowing of options occurs. Escalation is atmospheric, not consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can Eli extract usable knowledge from ruin without drowning in it?—is signaled by beat 2. Escalation is density-driven: each relic thickens the conceptual murk until the emptied globe rewrites the rule. No external antagonist is needed; the water itself is omnipresent pressure. Cost is felt (lungs, eyes, time) but could be sharper—an explicit gauge of dwindling air would have pushed this into the 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—mutual recognition with the ghost—signals early; pressure escalates through accumulative image-density rather than因果 turns. One meaningful tightening: the storm’s lightning/thunder window forces faster, more frenzied encoding, visible on-page. Cost is legible in the final breeze—she leaves carrying irreversible communion—but because agency is chiefly contemplative, the price feels conceptually rather than viscerally paid, keeping score sub-8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—seeking joy beneath anguish—remains abstract; tension tightens only texturally as diary pages unfold, but no live option is foreclosed. Agency is purely receptive; the diary yields without resistance, so cost is conceptual rather than felt. Escalation is a single cadence shift from mystery to shrine reveal; sufficient for short accumulative arc but barely crests 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—proving empty spaces remember—remains abstract; no external test or visible price is levied for failure. Pressure is atmospheric, not tactical: clouds calm, but Lyra neither loses nor risks anything on-page. One soft tightening: telescope gaze crystallizes her resolve, yet options do not narrow and cost stays conceptual. Meets short-form minimum, but lacks palpable trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake – mirror the sky before erasure – is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens through each sensory accretion; no secondary stake dilutes it. The single meaningful deepening occurs when the coin’s indentations redirect the brush, foreclosing any other possible image. Cost is felt: the portrait will outlive the library by minutes, then perish. No reversal, but the accumulative pattern adequately escalates under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.9)
    Stakes are announced as “discovery of a lifetime” yet never sharpen into a concrete trade-off or risk; the code is cracked without obstacle, opposition, or resource spent. Pressure plateaus once the message is read—no escalation, reversal, or cost appears under the Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—“learn the rhythm of repair”—is declared early; pressure is exploratory, not antagonistic. No reversal or resource lost; the only escalation is dropping temperature and deepening shadow, a mood intensifier, not a tactical squeeze. Because the lens is Accumulative, this ambient density suffices for mid-range, yet without a price paid or option foreclosed, it never truly tightens. The walk to revelation feels preordained rather than risk-laden.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.7)
    The dominant stake is announced as “harness the nebula,” but no obstacle, rival, or trade-off ever materializes; pressure remains ornamental. Escalation is replaced by repetition of communal awe. Without a visible price or foreclosed path, the story drifts from beatific hope to slightly brighter beatific hope.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake = preserve fragile universal balance before nightfall; signaled early. Escalation is situational: dying light narrows time, hush thickens, forcing slower, more reverent motions—visible cost is the adjuster’s bruised awe deepening into sober vigilance. One meaningful tightening: last ray fades → lullaby must be whispered immediately. No reversal, but pressure coherence suffices under situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stake—restore labyrinth before frost—is declared late (~40% mark) and stays abstract; frost never threatens her physically. One tightening beat: final flourish of last impression triggers glow. Escalation is present but mild; no trade-off or resource lost, so cost remains conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake is internal: transform estrangement → connection. Pressure accumulates through memory intrusion and foam imagery, but no concrete choice narrows options; insight alone escalates. Cost is asserted emotion, not paid action. Coincidence-free, yet lacks a visible trade-off that would tighten the accruing pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.7)
    Stakes—“bridges from silos”—stay abstract; no concrete resource, reputation, or emotional loss is risked. Pressure plateaus at poetic dialogue; the elevator’s “rusty heart” warms, yet this costs Emilia nothing and narrows no future path. Without a tightening or trade-off, escalation remains atmospheric rather than consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stake is abstract: “unlock secrets of abandoned dreams.” The only pressure is the lure of more memories; no resource dwindles, no external risk materializes. The single meaningful turn—mirror suddenly reflects entangled memories—happens to her; she does not narrow options or pay a price. Escalation is therefore decorative rather than tactical; the lens is Accumulative but lacks a tightening that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are declared early—find the forgotten repository—but the only tightening is the ticking gravity-inversion clock; her options never visibly narrow. The serpent-seed map removes investigative friction, so pressure plateaus rather than escalates. Cost is postponed to an abstract future “responsibility,” so the beat-to-beat tension stays moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake—personal re-enchantment—is clear but internal; no external pressure tightens after the first paragraph. Silence-translation method deepens mood yet never faces an obstacle or reversal; options do not narrow. Cost is atmospheric, not tactical. Without a meaningful turn that forecloses a path, escalation plateaus early.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—“to catalog the varieties of silence”—is declared early but never materially tested; no external obstacle jeopardizes the goal. Escalation is purely textural: silence deepens via sensory accretion rather than narrowing options. Because agency is passive—reading, attuning, feeling—the tension stays atmospheric; the diary offers no resistance once opened. Cost is poetic but not tactical; fireworks will break the hush, yet Elara’s tactics won’t change.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—uncover the source of resilience—is declared early and answered, but pressure is observational rather than hazardous; no live risk or narrowing option tests Lyra’s commitment. The hour-long inversion clock is mentioned but doesn’t tighten tactics—she lands before time expires. Cost is conceptual, not felt: she leaves “reluctantly,” but nothing is forfeited or foreclosed. Escalation is a gentle accumulation of wonder, not a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.0)
    Dominant stake—“understand to prevent next crash”—remains abstract; no live consequence if she fails. Pressure is ambient (silence, wind) rather than antagonistic; no trade-off forced, no option narrows. Investigator’s agency limited to looking and noting; survey produces no reversal or cost. Coincidence of finding the exact crash spot substitutes for earned turn.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—liberating the “sculpted hush”—is signaled early; pressure mounts via sensory density, not option reduction. The chisel strike provides the single required tightening, releasing both sound and silence in one fused moment. Cost is conceptual (the hush now lives outside the marble) rather than a tangible loss to Elian, keeping the price oblique but legible under an accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—“harvest insight from failure”—stays abstract; pressure escalates atmospherically (music makes air vibrate) rather than through a narrowed choice or visible price. No live option is foreclosed; the tension is aesthetic, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—decode emotion before stars extinguish—announced early. Escalation is atmospheric (stars blink out) rather than a narrowing of Echo’s options; nothing is forfeited or foreclosed inside the press ritual. No micro-turn where print fails or threatens Echo’s credibility; pressure is observational. Meets 7-band but lacks a paid price that alters tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes are signaled early—“retrieve relics, coax wonder”—but remain abstract; no concrete relic or deadline appears, so pressure stays atmospheric. The only tightening is the pendant’s stronger hum before the woman appears; this is a mood spike, not an option-narrowing beat. Escalation is lyrical accumulation, not causal rise; cost is oblique wonder rather than forfeiture, capping the band in the low-6 region.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake—proving objects absorb emotions—is declared early but never materially tested; no outside skeptic or obstacle appears. Pressure escalates only via lyrical accumulation (mist thinning, frost deciphered) rather than narrowing options. No visible price paid; the mystic’s stance crystallizes without losing anything. Closure is conceptual, not consequential under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake: re-spin silence into connection; signaled early. Pressure is lyrical accumulation—each fitted puzzle piece and woven thread thickens the emotional weave—rather than external opposition. No visible price (time, money, bodily risk) is dramatized; cost remains metaphorical. One meaningful deepening at sunset when loom pattern completes; suffices for 600-word accumulative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“coax resilience from rubble”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the silk must be risked on the blade, but the test is success without visible failure cost (no cracked blade, no burnt hand). Escalation is accretive: each hammer blow adds mythic density rather than narrowing options. The apprentice’s arrival introduces a future stake (passing knowledge) but does not complicate the present one, so the tightening is intellectual rather than tactical. Still, the accrual pattern holds under Accumulative lens and the final image reweights the premise positively.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—“discover the withheld truth”—stays abstract; pressure is atmospheric (shifting worlds) rather than a narrowing of options she can accept or refuse. No tightening beat forces trade-off; cost is existential wonder, not a denied path, so escalation feels diffuse under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving the lighthouse’s safety—is signaled early but remains abstract; no external antagonist or ticking clock raises cost. Stone-stacking provides a meditative beat yet does not narrow options or create irreversible consequence. The anonymous letters are hinted as menace but never activate pressure. Escalation is tonal deepening only; closure offers resonance without a visible price paid or path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—shaping dawn via ancient ritual—is signaled in line four and deepens through rhythmic accumulation rather than option-narrowing reversal; tension is atmospheric, not tactical. Agency is present but low-cost: she “carefully angles the lantern,” yet no beat risks failure, fatigue, or external resistance; escalation is a smooth luminosity curve, not a forked path. Visible price is asserted off-page—“weight of her responsibility”—rather than felt on-page, keeping cost conceptual. The tightening is a cadence shift, not a foreclosed option, satisfying the accumulative lens but capping entry to the 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—“learn the secret of magnetizing stories”—is signaled early but never tested or tightened; no alternative path is foreclosed. Pressure is atmospheric (fading sun, gathering onlookers) rather than tactical; Kaito’s agency stops at “decided to illuminate.” The cost is purely conceptual (he now “knows” connection), so escalation stays modest. Meets short-form requirement of one meaningful deepening, but lacks visible price or option narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=2.7)
    No dominant stake is signaled early; the task is introduced as vague obligation (“not to repair… but to deconstruct sorrow”). Pressure does not escalate: the storm intensifies externally, but options for the worker do not narrow, deepen, or cost anything. The pin-drop beat is decorative coincidence, not causal trigger. Because no trade-off or price is dramatized, the closure feels like ritual success rather than earned reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.5)
    Dominant stake—“rekindle a dying realm”—stated early but never tested by obstacle or trade-off. No escalation: plants bloom automatically as she hums; no price, narrowing option, or reversal appears. Conflict remains decorative, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—unearth wisdom in past mistake—signaled early; pressure escalates via narrowing clock (quarter-hour to midnight) and density of paradox texts. Agency is attention/renunciation rather than external action; the invitation re-pricing counts as visible cost under Accumulative lens. No live option is foreclosed on page—Elys could still attend the ball—so tension remains atmospheric, not tactical. Sufficient for mid-high band but not the sharp trade-off 8.8+ demands.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—“find the sacred in the ordinary”—is declared early but stays abstract; no tightening trade-off or visible price materializes. Pressure is situational and static: autumn deepens, birds leave, yet her options do not narrow; the one micro-turn (final smile) is mood-shift, not option-foreclosure. Escalation is textural (return visits accrue) rather than causal, sufficient for short form but thin on cost.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes remain abstract—“preserve the essence of a bygone era”—without a concrete deadline, rival archivist, or vanishing shelf. Pressure accumulates only atmospherically; the “illusions fade to memory” timeframe is poetic, not a ticking ledger the protagonist must outrace. No visible price is paid; options never tighten. The lantern promises revelation but delivers only wonder, not tactical loss.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—protect the family shine operation—signals early; the sunrise clock tightens the standoff, but the false-sabotage pressure is off-stage, so escalation is felt more as mood spike than tactical narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake – “learn why some people carry weather” – is declared early but never sharpened by a concrete risk or ticking clock; forests holding elections sounds dire yet alters nothing on the page.  Escalation is purely atmospheric: aurora brightens, ring vibrates, stranger appears – all coincidence, no protagonist-driven narrowing of options.  No visible price is paid or even previewed; the handshake costs zero stamina, social credit, or opportunity.  Under Accumulative lens a single intensification suffices, but here it is only a light pulse, not a reweighting that forces stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—unblock creativity—is signaled early. Pressure escalates via Accumulative pattern: each charcoal stroke increases resonance with the cave until the cave “hums,” a deepening that reweights the stake. No external antagonist or reversal is needed under this lens, yet the cost remains abstract; we see lifted weight but no concrete forfeiture (time, skin, pigment exhaustion). Sufficient for the 600-word tier.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—“find where lost conversations go”—is signaled early. Pressure is tonal (echoing whispers) rather than tactical; no deadline, rival, or dwindling resource raises cost. The map-palimpsest deepens meaning but doesn’t narrow options; arrival at the repository is frictionless. Escalation is textural (layer reveal) not causal; thus the tightening is present but gentle, lacking visible price that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—the bluff’s shift from silence to heart-language—is signaled early; escalation arrives via density increase, not causal turns. The final image reweights the stake, but the cost is conceptual rather than visceral, keeping pressure just shy of high-band intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—quell “inner static” or be consumed—is declared early; pressure tightens when she chooses to contain rather than escape the burn. That reversal narrows her options and risks overheating her chassis, a visible price. Escalation is linear, not deepening; each beat restates the same tension rather than revealing new trade-offs. Still, the final image reweights the stake: chaos caged, not vanished.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes remain abstract—“prove listening heals” is declared, never tested by a beat where failure costs her anything. Pressure plateaus after the mailbox spill; Emilia’s reading binge is summarized, so the dominant stake neither tightens nor forces a trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes are declared (escape, encrypt vulnerability) but never narrowed by a live threat or trade-off; pressure is atmospheric, not tactical, so escalation reads as mood accumulation rather than option reduction.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.2)
    A single dominant stake—recovering deleted memories—is signaled early and deepened through spatial descent, but escalation is atmospheric rather than option-narrowing; no tactics are altered by the gravity pockets en route. The crystal contact delivers a conceptual repricing that reweights the premise, yet the protagonist’s agency is observational, not decision-based, so the tightening is textural, not causal. Cost is implied via recovered memory flood, but no visible price is paid on the page, capping entry into high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—“prevent the prophecy from unfolding”—stays abstract; neither prophecy content nor stakes of failure are dramatized, so pressure is atmospheric rather than tactical. A single deepening occurs when the origami wing begins to glow, but this is an intensifier, not a narrowing of options; the summoner never risks or loses anything visible. Because coincidence and environment never resist, escalation is a smooth ramp of adjectives (“deeper,” “thicker,” “palpable”) rather than a choice with cost. The closure reconfigures tone, not consequence, so the conflict remains lyrical but low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single stake—student’s desire to decode “language of old buildings”—is declared early but never faces an on-page test or narrowing. Pressure is atmospheric, not tactical; no option is foreclosed, no price paid. Escalation is lyrical accumulation under meteor glow rather than causal tightening; acceptable under Accumulative lens yet remains low-impact.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—reclaim quarantined memory—signals early. Pressure escalates only texturally: whispers grow louder, memories surface, but no active opposition or trade-off is tested. The cost (pain of recalled loss) is asserted, not dramatized; she simply keeps listening. No visible price alters later tactics; escalation is accumulative but flat.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—subvert an injustice-forging document—signals early. Pressure escalates only once: the“calibrated treason” deepens when words “seemed to take on a life of their own,” a textural intensification under Accumulative lens. No concrete loss (time, safety, tool) alters tactics; the risk stays abstract. Closure reweights meaning but does not narrow live options or show a price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—“why some people echo”—remains an abstract question; no on-page test or narrowing of options occurs. Pressure is atmospheric: the song’s intensity deepens, but it does not force a trade-off, loss, or irreversible choice. The escalation is a cadence shift, sufficient under Accumulative lens, yet the cost is diffused through the collective hush rather than paid by Aria’s own options. Legible but low-urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.0)
    Dominant stake—“find a fragment of truth”—stays abstract; no concrete resource is risked or foreclosed. Pressure is accumulative/textural: visions layer like translucent sheets, but each revelation is additive, not decisive. A single micro-turn occurs when the globe settles into a pattern, yet the pattern is read, not acted upon; cost remains atmospheric rather than paid.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake is cognitive—to “uncover hidden patterns/effort”—but it never tightens or faces external opposition; pressure is atmospheric, not tactical. No visible price is paid: she does not break, lose, or renounce anything on the walk. Escalation is a gentle density increase of images rather than a narrowing of options. Agency remains observational; the climax is reception, not action.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.3)
    A single dominant stake—find the diamond/stillpoint—is signaled early and pursued steadily, but pressure stays flat: no ticking clock, antagonist, or resource drain. Escalation is purely accumulative (more paper pieces) rather than a tightening that forecloses options. The “being watched” beat is introduced at the 90% mark but not activated, so cost remains conceptual rather than felt. Therefore the 8.8+ gate is unreachable despite the quest frame.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes (“shape a new dawn”) are announced early yet never tested; no reversal or trade-off is dramatized. Pressure is asserted via crowds rallying off-stage, but the protagonist’s options do not narrow—she keeps watching and listening. Cost is absent; the prophet’s rise happens to her, not because of her. Escalation is purely rhetorical (“spread like wildfire”) without on-page agency or price.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—preserve fleeting beauty vs. personal irrelevance—signaled early; escalation is accretive (each jar, each dawn ray intensifies wistful ache) rather than a narrowing fork. No visible price beyond generic “years bearing down”; poet never risks or forfeits a live option. Pressure remains atmospheric, not tactical; coincidence absent; meets minimal one-deepening test for lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—protect the artifact via resonance-match—is signaled early; pressure tightens once as sunset expiry looms, forcing precision in the tuning beat; cost is the irreversible commitment of the artifact to this place, legible in the closing hush, meeting the 8.0+ band though escalation is singular, not compounded.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=3.2)
    The dominant stake—“patient revolution”—is declared repeatedly yet never tested; no visible price is paid, no option is narrowed. Pressure remains static: the viaduct hums louder, the moon sets, but the mapper’s tactics do not change. Escalation is purely atmospheric; coincidence (lunar climax coincides with viaduct glow) substitutes for agency-driven reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—solve case/free self—signaled early but pressure stays atmospheric; no concrete narrowing of options. One soft deepening: “Free at last” inscription links case to self, but it is noticed, not triggered by agency. Cost is existential, not enacted; no tactic altered. Escalation is textural density rise via drip/echo repetition; sufficient for short-form under accumulative lens, but barely felt.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the chaplain can convert guilt into efficacious action—remains abstract; no on-page obstacle tests it. Pressure is ambient (“memory…haunted him”) rather than intensifying; the proprietor’s gentle affirmation acts as complication-free counsel. The single narrowing moment is the gift of the box, which carries no visible price or risk, so escalation stays flat.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stakes are announced—decode the algorithm, ring the unheard bell—but no obstacle ever endangers that aim; tension plateaus. Because escalation is purely iterative observation rather than rising risk, pressure remains static and the final “ringing” delivers no felt price or forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—recover the truth behind “Stellar” disappearances—tightens via pattern accretion rather than causal reversals; each new 4-1-5-9 sighting narrows Lena’s mental options until the revelation that the files were merely hidden re-prices her obsession into custodial duty. No tangible price is dramatized on-page, so escalation is conceptual, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: maintain land-ice balance via empathic mapping; signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is accumulative: each mirror glimpse thickens pattern recognition, narrowing options until reassembly becomes inevitable single act. No external antagonist; pressure is coherent internal mandate. Cost is visible—crystal pulse now tethered to her heart, foreclosing detachment. 7.8 not 8.5 because the tightening is gentle; stakes never spike to loss-of-life urgency, only solemn duty.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—will the narrator re-enter life or stay dissociated—is signaled early. Pressure escalates via accumulative pattern: each day of labor adds sensory vividness and communal warmth, tightening the choice to stay present. No sharp reversal occurs, but the “sound of approaching endings” deepens knowledge, making endurance feel finite and precious. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; option to withdraw lingers but feels foreclosed by the final parasol-clutching image.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stake—“to nurture intersubjective understanding”—is declared early but remains abstract; no concrete test or reversal narrows her options. Pressure is ambient, not escalating; the vineyard’s mismatches are observed, not interacted with. The single “tightening” is a realization without external cost. Under Accumulative lens, density increases, yet the lack of a visible price caps escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are declared—“preserve the echo of wisdom”—yet no obstacle opposes the walker; the prophet freely speaks and the clearing obediently forms. Without friction or risk, pressure never escalates; the beat sequence is purely ceremonial. A single meaningful tightening or trade-off is absent, so the piece remains in static contemplation rather than conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake—“transmute pain into a masterpiece”—is declared early but never tested; no obstacle or time pressure materializes. No reversal, tightening, or trade-off occurs; the only “escalation” is sunset. Cost is zero: film is unlimited, light is perfect, mood stays serene. Under Accumulative lens, the pattern intensifies mood but does not reweight options or foreclose paths; closure feels incidental rather than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—decode growth pattern vs. exposure through testimony—is signaled early and tightens once: secrecy must be relinquished. Agency is largely reactive (summons), yet the scholar’s decision to rise and clutch the crystal crystallizes stance with visible cost under situational pressure. Escalation is single but sufficient for 700-word span; coincidence complicates rather than resolves. Persistent constraint (world unraveling) shadows the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.0)
    Single stake—“capture the sound of growing older”—is signaled early and remains conceptual; no external obstacle or rising price escalates the quest. Driftwood arrangement is meditative repetition rather than tactical adaptation; fog cooperation is ambient, not antagonistic. The only meaningful shift is acceptance (internal reweighting), not option foreclosure. Because pressure stays lyrical and static, escalation is thin under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake (harness the ephemeral) is declared early but never tested by a reversible beat; tremors raise abstract stakes yet Eli’s response is only to reinforce walls—no trade-off or narrowing options. No visible price is exacted from him. Escalation is atmospheric, not causal; coincidence drives the quake.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stake is singular and gentle: grant Emma a painless exit. Pressure is emotional, not consequential—no external obstacle or time crunch beyond the implicit ticking of dying breath. The single “tightening” is the blood-work moment, but it merely confirms what we already suspect; options do not narrow, only mood deepens. Cost is felt as shared sorrow rather than any tangible loss for Lena, so escalation stays modest under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake—“where shadows go at noon”—is declared early, yet no tightening or trade-off confronts Lyra; pressure stays diffuse and abstract. Escalation is textural (nights stack up) rather than option-narrowing; the absence of a visible price keeps the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—“share stillness without fire”—is signaled early but never tested by external resistance or resource loss; pressure is internal and steady-state. The single meaningful intensification is the glass’s final gleam, a visual deepening rather than an option-narrowing turn. No credible loss or forfeiture is dramatized; cost is purely conceptual. Under Accumulative lens this suffices for one tightening, yet the absence of felt price caps it below 7.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—finding safety after public shame—is declared early but never tested; no external threat or internal dilemma escalates. Pressure rises only via ambient beauty and the stranger’s flower, an accumulative deepening, not a causal reversal. Because no live option is risked or forfeited, the cost remains atmospheric; eligible for mid-band only.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—recovering creative flow—is signaled early; pressure tightens once when the cameo legitimates continuation, but this is external, not a tactical trade-off. No credible loss (time, reputation, money) alters later moves; the “against the current” concept stays thematic. Escalation is poetic accumulation (mist, shell, cameo) rather than narrowing options; under Accumulative/Textural lens this is acceptable, but the cost remains abstract. Closure reconfigures meaning, not tangible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes (restore communal rite) are declared early and tightened once when the device activates; no visible price or lost option materializes, so escalation is purely lyrical rather than tactical—sufficient for short form but not charged.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—translate heartbeats into maps—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tested once at the seal beat. Pressure is accumulative: decay-perfume silence → starlight glow → heartbeat hum → life-force cost, each layer adding weight rather than narrowing options. No external antagonist or reversal, but the lens is Accumulative/Textural, so one intensification suffices. Cost is visible (vitality drain), fulfilling the 8-band guardrail.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: can Elian trap immaterial echoes inside mechanical certainty? Pressure escalates by accretion: each failed angle or misaligned gear adds psychic weight; season’s decay mirrors stalled mechanism. Mid-story tightening occurs when he realizes the device can never store everything—options narrow to acceptance or obsession. Cost is legible: months lost, lungs full of rot, and the future sentence of endless return implied by the closing heartbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stake—collect intangible burden-weights—remains abstract; no concrete test or increasing price escalates. Tension accumulates via denser imagery, but the only narrowing is the approach of dawn, which is external, not agentive. The weave’s completion is inevitable rather than costly; options are not foreclosed. Under Accumulative lens the cadence shift is present, but without a felt forfeiture the escalation plateaus.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—containment of grief through craft—signalled early; one tightening as carving approaches finish. Escalation is cadence, not causal reversal; no option is foreclosed except the implied “never again” of his absence. Cost is atmospheric rather than tactical; pressure stays internal and steady-state. Sufficient for length but lacks a beat where containment could fail and force adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stake—recovering personal narrative from eroded ambition—tightens through each whispered fragment; the final click forcibly ends the search, a visible forfeiture of further scavenging; cost is present but understated, legible more as poetic stillness than as acute loss, capping escalation short of piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—“equations for hope” versus dereliction—is signaled early. Pressure is situational: the maze of patterns + decayed life-support create coherent threat. One meaningful tightening: realization pipes can restart air. No loss or trade-off appears on-page; success feels frictionless. Escalation stays conceptual rather than visceral, capping high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—reconcile precision life with wild dream—signaled early. One meaningful deepening: bear-eye contact re-opens abandoned path. Pressure stays atmospheric; no concrete trade-off forced on page. Escalation is mood-accumulative, not tactic-narrowing; cost remains prospective.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—gain hindsight clarity—remains abstract; pressure is atmospheric, not tactical. Escalation is a slow accretion of glints and whispers rather than a narrowing of live options; no concrete resource is risked or lost. The final crystallization is powerful as conceptual repricing, yet the lack of a visible price paid (time, bodily risk, social credit) keeps stakes legible but not visceral. Closure effect is owned by Q2; here, the pressure suffices for high-band entry but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=3.7)
    Stakes are announced early—preserve ancient methods—yet no opposition, ticking clock, or resource limit ever threatens that goal. The single “tightening” is the fog deepening, but it complicates visibility, not the puzzle itself; she completes it effortlessly. No price is paid, no option narrowed. Under Accumulative lens, pressure accumulates in mood alone, not in story options.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake is comprehension of “geography of healing,” an abstract want without external pressure or antagonist. No tightening beat narrows options; silence and emptiness accumulate texture but never test commitment. Protagonist’s agency is confined to writing and fondling thread—no fork, no forfeiture. Cost is purely contemplative; fits Accumulative lens yet stays flat on visceral stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.3)
    The dominant stake—“reawaken beauty”—is declared early but stays abstract; no intermediate failure or resource loss raises the price of pursuit. The single “tightening” is the palace shudder, an external vibration the prince does not cause or answer, so agency stays internal and contemplative. Because the conflict is entirely intrapsychic and the device assembles off-stage, escalation reads as mood intensification rather than option-narrowing. A visible cost (fatigue, broken component, forfeited memory) never materializes on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—tending a scarred world while carrying her own—is signaled early, but pressure is static; the burned tree is the only external pressure and it poses no active obstacle. The graft is a single gentle act; no complication, risk, or irreversible cost escalates. Escalation is therefore a texture-shift (rain, scent) rather than a narrowing of options; the lens holds but the beat is too soft to reach high-band cost clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single stake—liberate memories—lacks external opposition; pressure is atmospheric, not tactical. Escalation is textural: shards → carvings → box intensify mood but never narrow Aria’s options or threaten loss. No visible price is paid; the city’s revival feels gift-like, not earned sacrifice. Hence the tightening is present only as cadence shift, not consequential trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.3)
    Dominant stake—“share light without fire”—is signaled early but never tested; no obstacle, reversal, or visible price emerges. Pressure is static wonder, not escalating risk; the protagonist simply keeps walking and listening. Because the lens is Accumulative, escalation is judged by density/cadence shift; the final line offers a reprise, not a narrowing of options. No causal agency beyond continuing transit, so mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—discovering grief’s shape—is declared early but never tested; no reversal or forfeiture occurs. Spectral mentor is calm consultant, not antagonist; butterflies migrate on schedule, complicating nothing. The single “tightening” is interior re-labeling, absent a visible trade-off. Closure’s cost is aesthetic, not tactical, so pressure stays atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled early. Pressure escalates texturally: pendulum pause → inscription → golden light, each layer deepening the same stake rather than narrowing options. No visible price is exacted; the conflict is internal and static, so escalation is present but gentle. Coincidence (finding the rake) complicates, does not resolve, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—“discover the shape of intentions”—is signaled early and deepened through pattern recognition rather than external opposition. Pressure is steady-textural: each untangled thread adds knowledge but never threatens loss or moral trade-off; stakes remain intellectual. The crystal’s hum is the sole moment of tangible escalation, yet it complicates nothing, merely confirms success. Because no live option is foreclosed, the tightening required for 8.0+ bands is absent; still, the accumulative charge is legible and coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.0)
    The dominant stake—“prevail” over stagnation—stays abstract; no visible price is paid or option foreclosed. Pressure is static: the same blank page and hovering pen at the end echo the opening without escalation. A single micro-turn is hinted but never executed; the cartographer never risks error, ink, or exile, so tension plateaus.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—capture the broadcast to animate dust—is signalled early and held. Pressure is accumulative: static thickens, lyrics clarify, dust reacts; yet no live option is foreclosed and Emilia never adapts tactics. The crescendo intensifies atmosphere but does not test commitment or force trade-off, so escalation is present yet static. Cost is aesthetic (silence after song) rather than tactical, keeping score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—impermanence of safety—surfaces early and tightens through ash scattering as literal forfeiture of permanence. One meaningful deepening occurs when Lena realizes transience is the value, not the loss. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, adequate for this lyric design but short of 8.8+ urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake is cognitive: reconcile competing narratives of collapse. Pressure intensifies only rhetorically—“he began to agonize,” “jumble of competing narratives”—without on-page narrowing of options or tangible loss. No reversal or trade-off occurs; the tightening is purely rhetorical escalation. Closure qualifies as stance crystallization, but the lack of visible price keeps escalation muted.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving vanishing arts through choral harmony—is declared early but never materially tested. No tightening or trade-off appears; the “subtraction of noise” remains a metaphorical method without on-page mechanics or risk. Pressure is static nostalgia, not escalating scarcity. Closure reconfigures mood, not options.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—create a dish that captures the alignment and heals memory—is signaled early and narrowed to the seed-planting act. Escalation is textural: light thickens, memories “stir,” aromas layer; no external antagonist, but pressure coheres as the cosmos demands immediacy. The single meaningful tightening is the moment she spoons the meal to townsfolk—option to withhold is foreclosed, yet price (ingredient sacrifice, exposure of gift) remains off-page. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; still, under an Accumulative lens the intensification of density reweights stakes sufficiently for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes are announced as “witness the failure,” but the hive poses no active danger or resource loss; tension stays intellectual. The log reveal is a static info dump, not a tightening that forecloses an option. No visible price is paid by either character, so escalation plateaus rather than crystallizes a stance.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are abstract: “understand why some houses feel alive” carries no concrete jeopardy or forfeiture. Pressure is static; the ritual walk proceeds exactly as planned, with no reversal or narrowing of options. The shard is never shown to fail, resist, or demand a price. Escalation is therefore decorative rather than causal or costly.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is cognitive: replace nostalgic certainty with nuanced acceptance of decay. Pressure escalates once—ampoule jolt → cascade of revelations—but the tightening is internal and cost-free; no option is foreclosed, no tangible price paid. The garden thrives narratively, yet the statue’s agency changes only its interpretation, not its circumstances, keeping escalation gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: resurrect lost languages through paint; signaled early. Pressure deepens via accumulative layering—each memory adds weight—but no external force threatens failure, so options never visibly narrow. Cost is interior (endless nights, perpetual return) yet stays conceptual; no tangible forfeiture on page. Escalation is present but diffuse; meets default, falls short of 8.0 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are announced—preserve heritage—but Elena faces no live trade-off or narrowing of options; the thaw happens to her. No reversal or tightening occurs under the Accumulative lens; pressure is static awe rather than escalating cost. The “rosewater dread” is atmospheric, not tactical. Without a visible price or foreclosed path, escalation remains conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—“unlock latent radiance”—is clear early. Pressure is purely cognitive: solve yoyo = get glow; no external antagonist or time squeeze. One micro-turn when stone first flares, but escalation plateaus; the puzzle-solving scene is summary, not narrowing. Cost is promised but not displayed; glow arrives as gift, not trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.1)
    Dominant stake—“trick fear into revealing its weakness”—remains abstract; no concrete test or trade-off materializes. Escalation is atmospheric only: fog lifts, glow brightens, figure appears—no decision narrows options. The narrator’s agency is passive observation, so pressure plateaus rather than tightens. Cost is asserted (“I felt changed”) but not dramatized on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=3.2)
    No dominant stake is signaled early; the prophet’s goal is already achieved in the first paragraph. Middle beats repeat the same action—striking branches—without deepening cost or narrowing options. No reversal, complication, or trade-off appears; the music simply swells and stops. Because escalation is absent and no price is paid, pressure remains flat under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—uncover why the expedition vanished—signals early and tightens once when the shell cracks open, revealing map/note. Agency is thin: the act of deciphering is passive, and the crack happens to her; she neither risks nor forfeits anything on-page. Cost is atmospheric, not concrete; escalation relies on imagery (watchers loom larger) rather than narrowing options. The final step beyond the city freezes options in dread, satisfying the situational lens, but the price remains conceptual, not viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—exposing a noble lie—signaled early. Single tightening: finding the letter reweights the myth. Because escalation is accumulative, one intensification suffices, yet the cost is off-stage (abstract “truth” vs. real jeopardy). Agency is cerebral; no live option is foreclosed, no visible price paid, capping escalation at 6.0.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes of "rescuing stories from silence" remain abstract; no tightening beat raises concrete risk or forfeiture. Pressure plateaus after the inkwell retrieval; the surveyor’s tactics never adapt, so escalation stays flat under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake = decode truth before blackout ends; pressure stays conceptual—no ticking clock or resource loss on page. One meaningful tightening: shift from substitution-cipher assumption to interwoven-narrative hypothesis narrows options. Cost is intellectual, not visceral; no credible loss alters tactics. Escalation is gentle pattern break under Accumulative lens; meets minimal bar for 600-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—transmute grief into crafted light—is signaled early and never drifts. Pressure escalates by texture: each polished lantern and folded crane adds weight until the final release. No external opposition or reversal appears; escalation is one-directional accumulation, acceptable under Accumulative lens but limits ceiling. Cost is present (time, bodily ache, emotional exposure) yet static—no new tactical loss after midpoint—so the tightening feels gentle rather than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—uncover why her wedding was destroyed—signaled early. Middle “tightening” is intellectual (data pattern) rather than an action that forecloses an option; no visible price is paid or resource lost. Escalation is accretive, not causal, but coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stakes—decode the frequency—are declared early but never tested or narrowed; no alternative path is foreclosed, no tangible loss risked. Agency is purely procedural: follow signal, follow carvings, insert chip; coincidence simply delivers the chip where map points. One meaningful escalation is required; here pressure is static wonder rather than rising cost. Closure re-weights meaning but does not emerge from a prior dilemma or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake—“will she confront the withheld truth?”—is declared early yet never tightened. No active opposition or trade-off appears; driftwood vision complicates nothing. Escalation is accretive imagery, not rising cost. Closure lacks visible price; options unchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake—unlocking prisoner exchange—declared early yet never tested in a live beat; tension stays rhetorical (“negotiations stalled”). No visible price is paid by the protagonist; the breakthrough is attributed to lunar rhythm off-stage. Single micro-turn is the pocketing of the pull, but it complicates nothing. Pressure remains atmospheric, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake declared early—lost direction after divorce—but pressure plateaus. Each paragraph restates the same emotional state with new imagery, producing a flat line, not escalation. The paddle outing is calm from launch; no weather, fatigue, or navigational error tests him. Closure merely reasserts the opening problem as “peace,” so no option is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—empathy quest—is declared early but remains abstract; no visible price is attached at any beat. Pressure plateaus: the lake is wondrous but presents no escalating obstacle, ticking clock, or traded-off choice. The baseball could have forced a decision (keep/throw/offer) yet remains inert; thus escalation under the Accumulative/Textural lens is weak. Closure does not tighten or foreclose; cost is only rhetorical, capping the score below 6.5.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single dominant stake—help Aria reforge the bond—is signaled early; pressure accrues through lyric density rather than causal turns. The ritual constitutes the only meaningful tightening; options narrow to “perform the spell or refuse,” but refusal is never entertained, so agency is muted. Cost is atmospheric (“Lyra felt a strange sensation”) rather than a concrete loss or foreclosed path. Under Accumulative lens the scent-spice pattern intensifies, meeting the single-deepening requirement, yet the price remains implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—“find where lost time accumulates”—is signaled early but remains abstract; no ticking clock or tangible loss sharpens it. Pressure accumulates texturally via recurring images (mist, crack, tracings) rather than narrowing options; no reversal or trade-off is forced. Agency is contemplative; the only cost is emotional acceptance, paid off-page. Escalation stays lyric; lacks visible price that alters later tactics, capping entry to 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake is abstract: “understand transformation.” No external opposition, resource limit, or trade-off appears. Escalation is purely intensifying adjectives (“whispering hush grew louder”) without narrowing options. Closure’s cost is conceptual, but because nothing was ever at risk, pressure feels cosmetic.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are declared (“key to the fort’s very existence”) yet never tested: no guard fails, no authority confronts, no resource is lost. The single tightening—decoding the sundial—adds knowledge, not cost. Agency is present but frictionless; the protagonist never risks or forfeits anything. Under the Causal lens, escalation is rhetorical rather than material.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—decode cosmic pattern before reality frays—is declared early, but pressure stays atmospheric, never tightening into a visible trade-off or lost option. The “friction disappears” horizon never becomes a live clock. Agency is present—arranging rocks—but no escalation or narrowing of choices occurs; the climax is revelation, not decision.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are internal and static: will she understand her scars? Pressure never tightens—options do not narrow, time does not shorten, and the storm offers no real obstacle. The envelope reveal is a foregone conclusion because she hid it herself; no external force complicates retrieval. Escalation is atmospheric, not consequential; the storm’s fury is backdrop, not antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—winning the duel of wits—is declared early, but never specified in concrete terms; no visible price (reputation, limb strain, lost needle) is risked or paid. Escalation is atmospheric rather than tactical: sword-clash spectacle substitutes for argumentative narrowing. The “hidden overture” reveal is delayed and off-page, so pressure does not meaningfully tighten. Coincidence (opponent simply arrives) rather than protagonist agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—library rebirth as resistance beacon—is signaled early. Pressure is situational: decayed space vs. creative will; no external antagonist. One meaningful deepening occurs when the poet steps inside and the hinge creaks, symbolically accepting stewardship. Cost is conceptual (endless work) rather than tangible; absence of a concrete forfeiture keeps escalation muted.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake is escape from sorrow into filmic stasis; pressure deepens only once when she steps through the reel. No option is foreclosed: the horizon “invites” night but never threatens arrival. Cost is aesthetic, not practical—she gains eternal melancholy refuge without losing anything on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are declared (“memories washed away”) but no concrete risk or irreversible loss is dramatized; the monsoon is external décor, not an escalating threat that forces a narrowed choice. Agency remains at the level of routine caretaking, so pressure stays flat.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—diffusing severance regret—is signaled early; escalation is the single lace-weaving beat that reweights memory rather than narrows external options. Agency is attention/renunciation; cost is conceptual (letting the bundle go) yet gentle—no credible loss of time, tool, or social credit is dramatized. Pressure remains lyric-coherent but mid-intensity; the tightening is poetic, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes remain abstract: “understanding gradual change” isn’t tested by concrete opposition or narrowing options. There’s no escalation—only meditative circling. The flood’s aftermath provides context, not pressure. Agency is observational, not active; decay happens to the world, not through Maria’s fraught choices with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—deciphering ancestral secrets to reclaim artistic identity—is signaled early, but pressure remains static. The “hidden message” appears without obstacle; decoding requires no struggle, risk, or adaptation. The protagonist’s agency is passive observation (“gazed,” “pondered,” “felt”) rather than active confrontation. No option is narrowed, no price paid; the “twists and turns” are narrated, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—translating silence into felt music—is signaled early and deepens via the heat-map collaboration. But escalation is passive: the “discord” appears without prior evidence of compositional failure, making its rectification feel unearned. Cost is implied (emotional vulnerability) but never concretized as a trade-off (e.g., sacrificing a frequency for harmony). Agency resides in adjustment, not decisive renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—revitalizing the distress signal to create a resting place—is signaled early and deepens into thematic purpose. Escalation occurs via preparation and descent, but agency is passive: the undertaker responds to external prompts (note, lens) rather than driving turns through active choice. The tightening (submerging into danger) narrows options, yet no meaningful trade-off or loss alters tactics—equipment acquisition is summarized, not dramatized. Cost is conceptual (years of labor) but lacks visceral, on-page price during escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—survival under sanctions via anonymous donations—is clear early. Pressure accumulates texturally (food runs, gatherings) but lacks a decisive tightening that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The “deepening” is thematic, not tactical; no live alternative is foreclosed. Akira’s declaration is stirring but doesn’t alter the situation—luck or external aid sustains them, not protagonist-driven escalation. Cost is implied but not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—finding unused love—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The “tightening” occurs via breathing exercises, yet this is externally guided, not Aria-driven. No tangible price is paid; stakes lack visceral urgency. Under Accumulative lens, pressure deepens texturally, but without protagonist agency or consequence, escalation feels decorative rather than consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake (“discover the texture of time”) is stated but never tested through concrete opposition or trade-offs. Pressure is atmospheric, not causal: the “retrocognitive trap” imposes no tactical shift or loss. Elian faces no resistance, makes no difficult choice, and pays no visible price—agency is observational, not active. Under an Accumulative lens, the piece lacks a cadence shift or deepening that reweights the stake with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes (“control of seeds”) are abstractly declared but never concretely tested; guards are bypassed off-page, opposition faceless. The “impede” action occurs in narration only, with no visible price altering tactics. Coincidental discovery (arrow) complicates but doesn’t escalate pressure—agency is passive, with luck replacing meaningful trade-offs under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—capturing the sound of trust breaking to heal trauma—is signaled early and deepens through Lyra’s method of collecting absences. The meaningful tightening occurs when she imprints the shattering sound, transforming abstract search into tangible device. However, escalation stems from internal accumulation, not external pressure or trade-offs; no option is lost, no price visibly paid beyond lingering ache. Cost remains conceptual rather than dramatized, weakening causal teeth under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes remain abstract: “destiny’s whispers” and “secrets beyond perception” are declared but never tested. Lumina faces no opposition, trade-off, or consequence—coincidence (the flower message) complicates but also resolves nothing. The dominant stake (capturing illuminated moments) isn’t tightened; it’s merely repeated. No option is foreclosed, no price paid, rendering escalation illusory under any drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.3)
    Dominant stake (“craft safe zones for inquiry”) is stated early but never tested by concrete opposition or internal friction. The “daunting prospect” of venturing into the unknown is mentioned but not enacted—no tactical shift, loss, or trade-off occurs. Pressure remains static; the world “thaws” passively around Elian without forcing a crystallized stance. Agency is performative narration, not consequential action with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—proving vulnerability is power—is declared but not tested through meaningful escalation. The “challenge” of decryption lacks opposition: no time limit, physical barrier, or emotional interference from phobias. Betrayal and identity crisis remain thematic echoes, not active pressures that narrow options. Cost is conceptual (“fragile existence”) but not dramatized as loss, omission, or trade-off. Agency is passive: the code “reveals itself,” undermining “outwit” as earned triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—mapping the endless night—is signaled early but never tested against opposition or complication. Pressure accumulates texturally (deepening shadows, vibrating air) but lacks protagonist-driven escalation; the oracle speaks, and reality bends without resistance. No meaningful tightening forecloses options or forces trade-offs. The storm’s passage feels coincidental, not earned by her act. Cost is implied (“world holding its breath”) but not dramatized as a consequence of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=4.3)
    Stakes remain abstract (“understanding sentience”) with no on-page test or tangible cost. Zeta’s “experiments” occur off-stage via summary, so pressure never tightens; no option is foreclosed, no resource lost. The dominant stake isn’t dramatized—only declared—leaving conflict inert and resolution unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.1)
    Stakes (“thaw mistrust with transparency”) are declared but never tested or tightened. No opposition, complication, or trade-off forces the registrar to risk anything. The “conflict” is internal abstraction without external manifestation—no live option is foreclosed, no price paid. Coincidence doesn’t resolve because nothing was ever at stake; pressure remains static throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes are declared (“to prove that gardens know their gardeners”) but never concretely tested or jeopardized. There is no escalation: no threat to the garden, no failure of care, no visitor skepticism that forces defense or doubt. The “measurable luck” premise hints at external pressure but vanishes after its mention, leaving conflict internalized and consequence-free. Without opposition or risk, the dominant stake floats unanchored in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—proving time moves sideways—is signaled early, but pressure never tightens meaningfully. The malfunctioning simulator is repaired with ease; the nexus appears without opposition. Kaelin’s “breakthrough” carries no tangible loss (time, reputation, safety). Coincidence (the nexus forming perfectly) resolves the experiment, not agency. No option is foreclosed; she leaves energized, not altered by sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the maestro’s hidden message—is signaled early and deepens through Rachel’s manipulation of water on the program. The escalation is driven by her agency (“gently tilted the program”), aligning with the Accumulative lens. Yet the “cost” remains ethereal: peace and inspiration replace loss or sacrifice, making the price feel conceptual rather than felt. No option is foreclosed; she gains without measurable trade-off, softening the pressure required for high-band conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—uncovering hidden truth amid uncertainty—is signaled early and deepens through collaborative annotation. Pressure accumulates texturally rather than causally, consistent with the inferred lens. Yet no on-page reversal or choice narrows options; Aria’s “smudging” faces no resistance or consequence. The cost (“auroral sorrow”) is poignant but conceptual, not tied to a forfeited opportunity or altered tactic, weakening escalation under even Accumulative expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.3)
    Dominant stake (“find the weight of a swallowed truth”) is signaled early but remains abstract and untested by concrete opposition. Pressure doesn’t escalate—radio voices and a logbook complicate atmosphere, not agency. The explorer faces no trade-offs; discovery is passive, not earned through renunciation or risk. Coincidence (stumbling on the logbook) resolves the quest without cost, violating the lens guardrail that luck may complicate but not solve.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—finding regenerative silence—is signaled early but never tested under pressure. The “burrow” action deepens atmosphere but doesn’t narrow options or incur loss. Agency is passive: the keeper responds to whispers, swan folds, and urges, not active decisions. Cost is asserted (“fractures in their soul healed”) but never felt as sacrifice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—nurturing lifelong wonder—is declared but never tested under pressure. Eli arrives already receptive; no resistance, doubt, or failure complicates Aria’s mission. The eclipse deepens atmosphere but introduces no meaningful tightening: music adapts, boy watches, connection blooms effortlessly. Cost is implied (“fragile beauty”) but never dramatized as loss, trade-off, or consequence. Agency is passive observation, not decision or endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain abstract: “uncover secrets,” “understand stories.” No tightening occurs—Emilia faces no obstacle, trade-off, or narrowing of options. The “displaced axis” and “half-burned diaries” hint at mystery but generate no pressure. Conflict is passive reception, not active struggle. Coincidence (finding key objects) replaces agency; resolution arrives via reading, not choice with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.3)
    Stakes are proclaimed (“life about to change,” “hidden truth”) but never tested in scene. Pressure is static: the stranger appears, listens, departs—no opposition, negotiation, or trade-off occurs. The dominant stake (“open secrets”) remains conceptual, never materializing as a live dilemma with consequence. Coincidence (the stranger’s arrival) resolves nothing because nothing was at risk to begin with.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—unraveling stillness to prevent possession—is declared but not viscerally felt. Pressure escalates only texturally (whispers grow louder), not causally; the priest faces no resistance, doubt, or trade-off. The “before possession completes” timeframe creates nominal urgency but no tactical shifts. Agency is passive: he performs, succeeds, and leaves. No path is foreclosed; no price is paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—reigniting creative spark through memory mapping—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or complication. The “tightening” is merely increased movement (“pace quickened”), not narrowed options. No visible price is paid: exhaustion is deferred by time-bending, and the map yields insight without loss. Coincidence (dawn light strengthening) aids rather than complicates, undercutting agency. Cost remains conceptual, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake (“conquer the labyrinth of self”) is declared early but never tested through meaningful trade-offs. Pressure is atmospheric, not consequential—obstacles are “overcome through mastery” without struggle or loss. The “darkening brightness” tone shift signals escalation but lacks agency-driven tightening; echoes are integrated effortlessly. No on-page cost alters later tactics, violating the requirement that stakes materialize in scene with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming feeling through silent music—is signaled early and deepens as humming intensifies and numbness recedes. Yet escalation is atmospheric, not agentic: Aria doesn’t confront obstacles or make higher-stakes choices; the world responds to her presence rather than resisting it. Cost is conceptual (lost sound) but not dramatized as forfeiture or error. Under Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices, but agency remains passive, weakening pressure coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake (exposing illicit lab) is signaled but never tested on-page; tension remains hypothetical. Pressure plateaus after the message arrives, then dissipates into reflection. The “rogue quarantine zone” raises stakes abstractly but imposes no tactical constraint or immediate danger. Protagonist’s agency is limited to interpretation, not action—no risk taken, no price paid. Coincidence (being followed) introduces threat but vanishes without escalation or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=5.3)
    Dominant stake (processing grief via scent-memory) is signaled early but never tested under coherent pressure. The “transformation” of plants complicates nothing—it’s a coincidental mood shift, not a consequence of Elara’s actions. No meaningful tightening occurs: her decision to grieve is consequence-free, with no foreclosed paths or trade-offs. Agency is absent; she observes, breathes, and exits unchanged in capability or circumstance, violating Situational lens expectations for stance crystallization under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—navigating impossible choices post-energy beings—is declared but never tested on the page. No option is renounced, no trade-off made; the poet merely contemplates. Pressure remains static, accumulating mood but not escalating consequence. The rope hums with tension, yet no decision arises from it. Under an Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices, but here the “deepening” is thematic repetition, not a narrowing of options or raised cost.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—finding raw beauty amid ruin—is signaled early and deepens through the violinist’s encounter with communal storytelling. However, pressure remains atmospheric, not active; no obstacle tests her desire until the bonfire appears unearned. The meaningful turn occurs when she plays, but this stems from invitation, not struggle. Cost is conceptual (the irreversible loss of the forest), yet it’s not dramatized as altering her tactics—only her perception shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—crafting believable half-truth emotions for a discerning client—is signaled early but never tested under pressure. There’s no opposition, complication, or meaningful deepening; the process unfolds smoothly without risk, error, or trade-off. The “most discerning client” exerts no actual pressure, remaining off-page. Escalation is atmospheric, not dramatic; the story accumulates texture but avoids conflict that would force renunciation, endurance, or decision with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—honoring silent contributors—is declared late and never tested under pressure. The “meaningful tightening” is absent: Lena’s proposal faces no resistance, cost, or complication. Coincidence drives connection, not agency; stakes remain conceptual, not visceral. No option is narrowed, no price paid—escalation is thematic assertion, not dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—belonging—is signaled early but never tested under coherent pressure. The “shared search” introduces no real obstacle, risk, or meaningful tightening; the tag appears conveniently at sunset with no struggle. Agency is passive: Kael reacts to discovery rather than making a costly choice. The absence of opposition (social, environmental, or internal) flattens escalation—there’s no narrowing of options, only a smooth glide toward acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—finding the echo birthplace—is signaled early and deepens via the time-borrowing ritual. Pressure escalates texturally: mist evaporates, water slows, light glows, perception expands. Yet escalation relies on passive receptivity, not active choice under duress. The “borrowed time” tightens nothing; Lyra succeeds fully, then departs unscathed. A live clock (the giant’s nap) is present but doesn’t force tactical shifts—no urgency, no failed attempt, no narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—deciphering emotion’s hidden harmonies—is signaled early and deepens at climax, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure. The ritual unfolds without obstacle, opposition, or meaningful trade-off; the “eerie stillness” cues timing but imposes no constraint. Cost remains conceptual (“ambiguous loss”) rather than dramatized through forfeiture or altered tactics. Under an Accumulative lens, one intensification suffices, but here it’s atmospheric, not agential—luck or environment guides the turn, not choice.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—being seen by those who need the dweller—is signaled early and deepens after the memory triggers renewed urgency. The tightening occurs when city lights return, shifting from passive scavenging to active curation. Yet agency is muted: the dweller reacts to stimuli (tape, light return) rather than making a costly choice that narrows options. Stakes remain abstract; no on-page consequence proves what visibility would truly cost or gain.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes remain abstract (“need to change,” “embrace uncertainty”) with no concrete tightening or deepening that narrows options. The storm season exerts no real pressure—Emilia faces no loss, deadline, or consequence tied to inaction. Her “reluctance” dissolves without resistance, and the supposed agency of “reconstructing her approach” manifests as internal affirmation, not behavior with cost. Coincidence doesn’t resolve, but neither does protagonist-driven escalation occur.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=5.3)
    The dominant stake—“thresh meaning”—is declared but never tested through concrete trade-offs; the protagonist faces no real resistance or consequence. The “exchange” with the stranger lacks tension—information is granted too easily, and no price is paid that alters later action. Escalation is summary-driven (“I became obsessed… set out… found myself”) rather than pressure-driven, violating the Causal/Accumulative lens requirement for meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—deepening clairvoyance—is signaled early but never tested under coherent pressure. The “steadily unpredictable” pearl introduces novelty but no real opposition or trade-off; Aria’s abilities simply expand without cost or complication. No meaningful tightening occurs: the cave deepens, light brightens, understanding grows—all additive, never restrictive. Coincidence (the pilgrim’s gift) resolves rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake (compiling fragments to heal community) is signaled early but never tested under coherent pressure—no obstacles, resource limits, or interpersonal friction arise. The “staggered intervals” method is mentioned but doesn’t shape tactics or create trade-offs. Coincidence drives progress: the shop yields the perfect relic, the community gathers without skepticism. Cost is asserted (“devastating impact of exile”) but never felt in protagonist’s actions or losses.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake (“uncover secrets”) is declared early but never tested by concrete opposition or trade-off. Pressure remains static—mist deepens, light appears, but Emilia faces no dilemma, delay, or depletion that alters tactics. The “phantom train ticket punch” introduces potential agency yet resolves nothing; it vibrates but imposes no cost or constraint. Escalation reads as sequential description (“she walked… turned… stepped”) rather than protagonist-driven deepening under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—unlocking entangled memories to understand town-tower-sea connections—is signaled early but remains abstract and untested by concrete opposition. Pressure accumulates texturally (whale songs, shimmering symbols) but lacks a tightening that forecloses options or demands sacrifice. Emilia’s agency is limited to transcription, which proceeds without obstacle, making the “cost” of her insight purely conceptual and unearned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—answering “what happens after goodbye?”—is signaled early and deepens through Kael’s experiment. Pressure escalates via the intensifying solar storm and surging energy, culminating in the duplicate’s appearance. Agency is present: Kael actively weaves fields and chooses to reach out. Cost is felt (solitude ends, identity fractures), but the “spatial mutiny” power resolves cleanly without complication or trade-off beyond philosophical insight. No visible loss (time, tool, capacity) sharpens the price; stakes remain conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—securing asylum through a breach of protocol—is signaled early and tightens when the director’s reluctance becomes an active obstacle. However, the escalation relies on off-stage “negotiation” rather than protagonist-driven pressure; Lena’s agency emerges only in the final beat. The cost (“get us caught”) is declared but not embodied or tested on the page. Under the Situational lens, this qualifies as coherent pressure forcing stance crystallization, but the lack of a visible price paid limits emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—capturing the texture of a fleeting moment—is signaled early and sustained, but it never tightens into meaningful conflict. There’s no opposition, internal or external, and no escalation beyond the lamp’s hum growing louder then fading. The stationer’s agency is passive observation, not decision or renunciation. While the Accumulative lens allows for density over causality, the absence of any trade-off, loss, or narrowed option leaves stakes abstract and consequence-free.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes remain abstract (“reconstruct erased histories”) with no on-page test or narrowing of options. The dominant stake is declared but never pressured—no obstacle, opposition, or tradeoff forces a higher-stakes choice. “Layering stories” proceeds uninterrupted, unchallenged, and cost-free, violating the requirement that escalation must reweight the dominant stake under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—decoding the universal riddle—is declared but never tested concretely; the “conflict” is atmospheric, not causal. Pressure accumulates through sensory density, not protagonist-driven escalation. The myth buster’s actions don’t narrow options or incur visible cost; the resolution arrives via ritualistic performance, not earned renunciation or stance crystallization under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are declared (“preserve the city’s essence”) but never tested through concrete opposition or loss. Privatization looms as a vague deadline, not an active force that narrows options. Ava’s graffiti campaign faces no resistance, surveillance failure, or tactical consequence—pressure is static. The dominant stake lacks escalation; “hopeful desperation” is named but not dramatized through narrowing choices or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—capturing the last flora—is declared but never tested by tangible obstacles; “harsh conditions” are mentioned but never manifest as physical or temporal pressure that forces trade-offs. The chemical timer is introduced but doesn’t alter behavior—it merely “synchronizes” shots without consequence. Agency is passive observation; “outlasting” is asserted, not dramatized through endurance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—calibrating the drone—is signaled early and deepens through sensory attunement. But escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure: the ship’s anchor lift is external coincidence, not a tightening Emilia navigates. No option is foreclosed, no price visibly paid. The “meditative” process avoids real risk or failure, softening stakes into aesthetic refinement rather than consequential repair.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes are declared (“last lead,” “great discovery”) but never concretely tested or jeopardized. No tightening occurs—Emilia faces zero opposition, internal or external. The falcon’s return signals urgency but changes nothing tactically. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure should intensify via density or cadence shift, yet the prose loops without deepening. Coincidence (finding the pattern) resolves the quest, undercutting agency.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—restoring balance through rhythm—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates texturally via deepening silence, strengthening rhythm, and the town’s faint response. Yet no meaningful tightening occurs: the tuner never faces a choice, obstacle, or cost that alters tactics. The “infinitely patient” trait removes struggle; stakes remain abstract (“shared balance”) without visceral consequence. Escalation is atmospheric, not agential—luckily acceptable under Accumulative lens, but lacks the trade-off needed for high-band conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—preserving ancestral memory—is signaled early and carries emotional weight, but “time runs short” exerts no concrete pressure on decisions. No option is foreclosed; no trade-off is made. The tightening is atmospheric, not tactical: energy flows more freely, but Kael faces no escalating obstacles. Coincidence doesn’t resolve, but neither does agency drive escalation—the temple simply responds to her focus without resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.3)
    The dominant stake—uncovering hidden stories—is declared but never tested by concrete opposition or meaningful escalation. The rusted door and lock suggest a barrier, but no attempt to open it occurs, let alone a costful choice. “Before they find the bodies” implies urgency but functions as a dangling threat, not a live clock shaping decisions. Pressure remains ambient, not coherent; the boy drifts through corridors without resistance, narrowing nothing.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.3)
    Dominant stake (“repay a debt across lifetimes”) is declared but never tested—no obstacle impedes the ghost’s guidance or the alchemist’s grasp. The “resonant awakening” occurs effortlessly, void of trade-offs or visible price. Coincidence drives resolution: the bead is simply there, the ghost simply appears. Pressure remains atmospheric, not causal; no tightening forces a renunciation or recalibration of desire.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes are declared (“carve a path from ruin to reverence”) but never tested under pressure. No tightening occurs: Aria sews uninterrupted from dusk to dawn with no obstacle, trade-off, or meaningful deepening. The dominant stake remains abstract, and the absence of opposition—even internal friction—flattens escalation. Coincidence doesn’t resolve anything because nothing complicates the act of sewing.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—reconnection to heritage—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or trade-off. Pressure is internal and static; “purposeful wandering” lacks friction. No option is foreclosed, no price visibly paid. The excavation proceeds unimpeded, turning conflict into ritual rather than struggle. Cost is implied (“lost faith”) but not dramatized in choices or consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—beauty in surface mail’s slowness—is declared but never tested by opposition or loss. Pressure remains static: no obstacle interrupts Cipher’s work, no risk attends the letter’s creation. The “journey” is abstract; no tactical shift occurs due to time, resource, or external interference. Coincidence (morning patrons arriving) complicates nothing. Cost is conceptual (“piece of soul”) but not dramatized through forfeiture, error, or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—preventing a coup by decoding cosmic secrets—is signaled early but never tested concretely. Pressure escalates only atmospherically (“days shortened,” “flame burned brighter”), not causally; the embroiderer faces no obstacles, setbacks, or tradeoffs. Agency is passive: they “listen,” “stitch,” and “know,” but never act against resistance. The tightening is tonal, not tactical—insufficient under any drive lens for high-band conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—confronting unspoken regret through evocation—is signaled early and deepens as messages appear and the spirit manifests. Pressure escalates texturally (spirits crescendo, entity solidifies), but protagonist agency is passive; Aria speaks, but the manifestation arises seemingly by environmental magic, not her tactical choices. Cost is felt (emotional weight lifting), yet no live option is foreclosed by Aria’s actions—she observes and receives, rather than decides or sacrifices. The tightening lacks a decisive narrowing of paths driven by her will.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—confronting shared anxieties—is signaled early but never tested through concrete opposition or trade-offs. The “conflict” remains internal and static; no option is foreclosed, no price paid. Protagonist agency is minimal: she observes, reflects, and drifts into anesthesia. The tightening is atmospheric (mist deepens, vision blurs), not consequential—pressure accumulates texturally but without escalation that alters tactics or knowledge under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—recovering creative joy—is signaled early and deepens via the fresco discovery. But escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure: the “spark” ignites passively upon finding the fragment, not through a costly decision. The exposed film and knowledge network are mentioned but don’t alter tactics under stress. Cost is felt abstractly (“lost joy”) but never made visible through sacrifice, omission, or irreversible action tied to a tightening turn.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—trading certainty for curiosity—is signaled early and deepens through Lena’s deliberate manipulation of sound via mirrors, narrowing her path from restorer to co-creator. The tightening occurs when she initiates the feedback loop, foreclosing passive observation. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: she surrenders control, embracing ambiguity. Escalation is driven by her agency under an Accumulative lens, though the “vortex of noise and color” risks veering into abstraction; the stakes remain viscerally tied to her tactile engagement with pigment, nickel, and glass.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are declared (“thoughts taxable”) but never dramatized under pressure—no surveillance, enforcement, or personal risk materializes. Conflict is absent: Lyra faces no opposition, complication, or trade-off. The “tightening” is illusory; the story describes growing influence, not escalating danger. Without a single reversal, loss, or tactical shift due to constraint, stakes remain abstract and untested.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—transmuting sorrow into art—is signaled early and deepens through the postcard’s emotional trigger. But escalation is atmospheric, not causal: no narrowing of options, no trade-off forced by rising pressure. The “blossom armistice” backstory adds thematic weight but exerts zero on-page tension. Agency is passive contemplation, not decision; the lullaby soothes but solves nothing. Cost is implied (“centuries of longing”) yet never manifests as a concrete forfeiture altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—is signaled early and deepens through the museum of extinct feelings. The escalation occurs when the caretaker sings, coaxing emotions back via the song, which intensifies the emotional weight and connects all elements. Yet the pressure remains static: no option is foreclosed, no resource depleted, no consequence alters her next move. The cost is conceptual (time, loneliness) but not dramatized as a tactical shift—she simply continues “with gently systematic precision.” Under an Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices, but the lack of a felt price paid during the climax (beyond ambient sadness) limits the stakes’ visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring trust through linguistic accuracy—is signaled early and tightens as Elara nears breakthrough. The deepening occurs when symbols “reveal hidden patterns,” shifting her from isolation toward cautious exuberance. Cost is conceptual (years of strained relationships, prolonged silence) but not viscerally dramatized in the moment; the empty ink well symbolizes depletion without tangible sacrifice. Agency is present (her transcription method), yet conflict remains internalized without external resistance or irreversible choice at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—harmonizing preservation and safety—is declared but never tested through concrete escalation. No tightening occurs: Kaelin deciphers a message and feels inspired, but faces no obstacle that forces a costly decision. The “conflict” remains conceptual, with zero on-page pressure that narrows options or demands sacrifice. Coincidence (residue revealing a pattern) solves the puzzle without struggle, undercutting agency.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—balancing secrecy and connection through fabricated identity—is signaled early and accumulates via paper trails and dust rituals. But pressure never tightens into a meaningful trade-off; Emilia faces no external test or internal crisis that forces a costly choice. The “learning to trust again” timeframe is stated but untracked, and the pigeons’ departure carries no risk or consequence. Escalation is textural, not causal: emotions deepen, but stakes remain safely internalized without tangible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—understanding sacred thresholds—is declared but never tested under tangible pressure. The “butterfly effect” timeframe adds conceptual weight but no temporal urgency or tactical consequence. Protagonist’s agency is passive: decoding leads to revelation, not decision. No option is foreclosed; no price is paid. Escalation occurs through accumulating beauty, not deepening conflict or narrowing choices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes (“rhythm of belonging”) remain entirely abstract and untested; no option is foreclosed, no price paid. Conflict is static—no escalation, reversal, or deepening under any lens. The protagonist’s “task” involves no risk, resistance, or trade-off; revelation arrives via ambient attunement, not earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—recovering memory to understand vanishing paths—is signaled early but escalates weakly. The “tightening” comes not from rising pressure but a lucky seed trail, reducing agency. Protagonist follows clues rather than makes trade-offs; no option is foreclosed, no resource spent. The “before memory fades” timeframe creates nominal urgency but doesn’t alter tactics—she hums, walks, deciphers, all at leisure. Coincidence (bird) resolves the central obstacle, undercutting earned escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are declared (“serenade monotony,” “create wonder”) but never concretely tested or endangered. No meaningful tightening occurs: each performance succeeds identically, with no loss, adaptation, or raised cost. The protagonist faces no opposition, internal or external, that forces a trade-off. Under any drive lens, pressure remains static—coincidence (finding the bishop) complicates nothing and resolves nothing.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes are declared (“pen a cosmic verse,” “elective exile”) but never tested by coherent pressure. The “nostalgia ban” is background lore, not a live constraint affecting choices. Aria’s dance resolves nothing—it’s described as transcendent, but no option is foreclosed, no price paid. The escalation is atmospheric, not consequential: the speck glows brighter, but this doesn’t raise cost or narrow paths under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.3)
    Dominant stake (“reveal hidden beauty”) is declared but never tested under coherent pressure. The fisherman’s stone introduces disruption, yet the glazier’s response is contemplative, not consequential—no trade-off, loss, or narrowed option results. “Urgency” is stated, not dramatized; time (“before everything shifts”) exerts no tactical pressure. Coincidental ripple observation replaces protagonist-driven escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake (“translate pain into universal language”) is declared early but never concretely tested or tightened. No meaningful escalation occurs—Kael walks, reflects, feels calm. The “bargains” and “lost innocence” remain abstract; no option is foreclosed, no price paid. Under Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen via pattern break or cadence shift, but the prose cycles through similar lyrical phrases without intensification or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are declared (“bring light into darkness,” “ripple across timelines”) but never tested or tightened through protagonist agency. The “serene upheaval” lacks conflict—no opposition, internal or external, challenges Aria’s work. The vision escalates spectacle, not stakes; nothing is risked or lost. Pressure remains static, and the dominant stake stays abstract, never materializing in a concrete trade-off or irreversible choice.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake (“uncover secrets”) is signaled early but never tested under coherent pressure—no opposition, obstacle, or cost arises from pursuit. The “legacy’s burden” is declared, not dramatized; no choice narrows options or demands sacrifice. Discovery is frictionless: film strip and diaries yield revelations without resistance. Coincidence (finding both clues) complicates nothing and resolves everything, undercutting agency and escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake—persuading mirrors to reveal possibilities—is declared early but never tested through opposition or meaningful escalation. The lullaby “method” works instantly at climax with no prior trial, error, or adaptation. Pressure remains static; the bells create rhythm, not urgency. No option is foreclosed, no price paid—success arrives as atmospheric reward, not earned consequence under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes remain abstract (“lasting peace,” “price of redemption”) with no on-page test or narrowing of options. Delegates shift from “frazzled” to “conciliatory” off-stage, via narration, not protagonist-driven escalation. No reversal, trade-off, or tactical adjustment occurs—Elian “musters” players but faces zero resistance. Coincidence (sunset, stars) substitutes for earned pressure; the dominant stake never materializes in concrete terms.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring land to preserve extinct birds’ echo—is signaled early but never tested by tangible opposition or sacrifice. The “manufactured drought” is backdrop, not active pressure; no interest group resists, no resource is scarce, no price is paid. Protagonist’s agency is performative (“released the waters”) without tactical struggle. Cost is conceptual (loss of beauty), not felt in body, time, or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—freedom from conformity—is signaled early but remains abstract. Pressure accumulates texturally (snow, silence, prism) rather than through escalating opposition or meaningful trade-offs. The protagonist’s “untangling” is passive introspection, not agency that forecloses a path with felt cost. Under an Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices, but here the “harvest of echoes” lacks consequence that alters tactics or imposes price.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes (“explore ethics of storytelling”) remain abstract and untested; no on-page conflict challenges Amaranth’s assumptions or forces renunciation. The “subversive puppet shows” are mentioned but never dramatized, so there’s no live pressure from audience reaction or moral consequence. Under an Accumulative lens, the story accumulates mood but not cost—no deepening narrows her path or raises the price of her mission. Coincidence (finding a quiet dome) enables, but nothing complicates or demands agency.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—honoring forgotten narratives—is declared early but never faces concrete opposition or escalation. The “interrupted cadence” of wings is noted but doesn’t tighten decisions. Aria’s work proceeds uninterrupted; no trade-off, loss, or complication arises. Closure offers resonance, not cost: she departs resolved, with no visible price paid for her mission.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving sound of forgotten names—is signaled early and sustained, but pressure remains static; no meaningful tightening occurs. The task is difficult but never jeopardized. Agency is limited to execution, not decision under duress. Coincidence (aurora pulsing in harmony) borders on resolving tension magically. Cost is emotional but not dramatized as a trade-off or loss that alters behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—understanding why paths choose walkers—is signaled early and deepens through the dream sequence. Pressure escalates via the approaching storm, which tightens time and raises emotional stakes. Yet the “tightening” is atmospheric, not tactical: Hindsight faces no real obstacle or trade-off. Cost is conceptual (loss of autonomy) but not felt through action; the resolution arrives via vision, not choice under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.3)
    Stakes are abstract (“seal a covenant with the unknown”) and never tested through concrete opposition or trade-offs. Pressure does not escalate—only intensifies lyrically. The “liminal moment between regimes” imposes no tactical urgency; the astronomer faces no obstacle, loss, or dilemma that narrows options or demands sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake (“teach release of resentment”) is declared but never tested through concrete opposition or trade-offs. The “convincing” action occurs via deus ex machina melody, not protagonist agency—coincidence resolves rather than complicates. No visible price is paid; tension evaporates without resistance, undermining escalation under any drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—capturing the runaway dream—is signaled early and deepens through the sextant’s discovery and breathing ritual. The meaningful tightening occurs when the mirror’s completion blurs self and dream, forcing the ultimate choice: remain or vanish. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (finding the sextant) complicates but doesn’t resolve. Cost is felt in her disappearance, though the trade-off lacks explicit emotional friction—she soars rather than sacrifices, softening the price.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are declared (“bridge generational wisdom”) but remain abstract; the “breach of contract” exerts no on-page pressure, and Elara faces no obstacles, trade-offs, or escalating costs. The planting of seeds deepens hope but doesn’t tighten options—there’s no risk of failure, no consequence for inaction. Coincidence (Aria returning after hearing of the orchard) resolves emotional distance without prior friction or agency-driven escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—access to forbidden knowledge—is declared but never tested through meaningful opposition or trade-off. The “inquiry” action faces no resistance; the robed figures cooperate instantly. No option is narrowed, no resource spent, no consequence incurred. The stakes remain conceptual rather than visceral, failing to escalate under the Accumulative lens with felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are declared (find library, retrieve diary) but escalate through convenience, not protagonist agency. The “shadowy figures” pose generic threat without adapting or raising tangible costs. Elara’s “renegotiation” is a verbal pivot without demonstrated trade-off, and the final success arrives via discovery, not earned reversal. Pressure remains static, relying on chase tropes rather than deepening moral or tactical dilemmas.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes (“find the Garden”) are declared but never tested through meaningful opposition or trade-off. The “narrative threads” deepen thematically but not dramatically—no option is foreclosed, no price paid. Pressure remains atmospheric, not causal; the fog thickens, but Lyra faces no resistance beyond mild disorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (“understand fables of absence”) is signaled early and deepens via rope-reconfiguration, which narrows interpretive options into a pattern. Pressure accumulates texturally rather than through causal opposition, fitting the Accumulative lens. However, escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency: Emilia watches, then joins—a passive transfer of knowledge. Cost is conceptual (clarity gained) but not felt; no resource is spent, no path foreclosed. Tightening occurs, but without trade-off or irreversible commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring quiet—is signaled early and deepens via the mapkeeper’s methodical study. Pressure escalates texturally (cacophony → harmony), but agency is observational, not interventional; she “conjures” an image, not a tactic. The energy beings adjust *in response* to her vision, making resolution feel external. Cost is conceptual (lost peace regained) but not viscerally paid—no stamina, time, or tool is sacrificed. One meaningful deepening occurs, yet escalation lacks protagonist-driven narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost knowledge—is declared but never tested under meaningful opposition. The custodian faces no obstacles, trade-offs, or failures; success arrives via passive touch. Coincidence (finding the prism) initiates but also resolves the quest, violating the “coincidence may complicate, not resolve” rule. No visible price is paid; escalation is atmospheric, not causal.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving/shaping memory—is signaled early but never tested under pressure. No opposition exists; the “task” faces no obstacle beyond internal reflection. The deepening comes via atmospheric shift (storm to moonlight), not protagonist agency. Cost is implied (weight of memory) but never paid or foreclosed—she simply smiles and leaves. Under an Accumulative lens, this suffices for mild escalation, but stakes remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—defying creative hopelessness—is signaled early and deepens through ambient observation, fitting the Accumulative lens. Yet pressure remains diffuse; there’s no narrowing of options or meaningful loss. The fire spinner and mosaic note complicate but don’t escalate—both serve as inspiration, not obstacles. Agency is passive (watching, walking, receiving insight), and the “cost” of hopelessness vanishes without sacrifice, weakening the emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake—understanding “the texture of time”—is declared but never tested under pressure. The chronicler faces no obstacle, makes no choice with cost, and experiences no reversal. The “pause” between figures offers potential tension, but she observes it passively; their resolution occurs off-stage emotionally. No meaningful tightening occurs—reflection deepens, but stakes remain abstract and consequence-free.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—overcoming claustrophobia through controlled exposure—is signaled early and tightens during the inversion when Eli releases the doll, surrendering control. This act deepens their commitment and narrows options: they must rely on inner resources, not physical anchors. Cost is felt in lingering dread and the vulnerability of letting go. Escalation is subtle but coherent under the Accumulative lens, though protagonist agency could be sharper in initiating the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are declared (“teach silence how to comfort”) but never tested or escalated; no opposition, obstacle, or complication arises. The operator’s method—monitoring noise—is stated but never shown to shape decisions or encounter resistance. Coincidence (the train whistle) frames time but doesn’t pressure action. Under an Accumulative lens, the piece lacks a cadence shift or density increase that reweights the dominant stake with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake (“reclaim the throne”) is declared early but remains abstract; no tangible price is paid during the quest. The “sally forth before sunrise” deadline introduces time pressure, yet Aria faces no obstacles that force adaptation or loss. Escalation is decorative (more murals, brighter light) rather than consequential. Coincidence—not agency—reveals the staircase when the ruby flake “flares to life,” undermining earned progression under any drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—preserving/reviving the sanctuary—is signaled early and deepens when the threshold fades. Yet escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency: the keeper “senses a change,” then passively “links through scars,” and the sanctuary “stirs” on its own. No meaningful tightening occurs; options aren’t narrowed, and no trade-off forces a costly choice. The shift from isolation to reconnection is thematic, not tactical—pressure accumulates atmospherically, not through escalating opposition or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.3)
    Dominant stake—fulfilling the “quantum promise”—is declared but never concretely tested; “translating pressure into diamonds” resolves via unearned machine burst, not protagonist agency. Glitchy texts complicate but don’t escalate pressure meaningfully; the lab’s “strange occurrences” vanish without consequence. No visible trade-off or narrowed option tightens the narrative under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake (“uncover hidden truth”) is signaled early but never faces concrete opposition—no obstacle, trade-off, or narrowing of options occurs. The crank handle’s activation is frictionless; standing waves appear without resistance or risk. Cost is declared (“dynasty will be the last”) but not felt or dramatized—no sacrifice, time loss, or emotional toll alters tactics. Escalation is textural (hum grows louder, visions intensify) but lacks agency-driven deepening under the Accumulative lens; the protagonist receives insight, doesn’t earn it.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake (“capture the shape of possibility”) is signaled early but remains abstract, never tested by concrete opposition or loss. The knight faces no resistance, makes no sacrifice, and encounters no obstacle beyond mild disorientation. Escalation is atmospheric, not tactical—energies “surge,” walls “ripple,” but options don’t narrow. Coincidence (finding the program) initiates change, but agency lies in passive reception, not decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are declared (“magnify small kindnesses”) but never tested in scene—no obstacle forces Emilia to choose between competing goods or endure loss. Pressure remains static; “dust patterns” don’t complicate her task, and the emancipation timeframe exerts no tactical urgency. The dominant stake lacks escalation: her work proceeds unimpeded, and the “cost” of remembrance is abstract. Coincidence (finding the button) initiates but doesn’t deepen conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes (“tyranny of indifference”) are declared early but never concretized into on-page opposition; authorities are absent, plans unravel offstage, and no reversal tests Aria’s resolve. The “reappearance” is consequence-free—she arrives, speaks, departs. Under an Accumulative lens, escalation requires density increase with cost, but the gathering scene deepens theme without raising personal or tactical price. Coincidence (puddle map) guides action but faces no friction.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—hushing a cryptic prophecy—is signaled early but never concretely tested or escalated beyond atmospheric unease. The saxophonist’s agency is performative, not tactical; her music works by fiat, not struggle. No visible price is paid: stamina, social risk, or personal sacrifice remain absent. The “eerie nostalgia” and swirling mist complicate mood, not stakes, and resolution comes via aesthetic triumph, not earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—decoding the leaf-message—is signaled early and deepens when the moonstone reveals hidden patterns. Yet escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency: the speck glows brighter *on its own*, and the prophecy “reveals itself” passively. Cost is conceptual (time, attention) but never felt as loss or trade-off; no option is foreclosed. Pressure accumulates texturally, but under the Accumulative lens, the single intensification (glow → pattern) suffices for mid-band, not high.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—finding direction amid chaos—is signaled early and deepens via the compass rose’s activation. Elian’s improvisation constitutes agency, and the cost is conceptual: surrendering the illusion of control. But escalation lacks a tangible trade-off; no resource, time, or tool is lost to raise stakes. The “befriending uncertainty” resolution is thematically apt but not pressured by external or internal opposition beyond ambient melancholy.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—self-redemption through knowledge—is signaled early but never tested by concrete opposition. Pressure remains internal and static; there’s no meaningful tightening, only cyclical reflection. The disbandment of the search party is backstory, not active pressure. Agency manifests as passive pondering, not decision or renunciation with visible cost. Coincidence (rain washing away failure) substitutes for earned escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—guiding lost souls to peace—is signaled early but remains abstract. The tightening occurs when the harp’s dissonance intensifies, yet the collector faces no meaningful resistance or trade-off; her presence alone resolves the conflict. Agency is passive listening, not decision or endurance with cost. Under Accumulative lens, pressure deepens texturally, but stakes lack visceral urgency or consequence beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—confronting trauma to achieve redemption—is signaled early but remains abstract. Pressure escalates texturally (brighter light, writhing trees), yet Elara faces no meaningful obstacle or trade-off; Arin yields instantly, restraints vanish without struggle. The “mathematics of mercy” is declared but never tested through action. No visible price is paid; the epiphany arrives without cost, violating Situational escalation norms.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—unlocking hidden stories—is signaled early but never tested under coherent pressure. The “anchors of intuition” deepen thematically but don’t narrow options or impose trade-offs; Lena faces no obstacle, sacrifice, or dilemma. Her agency is passive observation, not decision or renunciation. Coincidence (spotting the painting) drives insight, not protagonist action, violating Situational/Accumulative escalation norms.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—uncovering forgotten truths—is signaled early and deepens through ghostly manifestations and the logbook, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure. Ezra’s analysis of dust leads passively to a discovery; no choice narrows options or incurs cost. The tightening is atmospheric, not tactical: ghosts solidify because the narrative demands it, not due to Ezra’s actions. Under an Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices, but the absence of agency-driven consequence limits cost legibility at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—compressing eternity—is signaled early and deepens via the whisper’s revelation. The operator’s agency drives the escalation: opening the bottle, interpreting the message, executing the prints. Yet pressure remains conceptual; no tactical trade-offs, losses, or foreclosed paths manifest. The “rupture” promises systemic destabilization, but consequences are described, not dramatized—cost is implied by swirling clouds, not earned through character sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reimagining a lost civilization—is signaled early and deepens through the shard’s discovery. Yet pressure remains abstract; the “heated dispute” with colleagues exists off-page, removing immediate opposition. The visible cost is emotional (sorrow), not tactical or social. The storm and time’s visibility complicate but don’t force trade-offs; agency manifests as persistence, not choice under duress. One meaningful deepening occurs, but stakes lack on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring balance between light and darkness—is signaled early and deepens through the act of repairing the unplayable box. Pressure escalates texturally via the glowing chip and tightening focus on hidden harmonies, culminating in a cadence shift at the crystalline note. Yet the conflict lacks tangible opposition or trade-offs; success arrives without visible sacrifice or tactical adaptation. The “covenant of rust” implies cost, but no concrete loss (time, tool, stamina) alters Erebus’s approach, softening the stakes’ visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—accessing a realm beyond reason—is signaled early and deepens through sensory immersion. Yet the conflict remains internal and atmospheric without tangible opposition or consequence; the “hinged awakenings” produce wonder but no visible cost or foreclosed path. The protagonist’s agency is passive reception (“allowed herself to be present”) rather than active choice under pressure. Escalation occurs via density, not causality, which fits the lens but lacks a felt price that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—artistic inspiration—is declared but never tested under real pressure; the storm rages, yet Aria works uninterrupted. The “tightening” is conceptual (“timewoven alliances”), not experiential, and no option is foreclosed or trade-off made. Coincidence (GPS failure) delivers the slide, but agency lies in passive reception, not active struggle. Cost remains rhetorical (“felt cost” is asserted, not dramatized), violating the Situational/Accumulative requirement for coherent pressure that crystallizes stance.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding why flowers bloom at night—is signaled early and deepens into a metaphysical insight about interconnectedness. Pressure accumulates texturally rather than through conflict; there’s no opposition, obstacle, or meaningful tightening that narrows options. The “dawning hush” acts as atmosphere, not pressure. Cost is conceptual (loss of vibrancy in art), but it’s asserted rather than dramatized through sacrifice or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes (“uncover truth”) are declared but never tested by concrete opposition or trade-offs. No meaningful tightening occurs: the diary’s “secrets” yield effortlessly once Ada appears. The tension between revelation and secrecy remains abstract, with no visible price paid for knowledge. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure should intensify via density or cadence shift—but the prose maintains a steady, undifferentiated hum.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are declared (“reimagine an entire civilization”) but never tested against opposition or scarcity. There is no tightening of options—only contemplation followed by effortless manifestation. The alchemist faces no trade-offs, losses, or complications; the “daunting task” incurs no fatigue, doubt, or material constraint. Coincidence (the town responding to presence) resolves what should be earned through struggle, violating the Situational lens’s demand for coherent pressure forcing stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—archiving emotional patterns to understand the present—is signaled early but never tested under concrete opposition. The “accidental prophecy” escalates stakes abstractly; no on-page reversal narrows options or forces a costly choice. Pressure accumulates texturally but lacks agency-driven deepening. Coincidence (memory surfacing) complicates but doesn’t sharpen conflict, leaving stakes felt yet unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.3)
    Dominant stake (“preserve balance”) is declared but never tested through concrete opposition or trade-offs. Pressure remains abstract (“forces of chaos”) with no narrowing of options—the vortex opens effortlessly, visions arrive passively, and the “burden” incurs zero tactical cost. Protagonist agency is illusory: blowing the cap triggers predetermined revelations without resistance. Coincidence resolves nothing because nothing resists; escalation is density of description, not deepening of stakes under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—listening vs. noise—is signaled early and deepens when Ember shifts focus to the bell. The meaningful tightening occurs at the solstice hush, where stillness pressures her to act. However, escalation relies on atmospheric coincidence (wind dying) rather than protagonist-driven pressure; her “urge” feels reactive, not agentic. Cost is visible (abandoning sirens) but not dramatized as loss—more implied than felt, limiting emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes remain abstract (“beauty of the cosmos,” “strength in vulnerability”) without concrete on-page tests. No tightening occurs: the janitor’s task (sweeping) never conflicts with desire or forces trade-offs. The dominant stake—finding meaning in stillness—is declared but never jeopardized; nothing threatens loss of the lantern, job, or insight. Agency is passive observation, not decision or endurance with cost. Coincidence doesn’t resolve, but neither does protagonist action escalate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake (preserving memory) is signaled early but never tested under pressure. No meaningful tightening occurs: the ghosts’ appearance complicates atmosphere but doesn’t alter options or demand trade-offs. Agency is observational, not active; the climax is revelation, not decision. Cost remains conceptual (“weight of unspoken words”) without concrete forfeiture (time, safety, sanity) that changes later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are declared (“understand the texture of time”) but never tested through concrete opposition or trade-offs. The “suddenly timeless” world imposes no tactical limitations—no missed appointments, no decay, no urgency lost. The garage-sale method introduces no risk or failure; responses arrive conveniently. Pressure remains ambient, not coherent, and the “hidden pattern” climax lacks protagonist-driven escalation or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—discovering beauty in incompleteness—is signaled early but never tested under coherent pressure. The snapped kite string introduces discord but resolves instantly without consequence; the poet merely glances up and resumes. No meaningful tightening occurs: her method (“harmonizing discord”) faces no resistance. Agency is observational, not tactical; she endures rather than chooses, forfeiting opportunity for cost-driven escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—leaving a legacy of interspecies respect—is signaled early but remains abstract, never tested by concrete opposition or sacrifice. The six-month deadline should tighten pressure, yet the caretaker faces no obstacles, setbacks, or trade-offs; their work proceeds unimpeded. Agency is passive observation and recording, not decision under duress. Cost is mentioned (“health declined”) but never alters action or forces renunciation, violating the Accumulative lens’s need for reweighted stakes with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—understanding “the chemistry of homecoming”—is signaled early but remains entirely abstract, never tested by concrete loss or opposition. No meaningful tightening occurs: the path is walked without obstacle, the entity appears without resistance, and the skeptic’s “pilgrimage” entails zero tactical adaptation. Cost is asserted (“trepidation”) but never felt or paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—to restore life to scarred land—is signaled early but never tested under pressure. No obstacle arises; the act of fertilizing meets no resistance, doubt, or complication. Agency is performative, not consequential; the coachman’s effort faces no risk of failure, fatigue, or moral ambiguity. Cost is declared (“ravages of war”) but not incurred on the page—no visible price alters tactics or tightens options.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—revitalizing the wasteland—is declared but never tested through meaningful opposition. The “wild hush” and trek provide atmosphere, not pressure; no stamina loss, wrong turns, or resource scarcity alter tactics. The riddle functions as a plot device, not a source of escalating tension. Cost is implied (“long and arduous” journey) but never dramatized—Lyra and Kael arrive unscathed, with no visible price paid for their hope.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—reconnection with meaning after temporal exile—is signaled early but never tightens into a concrete trade-off. The flickering light introduces potential escalation, yet Aria faces no opposition, obstacle, or dilemma; her sketching is meditative, not tactical. Pressure remains static, accumulating texture without deepening conflict. Coincidence (compass aligning with light) resolves narrative tension rather than protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (“amend the sky”) is signaled early but remains abstract; erratic heavens lack on-page manifestation beyond visual description. Pressure doesn’t escalate—Moonwhisper moves “with cautious abandon” through empty tunnels, encountering no opposition or complication. The climax involves no risk, reversal, or sacrifice, violating the “felt cost” requirement for meaningful tightening under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake (“unbind the past”) is signaled early but remains abstract; no concrete obstacle tests it. The alliance forms instantly without friction or trade-off, undercutting escalation. Coincidence drives the plot (mysterious figure appears, words spell out conveniently). Though the interregnum implies urgency, no tactical shift occurs due to time pressure—agency is passive observation, not decision under constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes remain declarative (“unlock forgotten truth,” “understand the shape of home”) without on-page testing or escalation. The “buried talents” concept is mentioned but never forces a trade-off or narrows options. The climax—using a feather to seed reality—resolves via convenience, not protagonist-driven pressure. No visible price is paid; the “hidden thunder” signals anticipation but delivers no consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled early and deepens through the decoding act, which narrows his focus to a single path: the labyrinth. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, intensifying via cadence shifts (breathing as “only movement,” fingers moving with “increasing urgency”). However, escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency; the tapestry *reveals* the message rather than his choices altering its meaning. Cost is thematic (guilt lifting) but not dramatized as a trade-off—no tool lost, time spent, or alternative abandoned—limiting stakes’ visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—uncovering truth through art before the ritual—is signaled early, but the ritual itself exerts no measurable pressure on tactics or timing. The “price of forgiveness” remains abstract; no trade-off or loss alters the artist’s approach. Escalation is textural (words intensify, mist swirls), but agency is passive: she speaks, and the world responds magically. Cost is asserted, not dramatized—no path is foreclosed, no resource spent.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the statue before suffocation—is signaled early and tightens via physiological escalation (blurring vision, stale lungs). Agency is maintained through persistent action, but the “deepening” hinges on memory rather than a tactical pivot. Cost is felt (near-asphyxiation), yet the workshop’s creaking and sea’s churning remain atmospheric rather than actively narrowing options. Escalation is textural, not causal, which fits the lens—but lacks a decisive trade-off beyond endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes remain abstract (“capture fleeting beauty,” “keep a promise to herself”) and never face concrete on-page tests. The dominant stake—artistic authenticity—is declared but unchallenged; no obstacle forces trade-offs. The “wrong turn” introduces complication via luck, not agency, and resolution comes through passive revelation, not renunciation or endurance. No visible cost alters later tactics; the painter returns unchanged except in inspiration.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are declared (“prove whispers travel farther than shouts”) but never concretely tested or jeopardized. No meaningful tightening occurs—Elian’s “beckoning” produces no consequence, opposition, or trade-off. The dominant stake remains abstract throughout, with zero on-page friction between desire and reality. Agency is illusory; the universe obligingly delivers “sweetness” without resistance or price.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming the past through reverse migration—is signaled early but remains conceptual rather than viscerally pressured. The moon-phase fluctuation introduces a constraint, yet it never forces a trade-off or narrows options in-scene (e.g., she simply waits for full moon). The cryptic calls offer “clues,” but no attempt fails or backfires, so escalation lacks friction. Closure crystallizes her stance (acceptance), but the journey feels unimpeded—no obstacle tests her resolve, making the “perilous” claim unearned and cost abstract rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake—tempering involuntary honesty—is declared but never tested through active conflict. The forager finds cures and “experiments,” yet no consequence, failure, or dilemma arises from this action. Pressure remains static: external world offers clues; protagonist receives them. Coincidence drives plot (stumbling upon eye, cache), not agency. No visible price alters tactics; the “unease” is noted but doesn’t complicate decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake—decoding the stranger’s gesture—is declared but never tested under pressure; Kael observes, wonders, and retrieves the boutonnière without risk, loss, or trade-off. The “borrowed memories” premise introduces conceptual stakes but remains inert, never forcing a renunciation or endurance with visible cost. Escalation is absent: the encounter deepens atmospherically but not dramatically, violating the Accumulative lens requirement for a density shift that reweights the central stake.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—fulfilling her father’s promise—is declared but never viscerally tested; obstacles are whimsical (ants, symbols) rather than oppositional. The creek’s rise introduces time pressure, yet Emilia acts at leisure, and the flood recedes conveniently. No meaningful trade-off occurs: she gains maps, legacy, and peace without loss. Agency is passive (“decided to follow,” “led her”), and luck—not choice—drives discovery, violating Situational/Accumulative escalation norms.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes are declared (“unravel the mystery,” “fabric of reality unravels”) but never tested concretely on the page. Pressure accumulates atmospherically, not through protagonist-driven escalation or narrowing of options. The queen’s climb entails no trade-offs, losses, or tactical shifts—agency is passive observation. Coincidence (the hooded warning) sets up stakes but doesn’t complicate them; resolution is deferred beyond the story’s bounds.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.3)
    Dominant stake (“capture density of presence”) is abstract and never tested against opposition or trade-off. No escalation occurs—pressure remains ambient, not coherent. The whispered secret resolves the quest without struggle, violating “coincidence may complicate, not resolve.” No visible cost or narrowed options result from her work; success arrives via intuition, not agency-driven deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.3)
    Dominant stake—distilling chaos into narrative—is declared but never tested under coherent pressure. No tightening occurs: the act of writing faces no obstacle, time limit, or consequence. “Feral nostalgia” is named as motive but doesn’t narrow options or force trade-offs. Agency is absent; the protagonist floats through dreams without resistance, choice, or cost. Coincidence (seeing one’s grave) initiates but isn’t woven into escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes remain abstract (“unveil ordinary miracles”) with no escalation or tightening. No meaningful pressure forces a choice—Elara observes, reflects, leaves. The dominant stake is declared but never tested; coincidence (finding the screw) complicates nothing. Under an Accumulative lens, there’s density but no pattern break or cadence shift that reweights stakes with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—deciphering runes to transform personal scars—is signaled early and deepens via the mentor’s axiom about stress crystallizing power. The “held breath” tightens pressure into a live temporal constraint, and the quill’s activation carries implied cost (it ends “spent”). Yet escalation remains passive: Kaito doesn’t *choose* under duress; he receives inspiration. The storm’s parting feels coincidental rather than earned by agency, weakening causal linkage under even an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—reconnecting with Astra—is signaled early and sustained, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure. The “hush before the orchard’s destruction” introduces external tension but doesn’t alter Lyra’s tactics or narrow her path. No meaningful trade-off occurs; the apology transmits effortlessly via mystical means. Coincidence (finding the bottle) complicates nothing and resolves everything, undercutting agency under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake (“unify fragmented truths”) is signaled but never tested through concrete opposition or trade-offs. The “hiccup” removes external pressure rather than intensifying it, and Aria’s journey inward/outward lacks tactical consequence—no option is foreclosed, no price paid. Escalation is declarative (“senses heightened,” “distortions cleared”) without protagonist-driven deepening or narrowing of paths.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes (“understand time”) are abstract and never tested through concrete opposition or loss. The “razor edges of time” concept is mentioned but doesn’t tighten options or force trade-offs. Counting backwards is presented as method, yet produces no new knowledge, error, or consequence—pressure remains static. No escalation occurs; the story deepens texture but not stakes, violating the Accumulative lens requirement for a density shift that reweights the dominant concern with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes (“revolutionize connection”) are declared but never tested; no tightening occurs—Lena’s walk yields insight without resistance, trade-off, or consequence. The “familiar strangers” exert zero pressure, and the laser button never functions as a tool that enables or limits action. Under an Accumulative lens, the story accumulates description but not meaningful pressure or cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—helping her father—is signaled early, but pressure never escalates beyond reflection. No on-page reversal or deepening narrows options; Elara’s “traversing” yields insights but no tactical shift with consequence. The heart attack sets urgency, yet time exerts no clock-like pressure. Cost is implied (emotional labor) but never dramatized as a trade-off that alters her approach or sacrifices something tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes (“human connection through wrong numbers”) are declared but never tested under pressure; no reversal, loss, or trade-off occurs. The “loop” of callers is observed, not engaged with in a way that deepens conflict or forces a costly stance. Coincidence (wrong numbers) structures the premise but resolves nothing—yet nothing needed resolving, revealing static stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.3)
    No coherent conflict escalates. The dominant stake—preserving memory—is declared but never challenged, tested, or complicated. There’s no opposition, obstacle, or internal struggle that tightens options. The archivist faces zero resistance; her work proceeds uninterrupted, making the “cost” entirely theoretical. Coincidence (finding the covenant) replaces agency.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—combating loneliness through catalyzed connection—is signaled early and deepens as the crowd’s despair shifts to community. However, escalation relies on off-stage rumor propagation rather than Raven’s active, costly decisions under pressure. The “chain reaction of kindness” unfolds conveniently without resistance, friction, or trade-offs, softening the stakes’ visceral urgency despite thematic clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—finding the stillpoint to heal inner sorrow—is signaled early, and pressure accumulates via intensifying melody and tingling skin. But escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency: the forest *gives* clues (notes grow louder, ring glows), and the mapmaker *receives*. No meaningful tightening occurs; paths aren’t narrowed, options aren’t weighed. Cost is implied (“trepidation”) but never paid—no stamina lost, no wrong turn taken, no price for knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—editing history through narrative control—is signaled early but never concretely tested; Aria writes effortlessly with no resistance or consequence. The garden failure complicates but doesn’t escalate pressure; it’s reframed as necessary, diffusing tension. Agency lies in interpretation, not action, which fits the lens but yields low-cost escalation. No visible price is paid for wielding the pen’s power.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.3)
    Dominant stake (“translate silence into music”) is declared but never tested under coherent pressure. No meaningful escalation occurs—the “symphony” emerges effortlessly, with no obstacles, trade-offs, or costs paid. The advisor’s actions lack agency; outcomes feel granted by ambiance, not earned by choice. Coincidence (the old man’s presence) enables resolution without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.3)
    Stakes are abstract (“forgotten promise,” “enduring power of art”) and never tested on the page. No tightening occurs: Elian faces no opposition, makes no trade-offs, and incurs no loss. The vandalized portrait—a potential source of conflict—is passively observed, not engaged. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story accumulates motifs but not pressure; the dominant stake remains conceptual, not visceral or consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving entangled memories through a shared dream—is signaled early but remains abstract. Pressure accumulates texturally (glow intensifies, sorrow deepens), yet no meaningful tightening occurs: Aria’s drumming always works, and the lagoon always responds. The “fleeting” nature of connection is noted but never tested—no failed attempt, no resistance, no trade-off. Cost is conceptual (“memories fade”) but not dramatized as loss, omission, or sacrifice that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—validating the power of whispers—is signaled early but never tested under real pressure. No option is foreclosed; the worker moves freely, finds clues effortlessly, and encounters a cooperative stranger. The “challenge” lacks opposition or risk, reducing conflict to atmospheric tension. Escalation relies on environmental intensification (storm, shadows) rather than protagonist-driven tightening, violating the Situational/Accumulative requirement that coherent pressure forces stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.0)
    Dominant stake (“teach darkness the value of stars”) is declared but never tested or embodied in action. No tightening occurs: the figure’s pattern-weaving complicates nothing, and the guardian’s calm deepens without trade-off. Conflict remains static tableau—“stillwater tension” is named repeatedly but never escalates or resolves. Agency is absent; both characters observe, not act, violating the pressure requirement under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.3)
    Stakes are declared (“humble rebellion,” “challenge the status quo”) but never materialize in concrete opposition or test. No meaningful tightening occurs—Elian’s plan succeeds instantly with universal awe, foreclosing no options and exacting no price. The dominant stake remains abstract throughout; “forests of second thoughts” functions as metaphor, not dramatized conflict with escalation or consequence under any drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—freedom through self-realization—is signaled early but never tested under concrete opposition. The whale’s song resolves tension rather than escalating it; Kael faces no resistance, trade-off, or narrowing of options. The “combative tenderness” is declared but never enacted in conflict, reducing stakes to internal yearning without external friction or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—finding meaning after forced joy—is signaled early, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening. The bouquet discovery introduces longing, yet no live option is foreclosed; Echo’s narrations deepen but don’t alter tactics or raise stakes. Pressure remains atmospheric rather than causal, relying on reflection over action. Under an Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices, but the cost (“emptiness,” “loss”) stays abstract, not viscerally legible in choice or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are declared (“stride through boundaries once thought sacred”) but never tested under pressure. The “ban” lifts off-page, removing temporal urgency; no obstacle opposes Lyra’s poetic act. Escalation is textural (increasing luminosity, humming intensity) but not consequential—no option is foreclosed, no price paid. The dominant stake remains abstract, unanchored in tangible risk or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes are abstract (“beauty in imperfection”) and never tested under pressure. The painter faces no opposition, obstacle, or trade-off—his actions meet instant, unearned acceptance. The glassblower’s inspiration arises without friction or cost. Coincidence (finding the reed) introduces the core idea but resolves nothing; escalation is absent, replaced by passive diffusion of influence.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding connection—is declared but never tested under coherent pressure. No meaningful tightening occurs; the bell ringer moves unimpeded, encounters no resistance, and faces zero trade-offs. The “artificial pilgrimage” generates no cost, loss, or altered tactics. Coincidence (grid stabilizing) enables the journey but doesn’t complicate it—agency is passive observation, not decision.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—reviving a withered heart through art—is signaled early and deepens via the curtains’ illumination. Pressure escalates texturally: origami placements → stellar alignment → curtain glow → renewed craft. Yet the escalation relies on magical causality that isn’t tested or resisted; no obstacle complicates the method, so stakes feel declarative rather than viscerally contested. The cost (prolonged isolation, emotional risk of hope) is implied but never crystallized in a moment where the maker sacrifices something concrete to proceed.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.3)
    Dominant stake—mapping lost cultural patterns—is declared but never tested under coherent pressure. No tightening occurs: the task proceeds uninterrupted, without obstacle, trade-off, or meaningful complication. Rain intensifies but soothes; dawn arrives gently. The “crash” is backdrop, not active constraint. Protagonist agency is passive observation (“began to confide,” “sought to understand”) rather than decision that narrows options or incurs cost.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—uncovering forbidden truth—is clear early, and deepens when the pagoda offers a new method. Yet escalation hinges on passive reception (colleague delivers object; instructions given) rather than protagonist-driven pressure. The “avoid patterns” directive isn’t tested through failed attempts or tactical shifts, flattening agency. Cost remains conceptual, not tactical or material, weakening stakes under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving hope against encroaching shadow—is signaled early but remains conceptual. The “meaningful tightening” is the discovery that the shadow feeds on collective fears, yet this insight doesn’t alter tactics or narrow options; she simply resolves to share findings. No visible cost accrues from her study or journey. Pressure accumulates texturally but doesn’t crystallize into a trade-off or irreversible stance under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—balancing self-respect and compassion—is declared but never tested through concrete opposition or trade-offs. Pressure remains internal and abstract; no meaningful tightening narrows options or forces a costly choice. The “con” revelation introduces tension but isn’t dramatized or linked to present action, rendering stakes inert. Escalation is textural (more reflection), not causal or situational, failing lens coherence under Accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—“to learn to read the stories in scars”—is declared but never tested under pressure. Digging is effortful but consequence-free; no resource depletes, no risk materializes. The “displaced miracle” and plant telepathy complicate nothing. Coincidence (the stranger’s gift) enables the quest but isn’t earned or costly. No meaningful tightening occurs—Elian simply persists until the earth yields, unimpeded.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—uncovering where unused love is stored—is signaled early but never tested through concrete opposition or meaningful trade-offs. The psychometric journey deepens atmospherically but lacks agency-driven escalation; the gazer receives visions passively. Cost is implied (“weight lifting”) but not dramatized as a foreclosed path or sacrificed alternative. Pressure accumulates texturally but doesn’t narrow options or force a consequential choice.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake (freeing creativity) is clear but never tested by concrete opposition. Pressure is ambient (doubts, fears) rather than dramatized conflict. The “tightening” is merely the aurora intensifying—a coincidence, not protagonist-driven escalation. No trade-off, loss, or narrowed option occurs; rest is declared essential but never shown to carry risk or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake (“cultivate sparks”) is signaled early but remains abstract, never tested by concrete opposition or loss. Escalation relies on sensory intensification, not narrowing options or deepening knowledge. The archive’s power “guides” Asa passively; no meaningful tightening forces a costly decision. Coincidence (clock buried conveniently) complicates but doesn’t escalate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (“understand translocation”) is signaled early but never tested under coherent pressure. Escalation is textural (hum grows louder) not causal; no meaningful tightening narrows options or forces trade-offs. The wind melody guides but doesn’t complicate—coincidence, not agency, drives the dream shift. Cost is absent: consciousness expands freely, returns unscathed.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes (“unused courage”) are declared but never tested through concrete opposition or trade-offs. The “dangers that lurked in the shadows” remain abstract, and the indirect routes avoid rather than confront pressure. No meaningful tightening occurs—Eira’s guidance removes all friction, rendering the journey consequence-free. Coincidence doesn’t resolve conflict because no real conflict ever materializes on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—cost of safety versus voice—is declared but never concretely tested. The “tightening” of the piano bench bolt is thematically adjacent but exogenous; it doesn’t narrow the bellhop’s options or force a trade-off. No reversal or deepening occurs: the bellhop begins contemplative and ends slightly more peaceful, but no decision, endurance, or attention shift forecloses a path. Pressure remains ambient, not coherent under any drive lens, and coincidence (the figure’s arrival) complicates without consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—unmasking the pretender—is signaled early, and Kael’s patient method creates thematic pressure. Yet escalation is passive: time passes, messages grow “more urgent,” but no concrete obstacle forces adaptation. The pretender arrives conveniently, not through Kael’s maneuvers. Cost is abstract; no tool lost, stamina spent, or social credit risked. Agency lies in endurance, but the lack of active tightening undercuts stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—discovering why paths vanish—is signaled early but never tested under coherent pressure. Maya pores over logbooks and builds a map, yet no obstacle impedes her, no trade-off arises. The “delayed revelation” remains abstract; no deepening alters her tactics or knowledge meaningfully. Conflict is internalized as curiosity, not urgency, and resolution arrives via epiphany, not earned reversal. Coincidence doesn’t resolve, but neither does agency escalate stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—rekindling purpose amid post-rebellion stillness—is clear early and deepens at the stone circle. Pressure escalates texturally via the hum’s intensification, culminating in visions that reignite conviction. But the protagonist’s agency is passive: she receives revelation rather than earns it through struggle or sacrifice. No tangible cost (lost time, injury, tool) alters her path; the “price” remains conceptual, softening escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.3)
    Dominant stake (“unlock new era of evolution”) is abstract and untested on the page. No meaningful tightening occurs: the kite appears conveniently, decoding requires no sacrifice, and opposition is absent. Plants’ whispers escalate tension but don’t narrow options. Coincidence (finding the kite) resolves the quest, violating agency under any drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—reconciling trauma with future uncertainty—is signaled early and deepens through atmospheric accumulation, but pressure remains passive. Amira doesn’t wrestle with a decision; she receives stillness. The “pearl of stillness” crystallizes her stance (Charged Poise), yet no visible price is paid: no path is closed, no resource spent. Coincidence (wind dying just as she reaches clarity) eases resolution rather than complicating it, softening the cost required for high-band escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes remain abstract (“purpose of art,” “confront the darkness”) with no concrete test or trade-off. The artist’s “descent” entails no risk, loss, or altered tactics—untangling threads is meditative, not pressured. Coincidental insight replaces escalation: realization arrives via atmosphere, not choice. Though a dominant stake is signaled, it never tightens into a live dilemma with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—uncovering why time slows in crisis—is signaled early but never tested through concrete adversity. The “disappearance” via ink patterns complicates tracking but resolves without resistance or consequence. Escalation is textural (fading traces, drone alerts) rather than causal; no meaningful tightening occurs. Cost is conceptual (uncertainty) but not dramatized as loss, sacrifice, or altered capacity.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes are declared (“fragile peace,” “contraband truths”) but never tested concretely. The “dangerous liaison letter” poses no personal risk to Aria—no surveillance, no penalty, no trade-off. Escalation is rhetorical (“scandalize the status quo”) rather than causal; the dormant networks operate frictionlessly, removing tension from dissemination.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—peace versus inherited violence—is signaled early but never escalates into coherent pressure. The world outside is chaotic, yet no external threat enters the dome to test Aria’s resolve or method. Her “inculcating plants with values” is declared but never shown to fail, adapt, or cost her anything. The story relies on static opposition (sword vs. roses) without a meaningful turn that deepens stakes or forces a trade-off. Coincidence (the crashed airship) introduces the stone but doesn’t complicate her path.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—catching the goddess’s echo—is signaled early and deepens via the “voicing silence” method. Pressure accumulates texturally: constellations shift, silences grow louder, ground vibrates. Yet escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening; she walks, stops, listens—no tactical adaptation or trade-off under duress. Cost is conceptual (spent garden energy) but not personally felt in action or forfeiture, softening the stakes’ visceral grip.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes are declared (“scandal that could topple the Wychwood empire”) but never tested in-scene; no tightening, trade-off, or visible price alters Adelaide’s path. The method of “proof by contradiction” is named but not enacted—no assumption is tested, no contradiction revealed. Conflict remains internal and abstract, with no on-page opposition or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—silencing inner dissonance—is signaled early and deepens through the letters and firmware whispers, but escalation relies on atmospheric intensification rather than protagonist-driven tightening. The tethering act stabilizes her, yet it feels reactive, not agentic; no live option is foreclosed with tangible cost. Under an Accumulative lens, the cadence shift into “meteor hush” reweights the stake, but the price paid remains conceptual, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—finding meaning in inner turmoil—is signaled early but remains abstract. The “unlearning” tightens nothing; no option is lost, no price paid. Protagonist agency is passive: she receives a tile, observes patterns, feels emotions. The climax (“interject one final change”) lacks consequence—it’s aesthetic, not existential. Coincidence (tile falling) complicates but also resolves, undermining earned escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming hope through compassion—is signaled early but never tested under coherent pressure. Aria faces no opposition, obstacle, or internal conflict that forces a difficult choice; her “mission” unfolds without friction. The deepening comes via memory, not escalation, and her climactic act (renaming) has no visible cost or consequence. Coincidence doesn’t resolve anything because nothing was at risk—stakes remain conceptual, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming coherence from a fractured past—is signaled early and deepens through Echo’s weaving of echoes. However, escalation relies on atmospheric intensification rather than protagonist-driven agency: the garden shifts *for* her, not because of hard-won choices. Cost is implied (nostalgia’s weight) but never made concrete—no sacrificed option, lost time, or irreversible trade-off alters tactics. Under an Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening suffices, but the absence of visible price caps emotional urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—illuminating hidden pathways—is declared but never tested under genuine opposition. The recalled telepathy pills introduce potential risk, yet Luna faces no consequence, dilemma, or sacrifice. The “static shock” conveniently grants clarity without cost, functioning as plot lubricant, not pressure. No option is foreclosed; no tactic shifts due to loss. Stakes remain abstract, insulated from failure or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain abstract (“uncover mysteries,” “become the voice”) without concrete tests or escalation. No meaningful pressure point narrows options or demands sacrifice. The heat-mapping produces beauty, not consequence; the fossil pulses but doesn’t compel risk. Under an Accumulative lens, there’s density without deepening—no cadence shift or pattern break that reweights the dominant stake with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming prophecy into possibility—is signaled early but never tested under coherent pressure. The “unscrambling” proceeds without obstacle, reversal, or meaningful deepening; stakes remain intellectual rather than visceral. No option is foreclosed, no price paid—escalation is textual (more whispers, more resonance), not consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.3)
    The dominant stake—“finding where unused courage waits”—is declared but never tested through meaningful opposition. There’s no escalation: the search yields immediate success (path revealed, figure found) without complication. The spy’s “prudently daring” trait enables no trade-off; she faces zero risk in approaching her double. Coincidence resolves tension (mist clears just in time), and no option is foreclosed—redemption arrives cost-free, violating Situational lens expectations of coherent pressure forcing stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—waiting for a traveler bound by a “palimpsest promise”—is signaled early but remains emotionally and narratively diffuse. The tightening occurs when the figure emerges, yet this turn stems from external arrival, not protagonist agency. Pressure accumulates texturally (mist clearing, gutters stopping), but no trade-off or renunciation occurs; the coachman simply continues. Cost is suggested (“patience worn smooth”) but not dramatized as a loss that alters future capacity or options.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—understanding why some places resist change—is stated but never tested through concrete opposition or meaningful tightening. Akira’s “thrums” and gazes incur no risk, cost, or altered tactics. Pressure remains atmospheric, not dramatic; stakes are philosophical, not visceral. The chimney smoke provides temporal texture but doesn’t function as a live clock forcing decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (“nurture hidden corners”) is declared but never tested against opposition or scarcity. No meaningful escalation occurs—pressure remains static, accumulating only in tone, not consequence. The gardener faces no obstacle, loss, or dilemma; pruning is ritual, not struggle. Coincidental elements (boat, hush) complicate mood but resolve nothing, violating the “coincidence may complicate, not resolve” rule without generating cost.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving past knowledge while forging a future—is signaled early but never tested under coherent pressure. No meaningful tightening occurs; the “brittle awakenings” concept remains thematic backdrop, not a force that narrows options or demands sacrifice. Protagonist agency is passive contemplation, not decision or renunciation with cost. Coincidence doesn’t resolve, but nothing escalates either—conflict stays static.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—finding the hidden thread—is signaled early but remains abstract. The tightening occurs when Lena shifts from passive pondering to active contribution, yet this turn lacks opposition or tangible risk. No path is foreclosed; no price is paid. The artists’ project offers opportunity, not pressure. Under an Accumulative lens, the deepening is thematic (connection through creation), but agency feels permissive rather than earned under constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.3)
    Stakes are declared (“restore balance to the universe”) but never tested or tightened through protagonist-driven escalation. No option is foreclosed, no price paid—Lyra succeeds cleanly on first attempt. The “cosmic tricksters” pose no adaptive pressure, reducing conflict to a solvable puzzle rather than a dynamic struggle with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—finding the “vital key”—is signaled early but never tested under real pressure. Conflict remains abstract; no opposition, time limit, or personal sacrifice forces a hard choice. The “fallow period” ends magically upon contact with the crystal, with no agency-driven escalation. Luck (hearing the organ) guides her, not strategy or risk. Stakes feel intellectual, not visceral—no loss, fatigue, or dilemma sharpens the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—uncovering hidden truths through empathy—is signaled early but never tested by concrete opposition. Pressure remains static: the detective speaks, the artist listens and paints. No meaningful tightening occurs; the “epiphany” about unifying opposites is stated, not enacted under duress. Stakes stay abstract (“dormant empathy,” “humanity lost”), lacking visceral consequence or trade-offs that alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes are declared (“honor ancestor’s bravery,” “uncover hidden truth”) but never tested through concrete opposition or trade-offs. The “reversible exile” concept floats as abstraction without shaping decisions. Pressure accumulates atmospherically but doesn’t tighten causally—no option is foreclosed, no price paid. Under an Accumulative lens, the dread intensifies but doesn’t reconfigure Emilia’s stance or narrow her path.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.3)
    Dominant stake (“recount hidden stories”) is signaled but never tested through concrete opposition or meaningful tightening. The pixelated amnesty removes consequence, deflating tension rather than escalating it. The fiddler’s decision to play music isn’t a high-stakes renunciation—it’s consequence-free expression. No option is foreclosed; no price is paid. Coincidence (breeze revealing pattern) resolves narrative curiosity without protagonist agency driving escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes remain abstract throughout: “understanding paths,” “disillusionment,” “sharing lessons.” No meaningful tightening occurs—Kael’s startup failure is backstory, not active pressure. The dominant stake (to comprehend circular paths) never faces an on-page test or forces a trade-off. Pressure is retrospective, not present-tense, resulting in static conflict without escalation or consequence under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—decoding inscriptions to alleviate present burdens—is signaled early and braided with the thematic core. Pressure accumulates texturally via star patterns, telegram memory, and inscriptions’ revelations, culminating in a deepening: the ancient civilization’s golden age emerged from shared burdens. Yet escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency; insight arrives passively as “words began to reveal their secrets.” No live option is foreclosed, and cost remains conceptual (emotional fatigue) rather than tangible, weakening under the Accumulative lens’s demand for reweighted stakes with price.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.3)
    Dominant stake (“discover what mirrors don’t show”) is signaled early but never tested concretely—no trade-off, loss, or narrowing of options occurs. The druid faces no resistance beyond ambient hostility; the frozen figure yields answers effortlessly. Agency is passive: they “reach out,” and truth is granted. No price is paid; the “cost” is emotional awe, not dramatized sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes remain abstract (“intersection of dreams,” “infinite possibilities”) with no concrete trade-off or foreclosed path. The “anxious elation” is stated, not dramatized through escalating pressure. Aria faces no opposition, obstacle, or meaningful tightening—she walks, sees, touches, and departs unscathed. The covenant’s revelation carries zero tactical or emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes (“heal,” “barter destiny”) are declared but not tested; the spell succeeds without resistance or trade-off. Pressure accumulates atmospherically, not causally—the trees “lean in,” but no obstacle forces a costly decision. The dominant stake remains abstract, and the protagonist’s agency is performative (“began to weave a spell”) rather than consequential under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming purpose after public failure—is declared but never tested through concrete pressure. The phone call offers a minor distraction, not a meaningful tightening that forecloses options or demands trade-offs. Jack’s “wrestling doubts” remains internal monologue without on-page consequence or agency-driven escalation. No visible price is paid; resolution arrives via epiphany, not earned stance crystallization under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes are declared (“reestablish the connection”) but never tested under coherent pressure. The dominant stake remains abstract, with no tangible consequence for failure. Elara’s “physics of transition” ambition drives reflection, not action with risk. There’s no tightening—only a smooth progression toward understanding. Coincidence (the seed responding) substitutes for agency; no trade-off or loss forces a harder choice. The final image shows success without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are declared (“preserve wonder in routine”) but never tested or tightened through conflict. No opposition exists—not even internal resistance strong enough to force a trade-off. The moon-phase fluctuation and “smelt” process are mentioned but exert no pressure on decisions. Without agency-driven escalation or a live constraint that narrows options, the dominant stake remains abstract and consequence-free.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes remain abstract (“connect with others,” “illuminate dark corners”) with no concrete test or visible cost. The single “tightening” is internal realization, not an on-page turn that narrows options or demands sacrifice. Protagonist agency is passive reception, not decision or renunciation; the pearl’s power “courses through her” without resistance. Coincidence (finding shell + pearl) complicates nothing and resolves everything via mystical empathy, violating earned escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes (“self-forgiveness”) are declared but never concretely tested or complicated by opposition. There’s no meaningful tightening: Elara’s journey remains static, with no live option foreclosed or price paid. The protagonist’s agency is passive—she receives wisdom from graffiti and river whispers rather than making choices that alter her path. Cost is implied (“heavy heart now lighter”) but not visible in action or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes remain abstract (“find the library of unspoken words”) and never face concrete on-page tests with measurable cost. The “tightening” is atmospheric, not tactical—the watch guides but doesn’t force trade-offs. Agency is observational, not decisive; the dreamer documents but never risks, loses, or renounces. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should reweight meaning through density, but the emotional stakes (love, loss) are summarized, not felt in action.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes (“dream vs. empire”) are abstractly declared but never tested in scene; no tightening occurs beyond rhetorical intensification. The “perforated destiny” concept promises narrative consequence but delivers none—Elian faces no trade-off, loss, or irreversible act. Pressure remains atmospheric, not situational, and agency is limited to contemplation, not decision with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—capturing one last spark of beauty before surrendering to stillness—is signaled early and deepens through Aria’s focused labor. The meaningful tightening occurs when she resists the threshold’s pull to complete her task, narrowing her world to the gemstone. Cost is felt emotionally (“a pang of sorrow”) and existentially (delayed transcendence), though it remains conceptual rather than concrete or physical.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—finding contentment—is declared but never concretely tested or threatened; no obstacle challenges Aria’s quest, rendering conflict inert. There is no meaningful tightening: the hairpin discovery prompts reflection, not altered tactics or risk. Agency is passive; she “ponders,” “feels intuition,” and “continues her tasks” without renunciation, decision, or endurance that incurs cost. Coincidence (finding the hairpin) complicates nothing and resolves everything via unearned insight, violating the lens guardrail for Situational/Accumulative designs.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—freeing the client from suffocating certainty—is signaled early but never tested through concrete opposition or trade-offs. The conscience faces no resistance, risk, or meaningful narrowing of options; “unhooking” occurs effortlessly via passive listening. Cost is implied (“protected vulnerability”) but never dramatized as a price paid during escalation. Pressure remains static, accumulating atmosphere without deepening conflict or forcing a decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes (“teach vanishing to appear”) are abstract and untested by concrete opposition. No escalation occurs—pressure remains ambient, not coherent. The “withholding” action doesn’t narrow options or force trade-offs; it’s a narrative device, not a character-driven tactic with consequence. Coincidence (stone-throwing) provides imagery but no complication.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake (“navigate without moving”) is declared but never pressured; no opposition arises, no trade-off occurs. The “pulse” offers nominal tension but resolves via passive attunement, not agency. Escalation is illusory—birds appear, dust accumulates—but no knowledge shift or narrowed option forces a costly stance. Coincidence (birds arriving) complicates nothing and resolves everything.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—resisting automated creativity—is declared early but never tested by concrete opposition. Eira faces no obstacle beyond vague existential dread; the keystone yields easily. The “unstrapping” requires care but incurs no risk, error, or trade-off. Pressure remains static, escalating only in lyrical intensity, not narrative consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.3)
    Dominant stake (“discover color of sound”) is signaled early but never tested under coherent pressure. No meaningful tightening occurs—Kael faces no obstacles, trade-offs, or reversals. The “mission” lacks opposition; the library yields its secret effortlessly. Coincidental timing (lantern festival) adds ambiance but doesn’t complicate or resolve. Agency is absent: Kael wanders, observes, and receives epiphany without struggle or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.3)
    The dominant stake—deciphering the backwards prophecy—is signaled early but never tightens under pressure; the process unfolds smoothly without complication, trade-off, or meaningful deepening. Coincidence doesn’t resolve, but neither does agency: the protagonist follows a preordained ritual with no resistance, error, or adaptation. No option is foreclosed, no price paid—the distillation succeeds effortlessly, undermining escalation under any drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—naming nameless fears through understanding sacrifice—is signaled early and deepens via the crystallization ritual. Pressure accumulates texturally rather than causally, consistent with the inferred lens. Yet escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency: the reaper reacts to memories and recordings rather than making a costly choice that narrows options. The “tightening” is atmospheric, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—mending brittle devotion via bell repair—is signaled early but remains conceptual. The mage faces no opposition, obstacle, or trade-off; the ritual succeeds smoothly, draining tension. Escalation is textural (light intensifies, bell glows) not causal or situational. Though the bell’s restoration symbolizes cosmic correction, no on-page price is paid—making stakes feel decorative rather than urgent or consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stakes are declared (“expunge pain,” “heal the community”) but never tested or narrowed through protagonist agency. No meaningful escalation occurs—only repetitive walking and photographing without consequence. The dominant stake remains abstract, unanchored in visceral loss or tangible trade-offs that would charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—achieving harmony between logic and intuition—is signaled early and deepens when the starlings’ patterns reveal a “hidden language.” The flame action tightens pressure by activating the crystal and drawing the birds into intricate flight, altering Elara’s knowledge. Yet escalation leans on coincidence (crystal found, birds respond perfectly); agency is observational rather than decisive, limiting felt cost or foreclosed paths.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are declared (“mapping uncharted skies,” “preserving trust”) but never tested by opposition or complication. Pressure remains static—no tightening, reversal, or deepening forces a trade-off. The “revision” proceeds uninterrupted, with no obstacle beyond abstract “danger.” Coincidence doesn’t resolve, but neither does agency drive escalation; the work simply concludes at dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes remain abstract (“defeat emotional numbness,” “identity crisis”) with no concrete test or narrowing of options. The “history rewriting itself” introduces external flux but exerts zero pressure on Kaito’s decisions. Conflict is internal yet static—no escalation, reversal, or trade-off occurs. The protagonist endures, but without visible cost or foreclosed path, agency dissipates.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes (“safeguard space for innovation”) are declared but never concretely threatened or tested. There’s no opposition, complication, or trade-off—only internal musing. The “mystery” poses no risk; the seed is a gift, not a challenge. Under an Accumulative lens, escalation requires density increase or pattern break that reweights stakes, but the narrative deepens only in abstraction, not consequence. No visible price alters tactics; the conflict remains entirely conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes (“restore lost laughter”) are declared but never concretely tested or tightened through protagonist agency. The conflict remains static—a performance without opposition or consequence. No option is foreclosed, no trade-off made; the leaf blower simply “works,” rendering escalation illusory. Coincidence (whispers emerging) resolves what was never dramatized as difficult.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—safeguarding secrets while wrestling uncertainty—is signaled early but never tested by concrete opposition or choice. Pressure accumulates atmospherically, not causally; the mist “coalesces into a presence” but poses no actionable threat. The guardian’s “waiting” is passive endurance without trade-offs, and no option is foreclosed. Cost remains abstract (“weight of responsibility”) with no on-page forfeiture or tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—escaping predetermined fate via creative destruction—is signaled early but remains abstract, never tested by concrete opposition or trade-offs. Escalation is textural (deepening twilight, vibrating air) not causal; the alchemist faces no resistance, error, or adaptation. The “moment of truth” arrives without earned pressure—luck or atmosphere resolves tension, not agency. No visible price (lost time, failed materials, bodily toll) alters tactics or crystallizes stance.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are declared (“uncover hidden truth”) but never tested—Aria faces no opposition, obstacle, or trade-off. The “shard of hush” is a poetic label, not a source of escalating pressure. Protagonist agency is passive: she listens, follows resonance, and receives insight without struggle. No option is foreclosed; the journey costs her nothing tangible or emotional beyond nostalgic longing.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.9)
    Stakes are declared (“restore balance to the cosmos”) but never tested in scene; the “vanishing ferry” exerts no on-page pressure that alters tactics. The equinox’s “sideways clocks” are mentioned but don’t tighten decisions or create tradeoffs. Elara’s agency is limited to observation and radio calls—no meaningful reversal or deepening narrows her options or raises cost under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes (“texture of connection”) are signaled early but remain abstract and untested by concrete opposition. Escalation occurs via intensifying visuals (“erupt into vibrant colors”), but this is environmental spectacle, not pressure driven by protagonist agency. No option is foreclosed, no trade-off made—the climax is experiential, not consequential. Coincidence (thread “guiding” her) replaces conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—preparing students to navigate by starlight—is signaled early but never tested under pressure; no obstacle arises to complicate the lesson. The “discovery of aliens” contextualizes urgency but imposes no live clock or tactical shift. Agency is passive instruction, not decision or renunciation with cost. Escalation is accumulative description, not deepening that changes knowledge or options under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reconnecting the living with the dead—is signaled early and deepens when Aria recognizes the sister in the photo. The tightening occurs in the revelation, narrowing Aria’s role from abstract tracer to specific witness. Yet escalation relies on coincidence (“drawn to this place at the precise moment”) rather than protagonist-driven pressure. Cost is implied (emotional labor) but not dramatized as a tangible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—retrieving the codex to honor the dead—is clear early, and tidal pressure adds temporal tension. But escalation is passive: Lyra finds everything she needs without obstacle, error, or trade-off. Phase transition travel resolves the return mechanically, with no prior testing or failure. Cost remains conceptual (“changed”) rather than dramatized loss of time, tool, or opportunity that alters her surface life.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding the digital ghost—is signaled early but never tested under pressure; Akira faces no resistance, trade-offs, or narrowing of options. The “defragment” action proceeds unimpeded, and the cleared radio static removes complication rather than deepening conflict. Stakes remain abstract (“secrets of the universe”), with no tangible price paid. Escalation is textural (ink patterns, snow deepening), not causal, fitting the Accumulative lens but lacking felt cost or foreclosed paths.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving fading language through translation—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or loss. The storyteller faces no obstacle, makes no sacrifice, and incurs no price; success arrives through observation alone. Under an Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices, but here the “tightening” is tonal, not consequential—no path is foreclosed, no tactic altered by cost.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=4.3)
    Stakes are declared (“restore balance,” “confront darkness”) but never tested in scene; the “harmony untamed” remains a poetic abstraction without tactical consequences. Escalation is static—Lena listens, feels energy, then leaves—with no narrowing of options or deepening of knowledge that alters her approach. The phone’s confessions deliver exposition, not conflict, and coincidence (random object discovery) drives plot, not agency.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—reawakening beauty in a mechanical world—is signaled early and deepens through Luna’s melody. The tightening occurs when music cracks the statues, narrowing options from passive playing to active liberation. However, escalation relies on magic’s convenience rather than protagonist struggle; no tangible price alters tactics. Cost is implied (mechanical grip loosened) but not dramatized as loss or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—delivering the storm-bottle across a drone-patrolled border—is signaled early but never tested meaningfully. Pressure remains static: drones hover, mailman waits, crosses, delivers. No tightening occurs; the “linking absences” tactic is named but unused in-scene. The storm’s turbulence escalates coincidentally, not because of protagonist decisions. Cost is absent—no tool lost, time forfeited, or social credit spent—and the resolution relies on external luck, not earned stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes remain abstract (“seek meaning in stillness”) and are never concretely tested. The “wrong turn” introduces mild disorientation but no real pressure; the oasis resolves tension rather than escalating it. The dominant stake—interpreting silence—never faces opposition or demands trade-offs. Coincidence (the singing voice) drives the plot, not protagonist agency, and vanishes without consequence, violating the “coincidence may complicate, not resolve” rule.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—reawakening dormant stories—is signaled early and deepens through the librarian’s hyperbolic mapping. Yet pressure remains abstract; there’s no narrowing of options or visible trade-off. The “urgency” of her pencil feels decorative, not consequential. Escalation is textural, not causal, fitting the Accumulative lens, but lacks a felt price that alters tactics or outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are declared (“capture a runaway dream”) but never tested or narrowed; the central conflict remains internal and static. No meaningful tightening occurs—Elian repeats the same ritual without adaptation, loss, or consequence. Agency is observational, not active; the “cipher of longing” exerts no pressure that forces a trade-off. Coincidence doesn’t resolve anything because nothing escalates to require resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (“free a trapped idea/memory”) is signaled early but remains abstract and untested by tangible opposition. The “protective mechanisms” resisting the locksmith are described atmospherically (“air thickened”) but never concretely challenge skill or force trade-offs. Escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency—the star provides a passive hint, and success arrives via intuitive finesse without meaningful cost or narrowed options. Coincidence (first star’s position) resolves direction, but no earned reversal deepens stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are declared (“recover stolen memories”) but never tested on the page; the fairy ring mushroom is found effortlessly, removing tension. The dominant stake emerges too late and isn’t tightened by meaningful opposition or trade-off. Pressure remains atmospheric, not causal—Emilia faces no resistance, forcing no renunciation or adaptation beyond vague “trepidation.” Coincidence (spotting the ring) resolves the goal without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reversing a soul’s exile—is signaled early and deepens as the archivist deciphers longing in the shadow’s geometry. Pressure escalates texturally: annotations grow “more fervent,” movements more confident, tension eases. The cost is felt (emotional labor, vulnerability) but not sharply visible as a foreclosed path. Agency is present (annotation as act of care), yet the “reversal” remains implied, not dramatized—luckily, Accumulative lens permits this resonance without decisive physical change.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes (“preserve the color of wonder”) are declared but never tested—Aria faces no opposition, delay, or trade-off. The dominant stake remains abstract, unanchored in visceral need or risk. Though the story deepens atmospherically, pressure doesn’t tighten; success arrives by ritual, not agency. Coincidence doesn’t resolve (luck isn’t involved), but neither does meaningful struggle—cost is absent, not merely implied.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—grounding spirits via net restoration—is signaled early and deepens texturally as silence accumulates. But escalation is passive: spirits “stir,” “dissipate,” yet never resist or complicate the work. The restorer faces no meaningful opposition or tactical shift; every knot yields predictably. Cost remains conceptual (“heavy, velvety stillness”) rather than dramatized loss, limiting pressure coherence under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the henge’s secrets—is signaled early but never tested by meaningful opposition or complication. Pressure remains static: rain falls, footage is reviewed, whispers are felt. No tightening occurs; the “method” yields results effortlessly. Agency is observational, not consequential—Elara listens but doesn’t choose, sacrifice, or resist. Cost is absent: she departs enriched, unscathed, with no visible price for revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—understanding “the physics of letting go”—is signaled early and deepens through discovery of texts and the net’s message. Pressure escalates via intellectual unraveling, not external threat, fitting the Accumulative lens. Yet agency is passive: Eli receives insights rather than earns them through struggle; the “untangling” yields a pre-written epiphany, not a costly choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to the ghost’s whispers—is signaled early and deepens as the storm escalates. The balladeer’s agency lies in encoding, which tightens into frenzy under pressure, culminating in a mural that alters the courtyard’s essence. However, the ghost’s presence never opposes or complicates her goal; it merely responds, making conflict one-sided. Cost is implied (her departure, the storm’s energy) but not dramatized as a trade-off or loss that reshapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding love’s duality—is signaled early but never tested under coherent pressure. There is no opposition, obstacle, or meaningful tightening; the diary yields its secrets effortlessly via scattered light. Elara’s “journey” involves no risk, loss, or trade-off. The absence of agency or consequence flattens escalation, reducing conflict to thematic contemplation without dramatized tension.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are declared (“prove that empty spaces remember”) but never tested through concrete opposition or meaningful tightening. No escalation occurs—only deepening reflection. The storm is past; the present holds no pressure, only observation. Without a live conflict or narrowing of options, the dominant stake remains intellectual, not visceral. Coincidence doesn’t resolve anything because nothing was ever in jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving ephemeral beauty against progress—is signaled early and deepens via the coin’s message about limits. Pressure escalates texturally: the hidden book safe, the ancient coin, the ticking demolition clock all narrow the artist’s window. Yet escalation isn’t driven by protagonist agency; the artist reacts rather than chooses under duress. Cost is conceptual (impermanence) but not viscerally paid—no tool lost, time forfeited, or relationship severed.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are declared (“discovery of a lifetime”) but never tested or tightened. No meaningful escalation occurs: the luminance appears, Eli observes, decodes, and plans—without obstacle, error, or consequence. The crew’s return introduces social pressure, yet Eli’s choice to withhold is effortless, costless. Under an Accumulative lens, there’s density but no deepening that reweights the dominant stake; the “tension” remains atmospheric, not dramatic. Coincidence (finding the light) initiates but nothing complicates through agency.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—learning the “rhythm of repair”—is signaled early but never tested under pressure. No meaningful tightening occurs; Kael encounters no obstacle, failure, or trade-off. The “hidden pattern” emerges effortlessly, and the door unlocks without resistance. Coincidence (prophecy + gear assortment aligning perfectly) resolves the quest, violating the rule that luck may complicate but not solve. Cost is asserted (“fragile and beautiful world”) but never dramatized or felt in action.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—harnessing nebular energy for communal growth—is declared but never dramatized under pressure. No reversal, trade-off, or visible price alters tactics; success arrives through consensus, not conflict. “Brambled hope” suggests fragility, yet nothing threatens failure. Agency resides in Aria’s ghostly orchestration, not settler choices with consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving universal balance against fragility—is signaled early and deepens through the adjuster’s tactile engagement with clockwork and puppet. The meaningful tightening occurs as dusk fades and the lullaby becomes necessary, raising emotional stakes. Yet the conflict remains internalized and consequence-free; no option is foreclosed, no resource spent. Under an Accumulative lens, this suffices, but the absence of visible price (beyond emotional weight) limits escalation to strong, not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (restore labyrinth to save travelers) is signaled early and tightens with the night frost deadline. Yet escalation relies on discovery, not agency: finding the blueprint solves the problem; no trade-off or loss occurs. The mechanical birds watch but don’t pressure. Cost is implied (urgency), but no stamina, tool, or opportunity is forfeited on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—honoring Sofia through meaningful work—is signaled early and deepens via the foam-insight turn. Yet escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency; the “realization” arrives passively through observation, not struggle or choice. Cost is implied (lost time with Sofia) but not dramatized as a present trade-off; the tightening is conceptual, not behavioral, weakening pressure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes are declared (“uncover hidden narratives”) but never tested under pressure. The dominant stake—accessing secret stories via the bottled moonlight—is introduced, then resolved through passive observation, not agency. Ember’s near-action (reaching for a tool) is abandoned without consequence, and her analytical method (“quantifying absence”) produces atmospheric effects but no real trade-off. Coincidence (the lull) enables reflection, but no meaningful tightening narrows her options or raises cost.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—alleviating collective remorse—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s journey to the pavilion. However, escalation relies on atmospheric intensification rather than protagonist-driven pressure; she walks, touches, receives, endures—agency is passive. The cost of subsuming memories is asserted but not felt in altered tactics or visible loss, weakening the tightening required for high-band conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.1)
    Stakes (“construct bridges from silos”) are declared but never concretely tested—no opposition, complication, or meaningful escalation occurs. Emilia’s “rehabilitation” faces zero resistance; the grain elevator instantly cooperates. Coincidence resolves nothing because nothing was at risk. No visible price alters tactics; the dominant stake remains abstract throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes (“uncover secrets of abandoned dreams”) remain abstract and untested; no meaningful tightening occurs. Elara faces no opposition, complication, or trade-off—her work proceeds uninterrupted under a conveniently ascending moon. The dominant stake never materializes in concrete risk or loss, rendering conflict inert. Agency is performative (“pressed on”) without consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—uncovering forgotten knowledge—is signaled early but escalates via external phenomena (gravity inversion, threshold effects) rather than protagonist agency. The archivist reacts, not acts; no trade-off or foreclosed path emerges. Cost is implied (“weight of discovery”) but never dramatized as a tangible loss or irreversible consequence that alters future options.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring felt music to a silent world—is signaled early and deepens through integration of the insulator. However, escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening; discovery of the insulator feels coincidental, not earned through struggle. The “stress cracks” analysis promises method but doesn’t alter tactics. Cost is conceptual (enduring silence) but not viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes remain abstract (“uncover truth,” “discover beauty”) with no on-page test or trade-off. The “before next moon” timeframe exerts no tactical pressure. Conflict is internalized as reflection, not dramatized opposition. No reversal, deepening, or narrowing of options occurs—pressure is static, not escalating under any coherent lens.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding silence through Lyra’s diary—is declared but never tested under pressure. No meaningful tightening occurs; the locked clasp yields instantly to “tuning frequencies,” eliminating tension. Agency is passive: Elara receives insight, doesn’t earn it. Cost is absent—no time lost, trust risked, or emotional toll exacted. The impending fireworks create nominal urgency but no tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes remain abstract (“unlocking secrets,” “cultivating serenity”) without visceral embodiment or tactical trade-offs. The “turning of the tide’s thought” introduces external timing but doesn’t force Lyra to act under constraint—she simply waits. No option is foreclosed; no resource is spent. The bloom’s brief duration implies urgency, yet Lyra faces no dilemma, loss, or adaptation, rendering pressure ornamental rather than operative under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—discovering the source of resilience—is signaled early but never tested under real pressure. The gravity inversion, meant to heighten tension, instead enables effortless discovery. No trade-offs occur: the plant-growth system works better, navigation succeeds, and revelation comes without loss. Agency is passive observation, not decision or renunciation. Coincidence (arrow tip, pool location) drives progress, not escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes are declared (“prevent future disasters”) but never tested by concrete opposition or meaningful tightening. The wind-pattern observation introduces a method but yields no reversal, trade-off, or narrowed option. Pressure remains static: silence, containers, debris recur without escalation. The investigator’s agency is passive observation, not decision under constraint—no cost is paid, no path closed, no knowledge altered in a way that changes her position.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes (“certify wonder”) remain abstract and untested; no trade-off, loss, or narrowing of options occurs. The sculptor’s chisel strike is coincidental, not earned by Elian’s agency. Pressure doesn’t escalate—wonder is declared essential, then affirmed without resistance, cost, or complication, violating the “coincidence may complicate, not resolve” rule.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—harvesting insight from failure via the flute—is signaled early but remains internal and abstract, never tested by external pressure or meaningful opposition. The “turmoil beyond the horizon” and “shadows of her soul” gesture at conflict but manifest as mood, not actionable stakes. No option is foreclosed; playing the flute carries no risk, cost, or irreversible consequence. Escalation is atmospheric, not causal or tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—unlocking emotion’s mathematics—is signaled early and deepens through the integration of the Halo fragment. The escalation is protagonist-driven (Echo positions the shard, prints the text), but the “vanishing stars” clock doesn’t alter tactics—it’s decorative urgency. Cost is conceptual (stars vanish, reality reshapes) but not viscerally felt; no tangible loss (time, tool, stamina) forces a trade-off under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—keeping wonder alive—is signaled early but never tested under coherent pressure. The pendant’s effect removes conflict rather than intensifying it; locals smile, time bends gently, and parting brings peace. No tightening occurs: options don’t narrow, knowledge doesn’t shift, and no price is paid. Coincidence (the apparition) complicates nothing and resolves nothing, violating the “coincidence may complicate, not resolve” guardrail by offering frictionless transcendence.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake (“prove objects absorb emotions”) is signaled but never tested under pressure—no failed attempts, misinterpretations, or conflicting evidence challenge her method. The “communion” proceeds frictionlessly; revelation arrives via passive observation, not agency-driven escalation. Cost is conceptual (“truthful lies”) but not felt, visible, or tied to a renunciation. Coincidental clarity (mist clearing) resolves tension rather than earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—reconnecting across silence—is signaled early but never tested by concrete opposition. Pressure remains internal and static; the “raveling silence” is described, not dramatized as an active force. The jigsaw puzzle serves as a symbolic stand-in for connection but introduces no meaningful tightening—no time limit, broken piece, or emotional risk during assembly. Agency is passive: she “feels purpose stirring,” then weaves. No visible price alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—coaxing resilience from rubble—is signaled early and deepens via the silk’s use, but pressure never truly escalates; the process is frictionless. The “trials to come” are declared, not dramatized, and the arrival of the apprentice complicates nothing. Under an Accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification (the silk’s activation) suffices, but it lacks cost: no stamina loss, material failure, or moral dilemma narrows options. Luck (successful imbuing) resolves the central challenge, not agency.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.3)
    The dominant stake—uncovering a “withheld truth”—is declared but never tested by concrete opposition or trade-offs. The “cyclically spontaneous” doorway enables effortless transit, removing tension; no option is foreclosed, no price paid. Escalation is illusory: worlds “shift and blur” without deepening knowledge or narrowing paths. The climax lacks agency—discovery happens *to* her, not *through* her choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving safety against encroaching darkness—is signaled early and deepens through the skipper’s ritual stone-stacking, which reweights his relationship to the lighthouse’s sorrow. Yet the anonymous letters, introduced as a potential source of communal fear, exert no tangible pressure on his actions or choices. The tightening comes from internal reflection, not external complication, which fits an Accumulative lens but lacks a decisive narrowing of options or visible trade-off beyond emotional endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—shaping the dawn via ancient ritual—is signaled early but never tested under meaningful pressure. No tightening occurs: the herald performs her task unimpeded, with no obstacle, trade-off, or complication. The world’s post-print condition is thematically adjacent but exerts zero tactical influence. Agency is performative, not consequential; luck or coincidence plays no role because nothing opposes her.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—deciphering human magnetism via the wing—is declared but never tested under coherent pressure. Kaito’s “illuminate” action produces no reversal, loss, or narrowed options; the wing simply reveals colors, and onlookers are passively “entranced.” No cost accrues: time, energy, social risk, or emotional toll are absent. Escalation is atmospheric (sun sets, glow intensifies), not consequential—pressure accumulates texturally but lacks causal tightening or agency-driven deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—deconstructing sorrow to restore meaning—is signaled early but never truly pressured. No option is foreclosed; the task succeeds cleanly without trade-off. The storm’s fury mirrors internal work but doesn’t complicate it. Agency is passive (“began to weave,” “felt the weight”) rather than decisive. Cost is asserted (“sorrow dissipated”) but not dramatized as loss, fatigue, or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—rekindling a dying realm—is declared but never tested under meaningful opposition. The memory keeper hums, plants respond, light returns: no complication, failure, or sacrifice occurs. Agency is performative, not consequential; “knitting communities” happens off-page. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through pattern break or cadence shift, but here accumulation only amplifies success without cost or narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—seeking wisdom from a past error—is signaled early and deepens through the search for “The Harmony of Opposites.” The meaningful turn occurs when the found message reframes the crumpled invitation, shifting Elys’s stance from avoidance to acceptance. Yet escalation relies on internal reflection, not external pressure or narrowing options; the clock ticks but imposes no real urgency. Cost is conceptual (emotional reinterpretation) but not viscerally felt—no tangible loss, forfeiture, or irreversible act marks the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake (“find the sacred in the ordinary”) is signaled but never pressured. No meaningful tightening occurs: the bread appears magically, the gardener arrives gently, and “absolution” arrives unearned. Agency is absent—protagonist observes, consumes, reflects, but never decides, renounces, or endures under constraint. Coincidence (vanishing bakery, silent gift) resolves emotional need without cost, violating the rule that luck may complicate but not solve.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes (“preserve essence of a bygone era”) are declared but never tested concretely; Elara faces no obstacle, trade-off, or loss. The “race against time” is atmospheric, not tactical—no resource depletes, no option narrows. Pressure remains static, accumulating mood without escalation. Coincidence (the slide glowing) replaces agency-driven deepening, violating the Situational/Accumulative escalation guardrails.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes are declared (“thwart The Shadow,” “capture the sound of trust breaking”) but never tested concretely. The confrontation lacks escalation: Lena speaks, The Shadow chuckles, sunrise arrives—no narrowing of options or deepening of cost. “False starts” as method are mentioned but never shown shaping attempts. Coincidental timing (sunrise) resolves tension rather than protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—understanding why some carry weather—is declared but never tested through active pursuit or trade-offs. The “elections in the forest” timeframe adds mythic texture but exerts zero pressure on decisions; time doesn’t tighten options. Aria’s approach to the stranger is consequence-free, with no risk or loss incurred. Coincidence (ring vibrating, aurora intensifying) drives progression, not agency.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are signaled early—creative blockage—but escalation relies on internal emotional buildup, not protagonist-driven pressure. The “tightening” is atmospheric (crystals humming), not agentic; Elara doesn’t wrestle with failure or make risky choices. Cost is absent: no time lost, tools broken, or relationships strained. The resolution arrives through passive receptivity, not earned confrontation with the block.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost truth—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or complication. Conflict is internalized as curiosity, not pressured by external resistance or meaningful risk. The “treacherous tunnels” are described but pose no obstacle; escalation is atmospheric, not causal. No option is foreclosed, no price paid—Aria gains insight without sacrifice, undermining cost legibility under any drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.3)
    Stakes are declared (“symphonies of truth,” “era after words”) but never tested or embodied. No meaningful escalation occurs: the iceberg appears, is added to the sculpture, and success follows. Protagonist agency is absent—no trade-offs, losses, or tactical shifts. Coincidence (wind-carried iceberg) resolves the implied need for amplification, undercutting earned causality under any drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—resolving inner static—is signaled early but remains largely internal and abstract. The controlled burn introduces external pressure, yet Aria’s response (“miniaturize the chaos”) isn’t shown as a high-cost trade-off; she succeeds without meaningful loss or complication. Escalation occurs texturally (fire intensifies, smoke thickens), but protagonist agency doesn’t narrow options—it enacts a predetermined metaphor. Cost is implied (emotional burden lightened) but not dramatized as a visible price paid during the burn.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.1)
    Stakes remain abstract (“healing through listening”) with no concrete on-page test or narrowing of options. The “locked mailbox mystery” generates curiosity but no tactical shift—Emilia’s method (asking around) faces zero resistance or consequence. Coincidence drives resolution: letters spill conveniently, residents volunteer theories unprompted, and the writer agrees to meet without friction. No visible price alters later moves.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes remain declarative (“escape,” “liberate herself”) but never materialize as concrete, tested pressure. The “timeframe” via the spider’s web is passive observation, not a tightening clock that forces trade-offs. No meaningful escalation occurs—Aria deciphers nothing, overcomes no barrier, and faces no opposition. The hangman’s dice and journal offer symbolic tension but no causal friction; her “liberation” arrives by epiphany, not earned agency under constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—recovering deleted memories—is signaled early and deepens after the whale beaches. Yet pressure remains atmospheric rather than tactical; the lighter encounters no resistance, trade-offs, or meaningful obstacles. The “fluctuating” gravity pockets enable discovery but impose no cost or constraint. Escalation occurs via revelation, not agency: the coffee-reading ritual functions as plot device, not earned method. Coincidence (whale) triggers change, but resolution stems from passive receptivity.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are declared (“great imbalance”) but never tested in-scene; the summoner works unopposed. Escalation is textural (silence thickens, wing glows) but lacks agency-driven tightening—no trade-off, no narrowing of options. The “cost” is implied fatigue, yet no consequence alters tactics. Under an Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices, but here pressure doesn’t cohere into felt risk.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the “language of old buildings”—is signaled early and deepens through the tutor’s explanation of “agreed upon lies.” However, escalation is atmospheric, not causal: the meteor shower intensifies mood but introduces no new obstacle or knowledge shift that forces a harder choice. The student’s whispered reply is a turning point, but it’s reactive, not agentic; they don’t risk anything to confess. Cost remains conceptual (“never see the world the same way”) without concrete forfeiture—time, trust, opportunity—that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes remain abstract (“reclaim her past,” “confront suppressed memories”) without concrete on-page tests. The only action—“archive the whispers”—lacks mechanics or consequence; it’s a narrative placeholder. Pressure doesn’t escalate; the seashell’s song simply grows louder, then resolves without resistance. No trade-off, loss, or irreversible decision occurs, rendering the dominant stake inert despite lyrical insistence.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—subverting a harmful historical text via “calibrated treason”—is signaled early and deepens through textual manipulation. But escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening; pressure remains static, atmospheric rather than tactical. No live option is foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized. The “cost” is thematic (moral burden) but not felt in action or consequence—luckily, the accumulative lens permits this, though it limits high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes—understanding echoes—are declared early but remain abstract and untested. No meaningful tightening occurs: Aria employs “progressive disclosure,” yet this method produces revelation without resistance, cost, or altered tactics. The “webs of intrigue” vibrate but impose no consequence. Conflict is internalized as contemplation, not dramatized pressure; the universe hums supportively, offering no opposition or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake (“salvage something pure from the wreckage”) is declared but never tested through concrete opposition or meaningful tightening. The “cameo appearance” triggers a vision but imposes no cost, forces no trade-off, and resolves via passive reception, not agency. Pressure remains static—ghostly whispers and candlelight intensify atmospherically but not narratively—so escalation under the Accumulative lens lacks reweighting with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.3)
    Dominant stake (“uncover hidden patterns”) is declared but never tested under coherent pressure. No tightening occurs: the walk through gardens is frictionless, and revelation arrives by ambiance, not agency. Cost is absent—no time lost, energy spent, or path foreclosed. Coincidence (fireflies mirroring patterns) substitutes for earned escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—uncovering truth—is signaled early but escalates via discovery, not agency. Aria follows paper, reassembles letters, walks to the glow; each step is reactive, not decisive. The “liquidation was orchestrated” twist deepens lore but doesn’t narrow options or force a tradeoff. Pressure remains atmospheric (dust storms) rather than consequential, and the climax offers revelation without sacrifice or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes remain declarative (“discontent,” “yearning for something new”) but never dramatized through concrete opposition or personal risk. The visionary faces no obstacle, makes no trade-off, and incurs no loss. The prophet’s rise occurs entirely off-page, robbing the central conflict of escalation. Coincidence—not agency—drives change: allegiance shifts “like desert sands,” and influence spreads “like wildfire,” both passive metaphors that evade causality.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preserving ephemeral beauty against oblivion—is signaled early and deepens when the poet realizes sounds “bridge the gap between generations.” The tightening occurs when he chooses to write, converting passive collection into active transmission. Yet escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure; the shift feels contemplative, not compelled by rising opposition or narrowing options. Cost remains abstract (emotional weight), not a visible price altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes (“protect the artifact”) are declared but never tested by opposition or complication. The process of vibrational matching faces no obstacles, risks, or trade-offs—pressure remains static. Agency is performative (she “monitors with logic and intuition”) but produces no irreversible choice or visible price, failing to deepen or tighten under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes (“patient revolution,” “unyoking from old order”) are declared but never tested or made visceral. No meaningful tightening occurs: the mapper’s actions don’t narrow options or incur cost. The viaduct’s “humming” intensifies coincidentally, not because of her agency. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation requires density increase or pattern break that reweights the dominant stake—but pressure remains static, rhetorical, and off-stage. The climax substitutes energy surge for actual consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake—uncovering truth for victim and self—is declared early but never concretely tested or tightened. No meaningful reversal or deepening occurs; Maya’s epiphany arrives via passive observation, not agency-driven escalation. Coincidental discovery of the inscription resolves internal arc without struggle or tradeoff. Cost is implied (“controlled by past”) but never made visceral or visible in action, choice, or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake (“moral burden over failed inmate”) is signaled early but never tested in-scene; the chaplain reflects, receives advice, and departs unchanged in action. No meaningful tightening occurs—his “renewed purpose” is declared, not demonstrated under pressure. The proprietor’s line about storm clouds complicates nothing; it resolves via sentiment, not protagonist agency. Cost is generic (“weight on conscience”), not specific or felt.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes remain abstract throughout: “to ring a bell no one had yet heard” is declared but never tested against opposition, loss, or dilemma. No meaningful tightening occurs—Zephyr’s “transliteration” proceeds unimpeded, and the workshop’s evolution responds passively to her insights without resistance. The dominant stake lacks visceral urgency, and the resolution arrives via insight, not earned agency under pressure. Coincidence doesn’t resolve, but neither does struggle complicate; conflict is purely internal and consequence-free.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes remain abstract throughout: “uncover the truth” lacks concrete parameters or consequences. The cold case is referenced but never tested against real-world obstacles or moral trade-offs. Pressure dissipates rather than escalates—the trail “goes cold,” yet Lena faces no depletion of time, trust, or tools. The cryptic message hints at danger but introduces no coherent antagonistic force that tightens options.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes remain abstract (“fragile balance,” “whispers of the frozen sea”) without concrete manifestation. There is no escalation—only a meditative sequence of looking and assembling. The peacekeeper encounters zero opposition, complication, or narrowing of options; the crystal reconstitutes effortlessly via intuition. Without pressure that forces a trade-off or forecloses a path, stakes lack visceral urgency or dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—reconciling survival after failed euthanasia—is signaled early but never tested through concrete opposition. Volunteering offers distraction, not escalation; no reversal narrows options or forces trade-offs. The “sound of approaching endings” emerges passively, not through agency. Cost remains conceptual (“fragile peace”) without on-page forfeiture or consequence that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes are declared (“nurture intersubjective understanding”) but never tested or tightened through opposition or trade-off. The sentinel wanders, observes, and reflects—no meaningful reversal, renunciation, or endurance occurs. Conflict is entirely internal and abstract, with no obstacle, resistance, or consequence to raise pressure. Under an Accumulative lens, there’s density but no intensification that reweights the dominant stake with legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes (“preserve the echo of wisdom”) are declared but never dramatized under threat; no opposition tests the line walker’s capacity. The “consecration” proceeds unimpeded, with no reversal, complication, or trade-off. Under an Accumulative lens, escalation requires reweighting via density or cadence shift, but the prose loops rather than intensifies, and cost remains conceptual, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.1)
    Stakes (“collective healing,” “transmuting pain”) are declared abstractly but never tested in-scene; Luna faces no opposition, obstacle, or dilemma. The dominant stake lacks concrete manifestation, so escalation is impossible. Agency is passive observation, not decision or renunciation, violating the core requirement that stakes be viscerally felt and pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—decoding the pattern versus testifying—is signaled early and deepens when the visitor arrives. Pressure tightens once, forcing a choice that reweights isolation against exposure. Yet escalation relies on external intrusion rather than protagonist-driven agency; the scholar reacts, not acts. Cost (abandoning research) is implied but not viscerally rendered in the moment of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—capturing the sound of aging—is signaled early but remains abstract, never tested by concrete opposition or trade-offs. The “tidal longing” intensifies atmospherically, not through escalating pressure that forces renunciation or sacrifice. Agency is passive: she arranges driftwood, but no live option is foreclosed; the fog’s behavior, not her choices, drives the climax. Cost is implied (forgotten memories) but not enacted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding the universe via the clock hand—is declared but never tested concretely. Earth tremors escalate pressure, yet Eli’s defense work lacks tactical trade-offs or visible loss; the observatory “holds firm” without cost. Coincidence (the leaf sound) catalyzes insight rather than protagonist agency, undercutting escalation under any drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—executing a “flawless goodbye”—is signaled early and deepens after the blood work, but the escalation is atmospheric rather than causal. Lena’s agency lies in humming and singing, yet these actions face no opposition or adaptation; they simply unfold as planned. Cost is felt in Emma’s death but not in Lena’s world—no path is foreclosed, no trade-off made. The piece achieves emotional resonance without narrative pressure tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes are declared (“find where shadows go,” “understand reality-bending”) but never viscerally felt or tested. No meaningful tightening occurs: Lyra’s research proceeds uninterrupted, with no trade-offs, losses, or raised costs. The “spoons bend reality” premise introduces potential pressure but remains vague backdrop, not an active constraint. Agency is passive observation, not decision or renunciation under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes remain abstract: “clarity,” “purpose,” and “hidden truths” are declared but never tested in scene. The dominant stake—making sense of past trauma—is diluted by lyrical generalities rather than tightened through a meaningful turn. No option is foreclosed; Emilia simply walks out “ready,” with no visible price paid. Coincidental discovery of the tooth complicates nothing and resolves everything.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes are declared (“share the pearl of stillness”) but never tested under coherent pressure. There is no tightening, deepening, or cadence shift that narrows options or raises cost—the polishing proceeds uninterrupted, without complication or consequence. The absence of opposition or friction renders the central conflict inert; “fire” is mentioned as forbidden but never poses a temptation or alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—emotional recovery after public exposure—is signaled early but never tested by external pressure beyond memory. The “confession going viral” remains a vague backdrop; no live consequence tightens decisions in-scene. Escalation occurs texturally (silence → pattern → flower), not causally, which fits the Accumulative lens, but agency is minimal: Aria receives solace rather than earns it through renunciation or risk. Cost is implied (“exposed and vulnerable”) but not dramatized as a felt price altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake (creative block) is signaled early but never tightens into concrete pressure: no deadline, rival, or material loss forces a trade-off. The “woman in white” resolves conflict via coincidence, not protagonist agency—her appearance complicates nothing and demands no costly response. Stakes remain abstract (“fear of failure”) without visceral manifestation; the “current” metaphor isn’t operationalized as a constraint that narrows options or demands sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—restoring sacred practices—is declared early but never tested under pressure; the forgotten songs succeed instantly, with no failure, adaptation, or resistance. Coincidence (vine’s glow, villagers’ immediate arrival) resolves rather than complicates. No visible price is paid: time, energy, or emotional toll are summarized, not dramatized. The tightening is tonal (“hush” to “wonder”), not consequential—options don’t narrow, knowledge doesn’t shift.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—translating heartbeats into maps—is signaled early and deepens through the sealing ritual. Pressure tightens via time (fading light) and internal demand (absolute focus), culminating in the hum that harmonizes with her heartbeat. Yet escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency: success arrives through steady execution, not a meaningful trade-off or narrowed option. Cost remains atmospheric, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding the “harvest of echoes”—is signaled early but remains abstract, never tested by concrete opposition or loss. Pressure accumulates texturally (days turning to months, heightened senses), but no meaningful tightening forecloses an option or forces a trade-off. The broken timer is repaired without complication; agency is passive observation, not decision under duress. Coincidence doesn’t resolve, but neither does struggle—progress feels frictionless, undercutting cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake—collecting burdens—is declared but never tested concretely; no burden manifests as a dilemma, loss, or trade-off. Pressure remains atmospheric, not causal or situational. The weaver’s “task” encounters no opposition, complication, or evolving knowledge. Coincidence doesn’t resolve anything because nothing is at risk—stakes float in abstraction, never materializing in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—containing overwhelming grief—is signaled early and deepens through the carving ritual. Pressure escalates texturally (rain intensifies, kettle boils, wood takes form), but the tightening lacks protagonist-driven agency; she reacts to stimuli rather than makes trade-offs that narrow options. Cost is implied (husband’s absence) but not dramatized as a price altering tactics mid-process.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—reconciling eroded ambitions through collected fragments—is signaled early and accumulates texture, but pressure never tightens into a consequential trade-off or narrowed option. The scavenger gathers whispers without resistance, cost, or failed attempts; conflict is internalized but not dramatized as active struggle. The sunset provides cadence shift, not escalation driven by protagonist agency. Cost is felt thematically but not viscerally enacted—no tool lost, time spent, or path foreclosed through choice.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake (“restore terminal as beacon of hope”) is signaled early but never escalates—no opposition, complication, or narrowing of options. Maya’s agency is frictionless: she envisions, acts, succeeds. The “maze of intentions” offers no puzzle to solve, only a metaphor to admire. Cost is asserted (“dark times”) but never dramatized; renewal arrives by narrative fiat, not earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake (reconciling dream vs duty) is signaled early but never tested under pressure. The bear’s arrival complicates emotionally but resolves nothing; Elian returns to work unchanged in action. No meaningful tightening occurs—only a soft realization. Cost is abstract (“sense of peace”), not felt or visible; opportunity isn’t seized or sacrificed, only contemplated. Coincidence (bear appearing) substitutes for agency-driven escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes are declared (“hindsight clarity,” “profound truth”) but never tested or made visceral. No meaningful tightening occurs—Lyra’s search faces no obstacle, loss, or tradeoff. The “conflict” is internal abstraction without external pressure; the resolution comes via passive revelation, not agency. Coincidence (the sundial simply appears) resolves what was never truly in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes (“preserve ancient methods”) are declared but never tested by opposition or trade-off. The “conflict” is observational, not active—no obstacle impedes decoding. Fog and time deepen mood but don’t tighten options. Agency is passive endurance, not decision; success arrives without complication. Coincidence isn’t used, but neither is meaningful pressure—escalation is textural, not consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to absences—is signaled early but remains abstract, never tested through concrete opposition or raised cost. Pressure accumulates texturally (deepening shadows, fading light) rather than causally; the narrator’s act of writing faces no obstacle or trade-off. The snapped thread offers symbolic cost but no lived consequence that alters tactics. Under an Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices, but the lack of protagonist-driven escalation limits tension.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring lost beauty—is signaled early and deepens through the prince’s assembly of the device, which narrows his focus from abstract longing to concrete action. Pressure accumulates texturally (shuddering palace, humming device, pulsing egg), culminating in a moment of high anticipation. Yet the escalation lacks a decisive tightening that forecloses an option; the prince never risks or sacrifices anything tangible. The cost remains emotional (nostalgia, trepidation) but isn’t dramatized as a loss that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—proving scars can heal—is signaled early but remains abstract. The “conflict” is internal and static; no external pressure tests Aria’s resolve beyond a perfunctory radio call. The grafting act is symbolic, not consequential, and rain arrives coincidentally, not as a result of choice. Under an Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices, but here escalation is textual, not dramatic—no narrowing of options, no price paid for compassion.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—liberating trapped memories—is signaled early and deepens via breadcrumb pursuit, culminating in Aria’s assumption of guardianship. Yet escalation relies on discovery, not protagonist-driven agency: geese carvings and glass shards guide her, not tactical decisions under duress. The cost (ongoing responsibility) is declared but not dramatized as a trade-off; no option is visibly foreclosed by her choice to open the box.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—sharing light without fire—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or consequence. Pressure remains atmospheric, not causal; “sonar pinging” reveals harmonies but encounters no resistance. The sole deepening is thematic (“troubling serenity”), not tactical—no option is narrowed, no price paid. Under an Accumulative lens, one intensification suffices, but here it lacks agency-driven escalation or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.3)
    Dominant stake—understanding “the shape of collective grief”—is declared but never tested through active conflict. Pressure is ambient (turmoil within, fading light) not coherent; the ghost’s appearance complicates nothing. No meaningful tightening occurs: the carver recites a poem, watches butterflies, and receives insight without trade-off or loss. Coincidence (butterflies arriving precisely at climax) resolves emotional tension rather than earned agency.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.3)
    Dominant stake (“redemption via incremental absolution”) is declared but never tested in-scene; no tightening narrows options or forces trade-offs. The rake handle’s inscription resolves inner turmoil through coincidence, not protagonist agency. Pressure remains abstract—waves hum, memories flood—but no concrete obstacle challenges Elara’s ethics or diligence. Cost is asserted (“weight lifting”) but never dramatized or paid.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes (“discover the shape of intentions”) are declared but never tested through meaningful opposition or trade-offs; the gardener faces no resistance, loss, or dilemma. The “uncharted echoes” exert no tangible pressure—escalation is atmospheric, not consequential—so no tightening or deepening occurs under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes are abstract (“write the future,” “seed innovation”) and never tested on the page. No tightening occurs—pressure remains static, and the protagonist faces no trade-off or foreclosed path. The dominant stake is declared but never concretized into action, cost, or altered knowledge under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—capturing the pirate broadcast to unlock narrative dust—is signaled early but never truly pressured. No meaningful tightening occurs; the broadcast arrives conveniently, deciphers easily, and yields success without loss. Agency is passive reception, not active struggle; coincidence resolves rather than complicates. Cost is absent: no time lost, tool broken, or belief shattered.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—confronting the illusion of safety—is declared but never tested through concrete opposition or dilemma. Lena’s “preparation to scatter” isn’t a pressured decision; it’s a scheduled duty. Eli’s dialogue deepens theme but doesn’t raise stakes or narrow options. The single tightening (realizing art’s transience) occurs internally without consequence or trade-off, violating the “visible or felt price” band guardrail for 8.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stakes are declared (“preserve ancient methods,” “uncover truth”) but never tested or tightened. No meaningful escalation occurs—Kael digs, reads, thinks, smiles. The dominant stake remains static, and no on-page reversal or deepening forces a trade-off. Pressure is internal but inert; coincidence doesn’t resolve anything because nothing was ever at risk. Cost is implied but never felt or visible in action.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes are declared (“unlearning hatred,” “preserving vanishing arts”) but never tested in-scene; no tangible opposition or consequence arises. Emilia faces no meaningful obstacle, trade-off, or loss—her “task” remains abstract. Without escalation or agency-driven pressure, the dominant stake floats unanchored in action, violating the Situational/Accumulative escalation test.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—creating beauty from ruins—is signaled early and deepens via the celestial alignment, which tightens the window for action. However, escalation lacks agency-driven pressure: the alignment is external fortune, not a challenge Aria must overcome. No live option is foreclosed; success arrives without trade-off. Cost is conceptual (“decay”) but not personal—no stamina, time, or emotional toll alters her tactics or outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake (“witness failure”) is passive observation, not active pursuit with risk. No meaningful tightening occurs—the beehive’s “adaptation” is revealed via log, not earned through struggle or trade-off. Coincidental arrival of workers delivers the riddle; luck complicates nothing and solves everything off-stage. The toll keeper’s “determination” yields no tactical shift, stamina loss, or irreversible decision—pressure remains static, stakes purely intellectual.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding aliveness in houses—is signaled early but never tested under coherent pressure. Eli’s ritual faces no obstacle, doubt, or risk; sanctification proceeds frictionlessly. Agency is passive observation, not decision with cost. The “deepening” is cognitive, not consequential; no option narrows, no price is paid. Coincidence (finding the shop) initiates but doesn’t complicate; resolution arrives by atmospheric osmosis.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding the garden’s downfall—is signaled early but never tested through meaningful opposition or sacrifice. The “structural weaknesses” insight arrives via magical object, not protagonist agency. No path is foreclosed; the statue simply gains wisdom without cost. Coincidence (the drifting ampoule) resolves the central mystery, violating the rule that luck may complicate but not solve.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.3)
    Dominant stake (“solve perpetual motion”) is intellectual, not visceral, and never tested by concrete opposition. Pressure accumulates texturally (heavier air, steeper stairs) but doesn’t tighten under any lens—no option is foreclosed, no knowledge shifts meaningfully. “Rupture” claims disruption but yields no tactical consequence or deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—reviving lost languages to prove strangers remember kindness—is signaled early and sustained. Yet it remains conceptual; no on-page test forces a trade-off or narrows options. The painter’s act of creation faces no opposition, internal or external, so pressure never coheres into meaningful escalation. The story deepens atmospherically but not dramatically; stakes are felt lyrically, not viscerally. Coincidence (moonlight) inspires but doesn’t complicate.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving displaced persons’ histories—is declared but never tested through concrete opposition or trade-offs. The thawing ice reveals artifacts but imposes no dilemma, urgency, or consequence on Elena or the group. Agency is passive observation; no meaningful tightening forecloses options or alters tactics. Coincidence (natural thaw) drives revelation, not protagonist choice, undercutting escalation under any drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake (“unlock latent radiance”) is declared but never tested through concrete opposition or trade-offs. The “reverse-engineering” is told, not shown, so pressure never escalates causally. Coincidence drives discovery (stone on shelf, yoyo in compartment), and resolution relies on unearned epiphany. No visible price is paid; the “change” is internal and abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.3)
    Stakes are declared (“uncover the secret,” “harness luminance”) but never tested through concrete opposition or trade-offs. The protagonist faces no meaningful tightening—each discovery (poster, dictionary, mirror) arrives passively, without resistance or consequence. The whispering advisor goads but never impedes, and the “photographically cursed model” poses no active threat. Pressure is atmospheric, not dramatic; escalation is simulated through intensifying adjectives, not narrowed options or earned deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—interpreting clouds to distill atmosphere into music—is signaled early but never tested under real pressure. There’s no opposition, obstacle, or trade-off; the act unfolds unimpeded. The “deepening” is tonal (blue hour → indigo) not consequential. Agency is performative, not costly: she strikes branches, taps driftwood, vanishes—no loss, fatigue, or risk alters her method. Coincidence doesn’t resolve, but neither does struggle complicate; escalation is textural, not dramatic, failing the lens’s requirement for reweighted stakes with legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the expedition’s fate—is signaled early, and tension escalates via the map’s revelation. Yet escalation relies on passive discovery, not protagonist-driven agency; Lyra deciphers, reacts, but doesn’t wrestle with a narrowing of options. The “price” remains abstract dread, not a concrete forfeiture (e.g., abandoning safety, burning a bridge). Coincidence (shell cracking open) resolves the search, undercutting earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—uncovering historical truth—is signaled early but never tested under real pressure. No reversal, trade-off, or narrowing of options occurs; Emilia walks in, finds the archive, reads, and leaves. The “noble lie” concept frames the quest but doesn’t complicate her process. Cost is absent: no time lost, stamina spent, or belief shattered. Escalation is static—accumulation without deepening—so stakes remain abstract rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are declared (“preserve the past for those who come after”) but never tested by opposition or meaningful complication. The drawbridge rising signals time’s passage but imposes no tactical pressure—the surveyor works undisturbed. No reversal or deepening narrows options; the conflict is internalized as mood, not dramatized struggle. Agency is passive observation, not decision or renunciation with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes remain abstract (“trace honest origins,” “uncover truth”) without concrete on-page tests or escalation. The “alternative hypothesis” appears as a thought, not a risky pivot with consequences. No option is foreclosed, no resource depleted, no price paid—Elara’s “bold annotation” carries no narrative or personal cost. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen via pattern break or cadence shift, but the rhythm stays static, and tension never tightens beyond intellectual curiosity.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—transcending grief through art—is signaled early but never tightens into a pressured choice. No meaningful escalation occurs; the “shadow detaching” is backstory, not active conflict. The basilica’s promise remains passive, and Kaito’s actions (polishing, folding) are repetitive rituals, not tactical responses to rising stakes. Cost is implied but never dramatized or paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake (“find unused potential”) is declared but never tested concretely; Amira’s “hunt” involves poring over data with no obstacles or trade-offs. The circuit breakers’ downtime is framed as an “opportunity,” not a constraint that tightens options. Coincidence drives the plot: flyer appears conveniently, Dr. Patel happens to study relevant theory. No visible price is paid—Amira gains purpose without loss, violating cost requirements under any drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—decoding the frequency—is declared but never viscerally tested; no obstacle impedes Lena beyond mild dimness. The “missing pieces” concept doesn’t narrow options or raise cost—it’s a plot device without friction. Her agency is minimal: she scans, interprets, retrieves. No trade-off occurs; the chip appears conveniently, and success comes without loss. Pressure remains static, escalating only in lyrical description, not narrative consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes (“uncover family secret”) are declared but never tested—no obstacle, reversal, or deepening alters tactics. The “sieved hush” concept is thematic wallpaper, not a source of pressure. Protagonist’s agency is passive contemplation; her walk yields a memory but no new knowledge that tightens options or raises cost.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—achieving prisoner exchange through forgiveness—is signaled early but remains abstract. The “synchronizing through moon phases” method introduces a unique constraint, yet it exerts no real pressure; negotiations succeed because the narrator declares harmony, not due to protagonist-driven agency. No live option is foreclosed, and the resolution lacks tangible consequence. Cost is conceptual (“weight of past mistakes”) but never embodied or paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.3)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming purpose after divorce—is declared but never tested by concrete opposition. No meaningful tightening occurs: Jack simply chooses to paddle and instantly finds calm. The “backlash of regrets” exerts no tactical pressure; it’s a mood, not a force that alters decisions. Agency is passive (“felt himself gravitating”), and the resolution relies on internal realization without visible price, violating the requirement that stakes materialize in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes (“kindle empathy”) are declared but never tested—no opposition, obstacle, or trade-off forces Lena to choose. The “labyrinth of choices” is metaphorical, not operational; she follows a path that “beckons,” encountering zero resistance. Coincidence (finding the box) complicates nothing and resolves nothing. No visible price is paid; the dominant stake remains abstract and unpressurized throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—reforging a bond beyond death—is signaled early and escalates via the ritual, but pressure remains abstract. The “rare spices” method appears only when needed, offering no prior obstacle or resource limitation. Lyra’s metamorphosis carries no visible cost; her “steadiness” negates tension rather than crystallizing a stance under duress. Coincidence (Aria arriving post-phoenix) complicates but doesn’t deepen agency-driven escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—recovering lost time—is signaled early and deepens through the hand-tracings and saucer, but pressure remains internal and undramatized. No meaningful tightening occurs; the cartomancer reflects, recalls, and accepts, but never faces a concrete obstacle or makes a costly decision that alters her trajectory. The “cloudbound repentance” concept intensifies atmospherically but not situationally—coincidence (memory surfacing) complicates, but nothing resolves through agency. Cost is conceptual, not felt in action or forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—unlocking the dimension via shadow work—is declared early but never concretely tested or narrowed by opposition. Aurora faces no resistance, complication, or trade-off; stitching proceeds uninterrupted. The “perilous journey” of shadow work remains abstract, with no visible price altering tactics. Escalation is textural (glowing Tear, shimmering photos), not causal or situational pressure forcing crystallized stance.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes are declared (“fulfillment of prophecy,” “understanding transformation”) but never tested through active conflict or trade-offs. Pressure escalates only atmospherically—the volcano rumbles, the hush grows louder—but Aria faces no opposition, dilemma, or consequence for her choices. The “detour” leads effortlessly to destiny; no agency drives escalation. Coincidence resolves the central mystery, violating the Situational/Accumulative rule that luck may complicate but not solve.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake (“spark a silent revolution”) is declared but never tested—no opposition, no risk, no tangible loss. The blackout complicates but doesn’t escalate; the sentinel faces zero meaningful pressure. Agency is passive: she deciphers a message handed to her, then activates a mechanism with no consequence. Cost is absent; the “revolution” succeeds instantly, painlessly, contradicting the premise of defiance requiring courage.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (unlocking cosmic patterns) is signaled early but remains abstract; no tangible cost accrues during escalation. The “harnessing” succeeds without complication—no reversal, resistance, or sacrifice. Protagonist agency is passive (sensing, placing rocks); stakes deepen only via assertion (“weight of unfulfilled prophecies”), not dramatized pressure. Coincidental stardust discovery undermines earned tension.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding the self through hidden patterns—is signaled early and deepens via the envelope’s revelation. Pressure escalates texturally through storm intensification and mental vortex, culminating in stillness. Yet agency is passive: inspiration “arrives,” the envelope “slips out.” The poet doesn’t *choose* confrontation so much as receive it. Cost is implied (years of concealment) but not enacted; masks slip without resistance, weakening escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are declared (“battle of wits,” “uncovering the hidden overture”) but never concretely tested. The opponent is a cipher; no counter-argument or resistance is shown, so Aurélien’s “victory” is unchallenged. Pressure remains static—fencing motions and reflection loop without escalation. The “hidden overture” resolves via exposition, not earned insight. Coincidence doesn’t resolve, but absence of opposition flattens conflict into soliloquy, violating the Situational lens requirement for coherent pressure forcing stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes (“rebuild the library,” “help rebuild the city”) are declared but never tested or complicated on the page. No opposition appears, no resources are scarce, no choices carry visible cost. The “blooming resistance” is mentioned but exerts zero pressure on the protagonist’s actions. Agency is passive: the poet resolves, then executes without friction, foreclosing nothing.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—escaping grief through art—is signaled early and deepens when the pianist enters the film world. Yet escalation relies on atmospheric accumulation, not protagonist-driven pressure: she reacts to compasses and film, but never makes a difficult choice with visible cost. The “unplanned encore” is declared, not dramatized under opposition. Under an Accumulative lens, one intensification suffices, but the absence of foreclosed options or sacrificed alternatives leaves stakes abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—protecting collective memory—is signaled early but remains abstract. Pressure escalates via approaching monsoon, yet Aria faces no meaningful trade-offs or narrowed options; her work proceeds uninterrupted. The “risk of memories being washed away” is declared but never tested through concrete failure or resistance. Coincidence (rain purifying memory) resolves tension rather than earned agency.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.3)
    Dominant stake (processing regret) is signaled early but never tested under coherent pressure. The lace-weaving method introduces no meaningful escalation—there’s no risk of failure, time limit, or consequence tied to the act. Coincidence drives the plot (compass washes ashore), and resolution comes via ritual release, not protagonist agency. No option is foreclosed; Kaito gains peace without loss, violating cost requirements under any drive lens.
