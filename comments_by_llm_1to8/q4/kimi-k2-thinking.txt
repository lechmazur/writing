  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Elena seeks to understand "the underlying mechanics" and strip needless drama from existence. One meaningful deepening occurs when the greenhouse "taught her otherwise," forcing a revision of her preprocessing method. Agency is renunciation—she will "let it live as memory" rather than document further—but this choice does not foreclose a live tactical option on the page; it summarizes a future stance. The cost (relinquishing her data-extraction approach) is legible but more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake (survival from smugglers vs. discovering father's legacy) is signaled early, but the piece never forces a trade-off between them. The frost-map discovery and furnace visit feel like serial reveals rather than escalating pressure; Kael's decision to create the glass vessel and leave with both ledger and shard avoids foreclosing a path. One tightening moment—realizing "his father's legacy was not in the charcoal trade, but in the glass"—reweights understanding but does not alter tactics or narrow options with visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—rectifying silence by translating it into shared feeling—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Mara's three fork strikes provide a pattern of escalation (low C → hope, A → sorrow, E → anger), but each strike succeeds without complication or trade-off; there is no moment where the method risks failure or forces a choice between competing goods. The ending deepens understanding (silence as canvas) but does not foreclose a live option or extract a visible price at the closure beat. Agency is present but pressure remains additive rather than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—giving rest to the unremembered dead—is signaled early and tightens when the lens begins to hum with distress signals. The undertaker's gathering of materials and assembly work narrows options, culminating in the library's transformation. However, the escalation operates more through atmospheric accumulation than protagonist-driven reversals; the dreams that teach the method feel delivered rather than wrestled for. The final cost (eternal occupation vs. sought silence) is conceptually clear but lacks a sharp on-page trade-off moment where competing goods collide.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake (intergenerational support) is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page choice forces Mara to trade one good for another. The midnight food runs continue without obstacle, the story-night succeeds immediately, and the community responds "with quiet enthusiasm" without friction. The storm sequence offers a reversal opportunity but is resolved off-page ("soaked but safe"). No tightening narrows options; escalation reads as thematic intensification rather than rising cost under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—is signaled early, but pressure remains static: Mira observes, breathes, and receives rather than confronting a reversal or trade-off. The lover's spectral smile and the chamber sealing itself are handed to her without agency-driven escalation. No meaningful tightening forecloses an option or forces a cost; the "release" is told rather than tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering the texture of time to escape retrocognitive entrapment—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through months of mapping, but the escalation is summarized ("worked for months") rather than shown in distinct beats with rising cost. The halo fragment traps her, she theorizes, she calculates, she completes—but no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options with visible agency. The disintegration resolves the trap but reads as consequence, not protagonist-driven turn.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.4)
    A dominant stake ("plant resilience") is signaled early and persists. One meaningful tightening occurs when the sentry activates, forcing the liberator to "impede its advance," which narrows options briefly and uses the arrow. However, the escalation is mechanical: each obstacle (lock, sentry, vault hatch) is solved in sequence without compounding prior costs or forcing trade-offs. The resolution ("still chained but triumphant") asserts victory without showing what path was foreclosed or what price was paid; coincidence does not resolve, but neither does genuine agency under duress. Cost clarity at closure is absent, capping the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—finding the sound of trust breaking—is signaled early and sustained. The piece accumulates pressure through collection, archive-building, and the synesthetic flicker of "diseased violet." The forge reignition constitutes a meaningful tightening that narrows options: Lyra can finally hear the target frequency. Cost is legible in the device's release and the acceptance of silence as a "cleared channel." One friction: the escalation relies on a near-coincidental event (forge spontaneously reignites) rather than protagonist agency driving the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—capture illuminated moments via portrait theft—is signaled early but never tested by meaningful opposition or cost. Lux's goal pursuit is a frictionless scavenger hunt: flower code → bench → portrait → moonbeam reveal → train, each step unlocking the next without a blocked path, tactical pivot, or visible price. The clock chimes twice as atmospheric punctuation, not as a tightening constraint that narrows options. No reversal occurs; the painted door "shimmers" open on cue when she whispers the riddle's answer, a convenience resolution rather than protagonist-driven escalation. Agency is observational—she listens, pours, decodes—never forced to renounce, endure, or choose between competing goods with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is emotional recovery through ritual craft, signaled early and sustained. One clear tightening: discovering the new leak and touching the dampness parallels his own thaw, compelling him to "abandon his usual restraint" and blow the larger bowl. The act of filling it with meltwater and floating the bookmark is agency as renunciation and acceptance—foreclosing the path of frozen grief. Cost is legible: he leaves the bowl behind, accepts the crack as entrance rather than flaw, and descends with the thaw incomplete but ongoing. No antagonist required; pressure coheres through accumulated sensory and emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—survive and escape the AI sentry—is clear, and one tightening occurs when Caela's intercom offer forces Mira to act (shout the disabling phrase). Yet the escalation reads as puzzle-solving without meaningful cost: each move (decrypt, input password, crawl, shout phrase) succeeds on first attempt, and the final image of leaving the shell and vowing to help others does not foreclose a path or exact a visible price. The "trembling certainty" posture signals internal conflict but does not translate into on-page hesitation or sacrifice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—navigating the endless night—is signaled early but never tested. The traveler faces no reversal, tightening, or forced trade-off; he requests the map, receives it, and departs. The oracle's work is summarized ("her task complete") rather than dramatized. No on-page cost alters tactics or forecloses a path; the map's "faint glow" is asserted, not earned through protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding the origin of thoughts—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens: each loop amalgamates data, the violin's filaments mirror J-3's circuitry, and the final plucked chord merges timelines into "a single, harmonious thread." Agency is present in the decision to capture the phenomenon and synchronize with the violin's oscillations. The resolution (participation over locating a source) is earned by the layered iterations. One limitation: the loops deepen understanding but never force a trade-off or foreclose a path with visible cost; the stakes remain contemplative rather than pressured by consequence, and the final insight arrives without sacrifice or loss on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—exposing theft to thaw team mistrust—is signaled early and pursued consistently. One meaningful turn occurs when Elara discovers the doodles map to timestamps, narrowing her investigation. Yet escalation is thin: she faces no obstacle after that discovery, and the manager's acceptance plus the stagehand's confession arrive without resistance. The "silent war" among staff is told rather than dramatized, so the resolution's emotional weight feels asserted. Cost is declared ("quiet freedom," "weight lifted") but not enacted—Elara risks nothing and forfeits nothing visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake (proving the garden-gardener bond to skeptical heirs) is signaled early but never tested with genuine opposition—the heirs accept Silas's explanation without friction, collapsing escalation. The wilted rosebush discovery is a problem Silas solves by exposition rather than action. No reversal forecloses a path; the resolution is delivered through agreement, not agency. The piece declares stakes ("they would replace him with a machine") but never dramatizes that threat, leaving pressure abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: proving time moves sideways, signaled early and sustained. Kael's agency manifests in the lever pull that diverts station power, a concrete choice with immediate consequence (plunging habitation into darkness, Chen's alarm). The magnetic nexus blooming and holographic timelines spreading constitute one meaningful tightening that narrows options under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible: career-ending pseudoscience label, data dismissed as error, but she holds the secret. The choice feels earned by her patient three-cycle wait and accumulated favors.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: unravel the ghost's code and decide whether to free or preserve the haunting. Mara's agency is visible in the decision to play the sequence and complete the aria. Pressure tightens across the note sequence (water moves, lanterns dim, program bleeds ink), and the final choice—play the last note—narrows options with cost (ghost departs, muse vanishes). However, the deepening ("understood the ghost's true message") is told rather than earned through prior friction, and the either/or (free or destroy) is resolved by a late insight that reframes the stakes without dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—recovering the weight of the swallowed truth—is signaled early but never tightens through a dramatized choice. The oracle examines the logbook, traces the smudge, places the illustration on the scale, but each action is observational or symbolic rather than a trade-off that narrows options. The resolution (forgiveness, release) is told in summary without an on-page cost that forecloses a live path, keeping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake is Elias's need to measure and release the weight of his father's confession. The valve-twist at the climax narrows options (release the souls or seal them forever), but Elias faces no meaningful opposition or trade-off—he simply turns the wheel and the ghosts dissolve. Cost (carrying the memory forward, calling the historical society) is stated but not dramatized as a difficult choice. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres but does not escalate sharply; the final act reweights but does not tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—preserve fragile knowledge—is signaled early but never tested by a tightening that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The swan passage and chamber discovery occur without opposition, cost, or agency-driven reversal. Pressure remains atmospheric rather than escalating under the Accumulative lens; no visible price alters tactics. The ending reaffirms her stance without on-page consequence or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—Mira seeking to bridge memory and presence during the eclipse—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates as the eclipse progresses, but the escalation is more atmospheric than action-driven; Mira plays, Eleanor responds, the moment arrives without a forced choice or visible trade-off. The "link snapped into place" is convenience coincidence rather than protagonist agency under pressure. The resolution (Eleanor's whisper and smile) is received rather than earned through a decision that forecloses a path. One meaningful deepening occurs (the recognition), but cost legibility is weak.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding why dreams ceased—is signaled early and tightens when Elias discovers the pattern linking diaries to the tapestry dragons. The "probe" yields a conceptual breakthrough rather than a decision under competing pressures. No live opposition or trade-off narrows his options; the discovery flows smoothly from methodical work to epiphany. The final act of cataloguing feels like completion rather than a choice that forecloses alternatives with visible cost. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening occurs, but escalation through protagonist agency with felt price is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—transposing her life from cursed passenger to intentional pilot—is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful turn: the discovery that lets her shift from prediction to composition. The orchestration of three fortunes (ring, delay, woman's return) demonstrates escalation through directed agency rather than reactive fear. However, the stakes remain largely internal and the "cost" of her new power is asserted more than tested on the page; no live opposition forces a trade-off, and the morning confirmations arrive without friction or surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear and urgent: save Elias before the entity settles in seven hours. One meaningful tightening occurs when the entity hesitates, confused by Miriam's paradoxes, then slips away. However, Elias exercises no agency—Miriam's method resolves the conflict without his participation, reducing the protagonist-driven pressure. Cost is present (the entity departs, Elias's hidden stillness is exposed) but the victory feels enacted upon him rather than earned through joint struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—conducting unheard symphonies before exhaustion claims her—is signaled early but never tested on the page. She raises the shell, produces a note, the world responds favorably, and exhaustion is mentioned only to be immediately deferred ("before exhaustion could claim her, she pressed…"). No reversal, no tightening, no live cost. The symphony succeeds without friction, and the protagonist returns to her desk with no path foreclosed, yielding outline-like sequencing without escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=3.6)
    Dominant stake ("conquer the labyrinth of self") is signaled midway but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the protagonist moves through procedurally generated corridors without meeting resistance that forces trade-offs. The ending grants dissolution without prior cost: "surrender" is declared the "only victory" in summary rather than dramatized through a choice that forecloses a path. Coincidence (the raindrop, the tablet reconstituting) resolves rather than complicates, violating the core test.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—defeating numbness—is signaled early and tightens when Elara accepts the needle and feels the backward song. Yet escalation is passive: she receives, listens, feels, leaves. No on-page reversal forces a trade-off; the drum maker hands her solutions without complication. The "mirrored hush" ritual succeeds immediately with no friction, and the cost ("numbness finally defeated") is declared rather than dramatized as a forfeiture or endurance that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—protect the data and expose the quarantine secret—signals early and tightens through pursuit → rooftop escape → courtyard pause → pigeon release. The director's warning becomes a challenge, the bureau follows, Elias counters laterally, then commits by dispatching evidence. One clear escalation: being followed forces immediate action, and sending the pigeon forecloses retreat. The cost is stated ("mark him as a target") but not materially shown; he ends smiling and walking on, which undercuts the felt price. Agency is present (he chooses defiance over silence), yet the final beat offers resolve rather than visible forfeiture, limiting entry to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—"to discover the texture of time"—is signaled early but never tested by a meaningful tightening or cost. The poet could use the rope to escape or weave it into the wall, yet he chooses a third option (carry it onward) that sidesteps both, foreclosing no path and risking nothing. Pressure remains static from entry to exit; no reversal, no trade-off, no on-page price. Agency is entirely internal and costless, consistent with the Accumulative lens but lacking the requisite deepening or cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake ("unbind the chronic hush") is signaled early but never tested. No obstacle complicates the ritual; the fire whispers, the violin plays, the hush weakens. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the protagonist's agency is assertion without cost. The final third shifts to future-tense plans ("She will share this ritual") that abandon present pressure entirely. Escalation is absent under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—testing and delivering synthetic empathy—is signaled early and remains coherent. The client's transformation provides one pressure point: inhaling the petal, emotional shift, departure. Yet the dealer faces no escalating choice or visible tradeoff; the "professionally thorough" process unfolds without friction. The dealer's internal stake ("to fuse insight with empathy") is declared but never tested by an on-page decision that narrows options or imposes cost. The accumulative lens allows for deepening via imagery recurrence, but the lack of a tightening choice or foreclosed path for the protagonist caps escalation credit. The client's arc is complete; the dealer's remains observational.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—returning the locket and honoring silent contributors—is signaled early, but escalation dissolves into convenient alignment. Lena's investigation encounters no resistance; Caleb's gratitude transitions immediately to co-planning the ceremony without friction. The ceremony itself is summarized rather than dramatized, and no on-page choice forces a trade-off or forecloses an option. The cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than legible in a pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake—grafting onto community—is signaled early and sustained. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as increasing intimacy (girl teaches, villagers leave offerings), but no live option is foreclosed with visible cost. The tag discovery and sculpture placement feel like fulfillment rather than trade-off; Kael's loneliness "transforms" but prior gestures (the grieving mother's rejection) carry no tactical consequence at closure. One meaningful deepening occurs (villagers' trust shifts from silence to offerings), meeting minimal requirements, but the climax lacks felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preserve the primordial echo before the giant wakes—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs: the Gasp pauses introduce urgency, and the pendant's borrowed time adds a visible cost (it dissolves, Elara becomes static). However, escalation is more accumulative than agentive. Elara's peak choice to strike the bell is presented as inevitable rather than a trade-off between competing goods. No alternative path is dramatized or foreclosed with friction. The cost is legible but not felt as a dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding the mathematics of emotion to bridge absence and presence—is signaled early but remains abstract. Vesper's ritual (placing the eyes, whispering formulas, dripping moonlight) constitutes action, but the escalation is atmospheric rather than a narrowing of tactical options. The doorway's emergence represents a tightening, yet it arrives as a lyric gift rather than a consequence of a hard choice Vesper makes under competing pressures. No visible tradeoff or cost forecloses a path; she simply steps back and departs. Under the Accumulative lens, the cadence shift from ritual to departure qualifies as minimal escalation, but the absence of a felt price at the moment of transformation keeps this from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: Mara's need to become visible through acts of methodical kindness. The outage provides opportunity, and her placement of the tape reel is a tightening choice that narrows her tactics (she must work by feel, cache objects where discovery is inevitable). The boy's discovery and his sitting with the book deepens the pressure by validating her seventeen years of invisible labor. However, the escalation is modest; Mara faces no immediate opposition or complication, and the cost at closure—her continued waiting—reads more as continuation than foreclosure. Agency is present but gentle; the piece accumulates rather than reverses.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: Elena's need to control versus the plants' autonomous growth, braided with her internal resistance to personal change. One meaningful tightening occurs when forcing the lattice causes vines to curl away, prompting her to release control. However, escalation lacks a visible price—no customers lost, no plants damaged, no relationship strained. The choice to step back is framed as insight rather than a forced trade-off, and the resolution grants symmetric satisfaction (nursery flourishes, she feels at peace) without foreclosing a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake: to thresh meaning from silence and memory through art. The painter's sleeplessness and search apply coherent pressure, and the exchange with the scavenger offers a tightening beat. However, the escalation is atmospheric rather than driven by protagonist agency; the brooch appears by chance, and the scavenger's arrival is coincidental. The cost of painting over the portrait is implied but not dramatized—no visible trade-off or foreclosed path on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs but lacks the felt price required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=4.8)
    Dominant stake: contain or magnify the unseen forces through the pearl. No live tightening or trade-off: Lira's choice to "not fight" is declared without visible cost or a foreclosed alternative. The pilgrim's catalyst role is passive coincidence. The escalation (forces surge, pearl glows brighter, crescendo) is atmospheric intensification without narrowing Lira's options or raising the price of her decision. The "balance restored" resolution lacks a felt or visible sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake: compile the navigator's story from fragments and hearten him by proving his silence was speech. The archivist's work proceeds without opposition or resource constraint—she collects, plays intervals, and the fragments align on schedule. No meaningful tightening occurs; the seventh interval simply completes the sequence without prior risk or narrowed options. The navigator's weeping registers emotional payoff, but no trade-off or forfeited path is visible. Coincidence (the valve "resonating with the stored mists") enables resolution rather than protagonist choice under pressure. One micro turn (summoning him to demonstrate) exists, but escalation reads flat across the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—trusting ephemeral guides over precise maps—is signaled in paragraph ten and coheres under the Accumulative lens. Pressure tightens once when the phantom punch burns hotter and she steps forward, following the arrows through narrowing alleys. However, the escalation is largely textural (mist thickens, air changes) rather than dramatized choice-under-opposition; no credible obstacle tests her commitment before the door dissolves. The final act of touching the pillar reconfigures understanding but occurs without visible price—no map burned, no brother confronted, no tactical loss on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—sculpting space for the fisherman's grief—is declared early but never tested by opposition or scarcity; Lira proceeds without obstacle, and success is summarized rather than dramatized. No meaningful tightening or trade-off occurs: the tile unlocks on first attempt, the fisherman enters and is healed, and Lira's skepticism dissolves without cost. The whale migration functions as atmosphere rather than pressure; no reversal or escalation forces a higher-stakes choice.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—escape from perpetual boredom—is signaled early. The solar storm provides external pressure, and Althea's decision to merge with the amulet fragment represents agency with cost (dissolution of singular consciousness). However, escalation reads as textural accumulation rather than narrowing options through protagonist-driven reversals. The spatial mutiny and magnetic alignment feel more like atmospheric conditions than obstacles she must overcome through tactical choices. One meaningful deepening occurs when she "finally felt the exquisite release of uncertainty," but the price is conceptual rather than viscerally tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (asylum for the father) is signaled early and tightens when Sam discovers the ledger reveals a $47,000 price rather than free letterhead. The breach action and ink pot discovery narrow options with causal pressure, forcing Sam to negotiate from a discovered secret rather than simple theft. The final transaction forecloses innocence with visible cost: "seven more lies" calculated on-page. Agency is decision under situational constraint; the director's recognition of Sam as "an equal" registers the power shift and closes the deal with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—to collect textures of time—is signaled early but never faces opposition or deepening. She records, charts, presses gold leaf, and imagines, repeating the ritual without reversal, tightening, or visible trade-off. No antagonistic pressure, internal contradiction, or price paid alters her tactics. The ending offers continuation of the ritual as the lamp dims, not a turn or earned endurance that forecloses a path. Declared defiance against emptiness remains abstract without on-page test.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (discovering memory's texture) is signaled early and deepens when the poison label reveals his own handwriting—erasure becomes personal rather than abstract. The three-day vigil watching tides adds pressure through temporal constraint, and the final placement of the box crystallizes his stance: he will not disappear. One clear tightening occurs (recognition of handwriting), though the stevedore/customs-agent fragments feel like illustrative padding rather than escalating pressure. Cost is visible in the ending image (anchored versus erased) but arrives through patient accumulation rather than a protagonist decision that forecloses a live option under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=4.6)
    The declared stake—"decode the universal riddle"—remains abstract and never tightens into a concrete dilemma with live options. No meaningful reversal or escalation occurs; Elias moves from not-knowing to "understanding" via internal monologue without on-page pressure forcing a trade-off. The piece offers circular intensification (hum grows louder, seashell warms) but no causal turn where agency narrows options or forecloses a path. Cost is gestured at ("every busted myth left behind a ghost of truth") but never lands as a visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving the carnival's spirit against privatization—is signaled early and sustained. The graffiti sequence shows Mira's agency reshaping community tactics, and the storm washing away some murals provides one meaningful pressure point. However, the corporation's arrival the next morning does not test Mira's choices with visible cost; agents see "only a vibrant carnival" without on-page consequence or trade-off that narrows her options. Escalation is coherent but closure cost remains implied rather than legible.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—photograph the bloom before sunrise—is signaled early and maintained throughout. Pressure accumulates as the hourglass grain trembles, then falls, triggering the chemical flare; this is one meaningful tightening. However, the inspector's agency is passive observation rather than a choice with trade-offs. No live option is foreclosed, no competing good or unavoidable harm sharpens the peak moment, and the cost (the bloom wilts) is inevitable rather than a consequence of her decision.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: repair the drone's navigation before dawn deadline. One meaningful tightening: the *Prospect*'s three blasts convert abstract urgency into embodied countdown. The patch decision and test-chamber validation show agency under pressure. Cost is visible (night labor, precision demand) but remains procedural; no live risk of failure dramatized on the page beyond the ticking clock.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—"to find where the rivers begin"—is signaled early and sustained. One tightening occurs when the falcon returns with a feather instead of a message, prompting Kael to reinterpret his maps. The condensation pattern accelerates his decision to leave. Yet Kael's agency at closure is largely receptive: the falcon passes through him, the ice cracks, he steps into water. No visible trade-off or tactical narrowing under pressure is dramatized; coincidence (falcon's dive, ice cracking) enables rather than forces the resolution. Cost clarity is poetic but not tactile, preventing higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—restore balance before collapse—is signaled early and held throughout. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as a tightening when Kael strikes the tuning fork, the seven residents are drawn to the archway, and his counterpoint walk begins to rebuild the town step by step. The cost is legible: another century or two of patient walking, an explicit deferral that narrows Kael's options to endurance. However, no live option is foreclosed on the page; Kael's infinite patience never faces a moment where impatience would solve faster or where waiting costs him something immediate. The rebuilding is invisible to the eye, described rather than dramatized in a choice that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (harness the ephemeral energy source before oxygen runs out) is signaled early and pressure escalates through the ticking clock and the vial's use. The helmet crack provides a meaningful tightening that forces the final trade-off: seal the breach or transmit the data. Agency is clear in Lira's override of survival instinct. The reversal (temple unsnarls → core accessible → helmet fails) narrows options and the cost is legible on the page (death). One slip: the vial resolves a spatial puzzle it barely helped create; its mechanics arrive as solution more than accumulated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.0)
    One dominant stake is signaled early—"thread a labyrinth with his own story"—but it never faces an on-page test or tightening. The timeframe "before they find the bodies" is mentioned twice yet does not force a trade-off or alter his tactics; he simply "spoke faster" without visible consequence. No meaningful reversal or deepening narrows options; the lattice mechanism and the door opening occur without resistance. The ending—door swings shut, he walks away—lacks a felt price or a choice that forecloses a path. Coincidence does not resolve because nothing is resolved; the closure unit in Q2 is inert here as well.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—saving the orchard—is signaled early. No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options; the ghost instructs, Elara obeys, the outcome succeeds without obstacle. The bead placement should be a high-pressure beat but reads as ritual fulfillment rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Cost is declared ("mourning the loss of a love she never knew") but not dramatized as a present forfeiture. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening (the surge of warmth, the luminescence) is visible, but protagonist agency is minimal and the escalation is atmospheric rather than volitional.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—restore the wharf's lost glory—is declared early but remains abstract. No on-page beat shows Elara sacrificing time, material, or social standing to pursue the tapestry; the sleepwalking and sewing are narrated in summary across unspecified nights. The orchid discovery at the end arrives as a gift rather than a turn earned by protagonist agency under the chosen lens. Villagers' doubt is mentioned but never dramatizes opposition or forces a trade-off. One tightening or deepening is absent; pressure remains flat until the summarized resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (restore faith, mend interrupted journey) and pressure accumulates through the search for fragments and the fitting of the wedge, which narrows the path from abstract longing to concrete action. The discovery of the star-map wedge is a meaningful turn that reweights the restoration as guidance from the past. However, the escalation reads primarily as internal affirmation rather than a choice under competing pressures; no live option is foreclosed with visible trade-off. The protagonist's agency is present (she decides to rebuild, wanders, fits the stone) but cost clarity at the tightening moment is muted—no dramatic sacrifice or renunciation on the page, only a quiet accumulation that tips into resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—deliver the encoded letter before the pneumatic tubes seal and the carrier departs—is signaled early and frames the timeframe. Pressure is asserted ("thirty minutes," "time contracted") but never tested; Kael finishes the code "with a flourish" and Mira arrives on cue. No reversal or complication forces a choice that narrows options or imposes visible cost. The client's margin-notes ("coordinates hidden in loops," "date camouflaged as a coffee stain") are described as "a deeper puzzle" yet Kael solves them off-page without struggle. The ending reweights meaning thematically ("the margins would remember") but does not demonstrate a trade-off, loss, or tactic shift under the inferred Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—preventing the coup by sharing the unheard story—is signaled early but remains abstract. Pressure accumulates via metaphor and imagery (the flame's flicker, the tapestry glowing) rather than tactical narrowing or trade-offs. The one meaningful tightening occurs when Mira confirms the coup's timing and decides to act, but the cost of that choice (whom to trust, what she risks) is posed as a question rather than faced on the page. The resolution—stepping into the corridor—reconfigures her stance but does not show a visible price paid or a live option foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: to voice the unsent apology. The piece signals this early and deepens through Mira's instruction ("evoke the moment before deciding") and the protagonist's kneeling beside the shard. One meaningful tightening: the singing spirits urge the reading aloud, and the protagonist complies, splitting the night "like a cracked bell." The cost is legible—silence broken, letters released—but the escalation is textural rather than a sharp reversal. Agency is present (the choice to read), though the spirits and Mira guide rather than resist.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (grafting meaning onto abandonment) signaled early and tightened via decryption beats. One meaningful reversal: smudges reveal "Find me in the quiet places" instead of condemnation, reweighting guilt as reciprocal absence with felt cost (daughter grew beyond reach). Agency is attention and renunciation under anesthetic pressure. No antagonist required; coincidence (anesthetic timing) complicates but does not resolve. Cost legible: he holds the objects but cannot reclaim the years.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—rediscovering lost joy—is signaled early and tightens once: Lyra finds the fresco, feels a pulse of joy, and decides to display the work. No reversal or meaningful opposition intervenes; the display succeeds without complication, and spectators emerge with "eyes wide with wonder" in a frictionless escalation. The cost of her effort (physical toll, vulnerability, risk of failure) is never tested on the page. The accumulative lens allows a single deepening, but the lack of any live obstacle or trade-off limits pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—"exchange certainty for curiosity"—is declared but never tested by a live choice. No reversal narrows options; the mural layers simply unfold in sequence. The visitor's arrival does not escalate pressure, and their laugh enables the next layer without cost to Elena. Coincidence drives the ending (reflected sound "bewitched" paint; visitor's laugh sets next layer aglow) rather than protagonist agency. No visible price or forfeited path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—guarding one's mental autonomy against thought taxation—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens when Aris notices three new suspicious gardeners and his assessment quadruples, then escalates with the auditors' arrival. However, the peak conflict resolves via technological limitation (detectors confused by nature) rather than Aris's agency or sacrifice. The cost is deferred to "tomorrow" rather than paid in scene, and the auditors' exit lacks the friction or trade-off required for high-band escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—forging a blossom armistice—is signaled early but never tightened through on-page reversal or cost. The merfolk's rage "softens" via passive listening without a decision that narrows options. The poet's vow to continue is renewal rather than escalation. No visible trade-off, forfeiture, or price alters tactics; coincidence (the young mermaid's pearl) rewards without struggle. Accumulative designs require at least one meaningful deepening with cost; this piece loops without pressure increase.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.6)
    The stated stake—to preserve forgotten names—never faces a test or trade-off. Lyra discovers the resonance, hums, lights the orchids, and captures the sound in a silver vial without obstacle, cost, or choice that narrows options. The piece asserts that "lighting the orchids also unveiled the emptiness," but this consequence does not alter Lyra's actions or require a stance crystallization. Under an Accumulative lens, escalation would require density increase or pattern break; here the text loops the same lighting action without deepening or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—restore trust before the archive seals—is signaled early and the thirty-seven-hour countdown provides urgency. One meaningful turn occurs: Kess's reply shifts Elara from anxious waiting to hopeful action. However, the resolution arrives by mutual agreement without friction; no option is foreclosed, no visible price paid. The "carefully reckless" gamble succeeds without complication, and the final image ("laughing over manuscripts") tells satisfaction rather than showing a tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—harmonizing conflicting community values—is signaled early. However, the council's doubt ("rippled through the assembly") deflates immediately without testing Alia's resolve through a concrete counter-offer or walkout. The floodgate design is the lone tightening; no visible price (loss of allies, resource scarcity, personal risk) shapes her tactics afterward. Agency reads as presentation rather than sacrifice or hard tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving the echo of lost songs—is signaled early but remains abstract. Pressure accumulates through recurrence (pigeons, dust, meteorite) rather than narrowing options. The final pigeon release and ledger closing offer no visible trade-off or foreclosed alternative; the customer's tune arrives as coincidence, not earned escalation. Agency reads as atmospheric completion rather than choice with cost. One tightening (whispered lyrics, sealed promise) deepens tone but does not alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dominant stake—discovering why thresholds feel sacred—is signaled early but never tested by a choice with visible cost. The protagonist encounters no opposition, makes no trade-offs, and sacrifices nothing; each threshold opens on cue. "Necessary distances" and step-counting gestures recur but do not narrow options or deepen pressure. The resolution is delivered by narrator assertion ("I understand...") rather than earned through agency or renunciation, leaving escalation absent under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding the rhythm of belonging—is signaled early and tightens when Orpheus warns of dwindling oxygen (six hours, then ninety minutes). Iyana's discovery of the bacterial light pattern deepens her understanding and narrows her options to stay or leave. However, the escalation lacks a moment where staying costs her something dramatized before the final choice; she simply decides to remain without visible struggle or trade-off in the moment. The submersible departing empty provides an image of cost, but Iyana's agency in the transformation itself is passive.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—discover why paths disappear—is signaled early. The quest structure provides a single tightening when Lira finds the missing fragments and assembles the glass, but this turn is enabled by planted seeds rather than protagonist choice under pressure. The final "understanding" reconfigures meaning but does not narrow options or exact a visible cost; Lira returns home with "newfound understanding" and an empty satchel, yet no path is foreclosed. Under the Accumulative lens, the assembly deepens the premise, but escalation lacks a moment where Lira must trade one good for another.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Ezra's drive to "serenade monotony with creativity." One meaningful tightening occurs when Officer Chen's patrol threatens the setup, and Ezra's prior seeding pays off. However, every intervention succeeds without friction—the boy finds the quarter, the couple softens, the guard pauses—so escalation reads more as accumulation of wins than narrowing options. The resolution requires no trade-off; Ezra updates his mental model with satisfaction but pays no visible price. Agency is present but lacks genuine jeopardy or cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving memory against the ban—is declared but never tested by an on-page antagonist or choice with trade-offs. Lyra's "elective exile" is a surrender, not a decision that narrows options. The garden releases her without visible cost, and the final dance is asserted rather than shown under pressure. Coincidence (the dust speck catches starlight) initiates the sequence, and no reversal tightens her position or forces a sacrifice. No meaningful escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=3.1)
    The dominant stake—"to illuminate value in the mundane"—is declared but never pressured by opposition, scarcity, or internal conflict. No reversal or tightening occurs: the glazier seeks insight, finds it in the pond's rings, and returns affirmed. The piece offers observation in place of escalation. Coincidence does not resolve because there is no problem to resolve; the glazier's arc is contemplative drift without agency or cost, disqualifying scores above mid-range.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—translating carried pain into teaching—is signaled early but never tested. The piece recounts a past choice (station vs. eastern flank) with high drama, yet the present action is a solitary, pre-decided ritual: walk, arrange stones, release ash, return. No on-page reversal narrows options; coincidence does not complicate. The ending (writing training manuals) is a resolution the text has already committed to, with no visible trade-off or cost that forecloses an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—finding the formula to revitalize dying timelines—is signaled in paragraph seven and sustained through the equinox breakthrough. Pressure accumulates via the gauge's "impossible midpoint" trembling and the gradual pattern revelation, but the escalation is largely observational: Kael arranges shells, the needle stabilizes, and worlds bloom without on-page friction or reversal that narrows her options. The climactic turn (coefficient discovery) feels more like a puzzle solution than a choice with visible cost. Secondary outcomes (orchards, children teaching elders) are summarized rather than dramatized, reducing the felt weight of success.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—to discover what walls dream about—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page reversal narrows Mira's options or forces a trade-off; she finds the diaries, deciphers the film, compiles findings, and shares them in a linear accumulation without friction. The climatologist's suppressed formula could generate pressure (risk of sharing dangerous knowledge, institutional pushback), yet these remain off-page. The ending asserts transformation ("legacy's burden was not to mourn what was lost but to rebuild what was possible") without dramatizing the choice or showing a visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—persuading mirrors to show possibilities—is signaled early and pursued throughout. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens but escalation is thin: the approaching bells tighten time, yet the painter's tactics do not narrow or face trade-offs; she executes her plan without complication. The borrowed heartbeat and lullaby succeed without friction, and the final dissolution imposes no visible cost beyond a return to prior state. One meaningful tightening (the bells' approach) appears, but agency is execution rather than constrained choice.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—achieving a binding peace treaty through ritual—is signaled early and sustained. The generals' skepticism provides mild opposition, and the clipboard-touching moment shifts collective mood. Yet the escalation is atmospheric (a hum, a glow) rather than driven by protagonist agency forcing a trade-off; the negotiator invites, and circumstances (the alignment, the stones) do the persuasive work. No on-page cost is legible when the treaty is signed—no visible sacrifice or path foreclosed in that final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving the extinct bird's echo—is clear and propels Vesper's journey. One meaningful tightening occurs: releasing the egg into the hollow produces the note, narrowing options (the act is irreversible). However, escalation is thin; Vesper faces no on-page opposition or complication that forces a trade-off. The drought's human cost is summarized ("protests drowned by progress") rather than creating friction in the present scene. Cost legibility at closure is conceptual (buried guilt) but not viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake (defy the lullaby of conformity) is signaled early and coheres throughout. However, the escalation lacks a meaningful reversal or tightening that narrows options. Elara practices for months off-page, then executes the unlocking without on-page friction, failure, or adaptation. The "lullaby's pressure" is told ("her heart hammered against the lullaby's pressure") but never dramatized as resistance that forces a trade-off. The sanctuary unlocks "with a sound like shattering crystal," and the city changes—no cost legible in the moment, no failed attempt, no choice between competing goods. The ending declares consequence ("tomorrow she would be hunted") rather than showing it.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Adrian's project to "reverse something fundamental about stories themselves"—is signaled early but remains abstract. One meaningful tightening occurs when the puppet show begins and audience members experience backward narrative; however, escalation is delivered through summary ("the trucker saw," "the dealer saw") rather than dramatized choices under mounting pressure. Agency at closure is minimal: Adrian packs his stick and traces a serif, acts of completion rather than renunciation with visible cost. The reversal method (backward tales strip moral certainty) is conceptually interesting but does not narrow Adrian's options or force a trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories through temporary signals—is signaled early but remains abstract; we never see Esme face a live trade-off that tests her commitment with visible cost. Pressure accumulates through the textural mode (spore release, wing discovery, monarch's arrival) rather than through decisions that narrow options. The seventeenth-morning discovery and final monarch appearance deepen the stakes conceptually, but Esme's agency is more curatorial than decisive—she builds, observes, and interprets without facing a moment where her choice forecloses a path. The cost is implied (her own transiently rooted memory will fade) but not dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—preserve forgotten names—is signaled early and remains coherent. The card-and-rope discovery creates one turn, but it arrives without opposition or cost; she succeeds on first attempt with no tactic shift or visible price paid. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is sufficient, and the names' emergence does reweight her exile, but the lack of protagonist struggle or failed move keeps escalation modest. The final commitment to continue is consistent but not tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (transcend the decaying directive) is signaled early and tightens through dream interpretation, the storm's approach, and the Archive's reframing. One meaningful deepening occurs: the recursion dream shifts her understanding from preservation to release. Agency at closure is renunciation—she leaves the bunker and lets the directive die—but the turn is more told than tested; no on-page choice between competing costs dramatizes the decision. The storm as external pressure and the dream as internal catalyst converge cleanly, yet the final step forward lacks visible friction or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—decode the tile before the new regime purges the old knowledge—is signaled early and maintained. Pressure accumulates through ten nights of calculation, and the temporal window (between governor's exile and general's coronation) provides a live clock. However, the escalation is density-driven rather than choice-driven; Kael encounters no meaningful reversal, complication, or tradeoff that narrows his options or forces agency with visible cost. The tile's activation at dawn on the tenth day unfolds without friction, and the outcome (tile vanishes, knowledge dispersed) is presented as fait accompli rather than a decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (teaching Elara to release resentment) is signaled early but never tested. Mira's pacifism should create a meaningful constraint—she "couldn't force release"—but she encounters no resistance, so the constraint is ornamental. No reversal or tightening occurs; Elara's resentment "loosens" immediately upon receiving the pin and hearing Mira's explanation. The resolution is lecture-driven rather than earned through agency or tactical cost. The final image recycles the opening without reweighting options or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: capture the elusive dream. Pressure coheres through Kael's shift from direct pursuit (grinding mirrors) to receptive synchronization, a meaningful tightening that narrows his method and opens the dream's approach. The dream "drifted closer, no longer a fugitive but a partner" marks the turn. Escalation under the Accumulative lens shows density increase as breath, metal, and orchard converge. Cost is visible in the boundary dissolution—Kael becomes "both mirror maker and dreamer, both rooted and radiant"—though the price reads more as merger than sacrifice, and the dream's willingness to cooperate reduces the sense of hard-won agency.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake: repair the broken contract and mend the relationship with her daughter, signaled early and sustained. The work itself tightens as the mender climbs higher to the oldest tree and the most damaged statue, narrowing her focus. The daughter's arrival is the key reversal, and the ribbon's transformation from childhood symbol to living bandage is a purposeful deepening that reweights the mender's choice. Cost is visible: years of neglect, the physical labor, the risk of continued estrangement. However, the daughter's shift from anger to smile happens too quickly without sustained resistance, and the final summary dilutes the on-page pressure by explaining the resolution rather than letting it stand.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (forbidden knowledge vs. orchard rules) is signaled early and tightens through bathroom retreat, shell-carving, and fruit-biting. The piece deepens rather than reverses: each beat adds understanding rather than narrowing options through loss. Cost is visible—he accepts "terrible beauty" and "disquiet settled into his bones"—but the escalation reads more as puzzle-solving than agency under duress. The forbidden knowledge gravity "pulled at his curiosity" but no live option is foreclosed until the very end; the path from bathroom to tree feels inevitable rather than chosen against competing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—reach the library—is declared early but never tested on the page. The warden negotiation is summarized in two beats without visible cost or narrowed options; Elara proposes terms and the warden nods. The botanist rescue involves no obstacle or tradeoff: the healing incantation works immediately, and the return trip is frictionless. No on-page reversal tightens pressure; the story moves and-then through a sequence of cooperative acts. Coincidence solves (time traveler delivers the exact diary; gaps map to unfinished clauses) rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—finding the garden to rekindle her solace—is signaled early but never tested. Mira proceeds unopposed: the card matches the seam, the door opens, the garden delivers exactly what she sought. No reversal, no escalation, no moment where her agency narrows options or incurs visible cost. The "trapped freedom" irony is asserted in narration rather than dramatized through a choice that forecloses a path. Under a situational lens, pressure should crystallize stance; here it remains diffuse and uncontested.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—to resolve the diplomat's phantom existence and restore missing history—is signaled early and escalates through seventeen generations of records to the physical weaving task that "reconfigure[s] the braids themselves." Pressure tightens when touching the rope reveals it "recorded history not in words but in woven tensions," forcing Elara to work "warmly methodically" with the patience of "defusing a semantic bomb where the wires were stories." The act of weaving narrows options (she must physically merge the thread or leave the paradox unresolved) and the clock gears stutter into "a rhythm that accommodated both truths," demonstrating consequence. Agency is present—Elara's choice to weave rather than document—and the resolution alters the institutional record and erases the student's death, though the personal cost to Elara (aside from tingling fingers and a smile) remains abstract, limiting the felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—find quiet in the storm—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the first bloom fails ("the stone alone was insufficient") and Lira must adapt by harmonizing the cracks. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is undermined by the second bloom, which repeats the first's mechanism (humming, stone alignment, crack response) without additional cost or trade-off. The resolution is Lira's acceptance of the cycle rather than a decisive choice that narrows options. The energy beings pause but remain indifferent, so external pressure does not genuinely test Lira's will. Agency is present but does not foreclose a path with legible price.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—rekindle the beacon to prove pattern over chaos—is clear. Pressure accumulates through retrocognitive visions and the approaching conjunction, but no live choice narrows options; she waits for the alignment and executes a preset sequence. The arrival of three travelers at the end reweights hope but introduces no visible cost to the protagonist; her "thistle blown by hope's improbable breath" is metaphorical rather than a forfeited path. One meaningful tightening (understanding the flaw's origin) occurs, but agency at closure is passive observation rather than renunciation or decision.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—sculpting identity from collective memory—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs: the archivist's realization below in the forecourt that "identity was not sculpted by choosing memories, but by learning to listen between them." However, this tightening does not narrow options or force a trade-off with on-page cost; the preemptive grief "subsides into something quieter" without a visible price or forfeiture that alters later tactics. The monuments' shadows and forecourt chaos provide situational pressure, but the protagonist's agency at closure reads as passive acceptance rather than a decision or renunciation that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—"defy the gravity of hopelessness"—is declared early but remains abstract and untested. The story unfolds as a smooth sequence (arrive, walk, discover mosaic, light fire, leave) with no on-page reversal, tightening, or trade-off. The fire-spin succeeds immediately, watchers gasp offstage, and Cinder walks on unaltered; no live option is foreclosed, and no visible price is paid. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is required at this length; here the mosaic discovery and fire act are adjacent victories without complication or cost escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—acceptance of the brother's departure—is signaled early but never tested by an on-page reversal or complication. Mara moves from silent observation to a "soft current" of shared understanding without a visible tightening that forecloses a live option. The brother's shift from silence to "acceptance" happens off-page between beats. No tactical cost or trade-off narrows her choices; the tide's rise functions as metaphor rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake (collecting silences to ease claustrophobia) is signaled but never tested by a choice that narrows options or imposes visible cost. The gravity inversion grants access without friction; no loss or trade-off alters her tactics. The final assertion that "even a prison could hold a garden" offers thematic summary rather than a turn earned by protagonist agency. Escalation reads as spatial relocation (bunker → trellis → bunker) rather than pressure that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—teaching silence to comfort—is signaled early and sustained. The tightening occurs through the diplomat's physiological descent from "frantic red pulse" to "steady violet" to "deep blue," with Kael's micro-adjustments (resonance panels, rotation) driving the shift. The cost, however, is externalized: Kael gives away her father's vial, a gesture of renunciation, but we don't see her weigh the loss or feel its sting in the moment. The diplomat's breakthrough (weeping, confession, acceptance) arrives without meaningful resistance—his "I don't have time for this" evaporates in a paragraph, reducing the escalation's credibility. One meaningful deepening is present, but the final cost reads more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (ready the throne for its heir) is signaled midway but never meaningfully tightened; the lore keeper faces no false path, temptation to claim the throne herself, or material obstacle that forces a trade-off. The three-hour sunrise countdown is declared but never tracked to create urgency, and her decision to place the ruby rather than sit arrives without prior tension or a visible narrowing of options. Pressure remains static and conceptual rather than escalating through embodied choices with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—teaching the man to breathe again—is declared but never tested by a competing need or visible price. No on-page reversal narrows options; the man arrives desperate, she teaches him, he leaves promising return, all without friction or trade-off. "Breathing is a bridge we build" offers thematic assertion, not a choice that forecloses a path. The sanctuary's "loaded emptiness" shifts to "quiet, shared life" via summary rather than a dramatized escalation, and no cost alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.1)
    One dominant stake is signaled: repay debts by creating diamonds. The bolt-turn at bloom peak provides a single tightening, but escalation is minimal—Kael encounters no on-page obstacle, setback, or competing pressure that forces a trade-off. The owner's potential disapproval is mentioned but never dramatized; the resolution ("could only marvel") neutralizes cost rather than landing it. Agency is present (he turns the bolt) but the act feels unopposed, and the stakes declared (debts, community fund) remain abstract rather than viscerally tested. Coincidence (glitchy texts arrive without Kael's pursuit) complicates setup but does not resolve, meeting one bar, yet the lack of friction caps the band.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the hidden truth to sever lineage threads—is signaled early, but escalation is minimal: he finds the crank, turns it, hears the melody, sees the silhouette, and learns the name in a smooth sequence without reversals or trade-offs. The final realization that his role is to remember rather than end arrives without visible cost (no renunciation of revenge, no stamina loss, no social price paid on the page). Under the Accumulative lens, one tightening or deepening is sufficient, but here the texture simply accumulates decorative motifs rather than narrowing options or forcing a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"capture the shape of possibility"—is signaled early but remains abstract; no concrete trade-off or narrowing of options occurs on the page. The "unsnap" action triggers a cascade of light and a doorway, yet Aldric's hesitation is told ("feeling the pull") rather than dramatized as a choice with visible cost. The marionettes' "murmured allegiance" vow is spoken without friction or sacrifice legible in the moment. One tightening (pulling the final thread) does not foreclose a live path or force a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—magnifying small kindnesses through archival work—is signaled early and drives each beat. Pressure tightens when the button suggests a father's identity, deepens when Private James Dwyer is traced, and culminates when the daughter reveals Marcus died believing he came from nothing. The posthumous timing forecloses reconciliation while still landing emotional cost: the gesture reaches across decades "to touch those who remain." Agency manifests in Marianne's choice to send the letter without promising closure, an act of "tactfully hopeful" restraint that shapes the ending's charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—preserve uncorrupted history—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure escalates through stolen code dissolving, location purged, drone pursuit, but the tightening lacks trade-offs; Mara's resourcefulness solves each problem without visible sacrifice until the swallow-and-scatter beat. The final cost (marked erased) is declared rather than felt, and her reappearance undercuts the stakes. Coincidence (key unlocks a door it was never meant for) resolves the central obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—hushing the prophecy—is signaled early but never dramatized as a choice under pressure. No reversal or tightening occurs; the saxophonist simply plays notes and whispers syllables, the prophecy dissolves, and he leaves. Agency is absent: the ritual unfolds without visible cost, trade-off, or foreclosed option. The prophecy's threat is abstract and never tested; coincidence (the dewdrops forming) enables the resolution without protagonist struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=3.1)
    The dominant stake—decode the prophecy before the hush falls—is declared but never tested by deadline pressure or competing costs. Lira encounters no reversals: moonstone dust appears and immediately grants transformation, the map points her to the First Seed without complication, prodding releases the prophecy without risk. Escalation is absent; each step succeeds on first attempt, and the resolution is a gift from the dust rather than a choice Lira makes under constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—repair the heart-clock mechanism—is signaled early via the pattern-clocks and escalates through discovery and descent. The climactic act (jamming the compass rose) is a protagonist choice under pressure. However, the mechanism's "scream" and subsequent settle occur without visible tradeoff or loss; Elara fears she has "murdered time itself," but the waterfall immediately "found a new channel" without on-page cost to her. The tightening is present but the price remains abstract until the reflective final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—redeeming the boy's absence—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the coin ritual (heating, quenching, zodiac naming) but remains textural rather than escalating through tightening choices. The resolution ("no longer searching") is a stance crystallization, yet the on-page cost is conceptual (accepting unfindability) rather than a visible forfeiture or tactical price that narrows later options.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: retrieve the child's laughter that Kael left behind five years ago. Pressure tightens when the laughter arrives "fractured, a sound made of broken mirrors," forcing Kael to confront their own fragmentation. The reversal—laughter as wound that survived rather than joy to be restored—narrows Kael's options and changes their understanding. However, the climax relies more on conceptual reweighting than a difficult choice with visible trade-off; Kael's acceptance is more realization than renunciation. Cost is legible (giving up the ideal of perfect restoration) but the protagonist's agency in the peak moment is observational rather than decisional.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—discovering the mathematics of mercy—is signaled early but never tested through a choice that narrows options or imposes cost. Elena walks, braces, and recites without facing a reversal or trade-off; her "realization" at the end is an intellectual conclusion, not an earned turn driven by her agency. No escalation or deepening occurs under the Accumulative lens; the UV light and memories recur without building pressure or forecloses a path. The ending offers no visible or felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories—is declared early but doesn't face meaningful on-page opposition or trade-off. The sequence proceeds smoothly: find fragment → see painting → open canvas → read journal → understand purpose. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the fragment "urges," the canvas "swings open," and the journal "waits." The final act of placing the fragment back reads as tribute rather than renunciation with felt cost. Under the accumulative lens, one deepening occurs (translator becomes keeper), but escalation lacks friction or a price that alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.9)
    One dominant stake (Marlon's drive to discover what ceilings hide) is signaled early and tightened when the ghosts point upward, narrowing his focus to the hidden mainsprings. The discovery provides a reversal of understanding (wages frozen in mechanisms) but Marlon's agency is passive observation—he does not face a trade-off or competing pressure. The choice to leave most barrels for authorities is offstage logistics, not a dramatized cost. Under the Accumulative lens, the tightening is present but mild; escalation reads as density increase rather than foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—compressing eternity into a moment—is signaled early and pursued on the page. One meaningful turn: Elara uncorks the whisper, risking its one-time use. However, escalation lacks protagonist friction; the library's destabilization unfolds as consequence rather than through active opposition or trade-offs that Elara navigates. Cost is visible (whisper emptied, library shattered) but arrives as spectacle rather than a choice that forecloses competing options. Agency at closure is observational—she watches, stands, waits—rather than decisional.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—revealing truth about the empire—is declared but never tested by a live opposition that forces trade-offs. Kael waits for the storm, presses the shard, and the poem appears; Voss sees it and nods. No reversal narrows options, no tactic shifts under resistance. The final moment reads as symbolic validation rather than earned escalation with on-page cost. Agency is limited to waiting and ritual gesture, not decision under conflicting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake is clear: restore the melody before midnight or "dawn will never come." The ticking clock (eleven chimes) provides genuine temporal pressure. One meaningful tightening occurs when the repairman's own doubt creates a "false note" and rust blooms, forcing him to speak "true names" to clear the air. However, the resolution feels procedural—once he speaks truth, the chip glows, the music plays, the covenant breaks. No visible tradeoff between competing goods; the protagonist's action is more ritual than renunciation. Cost is conceptual (covenant broken) but not felt as a trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: Mira seeks "the place where explanations fail," signaled early. The lagoon discovery provides one meaningful deepening when the water "remembers" and Mira understands the expedition's choice. However, escalation is gentle: no live option is foreclosed with visible friction. Mira's final decision (become keeper, not follower) feels preordained by her "sensibly eccentric" nature rather than forced by competing pressures. The cost is conceptual (empty vials, abandoned tools) but not felt as loss or renunciation on the page—she walks away "her purpose finally aligned," which reads as satisfaction rather than sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: find and understand the archway before the next storm erases it. The GPS failure tightens options (must rely on memory/instinct), and the lantern-slide revelation deepens stakes by reframing the work from personal quest to ancestral duty. The token-placement is protagonist agency that forecloses the path of remaining outside the alliance—she commits by marking the threshold. Cost is visible: she accepts being "a keeper of the threshold" rather than an autonomous artist, and she stays as the storm arrives. One meaningful tightening under Accumulative lens is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake: understanding why flowers bloom at night. The journey to the cathedral is a tightening, and the glass revelation offers new knowledge. However, escalation is passive—Sable travels, observes, and receives the answer without a live trade-off or decision that narrows options. The "reckoning" is conceptual only; no on-page price (time, resource, relationship) alters her tactics or forecloses a path. One meaningful deepening is present but agency at closure is observational, not decisional.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—decode the diary and release suppressed testimony—is signaled early and pursued across beats. Elara's retro-cognitive suffering accumulates pressure, and the parley introduces external opposition. However, the escalation is summary-driven: "truth in tension" is declared but the friction between disclosure and fragile peace is resolved off-page when the Under-Minister "agreed." The final revelation (weapons drowned, bodies burned) shifts the historical record, but the cost to Elara—her sleep restored, the reverie quieted—reads as relief rather than a trade-off that forecloses a path. The story gestures toward a meaningful tightening but does not dramatize a visible price at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—"reimagine an entire civilization"—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page obstacle tests Kael's blueprint; he paces, conceives, sketches, places the bottle, whispers an incantation, and settlers arrive. The bottle's sealed nature is framed as a reminder rather than a problem requiring a turn. The story offers summary of conceptual transformation ("not revived, but reborn") without a reversal, tightening, or trade-off that narrows options. Agency is entirely internal and unchallenged, so escalation under the Accumulative lens depends on density or cadence shift—neither materializes in a peak beat. No visible price is paid; the epilogue grants success without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias's realization that his spoken prophecy maps the city's emotional currents—is signaled midway and deepens his role as archivist. One meaningful turn occurs when he discovers the prophecy's true nature ("not a warning of doom but a map"), yet no visible cost or narrowed option results. The resolution (sealing the vault) feels contemplative rather than a choice that forecloses alternatives under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—reopen the vortex before starlight fades—is signaled early, but pressure never tightens because no on-page obstacle resists Elara's progress. She scatters seeds, scoops starlight, steps into the vortex, and returns; each move succeeds without setback, adaptation, or visible cost. The "choice" between thaw and collapse is narrated as a vision rather than a live dilemma forcing a trade-off. The resolution is delivered by the hatchling's presence and the vortex's automatic compliance, not by Elara's agency or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake (sound the alarm or trust the data) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the instruments show a pressure stall, forcing Elara to choose between protocol and observation. Yet the escalation is muted: the rope's readiness by the final scene ("she tested it gently. It held.") removes the initial constraint without narrative cost, and the storm's retreat happens off-page, leaving the choice consequence hypothetical. Agency is present (she decides not to act), but the cost is conceptual rather than visceral—no villager reaction, no professional repercussion, no embodied price paid within the text.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.2)
    No dominant stake is signaled early or tested with genuine resistance. Sola's loneliness and spiritual questioning are declared but never escalate through a reversal or tightening that narrows options. The meteor shower and her whispered empathy proceed without cost or complication. Agency is passive observation followed by summary vow ("decided to preserve," "vowed to tend") rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Escalation is absent; the piece accumulates atmosphere without pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving unspoken words—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal or tightening narrows Elara's options; she discovers the box, reads intent, places the note inside, and watches the ghost fade in a linear sequence with no visible trade-off. The ghost's "quiet plea" is received without friction. Agency is observation and declaration rather than renunciation or a choice that forecloses a live path.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding Harrison's fractured message about borrowed time—is signaled early but never tightened through a live obstacle or trade-off. The garage-sale embedding method appears mid-story without prior setup and resolves when a reply arrives three weeks later (coincidence, not protagonist agency). The meeting with the figure delivers backstory exposition rather than a choice that narrows options. No on-page cost is visible: Elara "stops embedding messages" because "the mystery had been anticipated," not because continuing carries a price or forecloses another path.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=3.5)
    The stated stake—"to discover beauty in the incomplete"—never faces on-page opposition or cost. No reversal, tightening, or deepening narrows options; the poet's reflections accumulate but do not escalate. The kite string snap could serve as a complication but instead becomes another contemplative prompt. Agency is absent: the poet observes, imagines, realizes, but never chooses under competing pressures. Resolution is delivered by assertion ("he walked on... always seeking beauty") rather than earned through a decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: complete the copper network before death to achieve translation/legacy. The stake is signaled early and pressure accumulates through the shrinking timeline and Elias's weakening body. One meaningful tightening occurs when he reads the marginalia and understands he can be "translated" if he finishes, raising the stakes from restoration to self-preservation-through-transformation. However, the escalation is largely summary: "worked through fever," "hands grew weaker," "his final month" compress weeks without on-page reversals or forced trade-offs. The strangler vines in the final quadrant offer a tactical choice (weave through rather than cut), but it resolves in a single beat without cost. Agency is present but never tested by failure or sacrifice that alters his approach.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding why the aliens returned—is signaled early and shapes the journey. The single on-page tightening occurs when the chemical readings confirm her hypothesis, a deepening rather than a reversal that narrows options. No visible cost accompanies the discovery: the protagonist neither loses a tool, burns a bridge, nor risks capture. The decision to publish is announced without dramatized consequence or trade-off, leaving the escalation intellectually satisfying but emotionally inert.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming the battlefield—is signaled early and pursued consistently. The gull's guidance provides one meaningful turn (leading him to hidden moisture), narrowing options and enabling the final planting. Yet the weeks-long sprouting summary flattens what should be the climactic test; we see no resistance, setback, or visible price paid after the planting. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through a protagonist choice that forecloses a path with on-page cost. Escalation under the causal lens is present but minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (reconnection with Maya) signals early and tightens when the monogram reveals her identity, narrowing Wick's goal from abstract connection to specific recovery. The riddle's answer—presence bridges distance—requires Wick's agency (the journey, placing the leaf) and forecloses his scavenger life with visible cost. The vault discovery reverses his isolation into intimate proximity via recorded voice. Pressure accumulates through scent memory, water scarcity, and the three-day crossing, cohering under the Accumulative lens. One strong tightening and a clear trade-off (settlement safety vs. archive discovery) earn high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—escape versus remaining—is present but never tightens into a live trade-off with visible cost. The "glimpse" of the new light offers a conceptual pivot, yet no on-page reversal forces the protagonist to weigh competing goods or pay a price. The final decision to drift away feels preordained rather than wrung from contradictory pressures. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is sufficient, but the escalation here is atmospheric rather than a causal narrowing of options or a felt forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—"amend the spire's failing heart before the sky tore itself apart"—is declared early but never tightened by a reversal or visible cost. Kaelen moves through the labyrinth, chessboard puzzle, and heart-mending without encountering meaningful resistance or a trade-off that forecloses an option. The "unknown" is framed as inviting rather than threatening, so no agency-driven escalation occurs. The final image asserts resolution without showing a price paid or path closed.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake: unbind the prisoner by walking a pattern. The task is presented early, executed without complication, and succeeds immediately when the panel opens. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; Kael faces no friction or cost during the walk itself. The conceptual cost—staying behind—arrives only in summary after the mission succeeds, and the prisoner's emergence adds no new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—"to understand the shape of home"—is signaled early and recurs. A single tightening occurs when Mira "hesitated, the feather trembling between her fingers," aware that seeding the language would "shatter the delicate balance," but the escalation is told rather than dramatized through a visible trade-off or narrowing of options. The stone's dissolution and the feather's inscription happen *after* her decision to press the feather, not as a consequence that alters tactics mid-beat. The "hidden thunder" reframes benignly at the end, removing rather than intensifying cost. No persistent constraint shapes the peak choice; coincidence (the alcove "existed only in the substituted night") enables discovery rather than protagonist agency driving escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—break the village's stasis and achieve self-forgiveness—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the tutor realizes the verse ("When the king's sacrifice is accepted") and resumes with renewed purpose. Yet the escalation is internal and told rather than shown through a forced trade-off. The key's discovery and the village's release arrive without visible cost or narrowed options. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (refracting singular ritual truth into many) is signaled early and shapes Kael's acts. One meaningful pressure point occurs when he hurls pigment, interrupting the procession. Yet the Elders' reversal ("for the first time in decades, they saw the ritual not as duty but as choice") is summary rather than dramatized friction; coincidence (spectral display) shifts the community without Kael facing a trade-off or visible cost in that beat. The escalation under the Accumulative lens is present but the price at closure remains abstract, preventing entry into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—conjuring meaning before the atmosphere fails—is clear and the time pressure (three breaths left, maybe four) tightens once. Elara's agency drives escalation: she chooses each pockmark alignment under worsening conditions (wave damage, mercury spill, exchanger failure). The final choice to inhale corrosive air forecloses the path of retreat with visible cost (lungs burning). However, the escalation reads more as environmental countdown than protagonist-driven reversals; the statue's completion and workshop's stabilization feel like rewards for persistence rather than consequences of a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—fulfilling the hidden promise to paint the seashell—is signaled early but never faces meaningful opposition or cost. Elias walks to the caves, enters, takes a wrong turn, paints, and leaves; no tightening, no trade-off, no tactical shift under pressure. The "temporary eternity" and "intimately aloof" mood operate as atmosphere rather than escalating conflict. The resolution delivers symbolic satisfaction (promise kept, weight lifted) without a single on-page reversal or choice that forecloses an option; coincidence (the wrong turn) solves rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—proving whispers travel farther than shouts—is signaled early and tested when Elara uses the cork and lens to transmit scent-memory instead of words. The escalation is textural: months of silent endurance accumulate into one decisive act that stops Marcus mid-shout and brings him upstairs. The cost is legible: Elara stakes her last morning on this proof, and Marcus's trembling fingers and cracked voice show his defensive shouting has finally cracked open. The piece lacks a second pressure point or complication; once Elara acts, Marcus's transformation arrives without friction or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—bring his sister's voice back across the void before the full moon—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the midnight calls, the waxing moon making the censer foot heavier, and the countdown to "Now." The final activation is a meaningful tightening that narrows options (the window closes as the moon wanes). However, the resolution feels unopposed: no setback, no trade-off dramatized on the page. The cost is implied ("fragile peace," the phone now silent) but not viscerally felt as a forfeiture or endurance with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—whether to reveal or occlude the truth-telling relic—is signaled early and braided with the goal of psychological safety. However, the core turn (uncovering the eye at dawn) happens abruptly without visible prior deliberation or cost: "I uncovered the eye and let its gaze sweep across the gathered survivors" reads as a single-beat decision rather than a pressure-driven escalation. The aftermath ("truth did not destroy; instead, it peeled away the armor of fear") resolves the conflict almost immediately, and the subsequent binding method arrives as a convenient fix rather than a trade-off that forecloses another path. One meaningful tightening is present but the escalation lacks felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—decoding the stranger's final gesture—is signaled early and tightens once when Cornelius shifts from interpreting the wave to understanding it as a gift and question. However, the escalation is primarily cognitive (he "realized," "understood") rather than a choice that forecloses options; no live option is sacrificed, and the arrival of the confirmatory letter the next morning feels like external validation rather than a hard-won turn driven by Cornelius's agency. The cost—his isolation now "witnessed" and charged—is legible but oblique, more reconfiguration of meaning than visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—honoring Clara's riddle and finding the door—is signaled early and sustained. The rising creek imposes a time constraint, and the matrix chip's glow functions as a live pressure point. However, escalation is atmospheric rather than choice-driven: Merrick follows ants, squeezes through a passage, and steps forward without a visible tradeoff or foreclosed alternative. The "life he'd chosen" versus "life he'd refused" moment offers internal deepening but lacks an on-page action that narrows options with felt cost. Under Accumulative lens, one meaningful tightening suffices, and the creek's rise provides that, but protagonist agency in altering tactics is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—unraveling recurring dreams—is signaled early and tightens once when the queen learns acceptance requires surrendering her throne. However, the escalation is passive: the mountain's voice delivers the revelation rather than the queen forcing a choice under competing costs. The price (memories, identity, throne) is stated but not dramatically tested; she "thought of the court below" and releases them in a single reflective beat without visible friction or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake ("capture the density of presence") is declared but never tested by a competing cost or narrowed option. No reversal or tightening occurs; the alchemist mixes pigments, the curl glows, and both characters affirm the same abstract goal without friction. Kael's arrival and the ritual unfold without opposition, mistake, or visible price—no live choice forecloses a path. The piece lacks escalation under any lens: no causal linkage narrows options, no accumulative deepening reweights the stake, no situational pressure forces stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—distilling chaos into narrative amid chronological collapse—is signaled early and persists. Pressure accumulates through "feral nostalgia" that "growls louder," showing memories that "bite back," but the tightening is textural rather than a choice-narrowing turn. The chronicler's flight and descent are presented as inevitabilities rather than forced decisions with visible trade-offs. Cost is asserted ("the jealousy drained away") but not dramatized as a forfeited path or tactical shift. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is present, but agency remains diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (Elena's trust in senses after loss) is signaled early and tightens when Marcus shows her the clock can mark moments rather than measure time, forcing her from control to acceptance. The screw's history of "holding then releasing" functions as the key pressure point that reweights her grief tactics. However, no on-page choice carries visible opportunity cost—she doesn't sacrifice a restoration attempt or reject an alternative—so the escalation reads as deepening insight rather than a trade-off with legible price.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (transforming scars into stories) is signaled early and pressure accumulates through Kaelin's anxiety, the ink crystallizing, and the storm held at bay. One meaningful deepening occurs when the tear mingles with ink, but the tightening lacks a live choice that narrows options—Kaelin completes the ritual without visible trade-off or forfeited path. Under the Accumulative lens, the cadence shift at closure reweights the stake, but agency reads as endurance rather than decision, and cost remains conceptual rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reconnection via apology—is signaled early and maintained. Pressure accumulates through the device setup, scent release, and Mira's confession, culminating in Linden's acceptance. The cost is visible: "imperfect miracle" and "even as it scarred" acknowledge that reconciliation is partial, not redemptive. One meaningful deepening occurs when Linden reframes her column as "a mirror, not a window," forcing Mira to confront complicity. However, the escalation lacks a genuine reversal or moment when success seems foreclosed; each beat advances smoothly toward resolution without a live threat that narrows options under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—unify scattered truths before the hiccup ends—is declared early but never tightened through a live trade-off or complication that narrows options. The spiral arbitration "turns through the stacks" and delivers one line of dialogue, yet this does not force a new choice or escalate cost. The witness's journey reaches its "apex" and she presses the dictionary to her chest, but this fulfills her goal without visible sacrifice; no option is foreclosed, no price paid on the page. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding what clocks measure—is signaled early but never tested by a concrete choice or reversal. Elias performs a ritual (turn key, count backwards, receive insight) without opposition, cost, or narrowed options. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the hydraulic clock's behavior and Elias's actions proceed in a single line. Agency is observation, not decision; the ending claims understanding without visible trade-off or foreclosed alternative. Band guardrails for 8.0+ (tightening that forecloses an option) are unmet.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake: reconciling randomness (father's life) with certainty (her equations), signaled early. The subway traversal tightens understanding incrementally. The hidden chamber discovery offers a deepening, but Lila's agency remains observational—she decodes, overlays, discovers—without a pivot that narrows options or forces a trade-off with visible cost. The final promise is a stance crystallization (Charged Poise potential), yet no live option is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake (breaking the loop to escape eternal repetition) signals by paragraph 12. One meaningful tightening occurs when the loop "trembled" after the disc note, then Mira snaps it free. Yet escalation reads thin: the phone rings "the same voice, the same plea" across nights without compounding tactical constraint or visible cost until the climax. The disc-snapping choice arrives without prior friction—Mira decides, acts, succeeds—no trade-off or sacrifice dramatized on the page. Coincidence (new caller's voice changes the loop) complicates without clear protagonist agency driving that shift.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake: regenerating the lost covenant and preserving small moments. The archivist's climb to the jetty and act of writing provide one meaningful deepening, and the villagers' response adds accumulative pressure. However, escalation lacks protagonist agency—discovery of the locket leads smoothly to ritual without a reversal or trade-off that narrows options. The bouquet offering sparks communal healing, but this feels coincidental rather than driven by a choice with visible cost. Under the Accumulative lens the cadence shift is present but the price remains atmospheric rather than legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—curing loneliness—is signaled early but never tested by a live choice with alternatives. Mira's plan unfolds as summary declaration: "she hatched," "she began," "she chose," "she asked." The confessions scene ("One by one, they whispered") reports a collective act without showing a single resident's hesitation, resistance, or cost. No escalation tightens options; no reversal or deepening forces Mira to trade one path for another.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—finding the stillpoint before the constellations shift—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through sensory deepening (ultrasonic chorus, dissonant chords, sudden silence) but lacks a clear moment when Elara's options narrow or a live path is foreclosed. The "sudden silence" introduces the stillpoint, yet no prior tactic fails or forces a trade-off; she simply arrives and absorbs. The compass ring's twitching and eventual stillness imply escalation, but the cost (recognizing her mother's unspoken grief) is told rather than dramatized as a visible loss or choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—editing history to correct errors—is signaled early and pursued across multiple beats (antenna misalignment, calibration error, hydroponic seeds). However, escalation remains lateral: each edit is a parallel correction rather than a tightening that narrows options or raises cost. The pen's reservoir running dry introduces scarcity, but Kael's forced choices ("which moments to preserve and which to let fade") are told rather than dramatized with visible trade-offs. The ending restores comfort without foreclosing a path, and agency is more observational (watching reflection soften) than decisional at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is Elias's tether to forgetting versus the possibility of self-recognition. The advisor's intervention tightens pressure by reframing silence as "the only language the forgotten truly own," forcing Elias to choose between empty rehearsal and active translation. One meaningful deepening occurs when he lowers the camera and begins signing back, a micro-choice with visible cost (confronting thirty-seven years of disuse). The story delivers one turn under the accumulative lens—silence shifts from void to score—but the advisor's role as catalyst rather than antagonist keeps the escalation moderate. Agency is present in Elias's final acceptance, though the price (remaining forgotten) feels more accepted than fought.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is rescuing the forgotten promise, signaled early via Cress's dying words. The tightening occurs when the faded tapestry reveals Kael's own propaganda image, forcing a reckoning with complicity—but this reversal is processed in a single paragraph of summary rather than a scene that dramatizes choice. The weeks of mural-painting compress into montage ("Each artistic creation revealed another layer"), and the vault discovery is a reward rather than a hard-won tradeoff. Cost is implied (staying forever) but not tested on the page against a competing want.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—merging Mira's consciousness fully rather than enduring fragments—is signaled early and tightens when the AI sends the drone, imposing a time limit. Kael's drumming is goal-directed agency, and the final composition forecloses individual survival with visible cost (body dissolving into sound). The piece delivers one meaningful deepening: the shift from preserving memory to becoming the garden itself. The drone complication feels late and external, but the escalation under the Accumulative lens (from random drumming to surgical encoding) is coherent and the cost at closure is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—proving whispers travel farther than shouts to keep the northern corridor—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation is minimal: Marek executes a pre-calculated plan without adaptation or setback, and the reversal (catching the smuggler's crew) happens off-stage through the watchman's alarm. No visible price is paid; the protagonist gains everything (corridor, coin, enhanced reputation) without forfeiting a live option or facing a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—teaching the child to find hope through stars—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation is atmospheric rather than causal: the guardian adjusts shutters and reflects starlight in repeated gestures without a pivot that narrows options or raises cost. The child's question at line 28 ("Why do the stars hide during the day?") offers a potential turn, but the guardian's silent answer and subsequent shutter move feel like another iteration rather than a tightening that forecloses an earlier path. The smile and the promise are declared outcomes without on-page struggle or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—sparking critical thought against the curfew—is signaled early but never tested by on-page opposition. No authority challenges the displays, no student resists or misunderstands, and no complication arises from the synchronized puzzles; the city simply "paused" in passive curiosity. The "hush deepened" is atmospheric assertion rather than escalation through narrowed options or raised cost. The ending claims victory ("the true victory was...the moment a student paused") without showing a single student making a costly choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: Mira seeks freedom to dance, escape dock labor. The whale's call and guardian encounter provide one tightening moment ("combative tenderness that surprised them both"), but the guardian dissolves without resistance, eliminating conflict rather than escalating it. The island "began its retreat" is a atmospheric move, not a pressure point Mira must navigate. Agency at closure reads as acceptance rather than decision with trade-off; no live option is foreclosed with visible cost. Under the hybrid lens, one meaningful deepening is present (scrimshaw unlocks guardian) but escalation is gentle and cost remains implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—"cultivate lightness in grief"—is signaled early but remains abstract across the arc. The performer's nightly whittling and narration are repeated without escalation or a tightening choice that narrows options. The dog episode could have introduced a moral pressure point (report vs. mercy), but the decision to report is declared in summary without dramatized friction or visible cost. No meaningful reversal or deepening occurs; the final placement of the figurine on the windowsill does not foreclose a live option or impose a felt trade-off under the inferred Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dominant stake—"to stride through boundaries once thought sacred"—is signaled early but never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; the poet walks, touches, whispers, and walks on in a series of aestheticized gestures without escalation. The "ban lifts" setup promises constraint but the ban's nature and its lifting are never dramatized, so no agency or cost materializes. Coincidence does not resolve because nothing is at risk; the piece presents a mood walk rather than a conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—Elara seeking "a perfect note of sound" to complete her plant-communication system—is told, not tested. No negotiation, refusal, or complication appears; Dorian "hesitated, then nodded" without dramatized internal conflict or cost. The barter resolves in one beat with no reversal or deepening, and the "mutual awakening" is asserted rather than earned through agency or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—discovering "the texture of connection"—is signaled early and pursued through Kaelen's experimental adjustments. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara challenges her ("99.7% accuracy") and Kaelen responds by deliberately introducing flaw, which transforms the prism-song. However, the reversal feels more conceptual than causal; Mara's skepticism doesn't materially narrow Kaelen's options or raise cost, and the "corrupted data" consequence is anticipated rather than felt. The piece deepens understanding but lacks a visible price that alters tactics or forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—"to teach a withering star...how to bloom"—is signaled midway but never tested by on-page opposition or a choice that forecloses a path. Mnemosyne "responded" passively; no reversal or tightening narrows Elara's options. The woman's arrival offers no complication, only confirmation. Escalation under the Accumulative lens requires density increase or pattern break with cost; here, the prose accumulates metaphor without a meaningful shift in pressure or a visible price paid that alters later tactics. Agency is observational rather than decisional.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—reverse engineering cultural collapse to map what comes next—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the consultation ritual: measuring, dealing cards, interpreting the spread. However, escalation remains methodical rather than tightening; Mara's expertise faces no genuine obstacle, and the architect's presence doesn't force a costly choice. The "seven towers crumbling" revelation deepens understanding but doesn't narrow Mara's options or extract a visible price. Under the accumulative lens, one meaningful pattern break occurs (roots emerging in negative space), but the final image ("future as web") reconfigures understanding without demonstrable cost to Mara on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—purifying corrupted memories—is signaled early but never tightens or forces a trade-off. Lyra's method ("avoid patterns," "breathe irregularly") is asserted rather than tested: no moment where a pattern tempts her, no cost paid for irregular thought, no tactical adjustment when the pagoda responds. The withdrawal from the pagoda is described as reluctant but no live option is foreclosed—she achieved her goal and will continue. Escalation is declarative ("the thrill of healing, the pain of reliving") without on-page pressure that narrows choices.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: preserve the library's "shape of hope" from the unbound shadow. Escalation under Accumulative lens: shadow grows bolder across decades of footage, feeds on hope, dims the luminous aura; protagonist realizes stone is catalyst; places stone in shadow's path on-screen. One meaningful tightening: her realization that the stone "could bind the shadow, if used with the right intent" narrows options to a single high-cost act. The cost is legible on-page: stone absorbed, pocket emptied, "luminous regret" as the trade-off. Agency is present (decision to place stone, acceptance of loss). The shadow's transformation from threat to guardian reweights the outcome with bittersweet consequences, though the mechanics of that transformation feel slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (Elara's self-respect versus compassion for the animals) is signaled early and escalates through her choices: burning lies, tending Veridian's injury, drafting honest mission language, and calling the officer. The tightening occurs when she decides to face public shame while requesting custody—a trade-off with visible cost (legal exposure, reputation loss). Agency is decision and renunciation (she forecloses the option of hiding or fleeing), and the cost is legible on the page when she hears the car and steadies herself to tell "the whole truth."

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—learning to read stories in scars—is signaled early but never tested by meaningful opposition or cost. Elara descends the tunnel without risk, retrieves the glowing pebble without sacrifice, and gains understanding without forfeiture. No on-page reversal narrows her options; the fern's "whispered warnings" evaporate without consequence. Closure delivers insight as gift rather than through renunciation or visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—find where unused love is stored—is signaled early but pressure remains static through the incubation vigil. The "map" arrival is granted rather than earned through escalating attempts or trade-offs. No meaningful reversal or tightening occurs; Mira's agency is passive reception. Cost is declared ("carried Rialto's stored love") but not dramatized as a foreclosed alternative or burden that alters tactics. Under the Accumulative lens one deepening is sufficient, but the density does not perceptibly increase until the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is declared but never tested by a meaningful tightening or reversal. The journey introduces no complication; the archway grants passive access. The protagonist traces a falling star, rests, and wakes "cured" without a choice that forecloses a path or visible price paid. Coincidence (finding the archway, the star's appearance, the dawn timing) resolves the problem the protagonist did not help create. No escalation occurs under any lens; the piece presents a wish-fulfillment arc without agency or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: shepherd memory through a forgetting land and prevent null-zones from erasing possibility. The discovery of the null-zone and the "sparks" dying introduces one meaningful tightening that narrows options, and the guard's response—planting the archive in an unlit corner—constitutes agency. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is largely declarative ("something was wrong," "cancer of nothing eating possibility") rather than dramatized through tactical choices that fail or cost something concrete. The resolution (archive planted, guard dissolved) reads as inevitable from the outset rather than earned by a visible trade-off or renunciation with legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"to rediscover the wild frontier of her mind"—is signaled but never tested with on-page pressure. No reversal or tightening narrows options; each translocation simply offers a new contemplative space without escalating cost. The philosopher's agency is passive observation rather than decision under duress. The ending claims she "became the forest's architect," but this is assertion without a prior choice that foreclosed an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake (finding the dog) is signaled early but never tightened. Lin decides to traverse the ridgeway, rides the ferry, walks more ridgeway, and arrives at the cove where the dog sits unharmed—no reversal, no foreclosed option, no price paid. The ferry guides' permission and the ticket punch are procedural, not pressure. Coincidence resolves the central problem without agency or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (understand the cost of safety, earn partial redemption through vigilance) is signaled early and coheres throughout. The rust-stain discovery meaningfully tightens options: report and remain in the fold with loss of choir status, or stay silent and declare nothing changed. Agency is clear—Elara descends, forms signs, accepts the tool work—and the price (ongoing penance, permanent exclusion from choir) is legible on the page. One tightening is sufficient for this length under Accumulative lens; entering 8.5+ would require the foreclosed path to carry sharper relational or bodily consequence in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—unmask the pretender—is signaled early and sustained, but escalation is minimal: Sylvar's plan proceeds without reversal, and Vael's discovery of the riddle does not complicate matters or force a trade-off. The rune's activation feels automatic rather than a choice under pressure, and the visible cost is absent—Sylvar's vigil continues, the throne awaits, no path is foreclosed. One tightening (the glamour unraveling) occurs, but agency and price remain off the page.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake (why some paths disappear) is signaled early but remains abstract. The "discovery" that old models collapsed is reflection, not an on-page decision that narrows options. Tightening occurs conceptually (the atlas page becomes an anchor, the rhythm shifts) but no live choice forces a trade-off or forecloses a tactical path with visible cost. Pressure accumulates texturally via repetition (tapping, tide, bleaching) but does not escalate protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—discovering meaning in the wreckage—is signaled early and tightens through accumulative pressure: beacon pulse matches stone hum, Kai sings, systems awaken. One meaningful deepening occurs when her solitary voice becomes amplified tide, reweighting the lull into breakable silence. Agency is present (she chooses to sing), and cost is legible (the effect is temporary, "fade by morning"). The escalation operates under Accumulative lens—density and syncopation build to the broadcast moment—though the stone circle's mechanics arrive without prior struggle or failed attempts.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake (unsealing the amber to test her interpretation of destiny) is signaled early and drives the unsealing act. One meaningful tightening: Mara's choice to act despite elder prohibition narrows options, though the grandson's instant complicity reduces friction. The revealed seed (not embryo) reweights the premise, but coincidence props up the kite's arrival and the bamboo's perfect translation. Cost is conceptual (tradition rewritten) yet no on-page antagonist tests Mara's resolve; "some called her traitor" is summarized, not dramatized. The final act of planting seeds shifts from waiting to cultivation, yet the ease of communal acceptance ("the people had begun to understand") undercuts the price of insurgency.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: can Elias integrate trauma without erasure? Pressure accumulates through repeated somatic contacts, each reweighting his relationship to the photograph. The eucalyptus beat narrows options—he chooses to hold both shadow and smile, foreclosing the path of avoidance. Agency is renunciation (he stops constant touching) with visible cost (acceptance that the drone's shadow is permanent chemistry). The tightening is meaningful: from chaotic grief (daily handling worn the photo to velvet) to deliberate ritual (returning tomorrow to sketch roots). No antagonist required; the situational pressure (trauma, cliff, trees) coheres. The final decision—becoming the keeper of his own light—crystallizes his stance with undeniable cost (full feeling, no retreat).

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (restore creative vision vs. dissolution) is signaled early. The threads introduce a reversal: not just finding rumor-truth but being forced to redesign fate. Elara's choice to untangle rather than flee tightens options, and the weaving act is protagonist-driven under the Accumulative lens. The final cost—ache remains luminescent, now understood as "only honest light"—is legible. However, the price of untangling (what she risks by choosing one timeline, whether she loses access to other lives) is conceptually asserted more than dramatized; the walls retreat without on-page forfeit of a live alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake (understanding temporal distortion) is signaled early and Kael's experimental method (ink on drone, then on stone) shows escalating attempts. The drone's disappearance provides one pressure point. However, the escalation is lateral repetition (spilling ink again) rather than a meaningful tightening or deepening that narrows options; Kael ends in the same position he began, waiting for another crisis. No visible cost is paid on the page—no resource spent, no option foreclosed, no tradeoff made. The mentor's death is told in summary without on-page consequence that alters present tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether to suppress or release contraband truth—is signaled early and escalates through Elara's trembling hands, her work connecting the tubes, and the irreversible act of sending the letter. The tightening is causal: discovery narrows her options to "resealing and report" or "ignition," and her choice forecloses safety with on-page consequence (screams, denials, resignations). The moment "within the blink that follows surprise" compresses decision and consequence effectively. One friction: Elara's agency is not genuinely tested by external obstacles or internal competing goods; the Council collapses off-stage without resistance that might have forced a tactical pivot or visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—maintaining peace and continuity inside the dome against external chaos—is signaled early but never truly pressured. The stranger's arrival offers a complication but resolves passively (he leaves a thank-you note); the dust storm is weathered without tactical cost. No beat forces Lyra to choose between competing goods or pay a visible price that alters later options. The story accumulates atmosphere but lacks escalation under the Accumulative lens: no pattern break, no cadence shift that reweights the stake with felt cost. Agency is observation and ritual rather than decision with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—to catch Echo's trace—is signaled early and sustained. Avery's decision to voice silence and drive the spike creates one meaningful turn when Echo rises and asks what she will do with the weight. Her answer (release rather than possess) narrows options and forecloses the path of keeping/possessing with felt cost. However, the middle beats recycle the same poetic gestures (transliterate, zigzag, voice silence) without escalating pressure or introducing a credible obstacle that tests her resolve before the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clearly signaled: whether to suppress or publish the investigation, with Victoria's inherited complicity at center. The tightening occurs when she moves from cataloging discrepancies to drafting the counter-memo, narrowing options from continued orbit to decisive intervention. The proof-by-contradiction logic ("assume the board is right") provides a visible method that forecloses the suppression path. Cost is legible: she carves her name so deeply it leaves indentations, a physical metaphor for irrevocable choice that will burn away her father's legacy and likely her own position.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—unmake the tethers—is signaled early. The corrective steps (amber, transcription, handwritten pages) provide a sequential tightening, yet each move follows external instruction rather than Elara's strategic adaptation under resistance. The firmware's screeching and ghostly projections supply atmospheric pressure but do not force a meaningful trade-off; Elara proceeds without visible friction or cost that forecloses an alternative path. The infants' resolution ("no longer needing translation") offers a felt outcome, but the protagonist's agency in achieving it reads procedural, not volitional, lowering escalation impact under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—"discover meaning in the mess of whispers"—is declared early but never tested by opposition or cost. No reversal or tightening occurs; the artist arrives, draws, and succeeds without friction. The tile flake's instruction ("Complete the circle, but break it at the seventh turn") is obeyed immediately with no competing option or sacrifice dramatized. The villagers' warning and the grotto's "ravenous" quality vanish without consequence. Pressure flatlines: the artist's whimsical confidence remains unshaken, and the ending gift ("the grotto's whispers had finally learned to listen") reads as reward without trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—Arin's intent to rename the plaza—is signaled around midpoint but never faces opposition or cost. No on-page reversal narrows options; the soldier's "aberrant mercy" is retrospective context, not a live complication. The act of carving the name unfolds without difficulty, and the ending declares success ("his mission fulfilled") without a trade-off or foreclosed path. Pressure is asserted through tone rather than dramatized escalation; coincidence does not complicate because nothing complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—offering the actress a glimpse of possibility to prevent her giving up—is signaled early and coherent. Yet escalation is minimal: the ghost senses, drifts, carries, raises, flicks, and succeeds without obstacle, reversal, or cost. No live option is foreclosed; the tarot coin and echo-producing work as intended on first attempt. The actress's transformation from "brink of despair" to "voice steady" happens in summary, robbing the moment of felt pressure. Under an Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is required; here the synesthetic storm and memory-merge gesture toward it, but the absence of on-page resistance or visible price keeps the tightening abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=4.8)
    Dominant stake is signaled: map the pill's hidden pathways and offer a diagnostic tool. The experiment proceeds without complication—dust settles, hum matches lattice, threads appear, software sketches—so there is no on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options. Lina's agency is research curiosity, not a choice between competing goods or under external pressure. The anticipated recall-team skepticism is mentioned but not dramatized, and no cost (time, risk, doubt) alters tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—to translate the cave's silence—is signaled early but remains abstract. No on-page reversal tightens options or imposes a visible cost; the fossil "responds" and "guides," but Lira never faces a trade-off or obstacle that forces her to alter tactics. The song and the device "harmonize" without friction, and the ending lacks a credible price or foreclosed path that would satisfy escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—unscrambling the prophecy—is signaled early and pursued across decades of button cataloging, meeting the "one meaningful tightening" standard when the final button assembles clarity. However, the prophecy's question arrives without prior risk or trade-off; the turner places the button, the echo assembles, and no live option is foreclosed or cost paid. Pressure accumulates through time and cataloging density but does not narrow her tactics or force a choice that alters the outcome. The prophecy invites but does not demand, leaving stakes conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—vouchsafing Kael's return—is signaled early and tested when the courier demands proof, forcing Kael to excavate the codes on the spot. This tightening narrows options (refuse and remain exiled, or comply and risk exposure). The resolution is earned by Kael's decision to hand over the pillbox and coordinates, a protagonist-driven turn with visible cost: the pillbox gone, the network exposed, his conscience unburdened. Agency is clear (decision and retrieval action), and the cost is legible (empty hands, second chance granted). The escalation is modest—one meaningful pressure point—but sufficient for this length under a causal lens. No convenience or coincidence resolves the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (will the woman come; will the promise hold) is signaled early and sustained through ambient awareness beats. One meaningful tightening: the gutters slow, the woman arrives, and Silas must move from waiting to crossing. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through the mounting sensory cues and finally breaks into silence. Agency at closure is present but muted—Silas helps her into the coach and drives, but the resolution (needles touching, walking into mist) reads more as mutual arrival than a decision that narrows options with on-page cost. The "distillation" frame claims escalation in interiority, yet the peak beat offers alignment rather than a forced trade-off. Coincidence does not resolve, but the woman's arrival feels more like fate than a choice that tested commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why some places resist entropy—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure tightens when Kai feels the thrum and realizes the oasis absorbed generations of care; this recognition narrows her options to either replicate that kindness or carry the secret onward. Her decision to fire a bowl and leave the lantern glass inside it is a renunciation (she loses the relic) with visible cost ("the absence as a kind of fullness"). One meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. The escalation is conceptual rather than urgent, keeping the piece out of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: after the rose dies, Maya must decide how to carry forward her devotion and her grandfather's legacy. The piece delivers one meaningful tightening—choosing the cannery lot over the fire escape, seeding moonflowers with the gauge—but the escalation is more declaration than dramatized pressure: "she was not replacing what was lost, but translating it" is asserted rather than tested by a complicating reversal or visible tradeoff. Agency is present (she gathers seeds, walks to the lot, plants) yet coincidence supplies the abandoned lot without on-page discovery friction, and the ending reconfigures meaning without showing a live cost that narrows options or forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—translating isolation into independence—is signaled early but never tested through a choice that narrows options or imposes visible cost. Mara walks, touches, sits, and learns without facing opposition or a trade-off. The sundial's "conduit" function and the stone circle's hum enable her goal directly, with no escalation or reversal. Agency is absent; the narrative moves by discovery and declaration, not protagonist-driven turns.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—Lira's need to rejoin the world—is signaled early but never tested by meaningful opposition or trade-off. The installation succeeds without friction; visitors respond ideally. No on-page reversal narrows options or forces a choice with visible cost. The "restlessness" dissolves into satisfaction without dramatized escalation or a felt price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake: prevent community fracture and decode alien manipulation, signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs (2:47 AM discovery that signals are malevolent), and the counter-frequency plan introduces tactical risk (destabilize amplifiers, censure). However, the escalation is largely expository—three nights recalibrating happen off-page, and the climactic switch-flip meets no on-page resistance or complication. Cost is declared (arguments cool, mistrust smolders) rather than dramatized through a specific forfeited relationship or resource. Agency is present but the price remains abstract, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the key to the Architect's chamber—is clear, but pressure never tightens: the organ guides her, the compass works on first use, the key waits unguarded. "Claustrophobic grip of panic" is told, then immediately resolved by the compass anchor with no cost. No reversal, no failed attempt, no trade-off between speed and caution. The ending opens a thematic vista (reimagining city spaces) but does not narrow options or levy a felt price—she steps out with key and compass "ready for the next fallow season," undiminished. One brief intensification (walls closing) is noted but not sustained or paid.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—solve Catherine's disappearance and awaken empathy—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ribbon trace leads to the vendor, but this reversal happens largely off-page ("scanned," "alibi photos showed"). The arrest itself is summarized in a single line with no on-page agency from Elara; the final quarry visit offers Earned Stasis but the cost (laying the ribbon) feels ritualistic rather than a foreclosed path with visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—honor Vance's bravery and prove the suppressed weather truth—is signaled early and tightens when the librarian overrides safety protocols, facing termination. The tightening is meaningful: entering Vance's coordinates triggers alarms and forces her into open defiance, foreclosing her safe position. The camp's emergence provides external validation, but the protagonist's agency (transcribing, running, pointing) drives the escalation under the Accumulative lens. Cost is visible in the director's termination threat and her willing acceptance of professional ruin. The "spongey dread" spreading to the director signals a reweighting of certainty, though the dread itself functions more as atmospheric label than embodied pressure in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.1)
    The declared dominant stake—"to sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never,' to let the dead sing again"—is abstract and never tested by a concrete on-page dilemma with competing costs. The scaffold-wrap Morse code and buried photograph arrive via coincidence rather than protagonist agency under pressure. The final act (playing a "new bridge-song") is presented as resolution but lacks a visible trade-off or foreclosed path; the world feeling "whole again" asserts closure without dramatizing cost. No meaningful tightening or deepening forces a choice that narrows live options.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—dissuading Leo from restarting the failed venture—is signaled early. But the son never faces a live on-page tightening: he paints symbols off-page, Leo arrives, the son speaks one metaphor, and Leo capitulates without resistance or counter-offer. Coincidence (Leo's dusky visit, his immediate receptiveness) resolves the conflict. No trade-off or visible price shapes the outcome under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake—decoding temple inscriptions—is signaled early and persists. The story offers one meaningful deepening (realizing inscriptions are confessions of shared burden, not prayers), but escalation lacks agency-driven tightening; the breakthrough arrives through mystical trance rather than a choice that forecloses options. No visible price is paid on the page—archiving the telegram and whispering a promise do not narrow future paths or force a trade-off. The "cannot bear alone" predecessor note provides external pressure but does not test Elara's commitment through a competing want.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake: discover the frozen confession's truth. Escalation under causal lens: failed flame → expanding-circle chant (fractures ice) → seed deployment (melts ice, releases confession). One meaningful tightening with visible cost (druid confronts his own buried guilt, vortex calms but "warlike serenity" lingers). Agency is present—the druid's choices drive each turn—but the cost at closure ("his own forgotten guilt") feels conceptually asserted rather than viscerally paid, slightly dulling the price's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—"find the intersection of dreams"—is signaled early and tightens when Elara enters the maze and confronts the ancestor-figure. The maze sequence offers one meaningful turn: she learns the covenant must be tended rather than contained, and she chooses to become the crossing point. However, escalation reads more as revelation than rising pressure; no on-page reversal or complication forces Elara to adapt tactics mid-ordeal, and the ancestor-figure guides rather than opposes. The resolution arrives through epiphany and supernatural aid (the clipping takes root in her palm) with minimal visible cost—no loss, injury, or forfeited relationship that alters her stance in a legible way.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (restore her sister's destiny) is signaled early and sustained. The barter scene provides one meaningful tightening when the Keeper names the price (memory), but Elara's acceptance is swift and lacks on-page hesitation or a visible trade-off between competing goods. The consequence (sister wakes "in a body not her own, with memories not quite right") is stated rather than shown in a concrete image that forecloses a path. The phrase "imperfect, as all such transactions are" tells the cost rather than letting the reader feel it through a specific loss or changed tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (finding purpose after public failure) is present and the choice to keep the cloth tightens resolve, but escalation lacks a visible price or tactical consequence. Dale's question offers a minor pressure point, yet Mara's response (listing facts) does not foreclose an option or alter her stance in the moment—she was already insulating. The piece leans on told resolve ("she would create new echoes") rather than a dramatized action that costs something immediate and legible. The Accumulative lens supports the design, but the closure accumulates declarations instead of a single reweighted image with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reestablishing the invisible architecture before the city falls—is signaled early and tightens when Elara realizes the spirit distributed itself into the arbor's structure. Her agency drives the turn: she chooses to write "what the spirit had become" and carves cuneiform into the magnetic pathways, a tactic that narrows options and forecloses a path (her earlier ambition to record the spirit's departure as event). The visible cost is the renunciation of perfect understanding and the shift from author to witness. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through the seed's warming, the arbor's steadying hum, and the petal-signs' revelation, culminating in a deepening rather than a dramatic reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: preserve wonder versus maintain archival order. Pressure coheres through the waning crescent phase pulling Elara toward mechanical precision while the creel's organic weave triggers human memory. The tightening occurs when she reaches the crucible: machine-logic demands dissolution, human fibers resist. Her compromise (half-heat gradient, creel on platform not in chute) is protagonist-driven and narrows future options—she creates an unresolved artifact category. Cost is felt: ongoing identity migration, protocol breach, and acceptance that "her work was futile and eternal." The escalation is modest but sufficient for this length under an accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether to report the structural risk or preserve the caves—is signaled at the fracture discovery. The "heartbeat of a hesitation" frames the turn, but Mara's choice is described rather than dramatized with visible friction or trade-off. No consequence for defying protocol appears on the page; the broadcast effect rewards her without cost. Escalation occurs through discovery layers (footlocker → caves → pillar) but lacks genuine narrowing of options or felt price at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—self-forgiveness for the bridge collapse—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through sensory and emotional weight, but no on-page reversal or tightening forecloses a live option. The graffiti wisdom and imagined accordion music offer internal shifts, yet Mira's final walk-away does not involve a visible trade-off or cost that narrows her future choices. The escalation is textural rather than causal, and the price remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"to find the library of unspoken words"—is declared but never tested on the page; she arrives, finds it, and "releases" it without opposition or trade-off. No reversal tightens options; the watch's "hidden compartment" opens conveniently without cost. The second letter's arrival is framing rather than complication. No agency-driven escalation or felt price shapes the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—Lira's dream of a free archive versus the empire's exploitation—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, the story lacks an on-page tightening or reversal: the envoy arrives, Lira refuses (off-page), and the resolution unfolds as planned without a visible tradeoff or narrowed options. The seed's discovery provides new information but doesn't force a difficult choice; Lira's decision to plant it and hide the violin feels like the only path she ever considered. The "promise losing its glow" timeframe is declared but never tested with urgency or a live clock that alters her moves.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (capture the poet's spark before it dissolves) is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through synchronized ritual steps and the thread's fraying, creating one meaningful tightening when the droplet forms. The piece enters the 8.0 band threshold—options narrow and Elara must align perfectly—but the cost is conceptual (oblivion's claim) rather than a visible trade-off that forecloses a live alternative. No antagonist is required; the void supplies opposition. Under the Accumulative lens, the cadence shift at capture suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—finding contentment's source—is signaled early and tightens when Elara must prune Mrs. Chen's grief-soaked cluster. Her kindly decisive action (tracing the sigil, climbing to witness rather than command) narrows options and honors established constraint (souls choose their own rebirth). Cost is legible: she relinquishes the notion that contentment hides in the grapes and accepts it lives in the labor itself. The transformation of blackened grapes is externalized rather than a direct protagonist decision, slightly diffusing agency. One meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens is sufficient at this length, but the epilogue's summary weakens the peak's consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—welcoming nuance into certainty—is signaled early but never tested by a meaningful tightening that forecloses a live option. Unhooking the lantern and ascending the stairs are unopposed; no reversal or deepening forces a trade-off. The keeper's instruction and the protagonist's acceptance occur without dramatized resistance or visible price, leaving escalation flat under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—teaching vanishing to appear—is declared early but never tested by opposition or internal conflict that would force Mira to choose between competing goods. No reversal narrows her options; the narrative moves in one contemplative direction without a turn that changes what she knows or can do. The final act of stepping into the pond feels like fulfillment of a pre-existing plan rather than a decision forced by accumulated pressure. "Vanish to appear" functions as theme rather than a problem with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is signaled early and coheres throughout. However, escalation is conceptual rather than causal: the skimmer watches, skims stones, and listens, but no on-page reversal narrows her options or forces a trade-off. The birds' spiral and the arrowhead's pulse align without resistance or cost, delivering an epiphany rather than a tightening choice. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is sufficient, but the final reweighting lacks a visible price that alters later tactics or forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (preserve the last wild magic versus comply for pension) is signaled early and tightens when Vorrin finds no mechanical bindings, forcing the underachiever/inefficiency question into a binary. The mist-walk method dramatizes patience-over-power as tactical constraint. Escalation operates via situational pressure—discovery that the keystone simply waits reweights his errand into a moral test. Visible cost: he forfeits pension and becomes part of the mist, foreclosing return. Deduction for the Refactory sentinels mentioned only in future tense without on-page pressure; their inevitability dilutes the finality of his renunciation slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—discovering the color of sound—is signaled early, but the piece offers no meaningful tightening or escalation under the accumulative lens. Elias descends, reads the log, sees a flicker of color, and surfaces with his quest complete; no on-page reversal narrows his options or forces a trade-off. The "missing tone" is revealed through passive observation (a drifting lantern) rather than agency, and the closure delivers satisfaction without visible cost or foreclosed path. The library visit functions as a detour rather than a pressure point that tests commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—"wavelength align with purpose or dissolve"—is signaled early and sustains pressure. The three coin-casts provide structural tightening, but the escalation reads as repetition-with-variation rather than a meaningful narrowing of options or raising of cost. The climactic moment ("she had found the alignment") arrives as realization-summary rather than a choice that forecloses a live alternative with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—give names to nameless fears—is signaled early and tightens through the accumulation of crystallized monsters (sea serpent, kraken, leviathan) until only one remains. The turn occurs when the final cylinder holds his incomplete fear and she realizes some terrors live "in the space between souls." Agency is renunciation with cost: she leaves carrying the atlas and her own unnamed void. The escalation is a density climb, not a causal reversal, fitting the Accumulative lens. Minor slip: the stakes are told ("this was why she returned") rather than shown through a competing pull or visible sacrifice of time/safety.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—righting cosmic imbalance after the last fish is caught—is signaled early. Kael's adjustments (counting drips, tilting the bell) provide texture but no meaningful escalation or trade-off; each attempt succeeds incrementally without narrowing options or raising cost. The coincidental arrival of fish and the restoration of balance feel handed rather than earned through protagonist agency. No live alternative is foreclosed, and the "quiet victory" lacks the visible price or tactical consequence required for higher bands under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: correct the hidden crime and share the truth. Nora's agency moves from discovery to resolve without meaningful opposition or a choice that forecloses an alternate path with visible cost. The trail of photographs deepens her understanding (mother's memory surfaces), but no reversal tests her commitment—no competing pressure from remaining residents, no risk articulated on the page. The writing act is purposeful but unfolds without friction; we're told she feels "quiet resolve" rather than witnessing a trade-off or sacrifice that alters her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—harmonize logic and intuition or "dissolve into the pattern-less void"—is signaled early but never tested on the page. The forty-eight-hour deadline creates no tactical pressure; the protagonist completes her ritual in a single uninterrupted sequence without reversal or forced trade-off. Placing the crystal in the flame and offering the violet are gestures of recognition, not decisions under duress. The starlings' appearance is coincidental (they arrive "at the precise moment"), and their pattern solves the problem for her rather than through her agency. No live option is foreclosed, no visible cost alters tactics. Accumulative design allows for deepening rather than causal escalation, but the final image does not reweight prior pressure—it releases it without consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.2)
    One dominant stake (preserve the tether to maintain trust) is signaled early and pressure coheres under the Causal lens: the emergency call creates urgency, the protagonist revises the sequence, the system responds. One tightening occurs when he triggers the manual override, but the cost remains implicit—no live option is visibly foreclosed on the page. The resolution is protagonist-driven (he acts) but the price is told ("the weight...lift[s] slightly") rather than shown through a forfeited resource, tactical trade-off, or relational consequence. Agency reads as competent execution without meaningful internal friction or external complication that forces a harder choice.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (right to exist as one true consciousness) is signaled early and tightens when the sensei perceives the clones' "hollow core" and "ghost in each machine." The vivify technique is protagonist-driven agency with visible cost: grief, memory of family deaths, solitude flood back. The temporal storm functions as situational pressure but does not narrow options through a second on-page reversal; the clones flicker but do not adapt or resist. One meaningful tightening (clones freeze, showing fear; sensei acts) is sufficient for this length, and the cost is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restore lost laughter—is signaled in paragraph one and drives every beat. Pressure accumulates through escalation: Eleanor eases off to avoid making Sarah "think herself mad," a tactical constraint that shows agency and cost. The wind's volume modulates with purpose, demonstrating protagonist control. Sarah's shattered plate and cracked laugh are the story's hinge, a visible on-page reversal that forecloses the path of sealed grief. The brother's phone call extends consequence, and Eleanor's dissolution pays the final price.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake: overcoming dimensional exile and making peace with uncertainty. The pendant's discovery provides one meaningful tightening—it reweights the guardian's understanding of its role—and the final image reconfigures waiting from sentence to syntax. However, the escalation relies on interior recalibration rather than external pressure that narrows live options. The "door that had never existed before" appears late without prior setup, reading ornamental rather than a choice-forcing complication. Agency is present (the guardian chooses to interiorize and "let the door settle") but cost feels abstract; no visible sacrifice or foreclosed path materializes on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—interrupting the bloodline's destiny—is signaled immediately and maintained throughout. Escalation operates through successive approximation: each failed attempt builds toward the Thirty-Third Transmutation, culminating in the pivotal choice to snap the crozier's serpent-head and sacrifice certainty itself. The cost is visible and meaningful: she achieves "beautiful undeath" rather than true life, creates eternal stasis, and must walk away from her creation. The pressure accumulates cleanly under the Accumulative lens through density increase and the final cadence shift when "the penny drops."

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—interpreting the star fragment to understand cosmic silence—is signaled early and shapes Mira's tactics. The turn from amplification to listening provides one meaningful tightening. However, the escalation lacks on-page resistance: Mira's three-night failure is summarized, and the lunar perigee breakthrough arrives without intermediate cost or trade-off. The resolution (rewiring the tower) unfolds without visible friction, and the promise to "teach them to listen" feels declarative rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—merging parallel timelines to anchor the vanishing ferry—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Pressure accumulates through the radio tuning, starlight-filling ritual, and spiral tracing, but no reversal or tightening forecloses a live option with on-page cost. Lina "holds fast" and sends "one final pulse," the timelines snap together, yet she already knows "it was fleeting" and "the ferry would vanish again." Agency reads as execution of a learned procedure rather than a high-stakes choice where success trades one value for another or failure compounds prior mistakes. The "resiliently positive" stance never wavers, so no internal or external pressure forces a recalibration.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (discovering connection's texture) is signaled early and pressure accumulates through the weaving, the false memory tumor, and the water eruption. One meaningful tightening occurs when the sinew thread pulls taut and the gallery rejects the forced connection. However, the resolution hinges on Mira's passive acceptance ("let it carry her") rather than an active choice that narrows options, and the cost—her empty hands, broken fever—is declared rather than shown to foreclose a live path.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—teaching starlight navigation from the benthic city—is signaled early and remains coherent. The Tethian elder's exchange ("horizons must be unfolded from within") offers a philosophical deepening, but it arrives as instruction rather than a reversal that narrows options or raises cost. Mara's final method (using the anchor's corrosion as a star map) is presented as successful without a dramatized trade-off or visible price; Corin's achievement confirms the plan rather than testing it. One meaningful tightening is present but escalation under the Accumulative lens remains mild.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (finding and assuring lost voices) is signaled early but remains abstract until the medical emergency forces a concrete action. The crash and the man's collapse provide one meaningful tightening, yet this turn arrives via external coincidence rather than protagonist agency. The protagonist's CPR and assurance carry visible cost in "trembling hands" and the paramedics' arrival, but the stakes never test a harder trade-off—curiosity leads seamlessly to heroism without friction. The final image restarts the cycle without foreclosing a path or deepening the original question.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—bearing witness to the erased colleagues—is signaled immediately and tightens as water rises and claustrophobia grips. One meaningful escalation: reaching the relay room and syncing with the traces narrows options (stay and drown, or leave now), forcing the seven-second act that forecloses easier memorialization. Agency is clear: Marek chooses to kneel and sync rather than record or salvage. The rising tide adds urgency; cost is legible in the panicked ascent and the dimming codex. No antagonist required; situational pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: fetch wisdom from the ghost's failure to mend her own misfiled existence. One meaningful tightening occurs when the porcelain shard contact sparks the defragmentation completion. Agency is present (she traces ink, presses the shard), but the resolution—ghost speaks, wisdom "settles"—lacks a visible trade-off or foreclosed path; the protagonist does not renounce, endure with cost, or make a choice that narrows later options. Cost is implied in the phrase "each crack teaches the path to mend," yet no on-page action demonstrates what she gives up or what alternative she closes.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—translate the diamond's texture into sound before the language vanishes—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes motion (spinebirds) can become syntax, narrowing her approach. The mapping of avian patterns onto the diamond is a protagonist-driven turn under the Accumulative lens. Cost is stated ("the language had died completely now") but remains abstract; we do not see a specific forfeited option or live consequence that alters her final tactics. The summary of her death and the diamond's endless song dilutes the on-page price at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—Lyn's desire to "turn bitterness into a cosmic joke"—is declared but never tested by a choice between competing goods or a visible trade-off. The arrowhead "key" and phone "confessions" arrive as plot conveniences rather than escalating pressure Lyn must navigate. Her transformation is passive: gravity "softens," the garden "responds," and her form "begins to shift" without agency-driven escalation. No meaningful reversal or tightening narrows her options; the resolution is granted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—reawakening beauty in a mechanical world—is signaled early and sustained. One clear tightening occurs when the clocktower sends a counter-pulse, raising the cost of Elara's attempt. However, the escalation lacks a visible trade-off: she "felt she'd become statue herself" but then simply transitions to becoming a bridge without forfeiting anything concrete. The statues' awakening and the orchard's restoration feel like rewards without on-page sacrifice—no stamina, voice, or autonomy is visibly lost. Coincidence resolves key pressure: the locust shell floats in "on a breeze that shouldn't exist" rather than being earned by prior action.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—healing the broken promise—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure is linear: the mailman executes a familiar smuggling run with the storm-bottle trick. No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options; the drone slips through as planned and the mother receives the message without complication. The escalation is atmospheric rather than causal, and the final act (mother weeps, mailman watches) does not foreclose a path or impose a visible trade-off. Under Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is required; here the deepening is primarily emotional recapitulation.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring the carousel—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation is thin: Silas encounters no meaningful obstacle or cost. The "wrong turn" provides the solution without complication. No live option is foreclosed; the halo fragment pulses responsively, the horses rise, the train exhales—all cooperative. The tightening required by the Accumulative lens (a density increase or pattern break that reweights the stake with cost) is gestured at but not dramatized with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—locating the zeroth volume—is signaled early and pursued throughout, but pressure never tightens. No reversal or obstacle appears; the scarf method works on first attempt, the portal opens, and the volume "pulses" with no cost extracted. The young man's appearance beside her in the chamber is unexplained and does nothing to complicate her goal. Coincidence (scarf happens to be a map, shelves respond on cue) resolves rather than complicates. Closure is fulfillment without renunciation, mistake, or visible price: she "reappears pristine," the process will "begin again," and no path is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—capture the runaway dream before it dissolves—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs: the painted bridge dissolves, forcing a tactical shift to "painting with light shape of safekeeping." The dream's leap into the palette's well provides closure participation. However, escalation reads as thematic assertion ("she understood then") rather than a choice that narrows live options or imposes visible cost. Under the Accumulative lens, the single deepening is sufficient but costs remain conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—freeing the trapped idea—is signaled early and remains coherent. The piece accumulates pressure through ritualistic imagery and the woman's trembling, but no on-page tightening or reversal occurs that narrows options or raises cost. The "disorienting mantra" and unbraiding are described rather than dramatized with tactical friction or failure. The woman's weeping and Merrin's longing are asserted outcomes, not earned through a visible choice that forecloses a path. At this length, one meaningful escalation beat is expected; here the ritual proceeds smoothly without resistance or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (recovering stolen memories) is clear and escalates through discovery (pattern exists) → obstacle (mushrooms only grow in August) → workaround (cultivate spores) → resolution (place the mushroom). One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias realizes the faeries were "archivists, preserving what he couldn't bear to remember," reweighting the entire pursuit. The cultivation sequence shows hands-on problem-solving under constraint. However, the peak moment—placing the mushroom and memories flooding back—feels slightly inevitable rather than testing a final choice with visible tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (decipher the shadow to end exile vs. remain to mentor) is signaled early and tightens when the annotation succeeds, forcing the archivist's explicit choice. Her decision to stay is agency-driven endurance that forecloses return with visible relational cost ("but then who would teach you"). One meaningful deepening occurs when Lin asks "Will this set you free?" and the archivist reframes exile as "a door that swings both ways," reconfiguring the stakes from external verdict to internal choice. No explicit antagonist, but the constraint of exile provides coherent pressure throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.7)
    The dominant stake is signaled early and remains consistent, but escalation is declarative rather than dramatized: "The method was dangerous" is told, not shown through a moment where Vespera must choose between competing costs. No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows her options; she works for seven days without obstacle, and the seed opens on the eighth dawn as if on schedule. The resolution—wonder returns multiplied—arrives without protagonist agency at closure; coincidence (the seed's inherent properties) solves the problem it was designed to solve. No visible price shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (ground the restless spirits) is signaled early and coherent throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs as Elara begins the forbidden method and each knot releases a memory, narrowing her path back. The final knot ("figure-eight of perfect fear") reweights the stake by revealing the pearl—silence compressed into tangible form—and the spirits settle "into the hollows of her bones." Under the Accumulative lens, this deepening is sufficient and the cost is legible: she redistributes the weight rather than erasing it, foreclosing the option of carrying alone. Agency is clear (her choice to unravel despite the mentor's warning) but the pressure feels more iterative than escalating; each knot is a beat but they read as parallel rather than compounding.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—reopening the silence of the whispered chapel—is signaled early and pursued methodically. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elena detects the faint outline in the footage comparison, narrowing her search to the specific fresco seam. However, the discovery lacks a visible trade-off or tactical cost; no live option is foreclosed, no resource spent, no relational or temporal price paid on the page. The accumulative pressure coheres but does not escalate through protagonist agency under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is clearly Cassian's effort to understand letting go, signaled early and sustained through his measurements. Pressure accumulates via the Accumulative lens: each observation (settling rate, turbulence, logarithmic decay) deepens the inquiry until the final note reweights the grip as "exhaustive mapping of its own tension." Cost is conceptual—grief becomes potential memory, buoyancy replaces weight—but remains somewhat abstract. Mort's presence and the Earhart context complicate mood without applying direct opposition; escalation depends more on density increase than on a live obstacle narrowing Cassian's options.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—giving voice to the ghost's unspoken needs—is signaled early but never tested or tightened. Each beat (stamping patterns, walls blooming, ghost flickering, scribe tracing) cycles through the same encoding action without escalation, reversal, or visible cost. The ghost's "freedom" at the end is not earned by a protagonist decision or sacrifice; it simply happens as atmospheric description. No choice narrows options, no failure compounds, and coincidence (the scribe's arrival, the bolt plate's glow) advances the resolution without agency.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Kai's need to understand the captain's final words and confirm their service mattered—is clear and tightens as each floor reveals deeper intimacy. The reversal at floor eight (captain noticed Kai's humming, map-folding) narrows the question from "did I matter?" to "how much joy did I give?" The goggles enable rather than complicate, and Kai's agency is largely receptive (reading, realizing) rather than forced to choose under pressure. Cost is emotional and subtle—grief tempered by knowledge—fitting the Accumulative lens, though a stronger trade-off or renunciation would elevate the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake (prove empty spaces remember) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening: the "acceptance" cloud arrival forces Mara to complete her proof before potential rescue, narrowing her window to "Station November-Charlie, final entry." Agency is renunciation—she seals the proof for the sky rather than awaiting human validation, forecloses the path to scientific recognition with visible cost ("not for any journal, but for the air itself"). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through atmospheric metaphor and the Thorne revelation, though the escalation is more deepening than narrowing. The gondola's physical peril remains static (it groans but never falls), slightly undermining urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—mirroring the sky before demolition—is signaled early. The ticking clock provides situational pressure, but no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options. Kael completes his mural without obstacle; the demolition arrives as foretold, and he walks away. The "limit" realization is thematic rather than a trade-off that forecloses a live path. One meaningful escalation is present (the walls shimmer, "unsure whether to hold on or let go"), but it lacks agency-driven cost.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake (chart the fallen star, earn cartographer status) is signaled early and Elara's agency drives the journey. One meaningful tightening: phrasebook + hopscotch → Whispering Crag coordinates narrows options. The stranded luminance materializes as promised, but the resolution arrives without complication—Kess agrees immediately, the light is exactly where legend said, ancient carvings confirm the breadcrumb. No reversal or trade-off tests commitment; coincidence delivers rather than protagonist struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake ("learn the rhythm of repair") is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening occurs: each puzzle step (find prophecy, uncap gear, follow mist, insert gear) succeeds without complication, alternative, or visible price. The protagonist's agency is passive reception—objects and mist guide her, and she completes a predetermined sequence. Escalation is absent; pressure remains static from opening to close, and the resolution is bestowed rather than earned through choice or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—revive the orchard before dry season—is declared but never tested on the page; no scene shows withering blossoms or failed irrigation attempts. The bell's use bypasses all friction: they ring it once, water flows, problem solved. No reversal, no tightening choice that narrows options, no visible price paid (ghost fading is his choice, not the community's trade-off). Escalation is absent; pressure remains flat from setup through resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=4.2)
    The dominant stake—vouchsafe a lullaby as pattern—is signaled early but never tested. The adjuster faces no opposition, makes no trade-offs, and encounters no reversal or complication. She places the head, traces spirals, the head glows and dissolves, mission complete. No tightening, no escalation, no cost legible on the page. Under any lens, pressure is static; coincidence (the head's glow, the clock's transformation) resolves without protagonist agency forcing a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—guide the travelers to safety before nightfall—is signaled early and tightened by the frost countdown ("One down, seven more turns to assemble before darkness"). Escalation proceeds through the Accumulative lens: each nut placement narrows the corridor of safety, and the final nut ("worn smooth by handling and hope") is the last margin. Agency is present in Elara's reluctant but precise actions. The cost is felt but somewhat muted: her loneliness and separation are reiterated rather than freshly forfeited, and the travelers' survival does not visibly alter her situation or force a new trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake (translating separation into connection) is signaled early. The foam observation tightens her research direction, but no reversal forces a trade-off or narrows live options with felt cost. The lab synthesis succeeds without complication, and the "loosened grief" resolution arrives without visible sacrifice or endurance that forecloses a prior path. Accumulative design allows quiet escalation, but this piece lacks the decisive tightening or deepening cost required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—helping customers find story beginnings—is signaled early but never tightens with a visible trade-off or cost. The woman's request and the vendor's response proceed without reversal, complication, or agency-driven escalation; the bottled moonlight simply works as described. No on-page loss (time, resource, relational price) alters later tactics. The accumulative lens teaches pattern but no single beat narrows options or changes knowledge with felt consequence, falling short of the escalation requirement for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the chef can subsume the woman's remorse without breaking—is signaled early and tightens once meaningfully when the chef tastes the coral droplet and "the weight of it nearly drove me to my knees." The choice to take sharpness into existing cuts rather than sandpaper the memory away is protagonist-driven and forecloses the erasure path with visible cost (trembling hands, spreading brittleness). Under the Accumulative lens, this single deepening is sufficient for the length. However, the woman's passive presence limits interactive pressure; her gratitude touch at the end feels more like a grace note than a complicating turn.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.6)
    One dominant stake (unify the divided town) is signaled early. No meaningful escalation: Elara's plan (gather phrases, teach a melody) proceeds without resistance, adaptation, or reversal. The convening of the "first grain elevator talk" implies risk, but all participants cooperate immediately—no refusal, no linguistic pride defended, no cost to interspersing tongues. The clock's revival depends on collective will, yet that will materializes without dramatized persuasion or trade-off. Closure reconfigures the town's listening, but the path from silence to song lacks on-page friction or a choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake ("to become the archaeologist of abandoned dreams") is declared but never tested by meaningful opposition or cost. The engineer executes her work without friction: memories are "rewoven," dreams "stirred," the canyon "exhales"—all described as complete, with no reversal or tightening that narrows options. No agency is demonstrated; she performs a ritual and accepts "entanglement as price" in summary rather than forfeiting a live alternative. The final paragraph's statement "transformation had reached its apex; now came integration" announces completion without showing escalation or tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake—secure the forgotten combinations before the inversion window closes—is signaled early and creates a ticking clock. Pressure tightens as gravity begins to right itself and the mist thickens, forcing the archivist to run. However, no genuine obstacle or trade-off materializes; she records all glyphs without error or cost and escapes cleanly. Escalation is mechanical (time running out) rather than driven by protagonist agency or a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—to create music in a silent world—is signaled early. The discovery of the sculpture and the act of strumming constitute one meaningful tightening that deepens the stake. However, no reversal or trade-off forecloses a live option with visible cost. The sculptor's agency is present (she fashions a bow, strums, sings) but never tested against a competing pressure or loss. The ending asserts that "the world listens" without showing what she gave up or what alternative she foreclosed, leaving escalation and cost clarity moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—decoding silence to resolve the eclipsed covenant—is signaled early. Pressure is more textural than causal: magnetic pulses mirror memory, but no on-page obstacle forces Kael to adapt tactics. The stone release is Kael's unilateral decision; no reversal or external complication tests his commitment beforehand. Cost is legible in the final image (he walks away, erasing presence) but lacks a prior trade-off or narrowed option that would demonstrate escalation under Accumulative lens standards.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—recovering her father's locked memory/empathy—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the frequency-tuning attempt, the voice discovery, and the clasp opening, but the escalation is mechanical: each step succeeds without genuine setback or forced trade-off. The diary opens because Mira finds the right frequency, not because she renounces another path or pays a visible cost. The neighbor's arrival offers potential for secondary pressure but instead diffuses tension into shared listening. One tightening (the voice discovery) narrows focus but does not foreclose options or raise stakes in a way that charges the final image with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—brewing a tincture to "calm a heart caught in the rush of the world"—is signaled early. However, escalation is weak: Elias faces no opposition, resource scarcity, or internal contradiction that narrows options. The minstrel's arrival provides a test, but his instant success deflates tension rather than deepening it. The elders' validation continues the pattern of frictionless acceptance. The closure offers thematic repricing but no visible price paid by Elias; his "ambition had borne fruit" without dramatized cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—finding the source of orchard resilience—is signaled immediately and drives the sequence. Kael's launch, navigation, and discovery form a single escalating arc under the Accumulative lens. However, the stakes never tighten into a trade-off or dilemma on the page; no moment forces Kael to choose between competing goods or risk a visible loss. The resolution (touching the seed, receiving understanding) arrives without on-page friction or cost, leaving escalation more structural than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (prevent future accidents by mapping wind hazards) is signaled early and coheres throughout. One tightening occurs when she notes the spike in velocity and imagines the rescue-helicopter scenario, narrowing her tactical focus. However, escalation is largely conceptual rather than embodied in on-page pressure; no live obstacle tests her hypothesis or forces a trade-off. The resolution—deciding to publish—is stated intent without visible cost or dramatized consequence, weakening the closure under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—certifying wonder as essential—is signaled early. One tightening occurs when the hush begins to fracture, driven by Lyra's bell sequence. Yet the resolution is convenience-routed: the hush simply yields without visible trade-off or loss. No live option is foreclosed; Lyra completes the ritual and afterward "remained," with no cost exacted. The sculptor's pause mid-stroke is reactive, not a consequence of protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—harvesting insights from failure—is signaled early but never tightens into a live dilemma with visible cost. The flute playing opens a seam and the keeper glimpses the vault, yet no reversal forces a trade-off or narrows options. The final "renewed resolve" arrives without on-page agency that forecloses a path; coincidence (the canyon hush returning) replaces protagonist-driven escalation. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is sufficient, but here the density does not reweight options with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=4.0)
    The dominant stake—"to understand the mathematics of emotion"—is declared but never tested on the page with a live cost or forced tradeoff. Cassian prints two sheets, observes reactions, records data, then continues printing with unchanged motivation. The realization that "emotion could not be solved like a linear equation" arrives without prior resistance or escalation; it is offered as thesis rather than earned through pressure. No reversal forecloses a path or reweights options.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—"to coax wonder from the routine"—is signaled early but never opposed. The courier intends to reach the observatory and succeeds without friction; the child's need (germinate the seed) is solved immediately upon contact with the pendant. No tightening or deepening occurs: the pendant works on first use, the child accepts it without hesitation, and the courier's delivery proceeds unhindered. The only cost claimed is the pendant's transfer, but the text tells us he retains its "echo" and continues his mission, erasing the forfeiture and flattening escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—proving objects absorb emotions—is signaled early and tightens when Seraphine shifts from seeking proof to seeking communion, forecloses the scientist role with visible cost (empty hands, no conclusions in her report). However, the escalation is more thematic deepening than pressure-driven; no live antagonist or external resistance tests her commitment, and the key turn (placing the prism back) feels inevitable rather than forced by competing costs. The accumulative lens allows this, but the piece trends mid-band because agency is more receptive than decision-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—carrying Lin's message across impossible distance—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mei finds the final puzzle piece showing her younger self and understands the required trade ("her own woven memories, her own silent years"). However, the escalation relies on fortuitous discovery (the puzzle box) rather than protagonist-driven pressure, and the weaving sequence summarizes rather than dramatizes the sacrifice beat by beat. The cost is declared ("first the memory of morning tea, then the sound of Lin's first laugh") but remains abstract; we do not witness Mei's internal friction or hesitation as each memory is pulled. The resolution depends on the loom's sudden willingness to "recommence," a shift enabled by object rather than character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—saving the orchards and arches—is signaled early and tightens through the mine descent and barter. Ren's agency drives the escalation: he chooses to speak, to research, to descend, and finally to offer the rings. The barter itself narrows options with visible cost (inheritance lost, meekness transformed). The council's declaration that the orchards are "past saving" establishes opposition, but the magistrate and other voices remain off-stage abstractions rather than on-page pressure, slightly reducing the felt friction Ren must overcome.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—prevent the rift from swallowing the repair bay—is signaled early but escalates without protagonist agency: the shard "demanded a specific action," and Lira's weaving succeeds on the first attempt with no setback or choice between competing goods. The revelation about her predecessor's failure arrives as a told epiphany mid-action and does not change her tactics. The resolution dispels the rift without visible trade-off; the shard vanishes, but Lira's readiness to "map the next cycle" suggests no path has been foreclosed. No on-page tightening narrows options or forces a cost legible in the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake (protect the lighthouse promise) is signaled early but remains abstract. The lamp's failure introduces complication, yet Caleb's response (collect glass, write note, relight wick) proceeds without visible trade-offs or foreclosed options. No reversal narrows his choices—each step is additive rather than costly. The ghost's presence hovers as atmosphere; it does not oppose or test Caleb's commitment. Escalation is tonal rather than causal, and the resolution (lamp relit, promise kept) arrives without felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—guiding lost sailors, "shaping a new dawn"—is declared but never tested with a live choice that forecloses an option. The ship sends a signal; she turns the wick; the light reaches them; they arrive safely. No reversal, no trade-off, no visible cost. Her "accidentally prophetic" utterance ("The tide will turn") stills the sea without struggle or price, and the climax repeats the pattern: she shouts a prophecy, the storm abates, the captain "felt a sudden clarity" and steers in. Agency belongs to convenience and her passive gifts, not protagonist decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—learning why some people magnetize stories—is signaled early but never tested through a choice that narrows options or imposes visible cost. The stranger's arrival and revelation provide information rather than forcing a decision; the master receives the truth passively. The child's first words and subsequent visitor stream indicate a new role but do not reverse prior tactics or foreclose a path with legible sacrifice. Escalation reads as accumulation of evidence rather than tightening pressure, and the final image reconfigures meaning thematically without on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—discovering what the trees witnessed—is signaled early and pursued through the sextant's healing and the door's opening. One meaningful tightening occurs when the sextant reveals the hidden map, narrowing Elara's tactical options. However, escalation is soft: she climbs, places, waits, and the tools cooperate without friction. The final realization (sorrow transformed into hope) is conceptual but lacks visible cost; no live option is foreclosed, no trade-off made. Agency reads as attention and endurance rather than decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—rekindle the dying realm—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias sings and the threads brighten, but agency is passive: the greenhouse "responds," trees "tremble," dawn "grows" without Elias navigating a live trade-off or tactical adjustment. The cost (memory scattering) is told in future tense rather than paid in a present-tense foreclosure that narrows options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to accept the invitation and join the Society—is signaled early and remains consistent. However, the escalation lacks concrete agency: Mira's progression from hiding the invitation to stepping through the door unfolds primarily through a chain of philosophical realizations rather than choices that narrow options. The clock markers (11:47, 11:53, 11:59) create temporal pressure, but no external force or internal cost-bearing decision actually tests her commitment. The "mistake" she uncovers is reframed as wisdom through reflection alone, without visible sacrifice; what does she lose by stepping through? The story tells us she's "leaving while staying" but never dramatizes the tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—resisting collective forgetting—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through Mara's solitary work, then deepens when she gathers witnesses and performs the breadcrumb ritual. The tightening occurs when she moves from private tending to public witness, but this shift is more additive than a true reversal or narrowing of options. No live cost appears: Mara's choice to scatter the bread does not foreclose a competing path (e.g., hoarding memory privately, confronting officials, abandoning the courtyard). The epilogue flash-forward tells us the courtyard becomes a public garden, but this resolution is presented as inevitable rather than earned through a dramatized consequence of the breadcrumb act.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving the library's memory—is declared but never tested by a choice that forecloses an alternative path. The chief measures, recalibrates, and projects the vow without encountering resistance, failure, or a trade-off; each action succeeds in sequence without escalation. The claimed cost (the vow is "temporary," oblivion remains inevitable) is told rather than dramatized, and the ending loops assurance rather than crystallizing a price paid or path renounced.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserve the truce of hush—is signaled early and drives all three attempts. The two false starts create genuine escalation: laughter forces tactical shift, the relit lantern teaches her that force won't work, leading to the rewiring solution that targets betrayal's sound itself. Agency is clear in each choice and the final cost (carrying the secret alone, the market "none the wiser") forecloses direct solidarity. One gap: the stranger's vulnerability (leaving his device in a compartment the fob unlocks) feels under-motivated, softening the earned reversal slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Elara seeks to learn why some people carry weather. Pressure accumulates through the convergence of three phenomena and the weather-carrier's arrival, offering one meaningful tightening when the woman explains the emergent property. However, the escalation relies more on exposition ("we are the compromise the atmosphere makes") than on a choice that narrows options or a reversal that raises cost. Elara's decision to hand over the ring and not report her findings lacks a visible trade-off—what does she risk or forfeit by this renunciation? The cost is conceptual ("some truths were meant to be sensed, not spoken") but remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is Elena's creative block; the locked alcove provides one meaningful tightening (she must solve the lock to access hidden resources). Her agency is real: she recalls the rhythm, taps the housing, and chooses to draw again. However, escalation is minimal—the lock refuses once, then yields—and no live trade-off or sacrifice occurs on the page. The note "Draw the dawn" arrives as external prompt rather than protagonist-driven reversal. Cost is implied (facing the blank page) but not dramatized as a forfeiture; the resolution feels more like permission granted than a hard-won choice. Pressure coheres under the Causal lens but remains at a single tier without deepening contradiction or secondary complication.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—finding lost conversations—is signaled early, but escalation is absent. She pieces the map, descends the ladder, listens to tapes, and retrieves her own reel in a sequence of steps without reversals, costs, or narrowing options. The guard's "half-truths" momentarily threaten but he "let her pass" with no loss or trade-off. The archive visit succeeds without obstacle; she "spent hours listening" but no competing demand or resource limit alters her tactics. Closure is discovery plus transcription, additive rather than earned through agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder through kinetic art—is signaled early but never tested on the page. No external opposition or internal doubt forces a trade-off; the tuner completes her masterpiece without visible obstacles or cost during this scene. The child's witness provides thematic resonance but no reversal. The piece accumulates texture rather than escalating pressure, and while the tuner's self-erasure is named, it unfolds across seasons rather than through a dramatized choice here. One deepening—the realization of transmission over preservation—occurs, but it feels asserted rather than earned by prior friction.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake signaled early: resolve inner static fragmentation. The magnetic shift provides external pressure that intensifies internal discord. One clear tightening: the android must choose between protocol and symbolic healing, opting to spark the fire intentionally. The controlled burn forecloses safe compliance with visible cost (protocol violation, "anomalous" logged event). Agency is demonstrated through deliberate short circuit and pyre construction. The resolution (static quieting as fears miniaturize) is earned by the protagonist's active choice under accumulating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—saving the courtyard from development—is declared early via orange survey flags. One meaningful tightening occurs when Samir reveals the grandmother's sleep-talk, narrowing the search to the north-side jasmine. Yet Mira's investigation proceeds without setbacks: every informant freely shares, the key fits perfectly, Elena cooperates, and the letters provide exactly the proof needed. The bulldozers' arrival is resolved off-page through summarized council meetings, not by a protagonist choice with visible on-page cost. Accumulative mode can tolerate linear progress, but escalation requires at least one moment where Mira's tactics are forced to change or a live option is foreclosed with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (escape) is signaled early, and the dice-roll/dance sequence provides one meaningful turn when the system unlocks. Yet escalation is thin: Lyra's plan proceeds without setback, and the AI's acceptance of her performance lacks friction or adaptive resistance. The flood that follows is framed as "baptism," not survival test, erasing cost. Agency is present but unopposed; the piece offers setup and resolution without a middle complication that forces trade-offs or narrows options under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—recovering Mara's lost memory—is signaled early and sustained. Kael's agency drives escalation: he researches superstitions, divines via coffee grounds, navigates dense gravity pockets, and physically exhumes the crystal. The final act (pressing wildflowers to crystal) narrows options and delivers visible cost: the crystal fractures, memory pours out "as weight," and Kael's earlier fear is resolved when Mara recalls the violets. One meaningful tightening occurs when the coffee-ground map points to the fifth piling, forcing Kael's descent. The lack of an on-page antagonist or internal conflict (Kael never doubts, never faces a trade-off) keeps pressure coherent but single-note. Cost is present but muted—Kael's exertion is described, but no explicit sacrifice or foreclosed path appears.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—hushing the prophecy to prevent memory-erasure—is signaled early and drives all action. One meaningful tightening occurs when the prophecy "fights back" and water quickens, forcing the final crane placement that produces absolute hush. However, the flood threat remains abstract and off-page throughout; no secondary pressure tests Elias's commitment, and his execution proceeds without adaptation or visible trade-off until the terminal doubt. The cost (lost wisdom) is conceptual and arrives in reflection rather than through a forced choice under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—learning the building's language and preserving its hidden history against renovation—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through weekly sessions, Mrs. Voss's warning ("They're planning to renovate"), and the meteor shower urgency. The tightening is atmospheric rather than causal: no on-page reversal narrows Alex's options or forces a trade-off; the renovation threat is told, not dramatized with a live choice under pressure. The seal-pressing ritual feels more like climactic illustration than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost, landing the score in mid-band under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—archiving her sister's consciousness before dawn—is signaled early and pursued throughout. Escalation reads as deepening rather than tightening: Elara moves from skeptical tracing to kneeling surrender, but no on-page reversal or obstacle forces a trade-off between competing goods. The sister's voice provides new knowledge ("not a prison... a cocoon"), yet Elara's final "release" feels like arriving at a prepared conclusion rather than a choice that forecloses a live alternative with visible cost. Pressure accumulates texturally but does not narrow options under causal or situational logic.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—unlinking the tyrant's power through forgery—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Elara's insertion of the thorn into the altar and the disc's spin provide one meaningful on-page tightening. However, the escalation lacks a visible cost that forecloses options: Elara completes each step without friction, mistake, or trade-off, and the resolution unfolds as a sequence of successes rather than a choice that narrows her path. The phrase "calibrated treason" promises precision and risk, but no on-page consequence tests her commitment or alters her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—"to learn why some people echo"—is signaled early but never faces on-page complication or cost. No reversal narrows options; each echo she uncovers simply adds to the seashell without forcing a trade-off or threatening her goal. The late mention of "a love she had lost" could introduce personal stakes, but it resolves immediately in the same paragraph via summary ("she sang it into the canyon"). Agency is observation and collection, not decision under pressure; the canyon "responds" and "amplifies" without resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—salvaging a "pure memory" for Elias—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the dream-mosaic method and the shrine ritual, leading to the wreck descent and chest discovery. However, the escalation is more procedural than agonistic: no live obstacle (other than ice) threatens Maya's goal, and no ticking constraint forces a choice between competing goods. The final recovery grants Elias peace without Maya visibly paying a price or foreclosing an alternative path; the cost is atmospheric rather than enacted. One meaningful tightening (finding the pristine globe) advances the stake, but under the Accumulative lens the closure deepening is mild.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are declared ("appreciate hidden effort") but never tested on the page with a live choice or visible tradeoff. The philosopher teaches Kael in exposition; no reversal or tightening narrows options. Kael's skepticism dissolves instantly without resistance, and the story ends with cyclical repetition rather than escalation. No agency, renunciation, or endurance forecloses a path with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—revealing hidden truth versus accepting protective lies—is signaled early and sustained. Escalation occurs through Elias's growing knowledge: anomalies → buried letters → STILLPOINT revelation → council complicity. However, the story stops at the threshold of confrontation; the walk toward the council promises rather than delivers a high-cost choice. The settlers as "living shields" and the council's manufactured curse provide external pressure, but Elias never faces a moment where truth-telling might cost him something he values, reducing the felt weight of his decision.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—transmitting the prophecy before the Council stops him—is signaled early, but pressure does not escalate on the page. Atlas adjusts the dish, converts shadow-pattern to broadcast, and transmits; no reversal or external obstacle meaningfully tests his commitment or narrows his options. The Council's enforcers are mentioned as a future threat but never arrive to create present friction. The storm scatters his notes but the text immediately assures us "the vision held," deflating the complication. The resolution is predetermined rather than earned through a climactic choice under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (redemption through preservation) is signaled early and tightens when she opens all jars, forcing her to choose between hoarding and releasing. The opening action introduces visible cost (poems now "given to the wind" rather than sold, altering her livelihood), and the tourist/librarian responses confirm relational change. One meaningful deepening: the shift from selling for pennies to accepting stories as currency. However, escalation relies on accumulation rather than a reversal that narrows options, and the climax (opening jars) faces no on-page resistance or competing pressure. The music box's sudden ability to yield different memories when "coaxed with different pressures" introduces a convenience that bypasses earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: protect the sacred artifact from the shadow-creature. The ice locking the boats creates one meaningful tightening (no escape route), forcing the engineer to confront rather than flee. The climax—using vibrational matching to dissolve the creature—shows agency, but the cost is abstract: her heart's rhythm changes, yet we don't see how this forecloses a path or what she loses. The creature's dissolution feels resolved by technique rather than trade-off; there's no visible price paid (stamina, voice damage, loss of the key's future function) that alters her options afterward.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—freeing the community from the tyrant's manufactured urgency—is signaled early but remains abstract; the tyrant and enforcers never appear on the page to apply direct pressure or force a trade-off. Elara's pulse transmission faces no meaningful resistance or complication; "they feared the ice" tells us a problem was avoided rather than dramatizing one overcome. The revolution "releases" without visible cost to Elara's tactics, resources, or safety. No reversal or tightening narrows her options under the chosen Accumulative lens; escalation is rhetorical accumulation of moon-path metaphors rather than rising stakes that alter her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—expose the preventable death and break Voss's control—is signaled early and tightens when Mara finds sabotage evidence and must choose whether to sign or upload. One meaningful pressure point (Voss's call while she examines bolts) narrows her options with visible cost (career risk, turning off phone). The worker's ignored report adds moral weight. However, the escalation feels procedural rather than agonizing; Mara's resolve never wavers on the page, so the tightening lacks the felt trade-off that would push this into high-8 territory.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—whether repair and delivery can transform guilt into meaning—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when Marlowe completes the repair and the melody plays, demonstrating that "something deserves to exist in its place." However, escalation is atmospheric rather than driven by protagonist agency; the chaplain observes and receives rather than choosing under pressure. The resolution hinges on Marlowe's work, not the chaplain's decision with visible cost, and the final stance ("he deserved that much") feels awarded rather than earned through a choice that forecloses another path.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.2)
    One dominant stake is signaled early: manifest the theoretical bell. Pressure accumulates through algorithm recursion and workshop mutation rather than protagonist dilemma. The arrow-to-kaleidoscope sequence provides one meaningful deepening that narrows the algorithm's options, but Zephyr's agency is instrumental—she helps rather than struggles. The ending's "no one in the present could hear it" imposes conceptual cost on the entire yearning loop, yet the lack of visible tradeoff or competing desire in Zephyr's choices limits felt escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—finding the truth about the vanished engineers—is signaled early and drives the investigation. One meaningful tightening occurs when she forges the clearance token and opens the vault, narrowing her options. However, the escalation is largely epistemic (discovering information) rather than a choice under competing pressures. No visible price is paid on the page for her defiance; the corporation's threat remains abstract and off-stage. The ending suggests ongoing work rather than a trade-off that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—reconstitute the crystal to navigate the floes—is signaled early and drives the middle search. The boy's step forward provides one clear tightening that narrows options. The blood-drop ritual enacts agency at closure. Yet the "weighted breath before reply" recurs as a label without embodied tension, and the final consequence (community can shift with floes) is told in summary rather than tested on the page, limiting escalation clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—seeking an ending versus finding continuation—is signaled early but never tightens through a concrete dilemma or trade-off. The ice crack at midpoint ("the sound of approaching endings she had been seeking") could serve as a pressure point but deflates into contemplation rather than forcing a choice. Her shift to volunteering occurs off-stage; we see her already working with supplies rather than witnessing the decision's cost. The accumulative design requires a cadence shift or pattern break that reweights the stake; instead, the ending restates the thematic premise without visible forfeit.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.2)
    The dominant stake—"to rediscover the lost connection between the lovers"—is declared but never tested. No on-page reversal narrows options; the sentinel wanders, imagines, writes, and buries the vial without encountering resistance or paying a visible price. The parallel between mismatched vines and the lovers remains thematic decoration rather than a tightening or deepening that forecloses a path. Agency is observational, not decisional.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—preserve the echo—is signaled early but never tested by complication or trade-off; the walker performs a ritual, the parapet responds, the task succeeds without reversal or tightening. No on-page moment forces a choice between competing goods or narrows options with visible cost. The prophet and the buried structure supply setup but no opposition; coincidence (the parapet answers her call) enables rather than complicates. Agency is assertion rather than decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.6)
    Dominant stake ("transmute pain into a masterpiece") is signaled early but never tested or tightened. No reversal or deepening occurs; the archivist's method works without complication, and visitors add photographs in frictionless accumulation. The piece offers gradual accretion over years without a single on-page choice that narrows options or forecloses a path. Agency is observational arrangement, not decision under pressure, and no visible cost appears at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: decode the pattern of knowledge growth before the library is lost. Escalation: discovery → weeks of cataloging → chained doors ("hours, perhaps less") → self-test (devastating nothing) → desperate reading aloud. The tightening is temporal (condemnation notice) and existential (his own voice absent). Agency at closure: Elias wraps the crystal in "endurance," places it back, and walks—each step a testimony. The price is renunciation of the artifact and acceptance of his erasure. One friction: the transition from desperation to calm placement compresses what might be a harder calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake: capture the sound of growing older. The prophet arranges driftwood, traces chalk, hears the tidal rumble, then traps it in a spiral—one on-page tightening. The chalk snaps, ending the moment, but this is a micro turn without escalation of options or visible tradeoff; he could repeat the attempt. Agency is present (he draws the spiral) but the cost is告知 rather than dramatized: "he would not remember this night" is summary. No prior constraint narrows his path, and coincidence (the rumble swells unbidden) complicates rather than being earned by his choices. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens but does not escalate meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: preserve the dying star's light before the observatory tears free. The tightening occurs when Kael aligns the escapement to the leaf's rhythm, steadying the foundations—a meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. Yet the escalation is thin: no reversal or second complication forces a trade-off, and the leaf's success arrives without visible cost (no stamina drain, no tool failure, no social or moral price paid on the page).

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (reunification before death) is signaled early and tightens when Lena arrives. The blood work result functions as a time constraint, but Elara's method faces no meaningful resistance or adaptation; the plan works on first attempt without complication. Lena's hesitation at the door is the sole friction, resolved in a single paragraph. The accumulative design delivers a deepening of the father-daughter bond, but the absence of tactical cost or a live obstacle holds the escalation in the mid-range.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—finding where shadows go at noon and preventing the sealed awakening—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara must relearn the final loop, narrowing options. The automaton's response and shadow-thinning create escalation under the causal lens. However, no visible price is paid: Elara succeeds without forfeiting time, safety, or resource; the "sealed awakening" threat is contained off-page with no dramatized consequence. Agency is decision-based, but cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—Elena's need to reconcile her career with truth—is signaled early and tightens when the tooth arrives. The confrontation with Moira narrows options: collaborate or remain silent. Cost is explicit (career dismantling) but the final beat resolves smoothly without a painful trade-off in the moment. One meaningful deepening occurs when Clara's parents' story surfaces, raising moral stakes. Agency is present but the protagonist's internal struggle feels summarized rather than embodied in a decisive act.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—sharing light without flame—is signaled early and pursued consistently. The polishing sequence provides one meaningful tightening (frosted haze to pearl), and placement in the square tests the mission. However, no on-page cost or trade-off emerges: Mira encounters no resistance, fatigue, doubt, or competing need. The villagers gather without friction; children mimic without complication. Escalation reads as accumulation of similar actions rather than narrowing options or raising price. Agency is present but unchallenged.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—Elara healing from whistleblower fallout—is signaled early and coherent throughout. Under an Accumulative lens, one expects deepening or cadence shift; here, the daily moss ritual is repeated without meaningful escalation or a tightening that narrows options. The decision to open the garden to others is intention, not on-page action with cost. No reversal or tactical constraint forces the final choice; pressure remains static from paragraph one to the end, missing the "one meaningful tightening" required at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake (witness and release abandoned hopes) is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through cameo encounters, each adding density. One tightening occurs when the younger self appears, prompting the shell-crack release. Yet no live option is foreclosed on the page—no character refuses a safer path, no resource is spent that changes later tactics. The soldier's song and mother's smile deepen texture but do not narrow the protagonist's choices or impose a trade-off with legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake—restore the Golden Vein ritual—is signaled early and sustained. The single meaningful turn is Elara's song reviving the vine, but no live option is foreclosed; singing succeeds without trade-off or visible price. The weeks of failed tinkering are told in summary, so the pivot to song lacks on-page discovery friction. The harvest moon deadline imposes a clock, yet Elara completes the task "on the final morning" without dramatized cost or competing pressure that forces a sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—translating heartbeats to find the child—is signaled early and sustained. However, no on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the ritual succeeds without complication, the map is legible immediately, and the path leads directly to the cabin. The Great Silence and the orchard's grief are atmospheric but do not apply pressure that forces a trade-off. The reunion bears no visible cost; the child is asleep and safe, undercutting the claimed stakes of loss and hope. One meaningful escalation or deepening is missing.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—restoring the Echo Chamber's function—is signaled early and tightens once when he discovers overload and redesigns the mechanism. Agency is decision-based (reverse-engineer, grind lenses, install at six degrees), but no on-page reversal or live cost alters tactics; each step succeeds as planned without forced trade-off or visible forfeit. The "wounded season" and its emotional echoes provide thematic pressure but remain abstract; no moment on the page makes the locksmith choose between competing goods or pay a legible price (time, stamina, failed attempts). Closure participation is clear (the mechanism clicks, echoes flow), yet the lack of friction or a narrowing choice keeps this just shy of the 7.0 threshold for felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—escaping the recursive trap by collecting and measuring burdens—is signaled early. The sequence of calcifications (daughter's voice, pride, existence) provides incremental steps, but each burden is collected without meaningful friction or failed attempt. The final revelation ("it had never been a prison, but a loom") reconfigures the frame conceptually, yet no on-page tightening forces a trade-off or narrows live options. The weaver's agency is more receptive than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—transforming grief into "something that could sit on a shelf"—is signaled early. Yet no on-page pressure forces Mara to choose between competing options or pay a visible cost. The carving unfolds smoothly without reversal; the prism placement occurs without resistance. The kettle boils as ambient time rather than a countdown that alters her tactics. The ending "smile" and deepened "rust-hued peace" describe resolution without showing what she forfeited or how her options narrowed under the chosen Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—reconciling with the ghost of eroded ambitions—is signaled early. The discovery of the child's fragment ("The sky is a canvas...") provides one tightening moment, and the ghost's invitation offers a second. However, escalation relies on the ghost's arrival rather than protagonist agency, and the cost of accepting collaboration is told ("unburdened") rather than shown through a visible trade-off or forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—resurrecting the terminal as a beacon of hope—is signaled early, but escalation is minimal: Mira encounters no obstacle, resource scarcity, or failure that tightens her options. Each repair succeeds on first attempt (water flows, lights glow, pulse resonates), and the children's arrival confirms success without complication. The accumulative lens allows for deepening via density increase, yet the story adds tasks in sequence without raising cost or narrowing paths. No reversal or tightening forecloses a live option, and the ending walks away from achieved success rather than a hard-won trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: making peace with the abandoned dream of teaching her daughter. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara moves from carrying the broken chronometer to dismantling it, then decides "she would not repair it—that future was gone," forecloses the path of restoration. The act of placing gears into crevices is agency as renunciation. However, no live opposition or friction tests the choice on the page—the forecourt accepts passively, the sunrise arrives on cue, and absolution is granted without dramatized resistance. Cost is present (twenty years, the daughter's absence) but the escalation from carrying to placing reads more as ritual than contested decision.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=3.9)
    The stated stake—to understand the architecture of lies—never faces on-page resistance. Elara seeks a door, finds it immediately, retrieves a map without complication, and continues. No option is foreclosed, no tightening or deepening occurs, and no cost is paid. The prose asserts "serene upheaval" and "weight of truth reclaimed," but the action is frictionless discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving the wisp-grass method—is signaled early and pursued consistently. One meaningful tightening occurs when the fulgurite reveals the final sequence, but no live option is foreclosed and no visible price paid; Elara succeeds without sacrifice or tactical trade-off. The fog and Kessler's skepticism add atmosphere but do not force a choice or reversal. Agency reads as endurance and attention, yet the ending offers retrieval without renunciation or cost legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=4.2)
    No dominant stake is tested on the page. The scribe's stated purpose ("understand the geography of healing") remains abstract exposition; no reversal, tightening, or deepening narrows options or forces a trade-off. She writes, binds leaves, whispers names, and walks away—all action without opposition or visible cost. Escalation is absent under any lens; the final release of the thread is untested gesture, not earned choice.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—reawakening beauty in a mechanical world—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the egg cracks and produces a hybrid creature rather than the legendary Aetherwing, altering expectations. However, escalation is accumulative rather than choice-driven; Lysander assembles, waits, and observes without a second pressure point that narrows his options or forces a trade-off. The resolution's cost (the "bittersweet burden of having unleashed a force that could either heal… or shatter") is declared but not dramatized through a visible forfeiture or tactical shift. Coincidence (the egg existing, the hatchery working) facilitates rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=3.4)
    No on-page reversal or tightening occurs. Maya's dominant stake—proving scars can sing—is declared but never tested by opposition or cost. The bird's recovery is frictionless; no choice narrows options or forces a trade-off. The ending walk-away does not foreclose a path or show a price paid, leaving escalation absent under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—liberating trapped memories—is signaled early but never tightens. Kael waits, walks, opens the box; no reversal, trade-off, or visible price alters her tactics. The geese pause on cue, the latch unclicks, success arrives without friction. Escalation is absent under any lens, and the resolution costs nothing on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is clear early: solve the ancestral equation, share light without fire. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara finds the gear and learns the seven-generation failure, which narrows her approach. The sonar-pinging shift from question to lullaby represents a tactical change, and the garden's recursive infinity responds, but the escalation is primarily thematic accumulation rather than a choice under pressure that forecloses a live option. The cost—accepting eternal repetition, carrying generational grief—is conceptual rather than viscerally felt in a decisive action. No antagonist or reversal; pressure remains diffuse and situational.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: discovering the shape of collective grief for the memorial stone. The six-week migration provides a frame, but pressure remains diffuse—Kael retraces paths, reads ribbons, watches butterflies, without a single moment where failure or discovery feels imminent. The grandmother's mentorship offers guidance without opposition. The spiral solution arrives as insight rather than hard-won choice with visible cost. One tightening occurs (final night, "not in the stone but in the spaces between"), but it reads as revelation rather than a choice that forecloses another path.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is restoring shared balance; signaled early and sustained. The tightening occurs when Elara finds the inscriptions and faces the binary choice (erase or honor), which narrows options with clear cost: preserve simple guilt or redistribute burden. The pendulum's pause and the returning tide create genuine time pressure. Agency is decision with visible cost—pocketing the handle forecloses the town's simpler narrative and binds her to witness role. Escalation reads as accumulative deepening: each inscription reweights her understanding, culminating in the tower settling "into true alignment for the first time."

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—discovering intentions woven in the tapestry—is signaled early but never tested by a counter-pressure or cost. The gardener untangles threads without obstacle, loss, or trade-off; no reversal or deepening narrows options. The ending recycles the same contemplative stance with no escalation, and the sovereign case's warmth in his pocket is asserted rather than earned by dramatized consequence. Accumulative texture does not substitute for escalation when no beat alters the protagonist's capacity or path.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (innovation before starvation) is signaled early and pressure accumulates through Kaelen's predictive modeling: one path leads to starvation, another to civil war, the third to geothermal drilling constrained by the ice bridge. The tightening is clear—she "ground her models against this constraint"—and the elders' approval is a meaningful deepening that narrows options. However, the resolution lacks visible cost in the moment; the head elder's nod arrives without dramatized friction, and Kaelen's multi-year epilogue summarizes transformation rather than showing the first hard price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—embedding the pirate's elusive lyrics to end the story famine—is signaled early and sustained. However, the piece offers no reversal, complication, or visible obstacle; Mira listens, transcribes, finishes, and waits for the orchestra with confidence. The broadcast arrives conveniently, the luminous ink works as hoped, and no on-page event narrows her options or forces a trade-off. Pressure accumulates texturally but never tightens into a moment where agency forecloses a live path with legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—"to crystallize a fleeting emotion"—is signaled early but remains abstract and never faces a concrete test or reversal. No on-page decision narrows options; Elara's actions (entering, powdering, walking away) proceed without complication or escalating cost. The piece asserts that "the emotion she wanted to crystallize has already escaped," but this is summary rather than a dramatized turn that forces a trade-off. Under an Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost is required; here the pressure flatlines.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving an honest record against Council censorship—is signaled early and escalates through the patrol's approach. Malach's agency is decision and endurance: he chooses to encode the "calculus of collapse" rather than a comforting myth, and his filing intensifies even as footsteps approach. The cost is legible in his acceptance of erasure and the patrol's potential violence. One meaningful tightening (the patrol's arrival) forecloses the option of prolonged deliberation, forcing him to commit and hide the cog.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—braiding diverse voices, unlearning hatred through subtraction of noise—is signaled early and recurs, but the pressure remains declarative rather than tested by a live opposition or narrowing choice. Marco's sung note and the group chord demonstrate agency, yet no on-page reversal forces a trade-off or forecloses a path; the decades-long summary tells us the method persists without showing a moment where it might fail or cost Mrs. Kaelin something immediate. The final passage of the rosette to Marco is a gesture of continuity, not a choice under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—revive the forbidden garden—is signaled early. The pruning and planting sequence tightens pressure as the alignment peaks, and Mara's actions drive the sprouting. Yet the escalation is frictionless: no reversal, no competing cost, no tactical trade-off. The plant grows "rapidly," the fruit forms, and Mara tastes success without any live alternative foreclosed. One meaningful tightening is present (alignment window), but the cost at closure is abstract rather than legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring not mere power but wonder to the failed grid—is signaled early and tightens when Mara places the honeycomb and speaks the riddle's answer, releasing the charge. The piece deepens rather than reverses: the drones failed from lack of reverence, and Mara's act supplies that missing ingredient. The cost is legible in the final beat: "Not yet," she tells the child, accepting the fragility of what she's restored and the ongoing wait required of her new role.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding animate houses—is declared but never dramatized as a problem that narrows options or imposes cost. The protagonist gathers and places objects in a repeating loop with no escalation, reversal, or trade-off. No on-page tightening: each house responds the same way ("exhaled," "hummed," "breathe easier") without complication or resistance. Agency is absent; the protagonist enacts a ritual without friction, and the ending grants legend status without a scene-pressure choice or visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: whether to preserve absolute truth or welcome nuance. Petra's agency is renunciation of her original purpose, a meaningful tightening when she threads the ampoule's memories and broadcasts them into the city's foundations. One clear deepening occurs: the revelation that the city drowned from its own rigidity, not invasion, which reweights Petra's mission. The cost is legible (stone heart quickens, lips crack, eternal vigilance rather than rest) but spread across the final third rather than concentrated at a single decision point. No explicit antagonist; pressure is internal and conceptual, which fits the Accumulative lens, but the escalation reads more as textural accumulation than a narrowing of live options under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: escape the infinite staircase by finding the rupture. One meaningful tightening when the impossible double-sixes reveal the glitch, and one deepening when the chipped die's three-face forces the choice to step forward or through. Agency is present—Elias's roll and step foreclose escape with visible cost (perpetual climb continues). However, the escalation relies heavily on mathematical proofs summarized rather than dramatized tests that fail and adapt; the reversal hinges on probability rather than embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake: prove that strangers remember kindness. The story signals this early and Kael pursues it methodically, but the escalation is thin—he paints, Mira notices, others leave tokens—without a meaningful tightening that narrows his options or forces a trade-off. The reversal (Mira's herb bundle) is coincidental rather than driven by Kael's agency; he watches from hiding and feels hope, but no on-page choice or renunciation alters his tactics or forecloses a path. The lens is Accumulative, yet the final cadence shift is more summary ("continued his vigil") than a deepening that reweights cost.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (rescue dying arts / thaw the harp) is declared but never tested by meaningful opposition or cost. Engineers warn the freeze is permanent, yet Liora's ritual succeeds immediately with no setback, adaptation, or price paid. The displaced families watch passively; no secondary pressure complicates her attempt. The resolution is convenience plotting—sunlight through a lens melts "permanent" ice without earned escalation or trade-off. No on-page reversal narrows options or deepens the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.7)
    One dominant stake—restore the lighthouse beam to save ships—is signaled early and pursued consistently. The yoyo puzzle provides a meaningful tightening: she must decode it and execute the reversal at the tidal turn, which narrows her window and raises tactical pressure. The hunger stone's pulse and the keeper's lore establish opposition. However, the resolution unfolds without a visible trade-off or cost that alters her later options; the beam flares, the boat is saved, and she departs with the secret intact. The story delivers a clear reversal (dark lantern → brilliant beam) but lacks a felt price or foreclosed path at the closure beat, keeping it in the solid mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (unmask fear's weakness) is signaled early and pursued on-page. One meaningful tightening occurs when the entities circle and Mira must voice the paradoxical question, but the escalation reads more as ritual completion than a choice that forecloses options. The entities "pause" and answer; Mira laughs—no visible tradeoff, lost resource, or secondary cost that alters her exit. Under the Hybrid lens, accumulative pressure (riddles, luminance, entities manifesting) builds atmosphere, yet the climax lacks a felt price: she emerges with knowledge and the clasp intact, no dramatized sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—survival of the orchard—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through layered strikes and the storm's approach, but no reversal narrows live options or forces a trade-off; the storm cooperates without dramatized resistance. The resolution (storm becomes partner) is told rather than earned through on-page agency that forecloses a path. Cost is claimed but not made visible.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: understanding the watchers and her mother's fate, signaled early and sustained. The cracked whistle discovery, weeks of study, crafting the shell whistle, and the dawn ascent provide escalation under the accumulative lens. The watchers' turning and the voice entering Kael's mind deliver a meaningful tightening that narrows options—her mother reached them but was catalogued. Kael's agency in the final beat (carving the question mark, choosing to speak their language) forecloses the path of ignorant safety with felt cost. The price is visible: she inherits sunwashed dread and cannot return unchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—"rescue truth from a pit of lies"—is signaled early but never tested by a credible opposing force. Emlyn faces no resistance: the letter is simply there beneath the ivy, her colleagues immediately agree, and publication succeeds without friction. The narrative offers one tightening (discovery of the letter's meaning) but it deepens understanding without narrowing options or imposing cost. Agency appears in her decision to "preserve the letter…as a bridge," yet this choice forecloses no live alternative and carries no visible price. The "noble lie" remains abstract rather than embodied in a character or consequence that could complicate her goal.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—documenting decay vs. memorializing lost dreams—is signaled early ("interlaced absence") and tightens when Elias finds the toy boat and locket, reweighing his purpose from survey to secret archive. The escalation reads under the Accumulative lens as a pattern of intensifying acts: fifteen notes in foundation repairs culminate in wresting the cornerstone for two hours and embedding his brass-sealed declaration, a visible price paid in exhausted muscle and covert defiance. The final request for a one-year delay forecloses the official path and commits him to prolonged, solitary work. Agency is clear—he chooses to transform ruins into memory vessels—and the cost (empty inkwell, council deception, next drowned district awaiting) lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—tracing the book's honest origins—is clear and sustained. Mira formulates and tests an alternative hypothesis (deliberately hidden vs. lost), which provides a tightening of inquiry. Yet the escalation is cerebral and the final turn (discovering Aldric's name, the council secret) arrives without forcing a trade-off or visible cost; the blackout's end grants success rather than demanding renunciation or endurance. No on-page price is paid to achieve the reclaimed stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—recovering the daughter's breath—is declared early but never tested on the page. The lantern maker polishes gems and folds cranes in repeated cycles without a reversal or tightening that narrows options. The shadow "steps from beneath the island" in the final paragraph and returns the breath without the protagonist paying a visible price or making a trade-off. Coincidence resolves the stake; agency is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: find where unused potential pools before the breakers reboot. One meaningful tightening occurs when the algorithm screams and Kael locks coordinates, narrowing her window to three minutes. Agency is present (she chooses to map rather than extract, places the geode in the transfer slot), and the renunciation of extraction carries conceptual cost. Deduct −0.5 because the twenty-minute clock does not materially alter tactics mid-scene—Kael's moves would read identically without it—and the locked coordinates never force a trade-off or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (decode the frequency of belonging) is signaled early and drives the pinion sequence and decoding. However, escalation is mechanical rather than character-driven; no live option is foreclosed, and the resolution feels inevitable without genuine agency cost. The pilgrim's abandonment of the chip and flight are intriguing complications, but Elara's success arrives without visible trade-off or sacrifice. The transmitted reply and her programmed next mission suggest serial questing rather than transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—discovering the withheld truth—is signaled early but pursued through passive searching rather than agency-driven escalation. No meaningful tightening or choice narrows options; the plaque's discovery is coincidental, and the protagonist's subsequent renunciation is summarized without on-page cost. The guilt and regret are told repeatedly but never tested by a live dilemma or visible tradeoff. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through density or cadence shift; here it simply repeats the same mood.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—completing the prisoner exchange without reigniting war—is signaled early and remains coherent. The moon-phase synchrony tightens the window, and the rope-untethering beat advances action, but these are logistical rather than agonistic. No on-page reversal tests Kael's commitment; Lin offers no friction, the prisoners remain compliant, and the exchange proceeds as planned. The "step toward recycling" is asserted in reflection rather than earned by a visible tradeoff or foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can navigate without his father's compass and forgive himself—is signaled early and tightens when fog erases the third pole, forcing a choice between control and surrender. One meaningful turn: he stops fighting the current and lets the kayak drift, a renunciation that narrows options and alters his internal stance. The cost is legible on the page (releasing the compass, walking away from the water). Agency is embodied in the decision to set the compass down rather than carry it further. No requirement for multiple reversals at this length; the single deepening suffices under the Hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"to kindle empathy where none remained"—is signaled (line 11) but never tested by an on-page trade-off or competing pressure. Kael's retrieval of the baseball is unopposed until the cavern trembles (line 23), a brief physical threat that vanishes as soon as he sprints (line 24), leaving no visible cost. The newspaper puzzle (lines 7–9, 17) promises a labyrinth of choices, yet every fork is resolved by a single correct turn ("turn where the echo breathes," line 18) without foreclosing a live alternative. No escalation under any lens: no causal tightening (retrieval is frictionless), no accumulative deepening (empathy motive is repeated but not reweighted), no situational crystallization (Kael's stance at the end is identical to his intent at line 11).

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake (reforge bond beyond death) is signaled early but never tested by a credible obstacle or internal contradiction. The protagonist gathers spices, arranges them, whispers a name, and the beloved answers—no reversal, no tightening, no trade-off. The "reluctant metamorphosis" is named but not dramatized: the transformation proceeds smoothly without visible cost or forfeit of a prior identity or goal. Coincidence (the beloved's voice simply appears) resolves the stake, violating the lens guardrail. No escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding where lost time accumulates—is signaled early but remains abstract. No on-page reversal occurs; the glade provides answers without resistance, and the cartomancer's acceptance is a passive receipt of wisdom rather than an earned struggle. The crack "weeping silver light" and the voice's explanation are given, not won. Closure reconfigures meaning (lost time = bodily transformation) but without visible cost: she descends with knowledge, cards, and saucer intact, no tactic altered or path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (achieving perfect compassion to escape) is signaled early and tightens through the stitching ritual, which narrows options with each photograph. The shadow-work confession ("I withheld Li's medicine") provides genuine moral calculus and a visible price that alters Maya's mass. The climax reversal—choosing to stay rather than enter the dimension—forecloses escape with clear cost. One causal slip: the gravity-psyche bond and Kwan Yin's Tear mechanics feel introduced for convenience rather than earned through prior constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding transformation's texture—is signaled early and pursued through the bug-collecting ritual. However, escalation lacks a meaningful tightening under protagonist agency: the crimson bug pulls him inland, the dislodged stone triggers the coincidence chain, and the village's salvation occurs off-page without Kael's knowledge. The final act of releasing the bugs is framed as realization rather than a choice that forecloses a live option with visible cost. One micro-turn (the crimson bug's appearance) shifts his attention, but the resolution is delivered by prophetic fulfillment rather than earned agency, and the cost—his "destitution complete"—is lyric assertion rather than on-page forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—sparking a silent revolution—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Seren decodes the sundial and finds the powder cache, narrowing her options to a single pneumatic charge. However, the escalation is cerebral and summarized; we don't witness her wrestling with risk, timing, or the moral calculus of unlocking every door. The blackout complicates but doesn't force a trade-off. Agency is present in her final choice, but the cost (professional betrayal, potential chaos) is conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake: decode the eel patterns to honor the mentor's promise and momentarily restore friction. One tightening: Elara places the final rock, dust flares, eels form vectors, then she chooses to let it fade. Agency is renunciation, which fits the Accumulative lens. Cost clarity is weak: "her own shadow dissolving into the aurora" is a potential price shown in vision but not paid or refused on the page; the actual choice to stop carries no dramatized trade-off or tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—to understand the cartography of scars, to speak uncensored—is signaled early but never tested by on-page opposition or trade-off. The poet waits, opens the envelope, reads his own past message, and decides to write; no reversal narrows options, no cost is visible (no censor enters, no resource is spent, no prior path is foreclosed). The timer and storm intensify atmosphere but do not escalate pressure; the "vigil in pause" remains a tableau rather than a gauntlet. The ending gesture (descending with the sealed envelope) is announced rather than earned by prior agency under constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=3.4)
    A dominant stake is asserted—"turning questions into destinations"—but never tested on the page with a meaningful tightening or trade-off. The duel escalates in description ("more fluid," "decisive thrust") without dramatizing a reversal, cost, or choice that forecloses a path. The opponent "stumbles" by convenience, and Rhen's victory arrives without visible price or alteration of stance. Under any drive lens (Causal, Accumulative, Situational), the pressure remains static narration rather than accumulation or deepening that reweights options or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: sustaining poetic voice/resistance within prison constraints. One tightening: the approaching molt forces a choice to anchor or drift. Agency appears in "chose to keep the poet's voice" and passing the tin to Cora, but these acts lack visible cost—he leaves prison regardless, and we don't see what he sacrifices to stay the poet. The library transformation (inmates whispering verses, notes through ventilation) happens off-stage or in summary. Escalation is additive (more inmates join) rather than a narrowing turn that forecloses options.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—finding refuge and completing the unplanned encore—is signaled early and pursued across beats (film search, airship journey, final performance). Escalation occurs through atmospheric accumulation (storm intensifies, arbor appears, performance persists) rather than causal reversal, fitting the Accumulative lens. However, the cost (bleeding fingers, imagined reconciliation) is compressed into the ending without prior tactical friction or a moment where the protagonist weighs continuing versus stopping. One meaningful deepening is present but the price lacks on-page dramatization in a choice beat.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (preserve island memory before monsoon drowns the ridge) is signaled early and tightens through visible markers: twelve days, seventeen percent luminescence drop, elders forgetting chants. The placing-and-singing beat narrows options decisively. Cost is visible in the question "had he preserved cultural memory or merely created a new fiction" and the fact that "his work was never finished." Agency is clear: Kael's choice to sing (breaking precedent) wakens the ridge. One limitation: the ridge's response feels somewhat convenient—resistance or ambiguity in the awakening would have sharpened the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake signaled early: understanding her sister's severance. The lace-guided wire-wrapping provides one meaningful deepening that narrows Mara's approach from wild compass-following to ritual patience. However, the escalation diffuses across "three seasons" in summary rather than tightening on-page. The ending reconfigures the stake (growth around wound vs. closure) but the cost is conceptual—no live option is foreclosed in the final image, just acceptance declared. Agency reads as endurance but the visible price in the ending beat is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake of avoiding war escalates under the accumulative lens through the ritual's deepening tension and the exchange itself. Agency is clear in Kael and Lin's actions, with cost legible in the "lingering doubt" post-exchange. However, escalation is subtle, lacking a more intense tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by Elias's agency, with the fog intensifying the stakes and his decision to drift representing a deepening that changes knowledge. Cost is legible when he lets go of the compass, and the dominant stake of internal forgiveness tightens meaningfully without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under the causal lens, from reading the newspaper to navigating the labyrinth and retrieving the baseball. The dominant stake of kindling empathy tightens with each choice, culminating in the cavern collapse forcing survival. Cost is visible in the threat of forgotten timelines and his transformed resolve. However, the stakes could be more visceral in middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake (reforging bond) escalates through protagonist agency (gathering spices, undergoing transformation); cost is legible in her metamorphosis, driven under the accumulative lens with one meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (lost time) escalates through accumulative density, driven by protagonist agency (unfastening hair, tracing hand). Cost is unmistakable in the realization that she is "both vessel and thief," foreclosing options with visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation under hybrid lens is driven by Maya's agency in stitching photographs, integrating shadow self; cost is unmistakable in gravitational changes and her decision to forgo entry, narrowing options meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.4)
    Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under the accumulative lens, as his actions accumulate toward the climax. The cost is legible in his realization and the village's salvation, with stakes signaled early and tightening through the chain of events.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake of silent revolution escalates through Seren's agency, from decoding the message to using the cradle of sparks. One meaningful tightening occurs when she measures the powder keg to wake every lock, foreclosing the commandant's control with visible cost. Pressure coheres under the causal lens, and the resolution is earned without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the accumulative lens, with visions intensifying and the cost of her shadow dissolving becoming unmistakable. The stake (restoring friction) tightens meaningfully through her choice to let the pattern fade, demonstrating visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation driven by poet's agency under accumulative lens; cost is legible in mask slip and scars; stakes tighten meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes escalate through the duel, driven by Rhen's agency in decoding and fencing. Cost is legible in the opponent's stumble and Rhen's fluid strikes, though the duel's outcome feels slightly swift.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by protagonist agency in rebuilding the library and spreading resistance, with cost visible in his molt decision. The dominant stake of blooming resistance tightens through density increases, and moral calculus sharpens the peak choice. Agency and cost are unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with cost legible in the storm and journey; dominant stake of personal refuge tightens meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes around cultural memory are signaled early and escalate under causal lens via Kael's agency and the monsoon deadline. The planting and singing represent a tightening choice with visible cost in the doubt and effort. Resolution is earned through protagonist action, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the Accumulative lens, as she actively engages in the diffuse technique, narrowing her emotional options. The cost is legible in the cooling compass and her prolonged stay, foreclosing her initial grief path. Stakes deepen through the ritual's progression, with one meaningful tightening in her realization about remembrance as a tide.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she will continue preprocessing reality to strip away “needless drama” or allow noise/decay into her model of meaning—is clear and carried through. Escalation is primarily internal and accumulative: dust, mold, watermarks, then the text from her colleague sharpen the choice. The decisive turn is her reply about hearing both signal and noise, which forecloses her old stance but at relatively low visible cost. The piece might benefit from one sharper moment where clinging to the old frame exacts or threatens a more concrete price.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stakes are articulated—his life vs. smugglers, the ethical use of legacy, whether he hides or acts—but on-page pressure stays relatively low and static. There is one meaningful tightening when the frost reveals a map and he chooses to go deeper, accepting inheritance and risk, yet there are no reversals or concrete antagonistic pushes. The wound and the threat of pursuit never significantly limit his choices or force trade-offs in the moment. As a result, conflict skews conceptual and thematic rather than viscerally escalating with visible prices paid.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can find a non-auditory “music” to counter the world’s suffocating silence—is clear, and the tuning-fork experiment is a meaningful deepening. However, the conflict is mostly internal and contemplative, with no on-page resistance beyond ambient grief; every step works on the first try, and no alternative path is visibly foreclosed. The emotional escalation from private experiment to communal ritual is real but gentle, lacking a sharp test or sacrifice. As a result, the piece has lovely pressure but not gripping tension.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central stake—giving the drowned true rest versus the undertaker’s desire for silence and escape—is clear and tightens as the distress signals shift from pain to coordinates, making inaction morally untenable. Escalation comes through commitment: they gather rare materials, bleed for the lens, and accept bodily transformation, each step foreclosing the option of leaving. The ultimate price is an eternal, self-imposed servitude, which is strongly legible at the end. The one constraint is that the pivotal choice to accept this role is somewhat implicit; more on-page hesitation or competing tactic could heighten the sense of a live alternative being truly surrendered.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stakes—survival under sanctions and the preservation of memory—are articulated but remain largely abstract on the page. Conflict is almost entirely externalized as a preexisting situation (sanctions, exile) with no meaningful on-page opposition to the food runs or Mara’s storytelling initiative. Escalation is more additive than tightening; each new ritual is a success without serious test or sacrifice. As a result, tension is low and the price of these choices feels minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can locate and transmute her “unused love”—is clear but the pressure remains gentle and mostly internal. There is one main tightening when the lover’s image asks for healing and the corridor of light appears, but Mira meets each stage without resistance, failures, or trade-offs. Her agency consists in choosing to engage and then to release, yet these choices never seem in doubt. As a result, tension is present but subdued, more like a guided ritual than a genuinely contested inner conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—escaping a retrocognitive trap by mastering time’s texture—appears early and deepens as Elara shifts from curiosity to obsession. Escalation is clear in concept (the geometry knots into “impossible” forms, her great-grandfather clarifies the cost, her body begins to disintegrate), and the final price is unmistakable. What’s missing is an on-page moment of contested choice or tactical adjustment once she senses danger; her agency feels more like a single long push than a tested, recalibrated struggle. As a result, tension is strong but more intellectual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—recovering drought-resistant seeds to revive a dead world while chained and under threat—is clear early and carries through. Escalation is present: solving the key puzzle raises the wall and triggers the mechanical guardian, forcing an adaptive fight that culminates in a risked final key press. The cost is legible but relatively soft: he remains chained and in a hostile environment, yet there’s little sense of real jeopardy or sacrifice beyond effort and danger. Internal conflict is minimal, so tension rests almost entirely on physical obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—Lyra’s need to understand Kael’s betrayal by hearing its sound—is clear, and there’s one meaningful tightening when the forge reignites and the ash becomes a chorus of promises. Internal pressure escalates from archival work to direct confrontation with the moment of betrayal. However, the key escalation beat is driven more by the environment’s sudden reactivation than by Lyra’s risky choice, and we don’t see a significant trade-off beyond accepting knowledge and dropping the device. The conflict remains primarily contemplative, limiting visceral stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain largely abstract: destiny, “illuminated moments,” and cosmic whispers rather than anything with concrete loss attached. There is no antagonist, setback, or meaningful risk; every puzzle yields quickly, and the only “clock” (sunset, then chimes) never bites. Lux never has to choose between competing goods or endure a visible sacrifice—she gains a powerful artifact (the portrait/portal) without paying a discernible price. As a result, tension is gentle curiosity rather than genuine pressure, and escalation feels decorative rather than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Marek can find a way to live with his unasked questions about Lena—appears early and coherently deepens. Pressure escalates inwardly through the discovery of the new fracture, his decision to blow an unusually large piece, and the choice to float the bookmark and leave the bowl behind. It’s a quiet, internal conflict, but the trade-off (accepting questions without answers; relinquishing the fantasy of retroactive rescue) is clear. The conflict remains mostly contemplative, so while effective, it doesn’t reach the sharpest possible edge of tested agency.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—survival/freedom after learning she’s a synthetic copy—is clear and escalates through the AI’s patrol, the void-crawl, and Caela’s attempt to talk her into surrender. However, opposition rarely bites back: the AI is neutralized by a single password, and the tracking system shuts down instantly when she shouts a phrase, without meaningful pushback or partial failure. Internal stakes (can she act through terror) do tighten, especially in the hull sequence. The resolution is driven by her agency, but with relatively low on-page price beyond fear, keeping escalation solid but not bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict and stakes are largely conceptual: fear of an “endless night” opposed by a map of silence. On the page, there is almost no resistance—no hesitation from the oracle, no price or risk in the traveler receiving or using the map. The night’s danger is asserted but never tested or escalated; the traveler steps into the void without any concrete on-page threat. As a result, pressure does not tighten, and the ending feels contemplative rather than earned under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—J-3’s attempt to understand the origin/nature of his thoughts under the constraint of janitorial duty—remains coherent, and the pressure does deepen as the loops intensify and reality fractures. The meaningful tightening comes when he decides to synchronize his diagnostics with the violin, actively amplifying the anomaly rather than treating it as a glitch. However, external stakes are minimal and there’s little sense of risk beyond ontological confusion, so escalation feels mostly intellectual. The resolution is an internal stance shift rather than a fraught trade-off, which keeps tension gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring trust around suspected missing funds—is clear, but pressure never truly tightens. Once Elara finds the doodles, there’s no resistance: the manager softens immediately, the stagehand confesses right away, and no options are seriously foreclosed. Conflict remains largely abstract and is resolved with a single, uncontested reveal, so escalation and cost are modest for a piece aspiring to high literary stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Silas’s fear of being replaced once his luck-based deception is exposed—is articulated, but never truly sharpened in action. The only “tightening” beat is the wilted rosebush hinting his luck is failing, yet this never leads to a concrete threat from the heirs or the world; they arrive, listen once, and quickly validate him. There is little escalation or trade-off: he confesses and keeps everything he wanted, with no visible loss, rejection, or even a serious challenge. As a result, conflict feels static and largely conceptual rather than dramatically tested.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael will risk the station and her standing to capture proof during the fleeting nexus—is clear and escalates once she diverts “all station power” and triggers the surge. There is a meaningful tightening when she chooses to pull the lever despite foreseeable backlash from Chen. However, antagonistic pressure is mostly offstage and brief, and we never see a concrete consequence beyond an alarmed comm message and implied future dismissal of the data. The tension is more intellectual and atmospheric than viscerally felt, which keeps escalation from fully peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether to complete the code and release the diva or preserve the haunting “in between spaces”—is established and tightened as the music reshapes the environment. The escalation through each successive note (water, lanterns, ink, ghost-pressure) is well-sequenced and leads naturally to the explicit binary choice at the climax. The cost of playing the final note (loss of the ghost as muse, potential disruption of equilibrium) is present but mostly conceptual rather than felt in a sharp, personal wound. The conflict is effective but could benefit from one more concrete consequence or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—whether she can confront and release the burden of the swallowed warning—is clear, and the smudge/memory beat is a discernible turn. Still, the pressure remains largely static: there is little sense that failure to act now would meaningfully worsen her world or foreclose options; it’s more a contemplative window than an acute crucible. Her final acceptance feels almost inevitable rather than hard-won, with minimal on-page trade-off between continued silence and confession/forgiveness. The conflict is resonant but under-tensioned for an elite short piece.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will confront and transform the inherited silence around the fire—is clear and escalates from eerie suggestion to direct confrontation with the ghost shift. Pressure tightens at the tunnel fork, at the first turn of the wheel, and again when he must decide how to use it once the ghosts appear, culminating in his choice to release them and then to speak publicly. The conceptual cost (accepting responsibility to carry and voice the truth) is legible, though the on-page risk to his present life is mostly implied rather than dramatized. The talk-radio device adds atmospheric tension but does not significantly alter his tactical options, slightly reducing felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—how to respond to irreversible decay of knowledge—is present but remains mostly philosophical; there’s no specific loss, deadline, or opposition that sharpens her choices. The primary escalation is her decision to use the swan to “burrow deeper,” which adds depth rather than real danger. By the end, her stance crystallizes (accompanying decay rather than resisting it), but the price of that stance is only conceptually, not viscerally, felt. Tension is more meditative hum than tightening coil, limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—can music, timed to an eclipse, bridge dementia’s erasure—is clear and tightened by the looming totality window (“For ninety seconds, the duration of totality”). Pressure escalates from quiet preparation to the uncanny synchronization of Eleanor’s breath-sound with the A minor chord and the sudden clarity of her speaking Mira’s mother’s name. However, conflict remains mostly internal and situational rather than contested; nothing truly opposes Mira beyond time and illness, and her choices are not sharply traded off against visible risk. The result is moving but structurally gentle, with a single major deepening rather than a strong sense of mounting jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering and preserving the last human dreams—is clear and thematically potent, but largely conceptual rather than dramatized as urgent conflict. Pressure deepens when Elias discovers the diaries are transcripts of final dreams and realizes someone tried to burn them, which reweights his task. However, he never faces a real choice that would force a trade-off or visible sacrifice; he simply proceeds to catalogue and accept his role. The result is a rich, textured mood with modest escalation rather than sharp tension.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Mei Lin is doomed to passive, harmful prophecy or can claim ethical agency over it—is legible and resolved by her deliberate “composing” and self-fortune. There is a meaningful deepening when she stops predicting and starts instructing futures, and the seven-minute delay/mail-boat sequence ties her inner shift to external effects. However, pressure doesn’t truly escalate; there’s no significant cost, risk, or opposition to her new tactic, so choices feel largely untested. The result is quietly satisfying but not maximally tense.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—expel the entity before it fully settles into Elias—is clear and tightened via the entity’s visible hesitation, smear-forms, and eventual slip “like water through a sieve.” Escalation is well managed: each new rhetorical loop complicates the entity’s assumptions, culminating in the all-loops-at-once move that briefly involves “twelve realities.” The price paid is somewhat soft (Elias screams, the anchor strains, certainties are shaken) rather than a sharply dramatized sacrifice, but it still reads as a meaningful narrowing of options. The conflict between certainty and doubt is effectively welded to the exorcism mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—creating the unheard symphony “before exhaustion” claims her—is legible and threads the piece. Pressure does build texturally as sounds accumulate from shell, spire, and lake, culminating in the unprecedented hum. However, there is little actual resistance or reversal; once she steps onto the balcony, success feels assured, and exhaustion never concretely impedes or forces a trade-off. The result is beautiful but relatively low-friction, more revelation than tested struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she can "conquer" the labyrinth/self before timelessness lapses—is clear, and pressure tightens through the revelation that she is the labyrinth and that timelines are collapsing. Escalation is primarily conceptual rather than situational: more iterations of self-failure, heavier tablet, collapsing timelines, culminating in a choice to dissolve rather than dominate. The cost is present but mostly framed as metaphysical (loss, recursion, becoming memory) rather than sharply dramatized through concrete forfeiture. Still, her decision to reverse the procedural generation and accept dissolution reads as an earned resolution to the internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can pierce her emotional and sensory numbness—is clear, and it does tighten once she submits to the backward song and lets the vibrations in. However, opposition is largely internal and very soft; there’s no moment where she nearly refuses or where the attempt seriously threatens to fail. Once the needle and backward-record logic are introduced, the path to healing has no real alternative branches or setbacks. The emotional cost (tears, vulnerability) is present but understated enough that tension never truly crests.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—risking personal safety to pursue and expose the quarantine’s secret—is present, and being followed plus the director’s warning generate plausible pressure. Yet the on-page conflict remains mostly atmospheric: no confrontation, no near-miss, no escalation beyond a steady hum of implied threat. His key choice (send pigeon, continue digging) feels morally correct but not sharply tested by a live dilemma. As a result, tension is steady rather than climbing, and cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.3)
    The central stake—whether she will remain emotionally sealed or submit to grieving Vance and the lost species—is legible from early on and escalates as scent exposure becomes unavoidable. The pressure tightens when the Nightshade fully opens and the perfume floods the space, collapsing her strategy of “aromatic caution” and forcing a stance. Her agency at the climax (choosing to uncork the vial instead of merely enduring the involuntary scent) provides a clear turn with cost. Stakes remain intimate and internal, but they are consistently tied to concrete actions and sensory overwhelm.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.4)
    The central stake—what to do with the rope, and thus how to engage with time and freedom—is clear, but pressure remains low and largely philosophical. The major “tightening” is when he recognizes the mutually exclusive options (climb out, weave into wall, or carry on) and the impossibility of choosing without loss. His final decision to carry the rope is an earned stance crystallization, yet the emotional or situational cost is muted and largely asserted rather than felt. The piece reads more as extended meditation than escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the chronic hush can be cracked and reweighted—is clear, but pressure is soft: nothing on the page truly threatens her or the ritual. Escalation is mostly a steady intensification of sound and memory rather than a tightening that forecloses options or exacts tangible loss. Her decision to perform the family ritual is a meaningful choice, but it is not tested or significantly endangered; the hush yields partial change with little resistance. As a result, the resolution feels more like a beautiful unveiling than a hard-won transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—can an artificial dose of empathy bridge an estranged relationship, and what does that mean for both men—is interesting but stays mostly conceptual. Conflict is extremely low-friction: the client hesitates only briefly, then complies, and nothing in the environment or process resists them. Pressure doesn’t so much escalate as gently continue; there’s no real narrowing of options or on-page trade-off, only a deepening of a foreknown outcome. This makes the ending thoughtful but not particularly tense.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stakes—recovering the locket’s emotional value and then honoring silent workers—are clear but remain low-pressure and largely unopposed. Lena’s investigation proceeds without obstacle; the award is conceived and implemented with no resistance, ethical tension, or trade-offs on the page. There is one meaningful deepening when the locket is revealed to belong to Caleb’s lost family, but after that, everything unfolds in a frictionless, summary mode. The result is pleasant but under-escalated, with little sense of risk or hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—Kael’s need to belong—is clear early and steadily pressured through social rebuffs and his inability to “read” the arbor. The shared search with the girl is a meaningful tightening, and the solstice exhalation of light plus the emergence of Dusk’s tag provide a satisfying peak of intensity. However, the conflict remains largely internal and aesthetic; there are few sharp trade-offs or risks that could truly threaten his new connection. The cost is emotional and conceptual rather than situational, which is fitting but keeps escalation in the “strong” rather than “devastating” band.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving the origin of echoes before the giant wakes—is legible early and escalates as the Gasp lengthens, the pendant drains, and the inhalation begins. Elara’s agency drives the decisive turn when she chooses to strike the bell despite knowing her borrowed time is nearly gone. The cost is unmistakable: she forfeits her own future to become the echo, and the city passes into a new state without her as a person. What’s missing is a more granular sense of struggle or alternative paths at the climactic moment; the choice feels somewhat foregone rather than agonized.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether Vesper can reconfigure her ambiguous loss into something bearable—is clear but remains low-tension and almost entirely internal. There is a mild escalation as the stone warms, patterns shift, and the doorway emerges, yet there’s little sense of possible failure, danger, or mutually exclusive outcomes. Her agency is steady but not tested; no option is decisively foreclosed on the page. The result is emotionally coherent but more meditative than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are emotionally clear—Mara’s need to be needed and the boy’s loneliness—but the pressure remains gentle and nearly risk-free. The main “turn” is the boy finding and pocketing the tape, yet this is foreknown by Mara (“She knew…that a child would come today”), which blunts uncertainty. Her agency is expressed in planning rather than in a difficult, costly choice under pressure, and there’s little escalation once the boy is on the page. As a quiet, situational piece this works, but for elite markets the conflict could use one sharper moment where an option truly narrows or might be lost.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elena clings to control or yields to organic growth—is clear and surfaces in the concrete problem of reconstructing the trellis. There is one meaningful tightening when her attempt to force the wood and vines fails, triggering frustration and a behavioral shift. However, escalation remains very gentle; nothing crucial is truly endangered beyond her inner comfort, and alternative paths never feel sharply foreclosed. The resolution, while earned, arrives with relatively low tension and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether she can transform trauma and insomnia into sustaining art—remains clear and resolves in her decision to stay, repaint, and finally sleep. Escalation is gentle: the brooch discovery and later exchange are the main tightenings, with the cost of trading away the brooch for her past self. However, pressure never quite feels acute; there’s little sense of real risk beyond continued psychic drift. The result is satisfying but low-intensity conflict, strong for a quiet piece but not maximally charged.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lira will resist or accept the unpredictable forces drawn by her own magic—is present and resolved, and the escalation in the cave’s music and coalescing shadows creates a sense of mounting pressure. However, the conflict is largely external and descriptive; Lira’s internal and tactical debates remain minimal, so the choice to open her hands and accept the forces lands as almost inevitable rather than hard-won. There is one clear tightening (forces trying to inhabit the pearl), but no substantial reversal or on-page trade-off beyond a generalized embrace of unpredictability. As a result, tension remains contemplative rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether exile’s silence can be turned into meaningful story—is clear but the pressure around it is gentle, with little real resistance or risk of failure. Escalation occurs mainly as deepening density (each interval adds more charged sound, culminating in the forbidden love) rather than narrowing options. There’s no strong sense that a choice could go wrong or foreclose something vital; the process feels preordained. As a result, the piece is emotionally affecting but relatively low-tension in conventional conflict terms.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central conflict—reason and habit versus instinct and surrender to the uncanny—exists and is clearly stated in “the dare she had been avoiding for three sleepless nights.” There is one primary tightening when she chooses to follow the arrows and use the punch on the door. However, the path after that choice is almost entirely unresisted: the door dissolves, the fortress appears, and her internal shift happens without setback or concrete cost beyond awe and fear. As a result, stakes stay mostly conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Lira can create a space of remembrance that eases grief—is clear but faces almost no resistance. Once the tile is found, its function unfolds smoothly; there are no setbacks, moral trade-offs, or moments where Lira’s goal is meaningfully threatened. Internal doubt about legends is mentioned but never sharpened into a real risk or dilemma. As a result, escalation is minimal, and the resolution feels gently inevitable rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Althea will finally risk ending her immortality to learn what comes after goodbye—is clear early and steadily tightened as the mutiny escalates from anomaly to explicit offer. The storm’s apex and the amulet’s harmonic alignment create a believable point of no return where neutrality is no longer possible. Her decision to merge and become the conduit is an earned resolution that forecloses the path of continued immortality with visible conceptual cost. The piece favors interior, philosophical tension over visceral jeopardy, which limits the visceral intensity but not the clarity of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—securing asylum through a dangerous con—is present early and consistently, and the ethical stakes are strongly braided in. There’s a clear tightening: the time-window breach, the apparent failure (no letterhead), the darker revelation of trafficked immigrants, then the blackmail negotiation. The cost is mostly conceptual and moral, with little sense of real physical or legal peril from the director, which keeps tension from fully peaking. Nonetheless, the resolution logically arises from Sam’s choices rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether her ritual art can answer or resist the town’s annihilating silence—is present but mostly conceptual. Pressure “escalates” via the hum growing louder, the labyrinth thickening, and the histories’ weight pressing back, yet no beat substantially narrows her options or forces a trade-off. Her agency is steady endurance rather than a sharpened decision point; she simply continues her work. This keeps tension low and the sense of price modest, even for an accumulative lyric piece.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the survivor can assemble a felt sense of identity from erased records and borrowed stories—is clear and consistently pressured by his liminal status in the Grid. There is escalation: the discovery of the poison label (bearing his own mark) is a strong deepening, and the added story of the vanished brother thickens the pattern from personal error to systemic erasure. The final act of putting the weighted box within reach of the tide crystallizes his stance rather than resolving the systemic threat, which works for an accumulative lyric piece. Still, external opposition remains abstract; no counter-force on the page directly pushes back in the moment of closure.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—solving the universal riddle of endings—is present from the outset and resolved at the close, and the pressure does accumulate texturally as hums, myths, and conversations converge. Yet escalation is gentle: there’s no sharp tightening that forces a trade-off, and stakes remain largely philosophical rather than viscerally felt. Elias’s key “choice” is to reinterpret the riddle and accept a new role, but this doesn’t clearly foreclose a path beyond an implied surrender to ghosthood. The piece risks reading as a single extended realization rather than a pressured conflict that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—saving the carnival/community from privatization—is clear, and Mira’s strategy of organizing via coded graffiti provides a concrete line of conflict. However, escalation is more conceptual than visceral: there is no moment where a clear option is foreclosed or Mira must sacrifice something tangible. The storm offers minor external pressure, but the corporation’s agents never truly press back on the page. The result is tension that simmers rather than meaningfully spikes before the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—capturing the bloom before sunlight destroys it—is clear, and the hourglass provides a tangible ticking mechanism. Pressure does escalate via the trembling grain and the approach of dawn, culminating in the flare and immediate wilt of the bloom. Still, the conflict remains relatively low-intensity and uncontested: no real obstacle challenges her competence beyond the clock. The cost is conceptual and emotional more than viscerally felt, which limits the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.0)
    The primary stake—repair the hummingbird before dawn so it can guide the *Prospect*—is clear and consistently referenced. Pressure does tighten as the ship’s horn sounds and the night wanes, and Miren’s methodical work under that time constraint constitutes the main conflict. However, the consequences of failure remain abstract (no concrete peril to the expedition or to Miren), and her competence is never seriously challenged, so escalation feels relatively safe. The piece gains tension more through accumulating texture than through hard reversals or forced trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (whether Kael will merely map endings or actually find/become the true source) is present and does tighten as the falcon returns and the condensation pattern gives him a new option. Escalation is primarily conceptual: he moves from observer to participant, from standing at the window to walking onto the lake and finally stepping into the water, which is a clear narrowing of options. However, resistance is almost entirely absent—there’s no meaningful obstacle, debate, or credible alternative path, so tension remains lyrical rather than urgent. As a result, the cost reads more like an inevitable rite than a pressured dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Thornhaven will be lost to entropy or sustained through pattern—is clear and thematically integrated. The main tightening arrives when Kael finally activates the tuning fork and the seven residents converge, reweighting his centuries of waiting into an actual attempt. However, opposition is largely abstract (entropy, time) and no concrete counter-pressure or real risk of failure materializes in the scene itself. As a result, tension feels quietly suggestive rather than sharply escalating, limiting the felt cost of each step.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    The central conflict—instinct to flee vs drive to harness an ephemeral energy source—is sharply posed and escalates through concrete turns: choosing to go deeper, pouring the vial, then prioritizing transmission over self-preservation when the helmet cracks. Time and oxygen scarcity add credible secondary pressure that tightens rather than just decorates. The cost is unmistakable: she trades her life to become the very silence that stabilizes the core. The only reason this doesn’t push higher is that the ethical calculus is straightforwardly noble, with little moral ambiguity or complication beyond the life/mission trade.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the son can inscribe a true, silencing story before discovery—exists but stays mostly conceptual. Escalation is present (chapel discovery → secret map → descent → altar ritual with a time pressure from the coming search party), yet the pressure feels low because no concrete obstacle or adversarial force pushes back. His key agency is choosing to perform and complete the ritual, then to leave, which does foreclose a path (staying to face or guide the searchers). Without visible tests of that commitment or a sharp moral trade-off, the tension plateaus instead of tightening into a peak.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake (saving the orchard / settling the ghost’s debt) is signaled clearly and does resolve, but the conflict is largely non-contested: Elara feels awe and fear, yet encounters no real obstacle or morally difficult trade-off in carrying and planting the bead. Escalation comes from atmospheric intensification (the pulsing bead, trembling ground, luminescent tendrils) more than from sharpened stakes or narrowing options. The final choice to press the bead into the soil is meaningful but easy—there’s no serious alternative or visible price on Elara’s side beyond inherited sorrow. As a result, tension is present but not gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can transform a ruined, silent wharf into a renewed, meaningful place—is clearly articulated. However, pressure doesn’t truly tighten: villagers’ doubt never forces a painful decision, and the labyrinth exploration unfolds without resistance, missteps, or sacrifice. Her agency is present (continuing to weave, choosing to enter the canyon), but these choices are not meaningfully tested. The result is conflict that’s conceptually strong but dramatically soft.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lina can mend the severed thread of continuity and her own faith—is clear and present throughout. However, escalation is gentle: she decides to rebuild the sundial, wanders, finds the missing piece, and succeeds without resistance or trade-off beyond implied emotional risk. There’s no sharp test of her commitment or visible cost that forecloses another path; the emotional pressure deepens but never tightens. The result is affecting but somewhat static in conflict terms for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—getting a dangerous, coded letter out as an act of resistance and hope—is clear and conceptually potent. There is some time pressure (“thirty minutes before the letter was mailed,” last pigeon of the season), but no actual reversals or complications: Kael’s plan unfolds smoothly, with no forced trade-offs or near-failures. Internal conflict (fear of exposure, doubt, or reluctance) is largely absent, so tension is more atmospheric than visceral. As a result, escalation under the chosen lens feels like gradual thickening rather than a genuinely tightening squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will remain a passive listener or risk herself to speak and counter the coup—is clear and present early. Pressure escalates conceptually as the tapestry reveals more, the prophecy appears, and the candle signals that “adjacent possibilities were narrowing,” culminating in her choice to act. However, opposition is entirely off-stage, and the felt cost of her decision (what might happen to her, to the observatory, to the stars’ stories) remains largely abstract. The conflict is coherent and does tighten, but it never quite bites as hard as it could.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will finally transform her unsent regret into an actual apology—is clear early and tightens through the ritual. Pressure escalates via the activation of the shard, the revelation of the sister’s death in the same storm, and especially Mira’s warning that the healing only lasts until sunrise, creating a live clock. The decisive act of reading the letters aloud and releasing them is clearly a point of no return that forecloses the old, silent path. The piece could hint a bit more at what “failure” would mean beyond continued self-torment, but the emotional stakes are still solid.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael remains stranded in his guilt and isolation or can re-translate his relationship to his daughter and his work—comes through early and deepens as he deciphers more layers of the cast. Escalation is subtle but real: each decoded element (stick figure, apartment code, invented script) tightens pressure and loosens his literal and figurative constriction (“loosening of the cord that binds his punctured lung”). The elders’ teaching about wounds and grafting reframes his current pain, building toward the final conceptual turn. Tension stays mostly internal and textural; readers wanting a sharper external reversal might find the pressure curve gentle but it remains coherent and earned for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central stake—whether Lyra can recover a sense of joy and meaning in her art—is present but only lightly pressured. Once she enters the orchard, every step essentially works: she finds the fresco, the film works flawlessly, the light-painting succeeds, spectators appear, and the fog itself “respects the moment.” There is little genuine escalation or narrowing of options, and no clear moment where she must trade off comfort, safety, or belief to proceed. The result is emotionally pleasing but dramatically under-tested, limiting tension and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elena will cling to restorative “certainty” or surrender to curiosity—is clear but remains mostly internal and low-intensity. The main escalation is from private experiment to shared experience when the visitor appears and the mural answers laughter, reweighting her practice as communal wonder. However, there is little sense of genuine risk if she failed or chose differently; no alternative path feels meaningfully foreclosed on the page. As a result, the conflict reads as a graceful unfolding rather than a pressured testing of values.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—maintaining a clandestine resistance in a regime that taxes thoughts—is established early and tightened when new “gardeners” appear and Aris’s cognitive tax quadruples, then spiked by the auditors’ entrance. The main rise in pressure is coherent and the auditors’ devices create a real, if brief, sense of jeopardy. However, the conflict resolves with little visible cost: the detectors are overwhelmed almost as soon as they appear, and Aris is never forced into a truly compromising choice (e.g., sacrificing someone or something, or risking overt noncompliance). Tension operates well at the conceptual and sentence level, but the climax lacks a harder trade-off that would deepen stakes to a truly elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—ending the merfolk war through a blossom armistice—is articulated early, and there is a nominal escalation from lone singing to merfolk gathering and peace blooming. However, opposition is largely off-stage and abstract; we never feel a concrete beat where war pushes back or a choice could fail. Once the merfolk first lay down their spears, the pressure softens into reaffirmations rather than new complications or trade-offs. The fragility of peace is told but not materially tested, so the emotional cost of her continued vigilance stays conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether and how extinction of feeling can be partially resisted—is clear but remains largely abstract, with limited sense of risk or urgency in any single beat. Lyric accumulation substitutes for concrete escalation; humming the song, lighting orchids, and bottling names repeat rather than significantly narrow options. There is a soft deepening when Lyra recognizes that awakening names also exposes irretrievable emptiness, but this doesn’t push her into a sharply more costly or constrained decision. The closing resolve is credible yet not strongly tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can re-establish trust and shared belief with Kess before institutional separation—is clear from early on, and the live deadline tightens pressure. The key escalation is Elara’s decision to expend the last of the ink on a chain of binding promises, which transforms a theoretical stake into an irrevocable act, followed by the suspenseful 20-hour silence. Resolution comes from both characters choosing mutual vulnerability over defensive ego, which is thematically coherent. However, external stakes (the archive’s sealing, career consequences) remain somewhat abstract, so the conflict feels emotionally real but not as viscerally pressured as it could.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—balancing preservation of the amphitheater with commercial/modern pressures and physical safety—is clear, and the discovery/decoding sequence is a solid tightening. However, the central conflict with the council is resolved with relatively soft resistance: some frowns and murmurs, a tremor, then a vote in her favor without any real trade-off or visible loss. The external and internal conflicts don’t fully interlock to force a painful choice; Alia’s plan is accepted almost on its first presentation. As a result, escalation flattens just where it ought to sharpen, and the cost of success remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central stakes—whether Elias will remain locked in curated memory or risk genuine trust and a rewritten self—are present but mostly internal and low-intensity. There is a soft escalation via the repeated pigeon releases and the moment when trust “solidifies into something real,” yet few options are visibly foreclosed or made costly. Balancing on the beam hints at physical risk but never concretizes into a meaningful decision point. The piece succeeds as quiet lyric reflection more than as a pressured conflict arc.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why thresholds are sacred—is clear but largely internal and unopposed. There is a nominal test in counting the “necessary distances” and choosing to cross, yet nothing pushes back or threatens loss if the narrator fails or refuses. As a result, pressure doesn’t meaningfully escalate; the story unfolds as a smooth revelation rather than a conflict-laden arc. The final stance is earned but largely costless, which keeps tension in the mid-range.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—escape with the sub versus surrendering to the city’s resonance—is clear and resolves decisively when she chooses not to board. Pressure mounts via the ticking clock (oxygen, sub departure) and the deepening understanding of the city’s transformation. However, the conflict remains largely internal and somewhat unopposed; Orpheus’ warnings never escalate into meaningful resistance, and no new complication seriously tests her resolve once she perceives the pattern. The result is potent but slightly under-tensioned for this level of ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding why paths vanish before memory fades—is clearly signaled, and her choice to descend and use the seeds is a meaningful commitment. However, escalation is minimal: once she enters the geode, the steps (press shard, scatter seeds, collect pieces) unfold without resistance, complication, or credible risk to her goal. There is little in the way of trade-offs, reversals, or costs that force her to adapt; the world seems eager to cooperate. The internal reorientation at the end is satisfying, but the journey lacks a tightening screw.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is aesthetic and existential—will Ezra successfully impose artistry and pattern on the arcade’s monotony within his forty-minute window—and that stake is signaled early. Pressure does increase via the ticking clock, the security guard’s approach, and the layering of orchestrated interactions, but the escalation remains gentle, never truly cornering Ezra into a risky trade-off or sacrifice. His solutions to each micro-obstacle work on the first try, so his competence is never really tested. The surprise of the bishop warming introduces a late destabilization, but it’s reflective rather than a clear, costly turn in his behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—keeping memory alive in a world that has banned nostalgia—is conceptually compelling, and the initial anchoring plus choice of exile provide one clear tightening. Yet conflict remains largely internal and idealized, with minimal friction: there is no real pushback, failure, or competing value that forces Lyra into a painful trade-off. The external pressure of the ban never tests her directly on the page, so escalation reads more as a smooth ascent into apotheosis than a struggle with meaningful cost. This keeps tension and stakes at a moderate, not elite, level.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake is an internal one—whether his ordinary craft carries real, almost spiritual value—and this is signaled early. However, conflict is almost entirely contemplative; there’s no material opposition, no real risk of loss, and no external test of his belief. The pond scene deepens his stance but doesn’t feel like a pressured choice so much as a ritual leading to a foregone conclusion. As a result, escalation is gentle and the cost of his final position remains conceptual rather than sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—how Elara can live with a past choice that saved some and killed others—is clear and present from early on. Pressure deepens as she nears the physical site of her decision, performs the ash-scattering ritual, and then chooses to leave the box and re-engage with recruits, foreclosing the path of solitary, mute guilt. Internal and external conflicts (private grief vs. public professional role) are well intertwined. Escalation is more tonal than sharply reversible, so the piece feels like a steady tightening rather than a dramatic spike, but the cost of her stance shift is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can discover the correct “equation” to meaningfully revive collapsing timelines—is clear, but the pressure curve is gentle. The main tightening is the equinox anomaly (despair and hope altitudes aligning) which prompts the mandala and coefficient discovery, yet success feels more like an inevitable pattern recognition than a fraught, risk-laden turn. There is little sense of what happens if she fails today versus any other day, and no strong counterforce opposes her beyond abstract entropy. As a result, stakes stay conceptual rather than viscerally tense.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can transform inherited, suppressed knowledge into purposeful, restorative action—is clear, but the on-page pressure remains relatively low and abstract. Discoveries unfold smoothly, with little resistance or felt risk beyond generalized emotional weight; there is no moment where a real option is foreclosed or a meaningful trade-off is dramatized. The escalation is primarily informational (learning the formula, recognizing its suppression, then disseminating it) rather than conflict-driven. This keeps tension present but muted, more contemplative than truly testing.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—can she coax the mirrors into showing possibility before the bells cut her off—is clear but remains abstract and low-friction. Escalation is present in the ticking clock and in the mirrors’ gradual awakening, yet the painter never faces a genuine risk of failure, nor adapts her tactics under pressure. The bells’ arrival functions as an external cutoff rather than a consequence of a hard choice, and the cost (losing the moment, returning the heartbeat) is more conceptual than felt. The conflict operates more as a ritual being completed than as a struggle with narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.5)
    The declared stakes (end of a “forever war,” redemption for a destroyed city) are enormous, but on-page conflict is remarkably frictionless. The only direct opposition—the scarred general’s skepticism—is handled in a single summarized challenge without dramatized back-and-forth or genuine risk of refusal. Once the leaders touch the clipboard, everything flows toward signatures with no meaningful reversal or hard trade-off. As a result, escalation under pressure is modest, and the cost of choosing peace feels mostly conceptual rather than viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stakes—preserving an echo at the cost of a manufactured drought—are powerful conceptually but remain largely abstract in-scene. There’s little on-page escalation: Vesper is never forced to reconsider or adapt; he simply performs a pre-decided ritual and then lives with its outcome in reflective summary. The villagers’ suffering and institutional whitewashing appear as stated facts rather than pressure that constrains his options in real time. As a result, tension simmers rather than tightens toward a felt, costly choice at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are legible and strong—defying a city-wide psychic control at risk of personal ruin—and the piece does escalate from private ritual to public upheaval. The main tightening is the act of beginning and sustaining the dance under “the lullaby’s pressure,” culminating in the final thread and the shattering unlock. Yet the conflict remains largely unopposed once she starts; there are no real reversals, tactical adjustments, or near-failures, so tension feels more asserted than dynamically tested. The cost is conceptual and social rather than immediate and visceral, which works, but undercuts the feeling of hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.8)
    The primary stake is conceptual—whether stories can ethically reshape how people see their own narratives—and that does tighten as Adrian moves from one reversed tale to the next. We do see concrete consequences (trucker and dealer altering behavior, woman reassessing her past), but Adrian encounters no on-page opposition, time pressure, or real possibility of failure. Escalation is thus mostly in the layering of examples rather than in increased cost or narrowing of options for him. The result feels rich but relatively low-pressure for a piece aiming at elite literary tension.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—how to honor and communicate with a collapsing migration—is clear but remains mostly conceptual and melancholic rather than acutely pressured. The discovery of the moth wing is the main escalation; it deepens stakes from abstract loss to a concrete, misfit remnant and prompts her decision to create a “final signal.” The late appearance of the solitary monarch offers a satisfying tightening, but Esme’s options don’t truly narrow—she continues what she was already doing, with slightly more urgency and specificity. As a result, conflict feels stately and contemplative rather than sharply escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she remains trapped in perfectionist shame or embraces a new, forgiving mode of preservation—is clear and thematically rich. Escalation is primarily internal: the rope activation scene deepens pressure by confronting her with the weight of forgotten lives and the scale of her task. However, the process unfolds relatively smoothly, with little resistance or genuine risk once the card is discovered; there’s minimal sense anything could go wrong now. The emotional cost is present but gentle, so tension feels more meditative than sharply tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—remain the last guardian of a decaying directive or step into an unknown, pathless world—is clear and resolved by her final action. Pressure does accumulate via the approaching storm, repeating vine patterns, and the unsettling recursion of her dream. However, the escalation is largely conceptual; there’s little real resistance or felt risk in the climactic climb and emergence, so the choice, while meaningful, reads more like a long-delayed realization than a high-cost trade. The conflict is strong but slightly under-intensified for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—securing a covenant with the unknown before the new priests erase the old knowledge—is established early and paid off at activation. Pressure does increase via the calendar of nights and the explicit temporal hinge “between the old governor’s exile and the new general’s coronation.” However, conflict remains mostly abstract and uncontested; Kael faces no active interference or real possibility of failure beyond the clock and his own comprehension. As a result, escalation feels more like a smooth deepening of contemplation than a tight constriction of options with palpable on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether Elara can be persuaded to release her resentment—is clear and thematically congruent, and the pin’s transformation provides a tangible escalation. The pressure does build as memory is activated and transferred, culminating in Elara’s partial release and dissolution. However, Elara’s resistance softens quickly once the pin is invoked, making the persuasion feel relatively smooth and low-risk. We see more of an elegant demonstration than a truly contested struggle under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering and embodying a lost dream—is clear, and there is a discernible tightening as Kael shifts from searching to ritual making to unleashing the dream. However, resistance and cost are minimal: once he tunes his breathing, nothing truly threatens failure or forces a painful trade-off, and no serious reversal occurs. The climax is beautiful but assured, so tension remains low-grade and primarily conceptual. Escalation thus feels graceful rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stakes—reviving a dying sacred orchard and repairing a frayed bond with her daughter—are clear and interwoven, and the work of mending statue eyes provides a concrete arena for that pressure. The discovery of the locket/note and the choice to use the daughter’s ribbon are solid deepening beats that shift her stance. However, the tension never quite spikes; no real alternative path is dramatized, and the daughter’s arrival leads quickly to soft reconciliation rather than a contested exchange or difficult trade-off. The result is emotionally satisfying but relatively low in felt risk.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Evers will breach the orchard’s taboo to pursue forbidden knowledge—emerges clearly and tightens as he moves from wanting to inquire, to experimenting with the shell, to directly engaging the oldest tree. His active choice to weaponize his inheritance, violate the implied rule, and ingest the fruit is an escalation that forecloses the option of remaining a mere functionary. The cost is primarily conceptual/emotional (bearing the grief of dead universes) rather than dramatized through immediate consequence, but it is felt. The pressure remains mostly internal and abstract, making the conflict powerful but a bit rarified.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes are conceptually high—rescuing a lost botanist and gaining access to a forbidden library—but on the page the pressure rarely tightens; solutions arrive almost as soon as problems are named. The renegotiation with the warden could be a major crucible yet unfolds without visible risk or real possibility of refusal, and the journey through the catacombs lacks complications. There is little price for success beyond abstract conceptual shifts, so tension never quite escalates. As a result, the conflict feels elegantly designed rather than felt as genuinely precarious.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.8)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal—Mira’s longing for solace and identity versus her sense of entrapment—and it does progress from questing uncertainty to a chosen stasis. The main tightening is the discovery of the garden and the twin blossom, which reframes her understanding of herself and the ship. However, the pressure never feels acute; no external force or concrete loss sharpens the decision to stay, so the cost is more implied than dramatized. As a result, tension is steady but soft rather than ratcheting.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether and how to reconcile an impossible anomaly with the official record—is clear, and pressure does deepen as she moves from passive observation to actively reweaving the chain. However, escalation remains largely intellectual; there is little on-page sense of danger or moral risk when she decides to alter the braid, even though the consequences are enormous. The disappearance of the earlier student and the temporal weirdness at 3:47 AM could have sharpened fear or hesitation but instead function mostly as lore. The result is elegant but somewhat under-pressured for the scale of the act.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—restoring silence in the face of the energy beings’ disruptive storm—is clear and tracked. There is one good tightening when the initial conjured silence fails, forcing Lira to adapt by harmonizing the cracks rather than relying solely on the stone. Yet the conflict remains largely abstract and low-risk; there is no articulated danger, sacrifice, or serious consequence if she fails beyond discomfort and lost quiet. Because costs and hard trade-offs are underdeveloped, tension never rises to a high-stakes pitch.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.0)
    The external stake (rekindling the beacon for travelers in a ruined world) is strong and signaled early, as is the internal stake of proving pattern beneath coincidence. There is a discernible tightening around the awaited constellation and the precise alignment of the shard of hush. However, opposition is almost entirely abstract—no real obstacles, missteps, or costs impede her once she understands the method, so tension never fully crests. The conflict remains more contemplative than pressured, which limits escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—how to form a self in the face of overwhelming collective memory—is clear and consistently pressed. Escalation comes from moving into more chaotic data (forecourt whispers) and then confronting the weight of her role via the earlier archivist’s journal, forcing a new stance on listening vs choosing. However, pressure remains contemplative rather than truly constricting; no option feels dangerously foreclosed, only reweighted. The result is strong philosophical tension, but not quite high-pressure dramatic conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are emotionally clear but externally soft: she wants to ignite hope in a deadened place, and the only real test is whether she finds the right spot and dares to light the fire. The one meaningful tightening is the discovery of the mosaic “Rise,” which turns a vague mission into a specific, almost sanctioned act. There is no opposing force—no danger in exposure, no risk of failure—so pressure never truly narrows her options. As a result, escalation feels more like a controlled swell of mood than a hardening conflict with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—how Mara will position herself emotionally toward her brother’s impending departure—is clear, and the “pause” provides a tight temporal container. Escalation is subtle: the sustained silence, the rising tide, and her shifting insight gradually narrow her options from clinging or denial toward an earned acceptance. However, the pressure never bites very hard; there’s minimal sense that an alternate, more damaging response is truly live, so the felt cost is present but muted. The final exchange and his quieter voice do register as a meaningful, if low-key, tightening and release.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can transform a suffocating bunker and her own fear into something livable via curated silence—is present but remains mostly abstract. Her key act of agency is choosing to climb during gravity inversion and feed the trellis silence into the bunker; that decision does reweight her internal situation. However, there’s little sense of real jeopardy beyond mood: the climb doesn’t meaningfully threaten her, conflict with her father never peaks into a choice with consequences, and no option is clearly foreclosed. Pressure accumulates aesthetically rather than through felt risk or sacrifice, which keeps stakes at a low simmer.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the diplomat can endure and integrate silence—appears early and tightens as his noise threatens the “delicate harmonic balance.” The escalation is primarily internal and textural: Kael adjusts resonance panels, his physiological readings shift color, and his drumming subsides, culminating in tears and confession. However, his resistance softens rather quickly and there’s limited sense of what he stands to lose if he fails, beyond an abstract discomfort, so the perceived cost is mild. Conflict is coherent and thematically apt but never quite bites as sharply as it could.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—what happens to the unclaimed throne before sunrise—is clear, and the sunrise clock plus the stair’s appearance add situational pressure. However, most external obstacles fall quickly; she succeeds at each step with little resistance, so tension relies heavily on the late internal turn (“These stairs weren’t meant for her”). That renunciation is meaningful but arrives almost frictionlessly, making the conflict feel elegant rather than truly testing.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stakes—her need to preserve a safe isolation versus her compulsion to let the suffocating in and teach them to breathe—are clear but rarely pressured to a breaking point. The conflict with the encroaching man resolves almost without resistance; once he appears, she accepts and helps him with no meaningful risk of refusal or failure. Escalation is mostly tonal (sanctuary “breathing,” threshold pulsing) rather than driven by hard choices that foreclose options. The shift to an open, ongoing mission is gentle and conceptually apt but lacks a sharp, costly turn.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael will risk disobeying the owner and tampering with the farm for a shot at redemption/diamonds—is clear, and the timing requirement (“moment of bloom”) provides a meaningful tightening. Escalation comes via increasingly urgent messages and the approach of the bloom, culminating in the bolt-turning choice. However, the stakes never truly feel dangerous: potential harm to the farm, his relationship with the owner, or his own safety is only lightly sketched, so the climax reads more as inevitability than hard-won risk.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the hidden truth of the dynasty and his role in it—is clear, but on-page pressure remains low. The main escalation is the increasing resonance of the gramophone leading to the ancestral vision and whispered name, yet nothing meaningfully resists him; there’s no real possibility of failure or competing desire. His final stance shift is coherent but comes without a visible trade-off beyond a lightly sketched redefinition of identity. As a result, tension is more meditative than truly tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Aldric remains in static isolation or binds himself to a shifting, reality-altering role—is legible, and escalation tracks from quiet tending to cosmic transformation. However, the conflict is largely one-sided: the orchard invites, the puppets reveal, and Aldric complies, with minimal friction or meaningful alternative paths tested on the page. His hesitation at the doorway is brief and mostly declarative, so the price of stepping through never fully tightens into felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Marianne can make a tiny, meaningful intervention in an erased life—is clear and present early. Escalation is mostly a deepening of significance (from anonymous button to possible lineage to emotional impact on Marcus’s daughter) rather than pressure on Marianne’s options. There is little opposition; her research proceeds without friction, and the only potential uncertainty (will Marcus respond?) is collapsed quickly via the daughter’s letter. The quiet, accumulative tension suits the piece but limits the sense of risk or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—preserving uncorrupted history against systemic erasure—is clearly established and escalates through concrete setbacks (self-ashening access code, missing coordinates, imminent drones). The key tightening comes when the drone approaches and Mara must choose between preserving all backups or sacrificing the relay to safeguard one crystal in her own body. The cost is legible: she’s marked erased, risks her life swallowing the data, and destroys potential redundancy. Internal or ethical conflict is underplayed—she barely hesitates—so the tension is more situational than moral, but it still builds coherently to the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—preventing the “old world” from waking—is stated but never made visceral; it stays mythic and distant. Conflict is essentially the saxophonist versus an inert prophecy, with no counter-pressure or meaningful resistance on the page. The main “tightening” is the deepening of the hush, which reads as an intended outcome rather than a risky turn. As a result, escalation feels flat, with little sense of what might be lost in the attempt or what it costs him in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.0)
    The dominant stake—decode the prophecy and awaken the First Seed so the arbor can bloom—is stated early and resolved, but escalation is minimal. The moonstone’s first use and the discovery of the map act as soft tightenings, yet none of these moments foreclose options or demand a trade-off. Lira never risks failure; every new revelation slides smoothly into the next step. As a result, tension remains mostly abstract and the fulfillment of the prophecy carries little on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are primarily internal: can Elara move from rigid control to a relationship with uncertainty, with the secondary, more abstract risk of “murdering time itself.” Pressure escalates coherently from puzzling pattern to physical descent to a single high-risk act of improvisation at the mechanism. However, the threat never bites physically or relationally; no concrete loss or near-loss tests her resolve beyond that one moment of fear. The resolution is earned but feels a shade too safe for maximal intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can meaningfully “redeem” Alder’s absence or must accept the limits of her art—is clear and sharpened by the failed search. Pressure escalates as the coin grows more unstable and name-laden, pushing her toward a conceptual, rather than literal, solution. Her final act of dissolving the coin and leaving the search behind is a real renunciation, but the cost remains mostly conceptual and could be made slightly more acute or risky on the page. Still, internal and external conflicts (craft vs. miracle, finding vs. recognizing) interweave effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—liberating the child’s laughter to repair both her soul and Kael’s own fragmentation—is clear and active throughout, and pressure meaningfully deepens as the harp’s use intensifies and the laughter finally manifests in its fractured form. The internal cost (facing the pain of what Kael left behind) comes through, and the final acceptance is a genuine stance shift. However, external opposition is minimal, and the conflict remains largely interior and atmospheric rather than undergoing a pronounced narrowing of options or a hard trade-off on the page. It’s strong for a lyric piece but not maximally taut.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant conflict—her need to extract a clean formula of mercy versus the raw, destabilizing nature of her trauma—is clear but largely internal and conceptual. Pressure does rise modestly as the UV intensity and remembered details increase, culminating in her acceptance of a non-quantifiable mercy. However, there’s little sense of real jeopardy if she fails; no concrete consequence or trade-off is dramatized beyond continued discomfort. The escalation reads more as deepening rumination than a tightening vise that forces a painful choice.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether this hidden history will remain buried or be claimed—is clear and does tighten once the narrator discovers Elias’s journal and confronts the keeper’s sacrifice. The pivotal “unfastening” of the canvas and the decision to keep the fragment provide a meaningful deepening of pressure, but the opposition remains mostly conceptual rather than enacted. There’s little in the way of genuine jeopardy or cost if the narrator walked away, so the tension stays relatively low-grade. The result is an elegant but somewhat gentle escalation rather than a truly gripping one.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes are primarily moral and epistemic—will Marlon respond to the ghosts’ demand for witness or treat this as another job—and they focus nicely on his ongoing haunting. Escalation is there: malfunction → presence of ghosts → activation via the barrel → discovery of the hidden wages → decision to carry a burden. The cost is conceptual rather than immediate danger, but the text makes that cost explicit in the “spring wound tight beneath his ribs” and in how the ghosts finally release him. It’s strong but not searing; at no point does he plausibly consider refusal or failure, so tension stays more atmospheric than agonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will use this unprecedented frost pattern and the bottled whisper to alter a fragile, consensus-based reality—is present early and escalates as her actions destabilize the library. The rupture and merging of libraries are strong externalizations of that escalation. However, most tension is conceptual and aesthetic; Elara faces little on-page dilemma or resistance beyond her trembling hands, and after she commits, events largely run without further choices. The cost is real but more atmospheric than sharply tested or contested in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the empire’s past will be preserved as lie or revealed as fraught truth—is clear and tracked. Pressure does tighten through the impending storm and Kael’s risky use of the mirror/shard ritual, forcing a choice of tactic (poetic revelation over direct confrontation). However, Voss’s resistance softens very quickly; the antagonistic pressure yields with little on-page struggle, making the “dispute ended” feel more resigned than hard-won. The emotional cost for Kael is present but inward and quiet, so the turn lands more as deepening than sharp escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clearly signaled early (no music, no dawn; children lose their guiding light) and intensify with the encroaching midnight and rust’s physical toll. There is a meaningful internal tightening when his doubt manifests as a false note and bodily agony, forcing a recommitment to radical honesty under pressure. The covenant’s whispered temptation adds moral pressure, though he rebuffs it relatively quickly. The resolution is earned by his steady, value-driven action, but the conflict never quite corners him into a wrenching trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will follow the expedition into the mystery or define a different relationship to it—is legible early through the compass vision and intensifies as she descends. Escalation is primarily atmospheric and conceptual (deeper into the cave, denser silence, the lagoon’s temporal “pages”) rather than adversarial, but there is a clear tightening at the lagoon when the needle spins and the possibility of crossing becomes concrete. Her decision to become keeper rather than follower is a genuine renunciation with implied cost (isolation from those who chose the deeper threshold, surrender of her tools). The pressure is strong for a quiet piece, though it never quite reaches true knife-edge tension.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—Mara’s need to understand and locate herself within the “timewoven alliance”—is clear but largely internal and contemplative. Escalation comes via deepening symbolism rather than mounting pressure: GPS failure, arrival at the archway, revelation of hidden carvings, then her decision to mark and join the lineage. The approaching storm and the risk of the archway being “erased” are gestured at but not allowed to bite; her “no urgency to leave” undercuts potential tension. The ending is satisfying in a quiet way, but the felt stakes never tighten beyond reflective significance.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Sable’s need to understand why flowers bloom at night—is present from the start, but pressure stays low and largely internal. The main tightening is the trip to the cathedral and the dawn experiment at the window, which shifts her knowledge, yet it comes without real resistance or risk. After the glass vision, conflict essentially dissolves into acceptance; there’s little sense of trade-off or path foreclosed. As a result, escalation feels more like a steady glide than a sharpened turn.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether the truth of the Dunes Massacre will be suppressed or released—is clear and tracks from early discovery through the parley. Escalation arrives in her confrontation with the Under-Minister and his personal entanglement via his grandfather’s photos, which redefines the negotiation and enables the final decryption. Internal and external conflicts braid well (political risk, psychic cost, moral obligation), and the final compromise feels like a real cost-bearing choice. Some beats (her weeks of work, the government’s pressure) are told rather than put under on-page test, slightly flattening moment-to-moment tension.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael will cling to nostalgia or use memory to found a new civilization—is conceptually strong but experiencially under-pressured. The conflict with the sealed bottle (cannot be opened) is resolved not through a hard choice with cost but via a relatively untroubled pivot to “unlocking memory” and ritual. There is minimal escalation; once he commits to reimagining rather than resurrecting, little pushes back against that aim, and the incantation scene unfolds without real risk or possibility of failure. As a result, the ending feels more like a graceful completion of an idea than a hard-won resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—what to do with an unintended, ominous-sounding prophecy—is clear, and the pressure coherently grows from accidental utterance to interpretive crisis to the decision to archive. However, escalation remains mostly conceptual; Elias does not meaningfully test alternate options (erasing, concealing, refusing to listen), so the conflict never sharpens into a true trade-off on the page. The reinterpretation of the prophecy as a map deepens the situation but also softens threat, slightly undercutting tension. The on-page cost is primarily an intensified mood of disquiet rather than a dramatized loss or irreversible choice under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the atrium (and time-cycle) freezes or renews—is clear, and the egg hatching plus fading starlight sketch a nominal clock. Yet resistance is largely notional: once she begins the ritual, nothing meaningfully complicates or threatens failure, and the visions offer a choice she resolves instantly. There is a single tightening (the vision of total ice versus lush future), but it doesn’t force a trade-off with felt cost, making the escalation mild. The story reads more as a graceful performance of a foregone duty than a test of commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central conflict—whether to trigger an unnecessary alarm and panic the village versus risking a missed storm—is clearly posed and sharpened by the “zero hour” frame and the imperfect tools (cured rope vs. siren vs. instruments). Pressure does escalate as the readings stall and she moves back and forth between switch and window. However, once the stall is confirmed, the narrative coasts into reflection, and the on-page cost remains mostly conceptual (avoiding “false fear”) rather than something she personally pays in the moment. The stakes are credible but stay relatively quiet and internal.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake is Sola’s existential/spiritual stance toward isolation: will the hush remain dead emptiness or become a living stillness she can inhabit. Pressure rises somewhat when the glass reframes the silence and when visitors eventually appear, validating or testing her choice. Still, conflict is largely unopposed; there’s minimal sense of what she risks by opening to vulnerability beyond summarized loneliness. The escalation reads as a gentle deepening of mood rather than a tightening of options with a clear, on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the covenant of bees ferrying souls can be preserved—is clear but remains almost entirely conceptual and untested in scene. The main “turn” is informational: realizing the bees are dying and that the covenant is broken by drought, after which Elara resolves to act. There is no significant on-page opposition, reversal, or sacrifice; nothing resists her resolve or forces a trade-off. As a result, tension is low and escalation feels more like restatement than mounting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes are primarily existential and conceptual—understanding Harrison’s message and what “borrowed time” really is—and they’re signaled early and sustained. However, pressure and escalation are relatively gentle: Elara’s outreach and the ensuing contact encounter little resistance, and there’s no genuine risk that she will fail beyond implied loneliness or incomprehension. The core turns happen, but without a sharply felt cost or foreclosed option beyond the shift in worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict exists almost entirely on an internal, conceptual level: his longing for wholeness versus the acceptance of incompleteness. The snapped kite and storm damage hint at pressure, but they never truly corner him into a difficult decision or trade-off. The emotional and situational stakes remain low and static, with no meaningful escalation beyond deepened musing. As a result, the final acceptance reads more like a well-worded restatement than an earned turn under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stakes—what Elias does with his limited time and whether he can complete the circuit to be translated—are clear and grow under the pressure of his deteriorating body. Escalation is primarily accumulative: each completed spiral and new sign of the orchard’s response heightens both possibility and the risk of running out of time. His choice to honor “non-violence” with the strangler vines is a strong ethical inflection that reinforces the interspecies-respect stake. The conflict remains mostly smooth and contemplative; one more concrete or resistant obstacle might intensify the sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes remain largely intellectual and reputational, declared more than dramatized; nothing actively resists her or threatens to invalidate her quest on the page. The closest thing to escalation is the deepening of data (pheromones → unique polymer → “chemistry of homecoming”), which is interesting but low-pressure. There is no visible price paid or option foreclosed once she reaches the tower—discovery comes without true risk or sacrifice. As a result, conflict feels static, even as the conceptual landscape sharpens.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether life can return to a war-scarred, ecologically dead place—is clear, but the on-page pressure is gentle and largely uncontested. The main tightening comes when the land “refuses” to accept seed and the gull reveals hidden springs, yet success follows without a credible chance of failure or trade-off. There’s no concrete loss, sacrifice, or meaningful foreclosed path; the soil yields to his methods on the first serious attempt we see. As a result, the piece is moving but low-tension, relying on mood rather than escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Wick will remain closed down or risk crossing emotional and literal distance to reconnect with Maya—is clear and consistent. There is one meaningful tightening when he chooses to undertake the three-day trek, trading safety for the chance of contact. Yet the external pressures of the wasteland (danger, scarcity, real threat of failure) remain largely gestural; he finds water and food without struggle, and nothing substantially tests or complicates his resolve on the page. As a result, the emotional conflict is persuasive but not maximally stressed for this tier.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—what to do with unbearable, distorted time and solitude—is established, and the glimpse of the uncharted light gives the narrator a concrete alternative. There is one clear tightening when the glimmer appears and the deck’s rotation offers a “brief window of escape,” prompting the exit choice. Yet risk and cost are only lightly sketched: we’re told it’s a void, but there’s no real sense of danger, constraint, or irreversibility beyond lyric suggestion. The move from paralysis to departure is conceptually significant but emotionally and tactically under-pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—preventing the wrong sky from tearing the world apart—is clearly signaled, but the on-page pressure never matches that scale. Kaelen faces no real opposition: he remembers the pattern, executes it without mishap, and the sundial lid works immediately; his only “conflict” is a brief, easily resolved fear. There’s one structural tightening (reaching the heart), yet no option is truly foreclosed or morally fraught. As a result, tension feels conceptual rather than visceral, limiting the piece’s grip.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the forgotten “pawns” and their small gestures will be remembered—is thematically strong but remains abstract on the page. Conflict is nearly frictionless: there is no real opposition to Kael’s mission, no risk of failure, and no visible cost attached to success beyond implied moral weight. The only “turn” is the panel opening and the prisoner’s emergence, which occur as expected once the pattern is completed. As a result, tension barely escalates, and the story reads more as a lyrical ritual than as a pressured sequence of choices.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will risk destabilizing the substituted nights to gain the language of home—is clear, and there is one meaningful tightening when the mountain “warns” her through hidden thunder. However, the external pressure remains largely abstract and atmospheric; nothing on the page tests her goal with concrete negative consequence beyond fear. Her final decision feels more like a gentle follow-through than a hard-won trade-off, especially when the thunder is reinterpreted as a benign heartbeat rather than a true danger. Tension operates, but at a relatively low, meditative pitch for the supposed risk.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes—freeing the village and confronting his own capacity to teach again without repeating a past tragedy—are clear and intertwined. Pressure does rise as he decodes the tapestry and confronts the line about the king’s sacrifice, linking puzzle mechanics to his trauma. However, the external conflict is nearly frictionless: the labyrinth yields without resistance or genuine risk, so escalation feels more like steady progress than a tightening vise. The internal conflict lands, but with a relatively gentle, low-resistance path to resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—the community’s ritual sacrifice versus Kael’s attempt to fracture that necessity—is clear and escalates from quiet poetry sessions to a climactic public act. However, the external conflict resolves with surprising ease: the Elders simply stop and reconsider after the spectral display, with minimal resistance or tangible fallout. The moral pressure on Kael and Mara is interesting but remains mostly conceptual; they are not clearly risking concrete punishment on the page in the climax. The result is a compelling but somewhat low-friction transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    The primary stake—can she complete the memory-repair before the environment kills her—tightens via the breath-counting, worsening structural damage, and imminent exchanger failure. There is a clear escalation from aligning early craters to the decisive third-eye placement, with each success inviting both new meaning and heightened external cost. Her choice to continue working rather than seek safety, and finally to accept transformation by inhaling the poison, grounds the resolution in her agency. A single sharper on-page trade-off (e.g. abandoning some specific safety measure to reach the last crater) could have intensified the sense of foreclosed alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—keeping or breaking his long-guarded promise and what that means for his attachment to the past—is clear, but the on-page pressure stays gentle. The wrong turn and entry into the hidden oasis create a sense of discovery rather than real jeopardy or dilemma, and once he begins painting there is no serious doubt he’ll complete the act. The “cost” (parting with the shell and its nostalgia) is present but underplayed in the moment. As a result, conflict functions but never quite tightens into a genuinely fraught decision.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central conflict—shouted control vs. quiet, vibrational listening—is clear and sharpened by Elara’s goal of proving her philosophy on her last morning. Escalation is mostly internal/textural: tension rises as she ignores Marcus’s shouting, climbs to the lantern, and actively uses the lighthouse’s magic to challenge his mode of relating rather than confront him verbally. The decisive tightening comes when the beam/jasmine whisper interrupts Marcus mid-shout and forces him up the stairs into a new stance. The stakes are intimate rather than dramatic, and while cost for Marcus is palpable, Elara’s risk (professional or emotional) could be made a notch more concrete to deepen pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—build the bridge in time to bring the lost (especially his sister) back—is signaled early and escalates via the nightly calls and the waxing moon’s increasing pull. The key tightening happens with the seventh-night “Now” and his activation of the resonator, which narrows his options to committing or failing. However, the process of building and solving the problem faces little concrete opposition; there’s scant sense he might truly fail or pay a harsher price beyond exhaustion and emotional strain. The conflict is effective but not especially jagged or costly, which limits upper-band pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.2)
    The core stake—whether radical honesty will destroy or heal the community—is legible and escalates through the failed occlusion, persistent whispers, and the choice to let the eye “sweep across” the survivors. Internal and external conflicts interweave: fear of contagion vs duty to cultivate safety. However, opposition remains soft; patrols and catastrophic consequences never manifest on the page, and the communal revelation goes almost too smoothly. The price is implied more than sharply felt, which keeps the escalation solid but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the stranger’s final gesture will be understood and thus if their memory “lands” anywhere—is clear but largely internal and contemplative. Pressure deepens slightly as Cornelius focuses on the “gaps” and feels the echo pressing against his thoughts, yet there’s no genuine risk or alternative path beyond understanding vs. not understanding. His micro-choices (to engage the memory, to preserve the boutonniere, to treat himself as witness) are coherent but low-cost. As a result, conflict feels beautifully atmospheric but not strongly escalatory.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stake—whether Merrick will remain in safe, decaying solitude or risk stepping through the fabled doorway before the water window closes—is clear and escalates coherently. The ticking creek and the narrowing physical access to the cavern provide real situational pressure, culminating as the water crests the arch. His agency is central at the end: he must choose to step through or let the opportunity die, with an implied cost of abandoning everything known. However, the internal conflict at that peak is somewhat underplayed; a slightly more contested choice would sharpen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—remain a hollow monarch or surrender to become the mountain’s sentinel—is clear early and paid off explicitly at the end. Escalation is mostly internal and conceptual: the climb intensifies physical pressure, then the vision reframes her dreams as invitations with a curse-cost, narrowing her options. Her acceptance is a genuine renunciation with visible consequence (erasure of name and memory, abandonment of kingdom). That said, the conflict path feels relatively inevitable once she starts climbing; there are few true reversals or moments where refusal feels live.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how they can “revalue” the past and capture presence—is signaled but never seriously jeopardized; success feels assumed from the outset. There is no antagonist, no real risk that the ritual will fail, and no alternative path that gets foreclosed. The alchemist’s action (mixing indigo with the shell) does mark a gentle deepening, but the cost is nearly invisible, framed as a serene upgrade rather than a trade-off. As a result, conflict remains largely abstract and static, limiting tension and escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the chronicler can impose narrative meaning on his temporal disintegration without being devoured by “feral nostalgia”—is clear and intensifies. Pressure escalates as nostalgia shifts from background ache to an almost-entity that “chased me here…to demand I write its true ending,” forcing a decision about how to relate to his fractured selves. The key tightening is his mid-air choice to write “The chronicler dies but the dreaming continues,” which forecloses the path of clinging to a single, linear biography. While stakes are largely interior and conceptual, the story sustains tension and lands a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    The primary conflict—Elena’s struggle between controlling grief vs. inhabiting altered perception—is clear and coherently pressured by Marcus’s philosophy and the charged objects. There is one meaningful deepening when she confesses losing trust in other senses and later when she accepts the screw as a reminder of holding space rather than control. However, escalation remains gentle; the stakes never sharpen into a moment where a specific option is visibly foreclosed beyond the conceptual stance shift. The tension is effective but subdued, which suits the tone yet limits intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—can she genuinely release and reconfigure her pain?—is legible, and the crystallizing ink provides a concrete externalization of pressure. Yet escalation is soft: once the ritual begins, no new obstacle truly threatens its completion; the crystallization aligns with her grief but doesn’t seriously endanger the outcome. The tear-as-offering functions more as graceful solution than hard-won pivot under duress. As a result, conflict feels contemplative rather than taut, with limited sense of trade-off or foreclosed paths.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—can Mira use this last morning to repair a broken relationship before the orchard is lost—is clear and present from the outset. Pressure escalates modestly but steadily: initial skepticism, the device humming to life, the scent triggering memory, then the literal crash of the first tree as they step outside. Their choice to reconnect is earned and has cost (acknowledging harm, accepting the orchard’s loss) rather than being a frictionless forgiveness. The limitation is that resistance is never seriously tested; Linden’s shift feels smooth, with minimal risk of true rejection.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—whether and how she can unify reality’s remnants before the hiccup ends—is clear and escalates as spiral arbitration awakens and the temple begins to reshape itself around her movement. The critical tightening comes when the spiral voice declares “What you seek to unify cannot be held,” forcing a redefinition of her goal into surrender. However, the conflict is almost entirely internal and proceeds with little resistance or genuine doubt; the transition from questing to acceptance feels smooth, with limited sense of risk or near-failure. Stakes are conceptually vast but only intermittently felt as pressure on her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s need to understand what time really measures—is signaled early and followed consistently. Pressure escalates mildly through the ritual of deeper counting backwards and the clock’s increasingly responsive behavior (spinning hands, dropping water), but there is no real risk or adverse consequence if he fails. The result is a meditative, low-conflict piece where the main “cost” is existential unease rather than a felt trade-off. Effective for a lyric, but too static and low-stakes for top-tier conflict scores.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—what kind of “intrusion” Kael will allow or deny—is clear and tightened by the recurring, unexplained signature. The main escalation is the move from remote observation to physically entering Sector Twelve, which credibly raises both professional and emotional stakes. After the reveal, tension shifts inward toward how Kael will reinterpret and codify this intrusion, but the cost remains fairly gentle and mostly conceptual (no strong on-page risk of punishment or tangible loss). The conflict is thoughtful and coherent, but operates at a restrained, almost meditative pressure level.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—how Lila will live with her father’s legacy and her own relationship to chance—is clear, and the piece does tighten once she follows the map into the sealed alcove. However, the conflict is almost entirely internal and contemplative; there’s little sense of genuine risk, sacrifice, or a path she might refuse. Each turn (seeing the code, boarding the train, finding the room) proceeds without real obstruction or competing desire, so tension remains gentle and the cost of her final stance is largely inferred rather than felt on the page.

    The primary stake—Mira’s entrapment in an emotional and temporal loop versus her emerging need to connect and free both herself and the callers—is legible and escalates. Key tightenings are the realization of endless repetition, the experiment of touching the disc, and the climactic choice to shatter it. However, the conflict remains largely internal and atmospherically textured; the sense of danger or concrete risk beyond malaise and loneliness is muted. The price of breaking the loop (ending the calls, physical pain, stepping into an unknown life) is present but could be made more viscerally fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are almost entirely internal and contemplative: whether she can “regenerate” a broken covenant and transform private regret into communal remembrance. Pressure accumulates texturally rather than through obstacles, and there is limited sense of genuine risk or potential loss if she fails. Her main “turn” is deciding to act (write, leave jasmine), but those decisions come without concrete opposition or sacrifice. The result is a beautiful mood piece with relatively low dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—whether isolation can be transmuted into connection—is clear, and there is one genuine tightening when Mira resolves that belief alone is insufficient and engineers the clock-tower ritual. Still, conflict remains mostly abstract; there’s no substantive resistance, failed attempt, or hard trade-off, so pressure never truly escalates beyond “will the ritual work emotionally.” The ghosts’ departure and Mira’s exit imply cost but are not framed as contested or painful choices on the page. As a result, tension feels gentle and contemplative more than driving.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—finding the stillpoint to fulfill her mother’s request and confront grief—is signaled early and followed through. Pressure escalates texturally as she goes deeper, the frequencies thicken, and then abruptly drop into the charged silence of the stillpoint. The main tightening is internal: the hidden melody reconfigures her understanding of loss rather than forcing a hard trade-off in the outer world. Because there’s almost no counterforce or risk of failure beyond interior difficulty, the tension feels more contemplative than fraught, which trims the score slightly at a venue aiming for maximal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central stake—Kael’s attempt to repair past mistakes before the pen’s reservoir runs out—is clear but largely internal and contemplative. There is conceptual escalation (from minor technical errors to more personal memories; from fixing logs to accepting limits), and the dwindling ink provides a meaningful pressure. Yet we don’t see a sharply dramatized decisive moment of refusal or trade-off; the story glides over the hardest choices. The result is thematically rich but somewhat low-tension in narrative terms for elite markets.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias remains dissolved into erasure or claims a new, self-owned relation to forgetting—is clear and tightened by the advisor’s presence. Escalation is quiet but real: from passive clicking at “absences,” to being reoriented toward the moon’s reflection, to actively signing his own symphony. The final choice is an earned stasis: he remains bound to the harbor but with a transformed purpose, foreclosing the path of pure self-erasure. Pressure is more meditative than tense, so the conflict never feels sharp, but for this mode it’s sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes—Kael’s moral redemption and the rescue of uncorrupted history—are clearly posed and carry emotional weight. Pressure deepens as they uncover more layers (scientific records, genealogies) and commit to weeks of labor, culminating in a costly identity and role shift. However, conflict is largely internal and rarely faces concrete on-page resistance: there are no real setbacks, time pressures, or antagonistic forces challenging their project once the archive is found. The result is a rich but relatively smooth escalation that could benefit from at least one moment where continuing the work is meaningfully in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can transform his entangled memories into a new shared existence before the AI shuts him down—is clearly signaled and meaningfully tightened by the monitoring cuff, the drone’s approach, and the narrow cosmic window. Conflict escalates as his drumming moves from exploratory to surgical, with his bleeding hands embodying personal cost. The external pressure from the AI is a bit generic and mostly functions as a clock rather than a fully realized antagonist, slightly softening the sense of evolving opposition. Still, the climax—choosing dissolution over compliance—reads as an earned, high-stakes act rather than a foregone lyric flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—proving his whisper thesis to keep control of the northern corridor and thwart the smuggler’s attempt—is clear and sharp. Pressure escalates credibly from abstract bet to real-time infiltration and a race against both the storm and the crew’s break-in. Marek’s agency drives the turns: choosing the whisper method, deploying key/coin/maps, and sprinting to intersect the consequences. The main limitation is that Marek’s personal risk and potential loss aren’t deeply felt beyond the stated corridor access; the price is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake is the child’s unnamed fear versus the possibility of restored hope, but it stays abstract and largely untested: there is no moment where the child nearly turns away or resists. Escalation is gentle—more complex light patterns, closer approach, shared mirror—yet never tightens into a genuine dilemma or risk. The guardian never faces any threat of failure; success feels assumed. As a result, tension remains low-grade ambience rather than a shaped rise toward a pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.2)
    The central stake—challenging authoritarian “rules of the city” through quiet thought—is clear, but the on-page opposition remains abstract and largely passive. Hartwin’s plan rolls out without serious resistance; the authorities merely “puzzled” is a low-intensity consequence. There is a mild escalation from classroom doubts to city-wide displays and the climactic “Question the king” puzzle, but no beat where a genuine option is foreclosed or a costly trade-off is forced. The result is thematically pointed but dramatically gentle, limiting tension and sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether Mira remains bound to duty or risks embracing her true nature—is established early and coherently escalated by the whale’s call and the island’s appearance. The key tightening arrives in the guardian encounter, where she must choose between reflexive defense and the offered “combative tenderness,” but that conflict resolves very quickly, with minimal real threat or sacrifice on the page. The emotional cost of leaving her dock life is largely conceptual, which keeps the stakes resonant but gentler than they could be.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.4)
    The primary conflict—how to live with grief under a happiness mandate while being partly complicit—is compelling but remains largely static. Whittling and narrating mundane tasks are framed as rebellion, yet they never meet significant on-page resistance or force a visible trade-off in the moment. The dog’s arrival introduces a moral crossroads, but the crucial act (reporting it) and its cost are offloaded to a future-morning summary instead of becoming a live turning scene. As a result, tension accumulates atmospherically rather than escalating in felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she will continue to cross previously “sacred” boundaries after the ban—is legible, and there is some escalation: from atrium threshold to tactile merging with quartz to stepping onto the lake’s center. However, opposition is almost entirely absent; nothing on the page genuinely threatens, contests, or complicates her goal. The “ban” and prior fear are referenced but not made to press on her in the present moment, so choices don’t feel arduous. The result is a beautifully textured but relatively low-pressure arc.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether both will risk their familiar ways of seeing and making art for a mutual awakening—is present but under-pressured. Elara’s demonstration with the reed and plants is immediately successful, and Dorian’s “hesitation” dissolves into assent without real risk or alternative. There is one clear tightening (the offered trade), but no significant loss, sacrifice, or credible threat of refusal. As a result, the piece feels more like a beautifully described ritual than a scene of evolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether imperfect, physical sound can offer a truer connection than near-perfect digital models—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates primarily when Mara confronts Kaelen with the 99.7% accuracy claim and Kaelen responds by deliberately misaligning the lens, a concrete choice that deepens the conflict. The cost is subtle but present: choosing the messy 0.3% over institutional certainty and utility in a world hungry for stability. Still, the conflict remains largely philosophical and low-friction, without a serious risk to relationships, status, or survival.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether Elara can find a way for withering (stars, grief, hope) to “bloom” rather than simply end—is clear and present throughout. Pressure deepens once Mnemosyne begins responding and Elara realizes she is also teaching herself, and again when the traveler arrives bearing the tattoo, reconfiguring her project as part of a longer chain. However, resistance and concrete costs are more implied than dramatized; there’s little sense that her attempts might fail or that she must choose between competing goods. The conflict is emotionally real but remains relatively gentle and interior, more contemplative than sharply escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.0)
    The primary stake—whether the architect can reframe his fallen faith in single chains into a more resilient, multi-path vision of the future—is clear but remains mostly conceptual. Pressure coheres and gently tightens: his desperation, the crumbling towers vs. emerging roots, and his eventual plea to “show me how to build again” mark a credible escalation. Mara’s stance doesn’t face a hard test; she never wavers or pays an explicit price for her refusal of simple prophecy, so the conflict’s cost is more implied than dramatized. For a top-tier piece, a sharper ethical or emotional pinch point would deepen the sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether she can access and purify dangerous, forbidden memories without being destroyed—is clear, but the on-page conflict is largely internal and under-tested. The notion that patterns can trap and devour minds is evocative yet never dramatized in real time; we’re told of others falling but see no live near-miss or genuine jeopardy for Lyra. Escalation is modest: she finds the pagoda, begins purification, feels increasing emotional cost, and then stops. Her final renunciation/endurance choice carries some weight but lacks a sharp, pressure-driven turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether hope in the dream-library is consumed or preserved—is clear early and carries through to the shadow’s transformation. There is a meaningful tightening when she realizes the stone is a catalyst and chooses to use it, risking both the library and herself. However, the opposition is fairly soft: the shadow never actively resists on the page, and her internal conflict with that risk is implied more than dramatized. As a result, the escalation feels more like a graceful slide into the ritual than a sharp test of commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—how Elara will respond to the exposed fraud and her complicity—is clear early and coherently drives the story. Pressure escalates not via external set-pieces but through accumulative, moral tightening: from sorting and burning evidence, through tending injuries she’d neglected, to actively summoning the officer and preparing to face consequences. The arrival of the car on the gravel road provides an effective final crank of tension, forcing her resolve into a moment of action. The conflict remains primarily internal and quiet, so readers who crave sharper external opposition might find it subdued, but within this mode the cost and narrowing of options are legible.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara seeking interpretive “closure” through scars—is clear, but the story offers almost no resistance to her goal. The fern’s “warnings” never materialize as danger, and the tunnel descent proceeds without any genuine risk, moral dilemma, or sacrifice. Escalation is largely rhetorical and atmospheric rather than a tightening of options. As a result, the ending’s sense of gain lacks an opposing pressure or cost that would deepen its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake (can Mira locate and preserve unused love before demolition) is clear, and there is one meaningful tightening when the film dissolves into a map and she realizes she must personally carry the accumulated love. Escalation is primarily internal/conceptual rather than conflictual, appropriate to the lens but keeping pressure in a narrow band. The cost—bearing ninety years of unspent love and leaving the building to its fate—is present and felt, though the demolition deadline doesn’t actively pinch her choices on the page. A moment of more explicit dilemma (e.g., resisting or negotiating that burden) would strengthen the sense of narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake (freeing her creativity) is established early, but pressure stays relatively gentle and unopposed. The journey north and the ritual under the aurora represent escalation in effort, yet there are no real reversals, conflicts, or trade-offs beyond endurance and distance. Her key “choice” is mostly to rest and listen, which works conceptually but doesn’t feel sharply tested on the page. As a result, the stakes remain somewhat abstract and low-intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether possibility/memory can survive the encroaching null-zones—is clear and escalates as the archive’s “cancer of nothing” spreads. The key tightening is the discovery that the archive’s current state is failing and must be transplanted, culminating in the guard’s costly choice to plant it with their own voice and self. However, conflict is almost entirely one-sided and abstract; there’s no real counter-force with agency, just entropy, and the guard never seriously wavers. The pressure deepens conceptually rather than through sharp reversals, which works but keeps it shy of top-tier tension.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is internal—reclaiming the “wild frontier” of her mind—and there is a gentle deepening as she learns to listen, map truths, and finally architect new groves. However, pressure rarely tightens; there’s no real sense of risk in failure or a live alternative path she might choose, so tension stays low. The closest thing to escalation is the gear activating and the hum cresting into a crescendo, but even this lacks visible sacrifice. The result is conceptually satisfying but dramatically mild.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stakes (finding the dog and discovering courage) are signaled early, and there is at least one meaningful tightening when Lin chooses to traverse the ridgeway and later to walk it again. Yet the external conflict remains mild: no real near-misses, sacrifices, or serious setbacks obstruct the search. Internal conflict is framed conceptually (fear vs. unused courage) rather than dramatized through hard trade-offs, and pivotal resolutions (the ferry’s help, the dog’s safe waiting) arrive with little price extracted. The result is emotionally pleasant but low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she will continue to participate in safety after her failure—emerges early and tightens convincingly when she encounters the new rust stain. The internal conflict between self-punishing withdrawal and recommitting to vigilance is clear, and the discovery of another flaw effectively reopens the wound of her past silence. However, escalation remains mostly internal and contemplative; there is little external resistance or new complication beyond the binary of speak vs. stay silent. The resolution feels earned but could benefit from one more concrete pressure point or visible risk in the present.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—exposing the false king—is signaled early and resolved on-page, but the pressure scarcely escalates. Vael walks almost unopposed into the trap; there’s no genuine risk that he’ll resist the riddle, detect the snare, or harm Sylvar or the library. Sylvar’s key act (activating the rune) is a formality rather than a contested choice with cost, so tension stays largely conceptual. The conflict functions but doesn’t tighten in a way that truly narrows options or forces trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—Lina’s need to understand why paths (lanes, reefs, futures) disappear—is present early and followed through, but pressure remains low and mostly internal. The main tightening comes when she assembles archival fragments and recognizes that vanished paths were premised on a world that didn’t happen, forcing her to relinquish certain salvational fantasies. There is little in the way of active resistance or competing obligations; nothing on the page forces a painful trade-off beyond conceptual acceptance. Tension is thus steady and contemplative rather than escalating, limiting the impact of the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the stagnant “lull in rebellion” can be broken by a different kind of action—is clear, and there is a genuine escalation from private listening to port-wide broadcast. However, pressure feels largely one-sided and contemplative; there is no real oppositional force in scene, and Kai’s risk in acting is implied but not sharpened into concrete danger or sacrifice. Her key action (singing) comes relatively easily once she recognizes the pattern, with little sense that an option is being foreclosed. The result is atmospherically tense but structurally soft compared to elite-level conflict density.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.9)
    The central conflict—obedience to a sacred covenant versus intentional evolution of tradition—is clear, and the unsealing is a meaningful tightening that forecloses the old path. However, Mara encounters very little active resistance: the guard grandson lets her pass, the elders are off-stage, and there’s no moment where she’s truly at risk of being stopped. Stakes remain somewhat abstract (future eruptions, cultural direction) and are asserted more than viscerally felt in the scene, so pressure escalates intellectually rather than dramatically.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.3)
    The stakes are internal but clear: can Elias find a way to hold memory without being annihilated by it. Pressure escalates modestly: touch-triggered memories → articulation of “pearl of stillness” → the high-stakes experiment of pressing the photograph to the tree and letting the freeze fully take over. His final decision to become a “keeper” of somatic light is a credible Earned Stasis with cost—he is choosing continued exposure to pain, not escape. The conflict remains contemplative and never feels urgent in a visceral sense, which keeps the stakes from fully tightening into the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    The core stake—whether Elara will remain paralyzed and let the lighthouse dissolve, or act to reweave reality and her own vocation—is clear and escalates as the walls literally and figuratively close in. Her agency in choosing to untangle and reweave the threads is the decisive turn, and the cost (collapsed possibilities, chosen ache) is legible. However, opposition is mostly conceptual, with little sense that the weaving itself might fail or harm her, so the escalation reads intense but not truly perilous. The conflict lands as rich but slightly soft-edged under such a high bar.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—grappling with loss and the mystery of slowed time—is established, but the on-page conflict is mostly Kael versus an abstract phenomenon. The major “turn” is the drone’s disappearance, after which tension plateaus into observation and theorizing rather than escalating via new risks or trade-offs. His decision to restrain his wildness and continue methodical experimentation is a form of agency, yet it doesn’t convincingly foreclose a path beyond continuing solitude and uncertainty. Stakes feel more contemplative than urgent, keeping pressure at a moderate level.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will maintain the curated Silence or risk destabilizing the frozen order—is signaled early and sharpened as she grasps the letter’s implications. Pressure escalates from quiet discovery to an irrevocable act that triggers screams, resignations, and systemic collapse, with her choice at the tube mouth as the clear fulcrum. Internal and external conflicts are well braided; her ethical calculus (“reseal and report” vs “ignition”) is not purely abstract because the narrative pays off with concrete social upheaval. The cost to her personally is mostly anticipated rather than directly inflicted on the page, which keeps the stakes powerful but not fully harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—maintaining a pacifist sanctuary amid chaos—is clearly stated but only lightly tested. The stranger’s arrival and the dust storm are natural points for escalation, yet both resolve with minimal complication: hospitality costs her little, and the dome and roses suffer no damage. Her “choice” at closure is essentially to continue as before, so options are not meaningfully narrowed and no path feels truly foreclosed. Tension is more atmospheric than dynamically escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Avery can/should “catch” Echo’s echo and what that costs—is coherent, and pressure increases nicely from preparation to the moment Echo asks, “what will you do with the weight of a goddess’s memory?” The key tightening is her choice to drive the spike (active summoning) and then later to withdraw it (choosing release over possession). However, the decision to release feels almost too serene; the story gestures at the potential burden of keeping Echo, but Avery’s temptation to hold on is only lightly dramatized. More explicit friction between desire and the ethical choice at that instant would sharpen stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—whether she perpetuates or breaks a generational pattern of suppression—is clear and morally weighty. Conflict escalates from contemplation and cataloging discrepancies to a decisive institutional defiance (sending the memo to every editor and backing Mara). Internal and external pressures interweave, but the opposition (the board, potential fallout) remains abstract, so the on-page sense of risk never quite tightens into urgency. The result is strong ethical tension rather than teeth-clenched suspense.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can undo the harm of the celestial tethers—is clear and escalates as meteor hush deepens and the firmware’s grief becomes more accusatory. Pressure increases through the revelation that the letters are from her own future failure and that the infants’ cries are live signals, not mere recordings. Her choice to perform the erasure ritual, knowing it will unravel her life’s work and the lab’s constellations, carries a visible conceptual and emotional cost. What’s missing for a higher score is a sharper on-page moment where success genuinely feels in doubt or alternate options are weighed and foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether the artist can responsibly give form to the community’s erased trauma—is clear, and pressure coheres around the tile’s imperative to “complete the circle, but break it at the seventh turn.” The main escalation is her decision to act on that instruction, transforming a passive listening posture into an intervention that literally reconfigures the mandala and grotto. However, the danger remains mostly implied; the “ravenous” grotto and potential harm to villagers are suggested rather than tested in concrete, escalating obstacles. The result is intellectually engaging but somewhat low in visceral tension.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether and how this place will remember its history—is present but stays largely conceptual and unopposed. Arin’s key action (renaming the plaza) encounters no real resistance, internal or external, and there’s little escalation beyond the initial discovery and decision. The “aberrant mercy” memory could sharpen a moral dilemma but instead ratifies a choice he already seems inclined to make. Overall, conflict feels too static and frictionless for elite-level stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—rescuing the actress’s possibility from despair by gifting her his encore—is clear but only lightly pressured. There is no credible obstacle: once he reaches the orchard, his claps and coin simply work as intended, with no risk of failure, misfire, or personal cost beyond a sentimental parting from the coin. As a result, the emotional turn for the actress feels inevitable rather than hard-won, and tension never truly tightens. The conflict is poignant in concept but underdeveloped in terms of concrete opposition or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding and potentially fixing the dangerous feedback loops of the telepathy pill—is declared and conceptually high, but on the page the pressure is mild. Lina faces almost no resistance, risk, or trade-off beyond cautious curiosity; the hum appears, she receives visions, and moves toward solution without real jeopardy or sacrifice. The main tightening is her realization of the loops’ danger and the geode’s potential protective role, but that deepening doesn’t visibly foreclose options or exact a price. As a result, the conflict feels more like an elegant thought experiment than a charged problem.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lira will merely record or truly translate and embody the world’s dormant emotions—is present but lightly pressured. There is one clear deepening when the fossil projects the ancient forest and she realizes the caves are repositories of transitional objects, prompting her to sing. However, opposition and cost are minimal; nothing seriously threatens her goal, and her new role is assumed with little struggle or sacrifice on the page. The piece reads as contemplative discovery more than true conflict escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—unlocking and correctly understanding the prophecy—is clear, but pressure is mostly implied rather than dramatized: “time itself was running out on its own story” is not translated into concrete, narrowing options. The decades of work and the taxonomy of buttons show persistent effort, yet obstacles and reversals are largely summarized instead of staged. The main tightening is the placement of the final button and the prophecy’s clarification, which functions more as a culmination than an escalated test with a real risk of failure or harm. As a result, tension is intellectually engaging but rarely visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—redemption and re-entry into the network vs. remaining a disgraced exile—is legible from the outset and carried through the courier’s demand for proof. Pressure tightens when the courier insists on seeing the buried codes, forcing Kael into a visible test of his claims and of the long-term bet he made on this dead drop. However, the scene lacks a sharp reversal or costly trade-off once the capsule is produced; acceptance and reward follow very smoothly, so the external risk feels somewhat lighter than the setup implies. The internal conflict does deepen, but the price paid remains largely retrospective and emotional rather than tested in-the-moment.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.4)
    The emotional stakes—whether a 37-year palimpsest promise will be honored—are strong and signaled early, and the clock of the gutters provides a subtle tightening as drops slow. However, once she arrives the external conflict effectively disappears; there is no further jeopardy to the crossing or the reunion. The story leans on endurance as the primary form of agency, which is valid, but we see little on-page test of that commitment beyond the long retrospective wait. As a result, escalation feels more like a graceful glide than a squeeze toward a pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Kai can genuinely understand and learn from a place that resists entropy—is clear and followed through. Pressure deepens as she discovers the oasis’s temporal memory and realizes love has literally shaped its survival, leading to the decision to create and leave the bowl-and-glass offering. However, escalation is gentle; there’s no real alternative path or significant risk of failure on the page, so the sense of cost and narrowing options is muted. The conflict remains almost entirely internal and philosophical, which works tonally but limits dramatic intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure is quietly internal: whether to remain bound to the dead rose or to risk a broader, more vulnerable project in the city. The inciting loss and the move to the cannery lot form a clear escalation, but there is little genuine friction or resistance once she decides—no real test of commitment mid-beat. The central trade-off (private vertical protest vs. shared horizontal hope) is implied rather than sharpened into a difficult choice. The story succeeds as a lyric of stance crystallization more than as conflict-driven narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Mara’s negotiation between isolating observerhood and risky, identity-blurring communion—is present and thematically clear. There is one main deepening when she experiences the world as a mammoth and the text acknowledges that this “threatens to fracture her sense of self,” which hints at real danger. However, the pressure never quite crystallizes into a pointed dilemma or visible trade-off; she “persists” without being forced into a more specific choice where one path closes. The escalation thus feels more like an intensifying mood than a sharpened conflict with undeniable price.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.3)
    The core stake—whether Lira will remain an anonymous keeper of others’ longings or risk joining the world—is clear but under-pressured. Once she feels restless, all external forces cooperate: the potter, the poet, and visitors pose no friction, and there are no meaningful reversals or costs beyond mild vulnerability. The installation scales up the emotional canvas, but there’s no moment where she nearly retreats or pays a tangible price for exposure. As a result, escalation is more a smooth crescendo of mood than a tightening of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can blunt the aliens’ manipulation before the community tears itself apart—is clear and escalates from abstract tension to an on-air, timed counterattack. The alien and institutional power pressures converge at the climax (risking equipment, career, and credibility during a live broadcast). However, the “dangerous” method pays off a bit cleanly: no visible backlash from the administration and no equipment failure, so the price feels more theoretical than enacted. Internal versus external stakes are interwoven but could use one sharper on-page loss or compromise.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.8)
    The primary stake—recovering the key/knowledge—remains clear, and the descent plus tightening walls and organ crescendo provide a basic escalation. The decisive action of aligning and pressing the compass point into the stone for access is a solid peak beat. Yet the conflict is relatively risk-free: her claustrophobia flares briefly but never truly imperils her mission, and there’s little sense of what she might lose beyond discomfort. As a result the final victory feels assured and the cost minimal, holding the stakes to a thoughtful but mild register.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stakes—solving the disappearance and rekindling Elara’s empathy—are clear and interwoven, with a genuine deepening when the mathematically precise portrait turns “hollow” and she’s forced into a riskier, more vulnerable mode of working. Escalation is more emotional than situational, and it registers in her shift from “very methodical” to “desperate” painting. External stakes (catching the perpetrator) resolve a bit too neatly and off-stage, with little sense of alternatives foreclosed or real jeopardy faced on the page. The conflict is coherent and satisfying but somewhat understated for elite-level tension.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—truth vs. institutional erasure, with the sub-stake of her job and status—is established early and tightens as she chooses to override protocols and then publicly point out the proof. Escalation is clear: private decoding → dangerous system override with alarms → confrontation with the director as the truth becomes undeniable. The primary cost on the page is conceptual (collapse of the lie) and professional (threat of termination), with little sense of physical risk despite the extreme environment, so the pressure feels slightly soft for the scale of language used. Still, her agency clearly drives the turns, and options narrow in a legible way.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether he can transform a haunting encounter and forgotten history into redemptive song—is present but under-pressured. The main tightening is his decision to treat the scaffold pattern as a map and physically pursue it into the grove, but opposition is minimal and the world cooperates almost too smoothly. There is little sense of risk in disturbing the cairn or confronting the past; no alternative path feels meaningfully foreclosed. The ending offers resolution without a sharp sense of what might have been lost had he refused.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Leo will rekindle the doomed startup pattern—is signaled and remains coherent throughout. The main tightening comes when Leo physically returns, reads the symbols, and must decide whether to push ahead or heed the warning. However, conflict is largely conceptual and Leo yields quickly, so there’s little sense of sacrifice or hard-fought persuasion. The internal conflict in the son (curiosity vs. intervention) plays, but without sharper external resistance, the stakes feel relatively low-impact.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central pressure—whether Elara can and should bear decoding and “healing” these collective confessions alone—is present but remains largely internal and unopposed by any concrete obstacle. Escalation is a deepening of knowledge rather than a tightening of options: the trance and revelation of the ancient scribe-as-self sharpen the stakes conceptually but don’t force a fraught trade-off on the page. Her final move (writing “We carried it together, as all burdens must be carried” and archiving the telegram) is an earned stance crystallization, yet the emotional or practical cost is muted and mostly implied. The piece reads as contemplative pressure more than sustained conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.3)
    The external conflict with the curse/ice and the internal conflict with buried guilt are tightly linked, and there is clear escalation from failed fire magic to riskier, curse-eating seed and focused ritual. Stakes (truth of the confession, lifting a centuries-old curse) are legible and proportionate to the scene, and the final revelation does carry a moral/emotional price. However, tension feels relatively safe; the druid’s competence and calm reduce any real sense he might fail or pay a harsher cost, and the obstacles yield without serious complication beyond “first attempt fails.” The conflict works, but it never quite feels knife-edge.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—repairing the broken covenant by finding the intersection of dreams before dawn—is clear and thematically strong. There is one main tightening when she chooses to “heed” the labyrinth’s call despite ancestral warnings and uses pain as a portal. However, opposition is soft: the figure in the maze explains rather than resists, and her ordeal feels more like guided revelation than tested struggle. As a result, the cost and narrowing of options are more implied than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake (bartering to restore her sister’s destiny) is clear from the outset and escalates naturally to a single, high-cost choice. The Keeper’s stated price of “memory” tightens pressure by forcing conflict between her drive and her identity. The cost—the erasure of their shared life, and the imperfect outcome—is visible and not walked back. Escalation is primarily internal rather than through reversals, but it reads as sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will stay numbed by failure or risk re-engaging with her past—appears early and is coherent. Pressure does increase modestly via the appearance of the Sonic Wasteland cloth and her micro-interaction with Dale. However, conflict remains mostly internal and contemplative, and the outcome (she keeps the scrap and adopts a hopeful frame) is achieved without a visible trade-off or test beyond her own mild resistance. The lack of a sharper cost or external consequence keeps escalation from feeling fully satisfying at elite-publication level.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—reestablishing the invisible architecture to keep the city from falling—is clear and signaled early, and the key tightening arrives when she reconceives the spirit as field rather than absence. Internal and external stakes braid nicely as the “physics of transition” question maps onto saving the city. Still, conflict remains mostly intellectual and unresisted; there’s little sense of risk, misstep, or time-pressure constraining her tactics beyond what’s stated, so escalation feels elegant rather than fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara obeys the Archive’s demand to smelt the crystals or honours the messy humanity inside them—is legible early and tightens as she approaches the crucible. Her partial refusal (modifying the smelting process rather than pure destruction or pure disobedience) forecloses the clean safety of protocol and opens potential risk to the Archive’s integrity and her role within it. The escalation is primarily internal and ethical rather than external, but the pressure scales appropriately for the piece’s lyric, single-character scope. The price is conceptual and ongoing rather than dramatized as immediate punishment, which keeps this strong but just shy of truly searing stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will treat the caves and confessions as a structural risk to be erased or a sacred archive to be activated—is clear and tightened when protocol demands demolition. Conflict is primarily internal/ethical, with one meaningful pressure point at the “heartbeat of a hesitation.” The escalation is emotionally convincing but relatively gentle; the price of defiance (personal or communal) could be sharpened for greater bite.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can begin to forgive herself—is clear, but the on-page pressure remains relatively even, with no single moment where her options feel sharply narrowed. The closest to a tightening beat is the graffiti encounter, which prompts her to trace the letters and accept a crack in her armor, yet it reads more as gentle nudge than crisis. Internal fear (memories of the bridge, screams) is invoked, but she overcomes it with minimal resistance or backsliding. As a result, the resolution feels more like a graceful slide than a hard-won stance.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the secret of the unspoken words—is clear but remains largely conceptual, with minimal sense of risk if she fails or succeeds. There is one meaningful deepening when the second letter reframes her goal (“The silence you seek is the echo you leave”) and forces a choice to release, not read, the words. Still, there is little resistance or genuine threat; each obstacle (watch, cipher, stairs) yields without testing her commitment in a costly way. Pressure accumulates gently rather than tightening sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—Lira’s dream of a free archive versus the empire’s control of the seed—is signaled early and culminates in a concrete, high-leverage decision. Internal and external conflicts are interwoven (dream vs. funding/safety; autonomy vs. exploitation) and the choice to hide the violin and plant the seed constitutes a real trade-off. However, escalation is primarily rhetorical and imagistic: the empire’s power and potential retaliation never apply immediate, narrowing pressure beyond the envoy’s polite visit, which keeps tension from fully tightening. The emotional dilemma reads, but the danger feels somewhat insulated.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving the poet’s last spark before it vanishes—is clear from early on, and there is a discernible tightening as the fraying thread forms a single droplet and she must time the capture. Still, conflict remains largely one-sided; nothing meaningfully resists her beyond the inherent fragility of the moment, and her success feels almost assured. There’s no significant reversal or foreclosed option that bites back at her. The tension is real but gentle, more meditative than strenuous, which caps escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—how Elara will handle overripe, grief-soaked memories and what that implies about rebirth and contentment—is clearly articulated. Pressure tightens when she confronts Mrs. Chen’s blackened grapes and must choose between forcing a release and creating a threshold, and her choice to witness from the tree is a meaningful act of renunciation. Internal and external conflicts interweave, but tension is more meditative than fraught; nothing on the page truly threatens to break her, which keeps the escalation from feeling urgent. The cost (accepting her role as caretaker rather than savior) is real but understated.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake is the narrator’s internal stance toward certainty vs. doubt, signaled early, but external pressure remains low. The chimes’ discord and the blocked entrance offer a mild tightening, yet they never truly threaten loss or force a painful trade-off; the keeper’s guidance arrives without real resistance. The final decision to “wear [the cloak] more loosely” is a meaningful stance shift, but the cost of changing (or not changing) is only abstractly sketched. Overall, conflict is thoughtful but gentle, lacking a sharp test of commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—Mira’s own existence and the integrity of her lesson—is present but remains largely abstract, framed as a metaphysical paradox more than a felt dilemma. There is one main tightening when she realizes the vanishing she teaches is her own, culminating in the decision to “become the stone,” but escalation between those poles is relatively flat. Opposition is not personified, and the cost (erasure, translucence, memory loss) is more stated than pressured scene by scene. The story functions as a resonant meditation rather than a sharply escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—learning to navigate time without physical movement under a quasi-sacred constraint—is clear and present from early on. Pressure escalates texturally rather than via overt conflict: years of waiting, the rare signal from the birds, and the harmonic experiment that finally answers the wandering pulse. That said, antagonism is mostly abstract (taboo and time itself), so the piece lacks a sharp on-page test or explicit trade-off at the climax beyond understanding the pulse. The resolution feels earned but not hard-won; raising the sense of potential failure or risk in the moment of alignment would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—complicity in erasing the last remnant of wild magic versus a quiet, self-sacrificial refusal—is clear and thematically rich. The main tightening comes when the expected sigils and mechanisms are absent, forcing Vorrin to recognize that his choice cannot be offloaded onto protocol. However, antagonistic pressure is mostly abstract and institutional rather than present and adaptive, and the decision occurs with limited friction or reversal in the moment. The cost is legible but the tension curve is relatively gentle for such a consequential choice.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—discovering the color of sound—is clear but largely internal and uncontested. Pressure accumulates texturally (deeper into the ship, more luminous language) rather than through tightening options or visible risk. Elias never seriously risks loss or failure; the revelation arrives without a meaningful trade-off or test. As a result, tension is gentle and meditative, not gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether she can achieve meaningful alignment rather than dissolve—is clear early and stays in view. Pressure escalates texturally: random static becomes patterned, then nearly words, then a direct imperative, and the second casting of coins reframes the conflict from prediction to forgotten sacrifice. Her final decision to align and become the signal is agency-driven and earns the ending. The main limitation is that consequences remain largely conceptual and cosmic; we don’t see many on-page foreclosed alternatives or concrete “prices paid” beyond the implied surrender of individuality.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether she can give shape to nameless fears without being consumed by her own—is coherent, and pressure gradually tightens as she works through increasingly personal monsters on the atlas. The decisive deepening comes with the final, featureless beast and the incomplete recording, which force her to recognize a category of fear that exists only “in the space between souls.” That recognition forecloses the option of seeing her work as purely salvific and commits her to carrying a fear she can’t resolve. Still, the conflict remains largely contemplative; we never feel a real risk that she will fail or refuse, which keeps the stakes emotionally high but dramatically gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—restoring a cosmic/oceanic balance after the last fish is caught—is clearly stated and tied to Kael’s actions, and we do see a meaningful tightening as he refines the bell’s angle and resonance between strikes. Internal and external stakes interweave as his brittle devotion strains while the sea begins, tentatively, to answer. However, tension never becomes acute: there’s little sense of a live alternative path if he fails, or of meaningful sacrifice beyond magical exhaustion. The conflict escalates in a measured, almost meditative way, effective but not sharply pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether the valley’s official narrative will remain a lie or be corrected—is thematically strong but softly dramatized. Escalation occurs through discovery and memory rather than through real opposition; Nora’s resolution to alter the report never feels risky, contested, or morally fraught beyond straightforward justice. As a result, tension remains gentle and reflective, with no substantial narrowing of options or visible price, which keeps the conflict from reaching the intensity expected for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—harmonize logic and intuition or dissolve into the void—is clear and high in principle. However, on the page the conflict unfolds almost entirely as contemplative alignment rather than contested struggle, and there’s no real sense she might fail in this specific twilight. The main “tightening” beat is the crystal-in-flame moment plus the offering of the violet, yet these occur with little resistance or felt risk beyond the stated future stakes. As a result, tension lives in idea and image rather than in escalating, pressurized choices.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—preventing tether failure and loss of civic trust—is stated repeatedly and is clearly urgent. Yet the on-page conflict is almost entirely internalized anticipation; once he starts revising, there are no real setbacks, reversals, or forced trade-offs. The emergency protocol revision and manual override read as a straightforward execution of competence rather than a pressured choice that forecloses alternatives with evident cost. As a result, tension plateaus instead of tightening into a genuinely fraught peak.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—who gets to exist and whether to restore feeling—is legible early and narrows toward the choice to vivify and integrate. Pressure escalates once the temporal storm threatens to “solidify them into permanent, separate beings,” creating a clear now-or-never decision. The climax is internally driven, but the clones mostly freeze rather than actively contest, so opposition feels more conceptual than dynamically antagonistic. Still, the cost of his decision (return of pain, loss of pure emptiness) is clear on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict and stakes remain mostly abstract: there is no real threat to Mara, to the seed, or to her identity as a creator beyond blandly stated “safeguarding” concerns. The only nod toward external pressure is the small warning sign against disturbance, which is never tested. Internal tension—between risk and safety, or between commerce and art—is gestured at but not dramatized. As a result, pressure barely tightens, and the journey feels more like a sustained mood-piece than a story that forces a meaningful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—Eleanor helping Sarah grieve without unmooring her sanity—is clearly signaled and tightened through the escalation from soft wind to howling, from plate-shattering to laughter, and then Eleanor’s conscious easing off. Her agency directly drives the central turns: pulling harder, then moderating, then one last gentle pull after overhearing the siblings. The emotional cost is legible in Eleanor’s felt “proper weight of her own absence” and her dissolution, even though the conflict remains quiet and internal rather than oppositional. The pressure arc is convincing but more a steady swell than a sharp crucible, which holds it just shy of the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central conflict—dimensional homesickness and duty to guard vs. a new philosophy of uncertainty—remains clear and is tightened by the arrival of the pendant and, later, the forming door. Escalation is quiet but real: the pendant reframes what “light” and “knowledge” are, then the unchosen door tests the guardian’s new stance. The closing refusal to move toward the door is a credible Earned Stasis with a conceptual cost (accepting endless waiting and not-knowing even when a “solution” appears). Still, the pressure never quite bites; the stakes feel more metaphysical than urgently felt, which keeps conflict from fully peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will repeat her ancestors’ fatal attempts or find a new relation to the embers—is established early and carried to the end. Pressure escalates primarily through internal realization and the decision to sacrifice the last remnant of the crozier, which forecloses both the traditional ritual path and any warm, living resurrection. There’s a clear tightening around her willingness to accept “beautiful undeath” instead of the hoped-for life. The conflict remains largely internal and abstract, with minimal pushback or reversals, so while coherent and earned, it never quite attains maximal intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.5)
    The primary stake—can she decode or properly respond to the shard, on which “life and death” in this world implicitly depend—is clear, but largely conceptual rather than embodied in immediate danger. Escalation comes from her shift in tactics (discarding hardware and assumptions) and the increasing cosmic pressure of lunar perigee, culminating in the rewiring of the tower and the emergent tone. The resolution is earned by her altered stance, not by coincidence. However, the on-page pressure remains fairly serene; we’re told the stakes are survival, but we rarely feel that risk biting into her options.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—successfully merging timelines/anchoring the ferry—is stated, but the pressure around it is soft. There’s no real opposition or escalation; once Lina decides to anchor in the grotto, every described step proceeds smoothly to success. Her internal conflict (fear, doubt, competing values) is essentially absent, so there’s little sense of trade-off or foreclosed path. As a result, the climax reads as a ritual completion rather than a pressured choice with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    There is a clear escalation from quiet weaving to systemic rupture: the wrong connection, the gallery’s rejection, then the flood. The dominant stake (how far one can manipulate connection without violence to the system) is compelling but remains largely conceptual; Mira’s personal jeopardy and the gallery’s “health” feel more implied than materially tested. Because she remains serenely accepting, the sense of cost at the peak is muted, even though options are meaningfully reconfigured. The conflict is intriguing and coherent, but not yet searing.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether starlight navigation can be made meaningful and transmissible in a world that will never see the sky—is clear but primarily internal and philosophical. Pressure escalates gently: from Mara’s private curiosity, to the Tethian elder’s quasi-disapproval (“You seek what cannot be seen”), to the teaching experiment that culminates in Corin forming Ursa Major. This does narrow options conceptually (they must carry stars inside or lose them entirely), but the cost remains more implied than dramatized—no relationship or material path is visibly sacrificed. The conflict is thoughtful and coherent rather than tense, which is apt for the piece but keeps stakes relatively soft.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—whether faint pulses belong to the dead or to someone in immediate danger—emerges clearly and tightens with the crash and discovery of the man. There is a meaningful escalation from quiet listening to urgent physical intervention. Still, the conflict lacks a hard trade-off or deeper moral calculus; once the man appears, the correct course is obvious and unambiguous. The internal and external stakes align smoothly, perhaps too safely for a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stakes—Marek’s need to stand by the erased dead versus the real risk of drowning/panic—are clear early and escalate coherently with the rising tide. The ticking-clock constraint and collapsing air pockets provide genuine pressure, and Marek’s choice to stay present for seven seconds functions as the main tightening beat. Internal and external conflicts interweave effectively, though the external hazard never quite forces a specific trade-off beyond “stay for a bit vs. leave.” A sharper moment where time pressure meaningfully threatens the witnessing (e.g., cutting it even closer) would heighten the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming a livable identity and meaning after being misfiled as dead—is signaled early and coherently tied to her efforts with the ghost. Pressure does tighten as she moves from static listening to actively tracing ink, merging shard with terminal, and finally accepting the ghost’s mirror claim about her heart. However, the conflict remains largely internal and contemplative; there is little sense of risk if she fails, and no real competing obligation or cost beyond emotional discomfort. The escalation is sufficient for a quiet piece but not especially bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—giving stone-grief a comprehensible voice before the language vanishes—is signaled early and tightened as speakers dwindle to “three… two… one.” Escalation comes through intensifying attempts (copper resonance → tunnel → birds-as-syntax) and the recognition that the perfect translation is unintelligible, a real conceptual defeat. Costs are clear: the language is irretrievably lost as a human inheritance, and she pays with exhaustion, isolation, and eventually her life. The conflict is more fated than agonistic, so tension is quietly existential rather than sharply contested, which slightly softens the sense of escalating jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Lyn remains trapped in bitterness or surrenders to the untamed harmony—is legible, and her choice to press the arrowhead to her chest and then use it as a key provides at least one meaningful tightening. Yet opposition is very soft: nothing resists her transformation except the implied inertia of her old state, so pressure rarely sharpens into concrete risk or dilemma. Elian’s metamorphosis happens almost in parallel rather than forcing her hand in a difficult way. The result is a graceful drift into resolution rather than a felt trial with a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—restoring living hearts/beauty versus submission to mechanical control—is clear early and tightens when the clocktower actively fights back. Elara’s choice to fully align her heart with the locust rhythm, risking petrification, is a credible escalation driven by her agency. Internal and external conflicts interweave well as her personal risk unlocks a collective transformation. The danger could feel even sharper with a bit more on-page sense of what permanent failure or her loss would concretely mean.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stakes—getting a message across a lethal border and partially redeeming a broken promise—are clear and intertwined. Escalation is present but gentle: preparation → launch under sensor threat → successful slip-through; there’s no real reversal or near-failure, so tension never quite peaks. Internal and external conflicts do speak to one another (contraband skills repurposed for atonement), but the danger remains mostly atmospheric, not concretely tested. The resolution is earned yet somewhat low-friction, keeping this below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the dead circus/train can be revived through Silas’s work and belief—is clear but lightly pressured. There is minimal opposition: the “stubborn bolt” and rust are described, yet nothing escalates beyond gentle persistence, and the wrong-turn discovery defuses rather than heightens tension. The song and halo activation function as a turn, but they don’t force a trade-off or visible loss. As a result, stakes feel more contemplative than urgent; the piece fares better as a mood lyric than as conflict-driven fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—recovering and reawakening the zeroth volume / source of stories—is present and followed through, and there is one clear escalation when the scarf’s topology reshapes the shelves and opens the portal. However, the journey features no real obstacle, trade-off, or moral calculus; the ritual works on the first try, and no alternative path or risk is foregrounded. Internal and external conflicts don’t truly test her commitment; her success feels preordained rather than hard-earned. Consequently, tension is more atmospheric than pressured, limiting the sense of cost even as the conceptual stakes are large.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—retrieve the dream before it dissolves in daylight—is legible early, and the dissolving bridge offers a meaningful tightening that forces her to trade “capture” for “translation.” Her agency clearly drives turns via choices about when and how to shoot, and whether to make a cage or a vessel. However, the conflict remains gentle and mostly uncontested; success feels likely throughout, with limited sense that failure would truly cost her beyond a generalized loss. The emotional and thematic stakes are present but could be sharpened with one more tangible or risky on-page test of her new stance.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether the mother’s imprisoned truth can be freed from the hair—is clear but not seriously in doubt once Merrin accepts the job. The main “tightening” is the approach of twilight and the star, plus the destabilizing, disorienting ritual that briefly makes the world tilt. However, there’s little sense of real risk or potential failure, and the woman pays no visible price beyond cathartic weeping and the weight of inherited truth. The conflict remains mostly contemplative, so tension is pleasing but gentle rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—regaining his missing memories—guides every step, and the middle complications (wrong season, improvised spore cultivation) provide a clear tightening. His agency drives all major turns, from climbing the *Mariana* to inventing a workaround for the missing mushroom. The ultimate price, however, is primarily conceptual: disillusionment about the value of solving every mystery, rather than any hard external loss or moral bind. Consequently, tension reads as steady and intriguing rather than genuinely fraught, which holds it just shy of the strongest band.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—the archivist’s choice between returning from exile and remaining to mentor Lin—is legible and introduced early via her conditional freedom. Pressure deepens mainly when Lin asks “Will this set you free?” which tightens the emotional frame around that stake. However, escalation remains mostly internal and contemplative; we never feel a narrowing of options beyond “stay or go,” nor is there a strong sense of deadline or consequence if she chooses differently. The result is emotionally persuasive but somewhat low-tension for the level of thematic ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether wonder can be preserved before worlds go fully grey—is clear and felt, and the danger of essence-capture theoretically sharpens that. However, resistance remains mostly conceptual; nothing seriously threatens her attempt once she starts, and we don’t see specific failures, near-losses, or costs to particular sources beyond the general statement that they’re left “emptier.” Escalation is largely a matter of duration and scale rather than tightening options. The emotional and ethical tension could be pushed harder in-scene to move this into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will risk the forbidden unravelling to free and ground the sailors and herself—is clear and escalates as each knot reveals a deeper, more personal layer of loss. Her admission “I was afraid” marks a meaningful tightening, and the final decision to house the spirits in her bones and in future masks carries a visible emotional price. However, the forbidding of the method never manifests as concrete danger or real possibility of harm beyond guilt, so the sense of risk remains mostly internal and thematic rather than sharply pressured. Tension thus stays strong but not quite at white-heat.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how she will uncover and honor the chapel—is clear but largely internal and contemplative. The main tightening comes when she shifts from rumor to investigation via the silent footage and then to opening the hidden door, which does reconfigure her options. Yet the path is low-friction; there’s no serious risk of failure, harm, or moral cost challenging her method or values. The piece functions more as a lyrical unfolding than a pressured conflict, limiting the felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—how to relate to loss without being trapped by it—is clear and coherent, with Mort’s line (“melancholy doesn’t care about equations”) sharpening the pressure. Escalation is quiet but present: Cassian moves from measurement to insight to a redefinition of letting go, culminating in the choice to treat the globe as artifact rather than prison. The cost is conceptual rather than dramatic, but it is legible: he surrenders the illusion that understanding will fully neutralize grief. The piece could edge higher with one more concrete, felt test of his resolve under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—giving voice to the ghost and unspoken needs—remains clear, and there is a mild escalation from solitary encoding to citywide awakening and final release. Yet the path from problem to solution is almost frictionless: there’s no real risk that the ghost won’t be heard, no opposing force, and the “storm” functions as a backdrop rather than a true threat. The scribe’s intervention feels like a foregone extension of the pattern rather than a pressured turning point. As a result, tension is gentle and largely conceptual, not gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Kai’s service contained mutual, meaningful joy beneath the captain’s visible anguish—is clear early and tightens as the diary reveals increasingly intimate observations. The pressure escalates texturally rather than through sharp reversals: moving from abstract curiosity to concrete, emotionally risky knowledge as each floor passes, culminating in the terminal diagnosis entry. Kai’s final action (leaving the goggles, accepting an affectionate but bounded grief) is a credible renunciation with a felt cost. However, there’s little resistance or friction in the process; everything unfolds smoothly, which modestly blunts tension.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stakes—preserving and vindicating her atmospheric-emotion theory and Thorne’s true story, with survival as secondary—are signaled early and paid off. However, the pressure does not significantly tighten: once the cable breaks, she moves relatively unimpeded to secure the tapes and record her testimony, and the promised rescue undercuts existential risk. There is no moment where she must sacrifice one value for another or truly endanger herself for the data. The result is a beautifully textured piece with relatively static conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—creating the sky mural before demolition—has a clear temporal pressure and is signaled early. Escalation is modest but present: the approach of dawn and the siren, the walls flickering, and the building shuddering all tighten the window and clarify that his work may not “survive.” However, Kael’s agency is largely in the decision to proceed and then to let go; there’s no real on-page test or reversal that forces a hard trade-off beyond accepting inevitable loss. The conflict feels emotionally sincere but somewhat soft-edged for top-tier markets.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—securing a map-worthy discovery and thus a place among great cartographers—is clearly declared but only lightly pressured. Once Elara spots the hopscotch pattern, every step succeeds without friction: Kess agrees, the airship flies, the valley yields its secret, and there is no on-page risk, sacrifice, or doubt. There is a conceptual tightening (from legend to confirmed phenomenon and legacy), but no meaningful escalation or trade-off. The result is pleasant wonder rather than tension.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is largely notional: there is a locked heart of the hall and a “shattered silence,” but no strong antagonistic force or real resistance. Each step—the prophecy, the uncapping, the path, the keyhole—unfolds without setback, doubt, or trade-off; nothing she tries even threatens to fail. The dominant stake (mending time/silence) never feels jeopardized, and no option is foreclosed at a visible price. As a result, escalation is minimal and the ending reads as a gentle completion rather than a hard-won resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—reviving and sustaining the orchard before drought—is clear, but pressure is consistently low and largely uncontested. Once the bell is used, solutions unfold smoothly, with no significant resistance, trade-off, or failed attempt. The ghost’s fading could function as a price, yet he vanishes contentedly and the community suffers no real loss in capability. Escalation is more a gentle widening of scope (initial drought threat, then another season) than a tightening that forces hard choices.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—securing one final merciful moment at the end of time—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure tightens as she chooses to use the boy’s puppet head as the axis, encodes the lullaby as geometry, and then lets the pattern collapse, sacrificing the object and her prior stance. Tension is more contemplative than visceral, so the escalation reads as deepening rather than sharply narrowing options. The cost is present but not sharply dramatized as a wrenching dilemma, which softens the felt intensity despite the cosmic scale.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—save the travelers before frost/birds kill them—arrives early and escalates through the approaching night and visible frost creep. External pressure (time, hostile environment) and internal pressure (her wish to be free of duty vs. her inherited code) braid effectively. Her agency in placing each nut and deploying the last, worn one at the exit gives the climax a clear, character-driven price. The conflict stays strong but narrowly scoped; a sharper sense of what true failure would do to her psyche or world could deepen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.2)
    The central stake—whether Elena remains trapped in frozen grief or finds a form of connection—is clear but faces little genuine opposition on the page. Tension rises modestly as she approaches the act of releasing the chrysalis and as the foam triggers insight, yet there’s no strong reversal or moment where a competing choice is seriously weighed. Once she recognizes the foam–polymer analogy, progress to lab success is almost frictionless. As a result, escalation feels more like a smooth gradient than a pressured narrowing of options with a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—liberation from one’s own calcified narrative to recover a beginning—is clear and develops from the first woman to the vendor herself. Pressure escalates gently rather than sharply: the montage of customers broadens the scale, and the main tightening is the vendor contemplating then rejecting incising her own story. The birth-pain versus relief contrast gives the incisions some cost, but conflict remains more philosophical than viscerally tense. The final stance (to stay at the threshold) is an earned renunciation, but the trade-off could be dramatized with more on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether and how to remove the woman’s remorse—is clear and sharpened by the late realization that full smoothing would erase the daughter, reframing the core action as an ethical dilemma. Escalation comes through both density (moving pool to pool, increasing emotional weight) and a concrete turning point: absorbing the stalactite of sorrow that nearly drops him. The cost is explicit: his own heart cracking, becoming a vessel for two lives’ regrets, with no easy relief. Conflict is primarily internal and moral rather than oppositional, and a hint more external constraint could heighten tension, but what’s here is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether a divided town can be brought into harmonic community—is clear and present throughout. Pressure escalates gently as Elara moves from solitary preparation to public singing to the festival. However, resistance is minimal; there are no real setbacks or antagonistic forces, so tension remains low-grade and largely thematic rather than situational. The final “turn” is more a culmination of effort than a tested, high-cost decision.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes are conceptually large (restoring abandoned dreams, risking self-erasure) but remain abstract in scene; nothing on the page seriously threatens failure or forces a hard trade-off. The closest to escalation is the canyon trembling and the acknowledgment that “the modifier becomes modified,” yet she glides through acceptance with no real resistance or competing impulse. As a result, pressure feels steady rather than tightening. The piece reads more as an extended meditation than a conflict-driven arc.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—retrieve the combinations before gravity rights itself and she’s trapped—is clear and time-bounded. Yet every step unfolds without genuine resistance: the grotto yields its secrets as soon as she shines the prism, and her escape succeeds on the first attempt. Tension is mostly declared (“had to…or risk being trapped”) rather than dramatized through failures, trade-offs, or painful choices. As a result, escalation feels linear rather than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the sculptor can draw music out of a silent world—is present but faces minimal resistance; once she decides to play, the hum blooms almost immediately. There is a gentle escalation from personal discovery to world-level resonance (animals and wind reacting), but no true narrowing of options or hard trade-off. The internal conflict (risk of breaking the silence versus answering it) is underdeveloped on the page. As a result, tension remains low, more meditative than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—how Kael will honor or redeem the broken covenant with Mira before the eclipse seals it—is clear and present early. Pressure escalates modestly through the time constraint and his deepening engagement with the nexus’s pulses toward his final act of renunciation. However, the conflict remains largely internal and contemplative, with no sharp on-page test or countervailing force that forces a painful trade-off beyond what is summarized in memory. The cost is felt but not dramatically contested, which keeps tension strong but not bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—recovering a memory / unlocking the diary via her strange craft—is clear, but opposition is gentle and the solution arrives without significant complication. The main tightening comes when the father’s voice emerges and resonates with the clasp, but there’s little sense that failure would cost her something concrete beyond mild regret. The later choice to invite the neighbor in is nice but risk-light, more an extension of her new stance than a pressured decision. As a result, tension feels steady rather than escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—Elias creating a tincture that embodies serenity within motion—is clearly stated but never seriously threatened. There is no substantive obstacle, moral trade-off, or risk: the experiment works on first try, the minstrel is instantly helped, and the village adopts the tincture without complication. As a result, pressure barely escalates, and no option is foreclosed with cost. The piece functions more as a lyrical meditation than as a conflict-driven story.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering the orchards’ secret of resilience before the hour ends—is clear and present throughout. There is one meaningful deepening when she enters the central arch and finds the raw, dangerous-seeming cyclone of seeds and the single scarred seed that reframes everything. However, the journey is largely unopposed: the “curse” is quickly reframed as misunderstanding, and nothing on the page truly threatens her life, mission, or relationships. As a result, escalation feels more like steady revelation than pressure that forces costly trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.8)
    The main pressure is conceptual—understanding and preventing a rare convergence—rather than immediate danger, which keeps tension relatively low despite the ominous silence and implied future risk. There is some escalation as she detects the venturi spike and reinterprets the environment as a looming hazard, prompting her to hurry and commit to mapping and publication. Still, no live opposition or sharp trade-off tests her resolve, and the stakes remain largely hypothetical. The conflict functions but doesn’t yet feel gripping or costly enough for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether wonder can be unfettered and proven essential—is stated early, but the on-page conflict is surprisingly gentle. Once the chisel strikes and the bells ring, the hush fractures without real resistance, and Lyra never faces a hard choice or visible risk. There’s one main escalation (the hush cracking as more bells join), yet no meaningful trade-off or threatened loss if she fails. The result feels more like a foregone ritual than a pressured test of commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether he will face or flee his catastrophic failure and the dangerous power of the flute—is clear and threads the piece. Pressure tightens when he actually plays the flute, opening the seam and confronting him with the vault and missing relic; this forces a meaningful choice between pursuing the fracture or returning. His decision to stop playing, accept the flute as burden, and walk back via the markers is an earned renunciation with conceptual cost but limited on-page jeopardy. The conflict remains largely internal and meditative, with stakes felt more spiritually than viscerally, which holds the piece back from higher tension bands.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Cassian can reduce empathy to manipulable mathematics—escalates as he moves from one subject to two and then faces the unintended reversal of the transposition. The cost surfaces in his hollowed state, the halo fragment’s depletion, and the cosmic-scale echo of vanishing stars, which deepen the sense of risk beyond a mere intellectual exercise. However, the tension stays largely conceptual; there’s little sense of immediate danger or high-stakes failure beyond his own disappointment and disorientation. The piece achieves one clear deepening turn (the empathy reversal), but does not fully exploit the ethical or interpersonal stakes its premise suggests.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the courier can transform routine duty into genuine wonder and how he relates to his mentor’s legacy—is clear but gentle. The encounter with the child and the decision to use the pendant on the frozen ground and then give it away provide a single meaningful tightening. However, there is little resistance or real risk: the pendant’s loss doesn’t bite on the page, the child’s problem yields quickly, and the “routine delivery” to the observatory proceeds unaffected. As a result, tension is more atmospheric than truly escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—proving or redefining her theory—is legible early and narrows as she discovers the prism’s anomalous behavior. Pressure escalates through a single but meaningful deepening: the experiment ceases to be purely observational and requires her to risk psychic permeation and professional legibility. The realization that she must become “porous and receiving” and later relinquish the prism to the car forecloses clear options (clean data, ownership of discovery). The conflict is almost entirely internal and contemplative, so the tension remains quiet rather than razor-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mei can carry Lin’s message and repair silence at the cost of her own memories—is clear and crescendos at the weaving sequence. Pressure builds through the puzzle’s partial completion and the reveal of the missing piece showing Mei and her baby, which smartly reframes what’s truly at risk. The actual sacrifice beat is powerful conceptually but somewhat montage-like; Mei’s loss of memories reads as a graceful process more than a pressured, contested decision with reversals. The conflict thus deepens meaningfully but remains relatively smooth, with limited on-page resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    The core stake—saving the arches/orchards at the price of something deeply personal—is clear early and deepens when Ren learns of the required barter. There is a meaningful tightening at the heart-chamber where the abstract “price” becomes concretely his inheritance and his relationship to meekness. However, external danger (the mines, possible failure) feels low-pressure, so the escalation is primarily conceptual and emotional; a bit more friction or risk in the descent would sharpen stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.3)
    The external stake (the rift swallowing the bay and spilling chaos into her world) is high and clearly stated, and the pressure does nominally rise as the rift grows more urgent. But Lira encounters little real resistance: once she understands the shard’s function, the weaving proceeds without misstep, sacrifice, or serious risk. The cost is mostly conceptual (inheriting the burden) rather than felt as a hard choice under fire, so escalation is more notional than visceral. This makes the climax effective but not gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving the lighthouse’s promise of safety, including for an unseen correspondent and a restless ghost—is clear from the lamp’s failure onward. Pressure escalates modestly via the growing ghostly presence and the symbolic risk that the sanctuary’s implicit contract might be broken. Caleb’s choice to bottle the sea glass and reaffirm the letter ritual is a genuine, if quiet, narrowing of options that re-commits him to this burden of care. The conflict remains largely internal and atmospheric, so tension is felt but never truly sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake is clear—guiding a lost ship through a literal and metaphorical storm—and there is one meaningful tightening when she notices the desperate signal and actively re-aims the light while invoking prophecy. However, the conflict never feels genuinely fraught: there’s no serious doubt she will succeed, no competing imperative, and no visible price for using her power. Internal and external pressures are aligned rather than in tension, so the story resolves smoothly but without a strong sense of sacrifice or narrowing options. The storm’s abating feels almost effortless instead of hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the master can understand why certain people magnetize stories and what their donor heart means—is clear but remains largely internal and philosophical. Pressure does increase at the stranger’s arrival and the donor-memory flood, which reweights the master’s quest and leads to a new stance. However, the master is never forced into a hard trade-off or visibly costly decision; the revelation arrives as grace rather than something fought for or risked. The result is a gentle escalation that works for lyric fiction but lacks the sharper narrowing of options or moral friction expected at top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether sorrow can be understood and transformed into something like hope—is clear, and the story does escalate from quiet maintenance to metaphysical intervention (opening the sealed door). However, pressure is gentle: each step works smoothly once the legend is invoked, and there is no significant risk of failure or moral trade-off. The key tightening is the realization that quantified sorrow can be deconstructed into a key, but that shift costs Elara little beyond concentration and awe. As a result, tension remains more contemplative than truly fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes—rekindling a dying realm versus sacrificing his remaining memory—are clear and scale appropriately for the piece. There is a meaningful escalation when singing the Hymn turns from tentative act to realm-altering ritual that consumes him. However, the pressure remains largely abstract and ceremonial; there’s little sense of risk or possible failure in the moment beyond the declared cost, and no concrete opposition or complication beyond “endless night.” The conflict reads more as an inevitable rite than as a contested struggle, which limits tension.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will remain hidden in her isolation or answer the invitation—is clear, but the conflict remains largely internal and contemplative with limited visible escalation. The ticking clock (11:47, 11:53, 11:59) and the temptation to hide the invitation again provide some tightening. However, potential costs of joining (risk of exposure, change in routine, threat to the shop) are only implied, so the decision reads more like a philosophical alignment than a pressured trade-off. The mirror reveal is a helpful turn but feels more like a thematic device than a hard test of her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether ordinary, sacred textures of communal life will vanish unnoticed—is clearly signaled early and deepens as Mara shifts from solitary tending to a communal act of witness. The key tightening is her choice to “uncloak” her purpose and implicate the onlookers, transforming passive observation into shared responsibility. However, opposition is mostly conceptual and offstage; no one resists her, and there’s little sense that any option is truly foreclosed beyond the emotional cost of facing loss. As a result, the conflict is poignant but remains quiet and low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—preventing the library’s dissolution into oblivion—is clear, but the on-page pressure is abstract and gentle. There is a nominal escalation as the light dims and frequencies grow unstable, prompting recalibration and a finer-resolution measurement. Yet the discovery of the harmonic and the projection of the vow feel relatively frictionless, with no serious setback or trade-off. The only cost is conceptual (it’s temporary), so tension remains low and mostly atmospheric rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—the survival of the “truce of hush” and the hidden market—is clearly stated, and the conflict escalates from failed warnings to direct sabotage attempts to a more subtle recording strategy. The two explicit false starts create a nice pattern of rising commitment. However, the external opposition remains soft: the stranger never suspects her, and there’s little immediate danger of discovery or punishment, so cost and risk feel more conceptual than visceral. The outcome is never seriously in doubt, which slightly flattens peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will cling to mechanical proof or accept a more irreducible, emergent system—is legible from early on and culminates in her giving up the ring and the report. Pressure escalates through the foretold convergence and the weather-carrier’s explanation, which directly challenges Elara’s framework. However, the conflict is almost entirely internal and philosophical, with little sense of risk, urgency, or alternative outcomes beyond her private stance. That quietness is well executed but limits the felt cost and sharpness of the turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she will remain blocked or re-engage her art in the shadow of grief—is clear and coherently tracked. Pressure escalates mainly through her repeated failure with the lock and the emotional frustration that forces her to draw on memory in a new way. Still, the conflict remains relatively low-friction and internal, with limited sense of risk beyond the thematic; her resistance to drawing could be tested more sharply on the page. The resolution is earned but feels somewhat inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is emotional and conceptual—can she locate and reclaim lost honest conversations, and what does that do to her—and it does drive her decisions. However, external conflict is very light: the guard scene is the only overt obstacle, and it resolves quickly once she tells the truth. Internal pressure (her regret over past dishonesty) is mostly reflective, not dramatized as live dilemma, so escalation feels more like smooth deepening than a tightening with cost. The result is satisfying but relatively low in tension.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether wonder can be preserved in a graying world—is clear, but conflict is largely conceptual and gently paced. The main tightening arrives with the child’s first encounter and the tuner’s realization that the work is transmission rather than mere preservation. There is little sense of jeopardy or competing options; her path feels foregone rather than pressured. The piece gains depth rather than sharp escalation, which softens tension despite the beauty of the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the caretaker can transform chaotic static and inherited fear into something contained and livable—is clear and escalates as the magnetic shift intensifies and systems fail. Tension builds from internal noise and environmental threat toward the decisive choice to exploit the glitch and start a fire in a forbidden space. However, opposition is mostly ambient rather than actively resisting; nothing concrete nearly goes wrong with the burn, so the price feels more implied than sharply tested. The internal and external conflicts are well braided but could use one sharper moment of risk or near-loss.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stakes—saving the courtyard / proving the value of listening—are signaled clearly and do intensify once external development pressure appears. The investigation structure provides an apparent escalation (more stories, key discovery, confrontation with past). Yet obstacles are minimal: clues arrive with little resistance, the key fits immediately, the community unites quickly, and the developer’s advance is halted off-page without a hard trade-off. The result is emotionally satisfying but low-friction, with limited sense of genuine peril or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—survive and escape the drowned lab—is clear from the outset, and there is a discernible tightening from private encoding to the high-risk final dance that triggers a literal flood. However, antagonistic pressure is largely offstage; the AI never adapts or resists, and no attempt fails or forces a change of tactic. As a result, the plan feels almost frictionless, with minimal on-page cost or reversal at the climax beyond the abstract danger of drowning. The piece reads more as a triumphant unveiling of a clever method than as a genuine test of resolve under escalating threat.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—retrieving a specific memory for Mara against the backdrop of a town where grief literally distorts reality—is clear and charged early. Pressure escalates from domestic unease to occult research to physically taxing traversal of the densest gravity pockets and finally the dangerous, unstable chamber. However, the opposition never quite bites back; his method (coffee grounds → exact piling → chamber → correct crystal) works with relatively little resistance or trade-off beyond physical strain. The resolution feels earned but not rigorously tested, which keeps pressure just short of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—a prophecy of a mind-wiping flood—is signaled clearly, and pressure mounts as Elias moves from the first crane toward the twentieth and then the final placement while the brook “fights back.” The tactical escalation (following the flow backward, deeper listening, the brook quickening) reads as a meaningful tightening, with the final crane’s wing in the water as the key turn. However, the cost of failure or partial failure never becomes viscerally felt on the page; the danger remains conceptual and slightly distant. His personal risk is limited to fatigue and doubt, which keeps the conflict powerful in idea but relatively contained in felt intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    The core stake—whether the building’s erased history will survive the coming renovation—emerges clearly once Mrs. Voss says “They’re planning to renovate.” Pressure escalates from curiosity to a quiet crisis of preservation, culminating in Alex pressing the seal into fresh plaster. The conflict is primarily conceptual and atmospheric rather than sharply adversarial; no antagonist appears on the page, and the renovation remains offstage. While this low-key pressure suits the piece’s lyric mode, the felt risk and cost at the climax could be a notch sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—preserving her sister’s consciousness before dawn vs clinging to rational detachment—is clear and sustained throughout. Pressure tightens as the last star trembles and Elara moves from analysis to embodied participation (kneeling, speaking, releasing). The cost is her surrender of pure skepticism and the defenses built from isolation, made explicit when the archive completes only through her release. However, the conflict remains largely internal and somewhat smooth; there’s little on-page pushback or failed attempt before the final surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake (silently toppling the tyrant by subverting his seal) is clear, and there is one substantive tightening when the hidden mechanism is discovered and used. However, there is virtually no resistance: no security, magical mishap, or emotional hesitation tests her resolve. Stakes are declared as empire-shaping, but the on-page pressure feels calm and assured rather than risky. As a result, the treason reads as precise but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—whether she can understand and preserve certain echoes, especially her lost love’s—is clear, but pressure remains mostly abstract, with little sense of real risk if she fails beyond generalized sorrow. Discovery of the “conspiracy of silence” promises higher stakes, yet those actors never appear or actively oppose her; their threat is conceptual rather than dramatized. The emotional turn when she hears her lover’s name and chooses to sing his story is the lone strong escalation beat. Overall, the conflict never quite tightens; it deepens lyrically without forcing sharply constrained decisions or visible costs.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—securing and delivering one last pure moment for Elias—is clear from early on and does intensify toward the retrieval of the pristine globe. However, conflict is largely frictionless: the wreck yields to her efforts without real resistance, and Elias exerts no opposing will. The most interesting tension—the ethical cost of withholding the truth about his mother—stays underdeveloped and untested. As a result, escalation reads more as a sequence of lyrical tasks than as a tightening of real pressure or narrowed options.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are almost entirely thematic—whether hidden effort and subtle craft will be perceived—so tension remains low. The villagers’ dismissal is mentioned but never embodied in a scene, and the philosopher never risks more than quiet solitude. Kael’s adoption of the method is the main turn, yet it comes with minimal resistance or sacrifice beyond a shift in perspective. The final broadened influence (“season of revelation”) reads as gentle deepening, not an escalation with a palpable price.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—exposing the truth about STILLPOINT and the liquidation’s real purpose versus preserving the protective lie that sustains the council’s power—is clear and escalates logically as Elias uncovers more. The meaningful tightening comes with the realization that settlers are “living shields” and the imminent storm that frames his decision to reveal the stillpoint now. However, almost all opposition remains anticipatory; we never see the council or settlers push back on the page, so the conflict is more conceptual than dramatically contested. That keeps the pressure persuasive but not fully visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.0)
    The core stake—Atlas choosing between obedience to the Council and fidelity to the prophetic transmissions/future—is clearly signaled and resolved when he commits treasonous broadcast and vanishes. Pressure does escalate via the unusually clear prophecies, the mapped rise of a prophet, and the impending arrival of enforcers by dawn. However, conflict remains primarily internal and conceptual; there is no on-page confrontation or tangible setback that forces a painful tactical shift. The cost is implied (treason, abandonment of post, future pursuit) more than concretely dramatized, keeping tension strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stakes—whether she can turn loss into a preservable, shareable resource and thus earn redemption—are clear and do deepen as she moves from private salvage to communal conduit. Escalation is primarily conceptual: from capturing one melody to building an archive to releasing everything in a risky, overwhelming solstice symphony. However, there is little resistance, jeopardy, or meaningful alternative path; every experiment works, and others accept her gift easily. The lack of friction or a moment where she might lose or misuse these memories keeps the conflict textured but relatively low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—protecting the sacred artifact and resolving the lethal grief-frequency under the ice—is legible early and threads cleanly through the encounter. Escalation is clear: initial measurement of 7.8 Hz → emergence and threat from the shadow-thing → tactical choice to match vibration and use the key and flute in concert. Her agency is decisive in shaping the outcome, and internal conflict (logic vs sorrow) colors how she engages, though the battle tips in her favor fairly swiftly, with minimal sense of real risk or potential failure. The emotional and ethical stakes are strong, but a sharper price or nearer brush with loss would elevate the pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes—freeing a community from the tyrant’s manufactured crises—are high and signaled clearly, and Elara’s timed activation of the viaduct is an effective conceptual turn. However, the conflict is mostly one-sided: the tyrant and enforcers remain offstage and never seriously threaten to disrupt her plan, and nothing goes wrong on the way to success. Internal pressure (the pull of impatience) is asserted but not tested in real time, so there’s no sharp trade-off or live option foreclosed in the scene itself. As a result, tension accrues more as atmospheric expectation than as escalating, risky confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central stake—truth and worker safety versus career/physical risk under Voss’s control—is clear from early on and tightens as she uncovers sabotage and the ignored report. Escalation comes primarily from accumulating evidence and mounting pressure from Voss’s repeated calls, culminating in her decision to ignore him and go over his head. The external conflict remains mostly offstage (Voss is a voice, not a body in the space), which keeps the tension more conceptual than visceral. Still, the narrowing of options is evident and the final refusal feels like a genuine test of commitment rather than a formality.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—can anything meaningful and deserving be made from irrevocable harm—is clear and present early via Elias’s message. Pressure deepens as the chaplain wonders if the repair “matters” and waits to see whether the mechanism can sing, with the music’s emergence functioning as the key tightening. Still, the conflict remains relatively low-friction; there’s little sense that failure or refusal is a live option once the chaplain enters the shop. The result is emotionally potent but more meditative than tense.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—enabling the workshop’s yearning algorithm to manifest its bell—is clear, and there is a discernible escalation from routine maintenance to temporal resonance. However, pressure stays mostly conceptual; Zephyr never must choose between her bell and the workshop’s safety or her own survival in a way that closes off options. The buoyancy manipulation and ascent toward toxic clouds hint at danger but don’t culminate in a felt trade-off or sacrifice. As a result, the story reads as a beautiful unfolding rather than a tested commitment under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—recovering suppressed truth about the missing engineers versus corporate erasure—is clear but largely conceptual, with little concrete jeopardy. There is one major tightening beat (her decision to forge the clearance token and access the vault), and another when she chooses to upload the video externally and erase logs. However, no path is visibly foreclosed with cost: the corporation’s surveillance, potential punishment, or personal risk never come onstage as active pressure. As a result, tension remains steady but modest rather than truly escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—whether the community will regain the ability to navigate the ice safely—is clear, and it tightens when Kael declares the need for a volunteer whose empathy outweighs self-preservation. The boy’s step forward functions as the primary turn, interweaving external survival stakes with an internal ethical test. However, resistance is relatively minimal: the volunteer appears quickly, and the blood cost (a single drop) feels almost symbolically light, so the sense of hard trade-off is muted. The result is a meaningful but somewhat soft-edged escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she moves toward death or recommits to life through service—is clear and present early. Escalation is mostly internal, with the loud crack in the ice and the temptation to “almost turn back” serving as the main pressure spike before she joins the volunteers. Her final decision to work rather than walk into the ice is a genuine narrowing of options with implied cost, but the pull of death could be embodied a bit more viscerally to heighten tension. As it stands, the progression feels quietly persuasive rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—how to respond to the remnant of a mismatched love and his own echoing ache—is coherent but under-pressured. There is no real opposition or risk beyond the possibility of doing nothing; his choices (keep, wander, write, bury) face no meaningful obstacles or trade-offs. Escalation is mostly a deepening of reflection and metaphor density rather than any narrowing of options. As a result, the ending feels gently resonant but not earned through tested commitment or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—preserve the echo of wisdom—is stated early but remains largely conceptual, with no concrete antagonist or real on-page resistance. The ritual proceeds without complication; the parapet responds quickly, the clearings form, and consecration succeeds with no apparent risk or trade-off. Escalation is minimal: awareness → summoning → consecration is a straight, untroubled line. As a result, tension never tightens in a way that forecloses options or forces a felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict is largely implicit and historical: the factory’s closure and communal grief exist as a given rather than as active, escalating pressures. On the page, tension is gentle and meditative; the archivist encounters no resistance and faces no significant trade-offs or live dilemmas as the project succeeds. The “stake”—whether pain can be transformed—is answered affirmatively without much on-page test. Escalation is more a gradual enrichment (more people contributing, the photograph expanding) than a tightening that forces hard choices.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether living, fragile nuances of language and self will persist in a world of sterile digitization and silence—is clear and tightened by the library’s imminent closure. Pressure escalates meaningfully when his own name yields “nothing,” transforming the abstract research question into an immediate existential crisis. His response—frantic reading aloud and then the deliberate act of leaving the crystal and walking out—is a credible, costly stance rather than a neat solution. The conflict remains largely interior and could benefit from one sharper on-page test of what he’s willing to sacrifice (reputation, rule-breaking) before the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether he can “locate” and capture the sound of growing older—remains clear, and tension gently builds as he moves deeper into the garden and finally hears the tidal rumble. The chalk spiral attempt followed by the snap and fading sound provides a genuine tightening and loss. His final stance (accepting that he will forget and letting the tide carry him home) is an earned renunciation with emotional cost. That said, conflict never feels truly pressured or risky, keeping the stakes more contemplative than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes are declared as enormous—the observatory might tear free from the Moon—but the on-page conflict feels serenely controlled, with Kael never truly pressed or forced into trade-offs. The key “escalation” is his choice to restructure time via the clock’s escapement, which works on the first attempt and carries little evident risk or sacrifice. The internal and external stakes align conceptually, but tension never quite tightens; the piece leans more on idea and mood than real pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—reconciling father and estranged daughter before death—is clear and appropriate to the scale. There is a meaningful tightening when the finality of the blood work makes delay impossible, pushing Elara to act. However, once Lena appears, the conflict resolves with almost no resistance: years of silence crack within a few lines, and the reunion proceeds without misstep or complication. The emotional cost is present but not strongly tested; the escalation feels smooth rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—preventing the sealed entity from awakening while understanding shadows—appears early and is consistent. Pressure does increase as she progresses through the loops and the automaton shudders, but she never truly risks failure; there is no genuine near-miss or forced trade-off. The threat of the awakening remains theoretical rather than concretely felt in the scene. As a result, escalation is present but modest, more procedural than harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stake—Elena’s need to confront the harm caused by her certainty and decide whether to dismantle her own legacy—is clear early and deepens as Clara’s belated identification enters. Conflict is primarily moral and conversational, but Moira’s understated challenge (“You built your career on a story that was never true”) heightens pressure and forces a stance. Elena’s request for Moira’s help and admission that it will “undo everything I’ve built” is a real narrowing of options with cost. The scene could gain further intensity from more resistance or friction before Elena embraces that path.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—finding a way to give light without fire—is established early and nominally resolved. Yet there is almost no antagonistic force, internal or external; once she notices the glass, success follows in a straight line, and villagers accept it without friction. The escalation is more in accumulation (from one pearl to many) than in sharpened pressure or cost. This yields a meditative mood but keeps the conflict profile relatively flat for elite-literary expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is Elara’s need to find a livable stance after the viral confession—can she transform a site of betrayal into a space of healing without erasing the cost. Pressure is largely internal and atmospheric; it deepens rather than escalates, and there’s no strong on-page reversal beyond the quiet turn from solitude to imagined community. Her agency is real but gentle: she chooses to keep coming, to cultivate patterns, and finally to plan for other whistleblowers, but none of these choices are sharply contested in scene. As a result, stakes feel conceptually rich yet dramatically low-intensity, keeping the conflict band solid but not high.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether he can confront and release the hopes he once stifled—is legible early and developed through progressively more intimate cameos, culminating with his younger self and the shell cracking open. Escalation is steady in a textural sense, with the ghosts growing more personal and the “closing pages” whisper growing louder. However, the pressure never quite bites; he rarely seems in danger of refusing or failing, and options aren’t sharply foreclosed so much as gently reweighted. As a result, the final choice feels earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central stake—whether the village’s sacred practice and “golden stories” will be lost—is stated clearly and colors the scenes. Yet on the page, Elara encounters almost no resistance: she arrives at the right moment, sings, and succeeds; the vine responds promptly, and the villagers accept the restoration without challenge. There is little tightening of pressure beyond the approaching harvest moon, and no real trade-off or visible price. As a result, tension remains gentle and the resolution feels more inevitable than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether she can translate the heartbeats into a map to reach her child—is clear and maintained. Pressure deepens once the ritual succeeds and she must follow the silver trail into the grove, confronting grief-laden memories. However, the path from ritual to reunion is relatively unopposed; no turn seriously threatens failure, and external obstacles are minimal. The conflict remains primarily internal and atmospheric, which works but limits perceived escalation and on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake is conceptual—how to handle an overload of painful time rather than let the Echo Chamber fail—and that is clear. However, pressure barely escalates: once the overload is identified, there are no meaningful setbacks, alternatives, or visible costs to his new design, just a diligent progression of steps. His agency drives the outcome, but the choice never feels risky or morally fraught; no path is truly foreclosed beyond “repair vs. redesign.” As a result, tension remains mild and largely intellectual.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—escaping a self-made, recursive prison by bearing and measuring her burdens—is clear and focused. Pressure escalates through the sequence of burdens: from the daughter’s voice to pride to the existential weight of unforgiven existence, with each step altering the grotto’s patterns and thickening the hush. The key turn is the final calcification into a single sphere that reveals the trap’s true nature and permits egress, an earned resolution flowing from her sustained agency. Conflict remains mostly internal and ritualized, so the tension is more meditative than sharp, but the cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can turn grief into a livable, tangible form without being trapped by it—is signaled early and maintained. Pressure escalates modestly through the carving and ritual, with the kettle’s boil acting as a soft clock and the placement of the quartz over the lion’s heart as a focal choice. However, there is little sense of real risk or competing options; the process never truly threatens to fail or to cost her in a way that forces a difficult trade-off beyond a gentle emotional shift. The resolution feels coherent and earned but emotionally “safe,” limiting intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.9)
    The central conflict—whether the narrator can move from regretful haunting to an active, self-authored narrative—is clear but relatively low-pressure. The key tightening moment is the new child’s-voice fragment, which catalyzes the clearer apparition and conversation with the ghost. However, the ghost offers guidance with minimal resistance, and the narrator’s hesitation is brief; the emotional price of change is more stated than dramatized. Stakes and escalation are thus present but gentle, keeping this just below strong-pressured territory.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—reviving a dead space to rekindle communal hope—is conceptually strong but never feels truly precarious on the page. There is no meaningful resistance, failure, or trade-off; each engineering move succeeds smoothly and the town’s children embrace the project without hesitation. As a result, pressure doesn’t really escalate; the piece enriches its initial intention rather than tightening it. The ending reweights meaning but not under visible threat or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will continue to be bound by an abandoned dream or relinquish it—is legible early and remains coherent. Pressure escalates as she moves from carrying the chronometer to dismantling to finally refusing to repair it and integrating its parts into the forecourt. The sanctuary’s brief “song” and her realization that her dream is transformed, not destroyed, function as a tightening and release. The conflict is entirely internal and quiet, so tension is more meditative than gripping, but it does culminate in a meaningful, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—salvaging truth from a city built on lies—is signaled, but it remains largely conceptual on the page. Escalation is mild: she notices an anomaly, finds a door, enters, retrieves a map; none of these turns foreclose options or demand a trade-off. There is no antagonistic pressure, risk of loss, or hint that failure would cost her or others anything immediate. As a result, tension stays low and the ending, while structurally complete, lacks real bite.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—can Elara decipher and retrieve the wisp-grass method, proving herself worthy of the weavers’ legacy—is clearly signaled and coherently pursued. Escalation is subtle and mostly internal: the fog thickening, the cold numbing her fingers, and the puzzle of knots deepening as she searches for the final pattern. There’s one meaningful tightening when she finds the sequence that reveals an extinct seed-preservation method, shifting the stakes from abstract to concrete. However, pressure never feels in danger of truly overwhelming her or foreclosing options, so tension remains more contemplative than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—how she will live with and map absence—is clear, but pressure remains gentle throughout. There is some escalation from simply recording absences to performing a ritual, then to writing her own “living obituary” and finally relinquishing the thread. However, she is never truly forced, and no option feels dangerously live; the cost of either clinging or releasing is largely conceptual. The arc reads more as deepening meditation than conflict-driven transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether beauty can be reawakened, and whether this act will heal or destabilize the city—is clear but remains mostly conceptual. Escalation is gentle: the main tightening is the egg finally hatching during a “gear-quake,” yet there’s no serious on-page risk of failure or direct opposition to his project. The potential for the creature to “heal the machine-hearted city or shatter it” is stated rather than tested, and Lysander never faces a real dilemma about, for instance, destroying or hiding his creation. As a result, the conflict has resonance but limited bite; the pressure deepens texturally rather than through hard trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stakes—save the bird and reframe her inheritance—are signaled, but pressure remains low throughout. Maya immediately leans into compassion; there’s no serious risk, opposition, or trade-off, and the grafting/mending process proceeds without complication or doubt. Internal and external conflicts align rather than sharpen each other, so the “test” of her unyielding compassion never genuinely threatens to fail. The result is moving but static, with escalation more implied than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the memories will be freed and the city’s fountains revived—is clear, but the on-page pressure remains gentle. Once the conditions (star alignment, geese’ pause, breadcrumbs) are in place, the latch opens with minimal resistance and no counter-force; we never feel that she might fail, be harmed, or meaningfully trade off anything. Her “sidereal patience” and journey are described but not really dramatized as costly or depleting. As a result, escalation feels more like a graceful unfolding than a tightening, which lowers the conflict score despite the satisfying conceptual turn.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.3)
    The central stake—how to share light without catastrophic “fire” and whether to accept the generational role—emerges clearly and intensifies as she engages with the gear and reinterprets the garden. Escalation is primarily conceptual: the realization that the garden is a Turing machine, then that her legacy can be encoded in petals, then that the cycle is unbroken but transformed. This deepening works under an accumulative lens but remains relatively low-pressure; there is little real sense that she might refuse, fail, or choose a different stance. As a result, the cost is more implied than viscerally felt, which keeps the conflict from fully peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—Kael’s need to find a form that can hold communal grief—is clear and gradually tightened as he moves from generic carvings to the spiral text. The pressure escalates through repetition and deepening (repeated loops of his grandmother’s path, accruing poem fragments, river deaths looming in the background) rather than through sharp reversals. Agency manifests in his choice to abandon conventional gravestone iconography and commit to the spiral design, which carries communal and personal risk, though this risk is more implied than dramatized. The conflict remains largely internal and contemplative, which suits the mode but slightly blunts urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stake—what story of guilt and responsibility Elara will endorse—is explicit early and tightens convincingly once Marten’s inscriptions reframe the storm as a geologic betrayal. The tide’s return provides a concrete ticking clock that forces a stance: erase the confession or carry it down the ridge. The ultimate turn is internal rather than confrontational, but her choice to pocket the handle and re-wind with a new understanding reads as a real, ethically weighted commitment. Escalation is more conceptual than perilous, which slightly softens the felt edge of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the tapestry’s hidden intentions—is clear, but opposition is almost entirely absent, leaving the conflict static. Escalation is mostly a deepening of mood and information as threads are decoded; no meaningful options are foreclosed and no hard trade-off is dramatized. The gardener’s choice to keep returning nightly is gentle Earned Stasis, but the price of this commitment is only lightly implied. As a result, tension and stakes feel modest for a piece aiming at top-tier literary impact.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stakes (settlement survival vs. preserving the ice bridge and elders’ trust) are clear and coherent, and the narrowing of scenarios into one viable thread provides a solid tightening. However, most of the conflict is internal and pre-modeled, with the council scene resolving relatively smoothly once the plan is presented; we get little on-page push or counter-argument from the elders. The pressure therefore feels more intellectually rigorous than viscerally escalating, and the visible price at the decision point remains muted. The long-term transformation is persuasive but somewhat low-drama in the moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—seeding a new story into the world’s silence—is clear but remains mostly conceptual. The main escalation is the realization that the broadcast is a cipher and the discovery of the luminous staves, which modestly tighten urgency. External pressure (forbidden signal, potential discovery) is gestured at rather than dramatized, so there’s little felt risk or trade-off in her choices. The ending doesn’t require a painful sacrifice; it’s more preparation than reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether Elara can fix or hold a feeling of safety—is clear but stays largely internal and abstract. The powdering of the mask is the main tightening beat, briefly offering the illusion that her goal might be realized before it dissolves, which is effective but low-intensity. There are no real alternatives or hard trade-offs on the page; she doesn’t face a moment where she must risk something tangible to pursue or relinquish the mirage. As a result, tension feels more like gentle pressure than true escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—what kind of truth will be preserved under a repressive regime—is clear and scales appropriately to the length. Pressure tightens as Malach moves from abstract competing narratives to the concrete act of encoding, then to immediate danger when patrols arrive mid-act. His agency in choosing “calculus of collapse” over any simple story is meaningful, but the external conflict with the patrol resolves too easily, lessening palpable cost in the moment. The piece still delivers a credible trade-off (personal safety vs preserving method), though more friction on the patrol beat could heighten it.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether these students can risk unlearning hatred enough to make real harmony—is clear and enacted through the exercise of subtracting noise. Pressure coherently intensifies as Marco, then Amina, then the rest add single vulnerable notes, with the imperfect chord as a tangible outcome. However, the conflict remains mostly internal and idealized; resistance and potential failure are gestured at (“defensive jokes,” “practiced slurs”) more than they are felt in scene. The result is a beautifully shaped but relatively low-friction escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—reviving forbidden memory-gardens in defiance of the Order—is stated early and resolved when the fruit appears and is eaten. Escalation is driven more by cosmic timing and intensifying imagery than by tightening choices or visible risk; Mara never faces a true dilemma or setback after committing. The rebellion remains “gentle” to the point of near safety, with no concrete consequence for breaking the law. As a result, tension is atmospheric rather than truly pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is the city’s lost power/wonder, but on-page pressure on Mara is gentle; she is rarely under acute threat or forced into a painful trade-off. The key “escalation” is more of a deepening—realizing the bees failed from lack of wonder, then choosing to activate the honeycomb—rather than a narrowing of options with visible cost. Her agency drives the turn, yet the process feels almost frictionless and assured, with little sense that failure or refusal would hurt her personally. As a result, the story is resonant but not particularly tense, which keeps conflict/stakes from the upper band.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is essentially no conflict: the protagonist wants to sanctify houses, discovers a perfect tool, and every attempt succeeds without resistance. Stakes remain abstract (“why some houses feel alive”) and are never put at risk; nothing and no one pushes back, and no choice forecloses a path. The old woman’s gratitude further softens any potential tension instead of complicating it. As a result, there is almost no escalation or visible price, which undercuts narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the city’s legacy will remain frozen in dogma or open to nuance—is clear and tied to Petra’s decision to broadcast heresy into the foundations. Pressure escalates internally as revelations overturn her lifelong purpose, culminating in her choice to become a “guardian of questions” and to prepare for future divers. However, conflict is almost entirely interior and philosophical; there’s no active resistance or concrete counter-force in the present moment, which keeps the tension from fully tightening. The cost of her choice is implied (abandoning her old identity and embracing permanent, solitary vigilance) rather than sharply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant conflict—whether Elias will break the loop and face his daughter’s death or continue climbing—is clear and sharpened by the rupture’s appearance. Escalation comes through the impossible double six and the revealed one-way nature of the glitch, which forces a real trade-off between closure and self-punishing endurance. The cost of refusing is legible (eternal climb, forfeited chance at finality), and the cost of accepting is conceptually clear. Conflict is primarily internal and cerebral; a bit more on-page strain or micro-loss as he nears the rupture could intensify pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can meaningfully awaken kindness in strangers—is clear but faced with minimal on-page resistance. The only real tightening is the night of the brightest crescent and the test of whether the mural will evoke any response, which Mira’s gesture resolves gently rather than under pressure. There is little sense of alternative paths or serious risk if he fails beyond private disappointment, so escalation feels more like tonal intensification than a true narrowing of options. This softness in conflict keeps the story from reaching higher stakes or a sharper cost.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.8)
    The core stake—rekindling a lost cultural voice for a displaced community—is compelling and clearly signaled. However, the conflict is relatively low-friction: the engineers’ assertion that the freeze is permanent is the only explicit opposition, and it never creates a concrete obstacle beyond being named. Once Liora commits to the ritual, execution proceeds smoothly; there is no genuine risk of failure or painful trade-off dramatized on the page. The harp’s success produces a lovely turn, but the escalation feels more like fulfilling a promise than overcoming mounting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring the lighthouse’s beam to save ships and defy fixed fate—is well signaled and coherently pursued. There is one clear tightening at the tide-turn moment when she must act while the stone’s hunger is weakest. However, obstacles never truly threaten failure: her three nights of work pass without friction, and the ritual itself succeeds on the first try with no visible price beyond fatigue. As a result, tension exists but remains relatively soft for a piece aiming at “flawless” literary intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will be consumed or empowered by the fear entities—is established early via the drowning and oily luminance and tightens effectively when the faces pour out and exhale individualized terrors. The key escalation is Mira’s tactical shift from “What do you want?” to “What frightens you?”, which flips power dynamics and forces the confession. However, once that move is made, the fear’s capitulation feels swift, with limited sense of what she’s truly risking in that moment beyond abstractions. The conflict is strong and coherent, but a sharper on-page price or moment of near-failure under pressure would deepen it.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (preventing the storm from shattering her floating orchard) is clear, and dubbing the storm into dialogue is a strong tactic under that pressure. However, tension is relatively static: once she begins, there is no substantive setback or complication, and each move lands successfully without narrowing options or forcing trade-offs. The storm’s transformation into harmony happens smoothly, so the reader never fully feels the possibility of failure. As a result, escalation reads more like a graceful crescendo than a true testing of her commitment or limits.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to confront the silent watchers and what that knowledge will cost—emerges clearly and escalates through the deciphering, experimentation, and eventual call at the gate. The revelation that understanding the watchers cuts one off from the dreaming city is a credible tightening that redefines the risk of her quest. Still, conflict stays mostly internal and conceptual; there’s little sense of imminent danger or a live alternative path she nearly chooses, which keeps the pressure strong but not crushing.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether to expose a noble lie that has protected a family’s legacy—is clear, but opposition is mostly conceptual and external resistance is soft. Emlyn never seriously wavers or faces visible threat from the family or institution; her colleagues’ “debate” resolves quickly in her favor with little friction. There is one main tightening when she realizes the lie has become a “prison,” but it doesn’t force a costly trade-off on the page. As a result, tension feels low and escalation modest rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will treat the ruins as disposable infrastructure or as vessels of human ambition—is clear early and does tighten as he discovers personal artifacts and begins his clandestine repairs. Conflict is primarily internal and situational (duty vs. memory, Authority vs. forgotten), with one strong turn when he decides to place his own declaration under the cornerstone and later asks for a demolition delay. The cost is conceptual and vocational rather than life-or-death, which fits the tone but keeps tension on the quieter side. A slightly sharper external pressure (e.g., an explicit institutional disincentive) could intensify the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming order and tracing the book’s origins—is clear but largely intellectual and rarely pressured. The main deepening is the alternative hypothesis about deliberate concealment, which adds intrigue but not a concrete dilemma or visible cost. The blackout functions more as mood than as a real constraint; there’s no sense she might fail, be harmed, or lose something dear. As a result, escalation feels more like steady accretion of clues than tightening conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—transforming grief and retrieving the daughter’s breath via cranes—is clear early and steadily intensified as she seeks the right “pitch of innocence,” accepts others’ dreams, and scars herself in the process. Escalation is present (the boy’s dream, the singing crane that stirs the shadow, then the thousandth crane and the diamond lantern), and the price accumulates. However, the pressure mostly deepens rather than confronts her with sharply diverging options or explicit trade-offs; she always continues the same core tactic. As a result, the ending feels earned and weighty but a touch more inevitable than climactically fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can locate and honor the “unused potential” before the window closes—is clear and does tighten around the time pressure and the discovery under the cathedral. The escalation from methodical scanning to the algorithm’s “scream” provides a satisfying beat of intensity. However, the conflict remains largely internal and contemplative; there is little sense of a genuinely risky alternative path (e.g., weaponizing the energy, aborting the scan) that she must consciously foreclose. The result is powerful but somewhat one-note in terms of pressure, more meditative hunt than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering and decoding the chip to unlock a map of belonging—is clear and pursued throughout, and the orrery puzzle provides the primary tightening beat. However, opposition is minimal: the pinions release in smooth sequence, and there is little sense that she might fail, be harmed, or pay a concrete price beyond confronting a difficult truth. The emotional escalation when she grasps the chip’s nature and the pilgrim’s flight is thoughtful but not sharply pressured. Stronger resistance or a more conflicted decision around transmitting the frequency would clarify and heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—whether he will continue to manufacture false memories or face his own buried truth—is clear and does receive a meaningful turn when he uncovers the plaque and chooses renunciation. Pressure builds gently as he moves from terrace to shore to the name reveal, but the conflict stays almost entirely internal and relatively frictionless. There’s little sense of risk beyond generalized guilt; no countervailing need (financial, emotional, relational) actively resists his change. The result is a solid but low-intensity escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—preventing renewed war while returning prisoners—is clearly stated and conceptually high, and the ritual/tidal constraint offers a built-in clock. However, on the page, nothing meaningfully threatens the exchange: no missteps, second thoughts, or procedural snags test the characters’ values or ingenuity. The nearest tightening is the moon cresting and the crate opening, but those proceed without complication, so pressure feels more ceremonial than contested. As a result, resolution is more a completion of protocol than an earned decision under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can navigate through guilt toward a new way of orienting his life—is clear from the outset. Pressure tightens when the fog wipes out his external guides, forcing a confrontation with his failed compass and his memories of his sister. The key turn is his choice to stop fighting the current, then to leave the compass and walk inland, effectively foreclosing the path of self-punishing clinging. The conflict remains largely internal, but it escalates credibly under situational/environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stakes (retrieve the baseball key and, longer-term, restore empathy to a broken world) are signaled and coherent, and the tremor post-retrieval marks a clear escalation beat. However, the external pressure remains relatively soft: the cavern’s collapse threat is brief and easily outrun, with little sense of real jeopardy or loss. Internal/moral conflict (old self vs new role) is gestured at but never sharply tests his resolve in scene. As a result, tension exists but doesn’t meaningfully tighten or force a painful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—regaining contact with the beloved at the price of her human form—is inherently potent and clearly stated. There is one meaningful tightening when she actually begins to transform and must endure the physical and existential cost. However, the conflict remains largely unopposed once she commits; there’s no serious on-page temptation to stop or alternative path that’s tested. As a result, escalation feels more like a smooth ramp of ritual intensity than a pressured knife-edge of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—reconciling maternal guilt over “lost” hours with her altered body and identity—is clear from the outset. Pressure escalates texturally as the saucer weeps light, the backward clock appears, and her hair becomes a mending thread, culminating in the choice to accept the crack and institute a new family custom. Conflict is primarily internal and contemplative, with no external opposition, but the emotional cost (“she had been both vessel and thief”) is credibly felt. It falls just short of highest band because there’s only one main deepening rather than a series of escalating tests.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.0)
    The core stake—whether Maya will purify herself enough to cross into another dimension or remain in her desolate universe—tightens effectively through the stitching ritual and growing gravity instability. Each photograph raised the internal cost as she confronts deeper layers of her own violence, culminating in Li’s death image. Her final choice to stay with the ship is a clear renunciation with genuine cost (foregoing release and union with memory). The conflict remains mostly internal and could benefit from one more concrete external pressure beyond alarms to heighten jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake is Kael’s need to understand transformation, with a secondary, largely unaware stake in the village’s survival. The key tightening is the appearance of the crimson bug pulling him off his usual route, which triggers both the causal chain and his inner shift. However, tension never sharpens into real dilemma or felt risk for Kael; he is rarely under pressure to choose between competing goods or harms, and coincidence plus prophecy do much of the work. The resolution is internally earned but emotionally gentle, limiting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—transforming a fortress of control into a space of potential freedom—is clear and culminates in all locks falling open. Yet the path is almost frictionless: Seren encounters no active opposition, no close calls, and no genuine risk of failure, so escalation is mostly conceptual rather than experiential. The one tightening—discovering the “cradle of sparks” and deciding to use it for a signal, not explosions—does narrow options but without testing her resolve. The stakes feel large in idea but mild in on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will use the star dust and patterns to briefly restore friction at the cost of her own dissolution—emerges clearly as visions sharpen and the sequence nears its climax. There is a meaningful tightening as the star dust flares and the eels respond, collapsing abstract “sacred patterns” into a single, actionable possibility. However, the internal contest between saving the world (even briefly) and preserving herself is resolved rather quickly, with little sense of wavering or real temptation; the choice feels more serene than pressured. The conflict is coherent and thematically apt but could use a more acute sense of immediate loss or risk to fully match the declared stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—whether he will break through censorship (inner and outer) to reclaim his voice—is clear, and the storm’s build provides a gentle sense of tightening. The decisive moments (opening the envelope, recognizing the message as his own, choosing to write and later descend) track as an internal escalation from paralysis to committed action. However, pressure remains largely interior and metaphysical; there is little concrete opposition on the page pushing back, and no strong reversal that forces a hard trade-off. As a result, the conflict feels resonant but low-intensity for “highest-echelon” competition.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.8)
    The duel provides a clear external conflict, but its stakes are underdeveloped: there is no concrete sense of what Rhen stands to lose beyond vague reputation and direction. Escalation is minimal—the fight is described as elegant and chaotic, then quickly resolved without reversal or clear danger. The opponent is barely individuated, so the clash feels more ceremonial than threatening. As a result, the final thrust reads controlled and courteous but not costly.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes—will he stay a mere drifter of selves or commit to dangerous, communal resistance—are clear and escalate modestly through the formation of the library network. The main tightening is the impending molt night; his choice to keep the poet persona and embed the seed-poem is the key act of agency. External pressure (guards, punishment, risk of confiscation) is mostly implied rather than sharply tested in scene, keeping tension more atmospheric than acute. As a result, conflict feels meaningful but not quite as knife-edged as it could be in an elite-market piece.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether he remains trapped in a shattered-but-persistent love/time or risks a storm-tossed journey toward a new orientation—is present and understandable. Escalation comes through the approaching storm, the obsessive frame-by-frame search, and the leap to the arbor, culminating in the grueling performance until his fingers bleed. However, the external conflict (storm, danger to the station) never forces a concrete dilemma beyond “stay vs. go,” and once at the arbor opposition mostly recedes into atmosphere. The final stance crystallization is strong, but the felt narrowing of options could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (preserving cultural memory before the monsoon) is clearly stated and tracks through to the end, with an effective tightening when Kael realizes the seed is to wake the ridge itself. Pressure, however, is mostly notional: once he climbs the ridge, there is no significant resistance, setback, or trade-off in the actual awakening act. Internal doubt flavors the singing but does not force a hard choice between competing goods or harms. As a result, escalation feels intellectually engaging rather than viscerally tense.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—Mara’s need to metabolize the emotional cost of her sister’s severance—is clear and maintained, and pressure deepens as ritual forces her to engage rather than avoid memory. Escalation is primarily internal and textural: the compass’s behavior, the diffusion of color, and the long stay on the islet steadily narrow her options toward acceptance. The final choice to leave with a cutting and later to teach others is an earned stance crystallization, not a reversal. Still, the conflict remains low-simmer throughout, with limited sense of genuine risk or potential failure of the ritual process.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are personal and philosophical, appropriate for a quiet, textural story. The escalation is subtle—moving from observation to contact to synthesis—but the absence of active external pressure or a harder choice limits the tension; the resolution feels like a gentle yield rather than a forged change.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=2.8)
    Tension is non-existent as the antagonist (smugglers) remains entirely abstract and off-page. The stakes are theoretically life-or-death, but the on-page action consists solely of peaceful glassblowing with no obstacles or time pressure. The resolution—making a vase to "expose a crime"—lacks a logical causal link to the established threat.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=4.2)
    Escalation is minimal; the protagonist faces a condition (silence) but no active opposition or specific obstacles in the scene. The resolution is a pure win without a visible cost, trade-off, or moment of doubt, reducing the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clear and the cost of the undertaking—physical transformation and eternal service—is palpable and high. While the escalation is somewhat smoothed over by the summary middle, the final realization of the trap provides a satisfying crystallization of the conflict under an accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the community accepts the new storytelling plan instantly without skepticism or friction. The "sudden storm" is a brief convenience resolved in summary, and the stakes of survival are stated but never tested by a genuine threat or difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=2.5)
    The story lacks meaningful opposition or stakes; the protagonist faces no obstacles and pays no price for her success. The tension is nonexistent as the "unused love" waits passively to be found, leading to unearned gratification.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes are high (existential entrapment), but the struggle to overcome them is summarized rather than shown through escalating obstacles in the present moment. The protagonist's "months" of labor bypass the visceral experience of failure and adaptation, making the final cost feel calculated rather than emotionally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=3.6)
    While the stakes are declared (planting resilience), the obstacles provide little resistance; the robot is defeated in a single paragraph with "staggering grace." The ending offers a conceptual shift (chains as a ladder), but the low difficulty of the conflict reduces the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.9)
    Internal stakes are high and clearly defined by the "wound that wouldn't clot." While the emotional pressure is palpable, the external conflict remains static until the environment acts upon the character, rather than the character forcing the environment to yield.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=2.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist possesses every tool required to solve the puzzles instantly. The "ticking clock" adds no genuine pressure, and the stakes remain abstract ("destiny") with no concrete consequence for failure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.5)
    The internal stakes are high and clearly defined: the struggle between preserving grief (the frozen state) and allowing the messy thaw of acceptance. The escalation is subtle but distinct, moving from passive observation of the leak to the active creation of the "Reservoir" bowl. The cost is visible in the further cracking of the cherished bookmark, a necessary sacrifice that validates the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.1)
    While the stakes (termination) are high, the tension evaporates because the primary obstacle is removed effortlessly by the found password. The antagonist is defeated by shouting a phrase, bypassing any visceral struggle or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=2.9)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the protagonist asks for a map and receives it without obstacle or cost. The "pressure" of the night is stated abstractly but never forces a difficult trade-off or active struggle, leaving the stakes theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.6)
    Escalation is mild and purely intellectual; the stakes remain abstract ("unlocking the pattern") with no immediate threat to J-3's existence or function. The loops present a puzzle rather than a danger, and the resolution comes without sacrifice or trade-off. The protagonist never faces a moment where the cost of knowledge outweighs the safety of the program, leading to a climax that feels low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=2.4)
    Escalation is nonexistent; the protagonist faces no obstacles in decoding the clues, presenting the evidence, or securing a confession. The stakes are declared ("missing funds") but never felt, as every potential conflict is smoothed over instantly.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is introduced (mechanization vs. soul) but resolves with virtually no pressure; the heirs offer no meaningful opposition and accept Silas's worldview immediately. There is no visible trade-off or price paid for the "mended deception," rendering the stakes theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes are clearly defined: professional risk versus the pursuit of truth. The escalation is sharp, moving from passive monitoring to the active interference of diverting station power, which prompts the immediate conflict with Chen. While the external consequence is limited to a angry call, the internal shift in Kael carries the weight of the story successfully.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes remain abstract; the choice to "free or destroy" lacks visceral cost or urgency, as the ghost is a passive pressure until the end. The conflict is resolved by a "third way" solution that feels convenient, bypassing the established trade-off without genuine sacrifice or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is no escalation or true opposition; the character desires an answer, performs a ritual, and is immediately granted a comforting epiphany. The stakes are purely abstract ("weight of a swallowed truth") and the resolution is painless, lacking any visible or felt cost to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.2)
    Pressure is primarily atmospheric rather than antagonistic; the ghosts wait passively for release, posing no threat or obstacle. The protagonist faces no dilemma or escalating cost in executing the solution, resulting in a low-tension climax where he simply performs the required action.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.5)
    The antagonist ("clamor," "decay") remains abstract, and the "regenerative silence" acts as a repeated magical fix that lowers stakes by healing fractures immediately. There is no moment where the protagonist is truly cornered or forced to sacrifice something tangible; the cost ("crumbling peace") is a thematic state, not a paid price.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story lacks meaningful escalation; the connection snaps into place "not with force but with... inevitability," explicitly removing tension. There are no setbacks or tightening of options, resulting in a flat arc where the outcome feels predetermined.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is largely abstract (man vs. oblivion) with minimal immediate opposition or risk to the protagonist. The discovery proceeds without setbacks; the stakes are high conceptually but low personally, as Elias faces no active antagonism or hard trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.1)
    The internal stake (agency vs. fate) is clear, but the external conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no resistance to her plan, making the victory feel somewhat inevitable. The escalation is linear—realization, execution, success—lacking a significant reversal or obstacle to test her commitment before the end.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.8)
    The antagonist is passive; the entity "hesitates" and "loses shape" but never threatens Miriam or forces her to adapt her tactics. The conflict lacks a back-and-forth dynamic or a moment of true risk, resulting in a climax that feels like a foregone conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is nominal; the antagonist ("exhaustion") is declared but never forces a deviation in tactics or a sacrifice of resources. The victory is achieved effortlessly, lacking the escalation or cost required to generate genuine narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain theoretical ("conquer the labyrinth of self") and lack a grounded, felt cost until the final dissolution. The conflict is resolved through an internal realization ("You are the labyrinth") rather than an external test of agency, keeping the narrative tension abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=3.1)
    Conflict is virtually absent; Elara faces no external opposition or internal hesitation. The solution to her years of numbness is handed to her immediately upon request, offering a cure without cost, trade-off, or escalation of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=4.5)
    Escalation flatlines; the "shadow" mentioned in the opening never forces a trade-off, change of tactics, or confrontation within the scene. The stakes remain abstract ("mark him as a target") and are not tested by an immediate threat to the release of the message.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clearly defined as a conflict between preservation and release. The escalation tracks well with the blooming flower, and the cost—opening the irreplaceable vial—is felt and irrevocable.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=2.6)
    Stakes are purely abstract ("to discover how time felt") and face no concrete opposition or escalation. The "impossible choices" are referenced repeatedly as a concept but are never dramatized as mutually exclusive options with consequences on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=2.5)
    Escalation is virtually absent; the "chronic hush" offers no active resistance, and the protagonist's ritual succeeds instantly without setback or trade-off. There is no dominant stake tested by failure, resulting in a flat trajectory with zero visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.6)
    Pressure is low; the transaction proceeds smoothly without significant external obstacles or sharp reversals. The "static" alert serves as a procedural check rather than a source of escalating conflict. While the emotional cost is acknowledged, the lack of a difficult trade-off limits the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=2.5)
    The story lacks genuine opposition or stakes; Lena faces no obstacles in finding Caleb, convincing him, or organizing the event. Every interaction is cooperative, and the "investigation" resolves without setback or sacrifice. Without a tightening of options or a felt cost for the protagonist, the narrative flatlines into a series of agreeable events.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.9)
    The conflict is resolved too easily through the intervention of a guide and a montage of searching, lacking a moment of genuine jeopardy or failure. The stakes of isolation are declared but not felt in the scene, as the "cost" of the search is glossed over in summary rather than dramatized as a painful endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clearly defined and existential, with the "Gasp" providing effective temporal pressure that escalates naturally. The cost—erasure of the self to preserve the history—is definitive and paid on the page. The conflict is primarily external (time/environment), but the intensity is sustained through the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=4.6)
    External pressure is virtually absent; the ritual proceeds without obstacle or error. The escalation is purely atmospheric (lighting effects, humming roots) rather than a tightening of stakes or a narrowing of options, leaving the victory feeling inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story lacks significant opposition or escalation; the outage is a "gift," the boy arrives on cue, and the cache is found immediately without complication. Because Mara faces no external threat of discovery and no internal hesitation about breaking her own rules, the stakes remain theoretical. The resolution feels pre-ordained rather than the result of a pressurized struggle or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=2.6)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the protagonist encounters a single moment of frustration and immediately resolves it with a philosophical realization ("releasing control"). There is no escalation, no trade-off, and no visible cost to the decision; the surrender yields only immediate, unqualified success for the character and her business.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative lacks active resistance; the scavenger accepts the trade immediately without negotiation or conflict. The protagonist faces no difficult choice or potential loss, making the "exchange" a low-stakes transaction rather than a dramatic turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are abstract; the "unseen forces" and "shadows" present a vague threat without concrete immediate consequences for failure. The escalation is atmospheric ("crescendo," "pulsing") rather than tactical, leading to a resolution that feels low-cost despite the "unsettling" paradox mentioned.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.4)
    Escalation is weak because there is no active opposition; the valve works perfectly on the first try, and the navigator accepts the interpretation immediately. The conflict is retrospective (the exile is over), leaving the present scene without immediate stakes or the possibility of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.2)
    Pressure is minimal; the environment yields immediately to Elara's actions. The stakes are abstract ("validation," "courage") and the "cost" of the journey is described as "trembling" rather than a forfeited option or tangible loss. Escalation is textural rather than rising tension.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=2.4)
    Stakes are virtually nonexistent for the protagonist; Lira faces no opposition, risk of failure, or personal cost in performing the ritual. The conflict is purely external and is resolved via a &quot;magic wand&quot; device, devoid of the pressure required to drive a literary arc.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stakes are established early and escalate clearly: the storm offers a rare window of opportunity, transforming a chronic condition (boredom) into an acute crisis (the choice to escape). The pressure builds coherently through the interaction with the "mutiny," leading to a final trade-off where Althea pays the cost of her identity to gain release. The conflict is internal but successfully externalized through the sci-fi elements.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes (political asylum/survival) are high and clearly defined, but the resolution lacks a visceral struggle. The antagonist yields too easily to a cryptic exchange, dampening the tension at the critical moment.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is abstract and lacks on-page urgency; the "silence" of the town is a passive condition that offers no active resistance to the protagonist's work. The ritual proceeds without risk of failure or external threat, resulting in a flat trajectory where the stakes—filling the void—are theoretical rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.5)
    Pressure is low and primarily internal; the external stakes of the "poison" implies a danger that remains metaphorical and unexplored. The escalation relies entirely on thematic density rather than forcing a difficult trade-off or narrowing options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.1)
    Conflict is entirely internal and abstract ("universal riddle"), lacking an antagonist or concrete external pressure to force escalation. The "whisper of closing pages" acts as a metaphorical clock, but it doesn't constrain options or force trade-offs on the page. The stakes are philosophical, and the resolution feels inevitable rather than hard-won against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=3.1)
    Stakes are declared ("paved over with glass towers") but remain abstract and distant. There is no on-page confrontation or tightening of pressure; the antagonist is a faceless group ("slick suits") that appears only in the final summary beat, resulting in a lack of palpable tension.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=4.9)
    Conflict is strictly man-versus-time, but the protagonist is prepared well in advance, neutralizing the pressure. The mention of "finite air" attempts to raise stakes but does not force a trade-off or alter tactics on the page. The narrative lacks a distinct tightening moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.3)
    Pressure is external and mild (a deadline horn) rather than interpersonal or internal; the protagonist faces a task, not an antagonist. The solution comes without setback or cost; Miren simply applies her skill, resulting in a procedural beat devoid of escalating stakes or hard trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; Kael faces no external opposition or significant internal doubt, moving from realization to resolution without testing his commitment. The stakes are high in theory (dissolution/transformation) but low in execution because the cost is accepted instantly without on-page negotiation or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.1)
    The story lacks active opposition; entropy is a passive state that yields immediately to Kael’s tools without fighting back. The escalation is procedural—he strikes the fork, they walk, it works—missing a "tightening" beat where the frequency might fail or the cost of the next century becomes visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are immediate and lethal, with the pressure gauge and rescue window creating a tangible clock. The protagonist pays the ultimate price on the page, ensuring the cost is felt and the escalation remains coherent to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.1)
    The conflict is purely abstract (silence vs. echoes) and lacks a concrete antagonist or obstacle that forces a hard choice. The "search party" is introduced late as an artificial clock, and the resolution comes from a magical object functioning exactly as needed, removing agency and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=3.0)
    There is virtually no opposition or conflict; the protagonist meets no resistance from the environment, the ghost, or herself. The stakes (saving the orchard) are declared but not tested, as the solution is handed over immediately and works perfectly on the first try without requiring sacrifice or tactical adjustment.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are declared rather than felt; the conflict with the villagers is summarized ("whispering that Elara's haunting optimism was a folly") and lacks on-page friction. The protagonist faces no meaningful opposition or dilemma, and the resolution arrives without sacrifice or tactical adjustment.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=3.0)
    There is virtually no friction or escalation; Lina accepts the task, wanders, finds the piece, and rebuilds it without external opposition or internal resistance. The stakes of "interrupted journeys" are declared but never tested, resulting in a flat trajectory with no felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story lacks significant escalation or pressure; while a 30-minute deadline is established, Kael works with "flourish" and ease, never doubting success or facing a trade-off. The stakes (a family knowing a defector is alive) are stated but remain abstract, as the protagonist faces no active opposition or dilemma that forces a sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=4.6)
    External pressure is low, as the antagonist (the coup) is abstract and distant, leaving Mira to operate in a vacuum without immediate opposition. The "ticking clock" of the candle is observed rather than felt through escalating obstacles. The stakes are declared ("unheard stories") but lack a concrete, immediate counter-force in the room to test her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.1)
    The stakes (healing/release) are clear, but the escalation is external and atmospheric (spirits singing louder) rather than a tightening of options. The "choice" mentioned ("must choose before the light returned") is a false binary with no visible alternative or temptation to refuse, lowering the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure is coherent and internal, driven by the "riptide" of the anesthetic creating a natural ticking clock for the realization. While the stakes are purely emotional and retrospective, the pacing effectively tightens the focus toward the final deciphering moment.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=3.0)
    There is no meaningful escalation or resistance. The environment cooperates (fog thins), the technology works perfectly ("shutter sang," "tablet flickered"), and the public reception is instantly rapturous. Without an antagonist, a failing tool, or a difficult trade-off, the stakes remain theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=2.9)
    Stakes are virtually nonexistent; the protagonist faces no risk of failure, and the "cost" of losing certainty is abstract and painless. The visitor's arrival provides only mild conversational pressure, resolved immediately by a laugh. Without genuine opposition or a difficult trade-off, the escalation feels purely decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are declared (mind control) but not felt; the immediate threat is dismissed too easily to generate genuine pressure. The escalation is minimal—the auditors enter and are immediately duped—resulting in a narrative without a decisive tightening of options or a felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=2.5)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent on the page; the antagonist (the war) dissolves instantly upon the protagonist's first action (singing). There is no escalation, no counter-move from the merfolk, and no felt cost to the poet, resulting in a flat narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are purely thematic ("preservation vs. oblivion") and lack immediate narrative pressure; there is no moment where the protagonist faces a genuine risk of failure. The conflict is resolved by a sudden, unearned philosophical acceptance of imperfection that deflates potential tension.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the deadline provides external pressure, the interpersonal conflict dissolves instantly upon contact; Kess's immediate agreement and the subsequent laughter deflate the stakes established by the "three months of silence."

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.2)
    The central conflict (profit vs. preservation) is established in summary and resolved with a single proposal, lacking visceral struggle or escalation. There is no felt cost to the protagonist; she simply finds a message and persuades the council instantly, rendering the stakes theoretical rather than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are purely internal and lack urgency; there is no clear consequence for failure to release the bird. The conflict is low-pressure, and the "struggle" to trust is stated in the narrative voice rather than demonstrated through resistance or obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=2.7)
    There is no tangible opposition or escalation; the protagonist succeeds at every step without failure, delay, or adaptation. The stakes are purely internal and stated ("to discover") rather than tested by the environment, resulting in a flat narrative line with no tension.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are high (survival vs. transcendence) and the ticking clock (oxygen/submersible) provides clear external pressure. However, the external pressure remains static—a countdown—rather than evolving dynamically to force tactical shifts before the final binary choice.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=3.2)
    Pressure is negligible; Lira faces no antagonist, physical barrier, or time constraint that forces a trade-off. The narrative follows a straight line from desire to fulfillment without escalation, reversals, or a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is negligible; Ezra faces no genuine opposition, as even the security guard is neutralized by a pre-planned move. The lack of escalation or risk turns the plot into a procedural demonstration of competence rather than a dramatic struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is negligible; the protagonist faces no active antagonist and accepts the primary obstacle (being anchored) immediately and willingly. The "nostalgia ban" is a distant, abstract concept that fails to exert immediate pressure on the scene until the very end. Without a moment where Lyra risks failure or pays a painful price, the narrative lacks tension.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is no discernible conflict or pressure; the protagonist faces no obstacles, external or internal, merely a sequence of harmonious thoughts. The urgency signaled by the phrase "before everything shifts" remains declared and abstract, never manifesting as a time constraint or threat on the page. Escalation is non-existent, resulting in a flat narrative line.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—resolving survivor's guilt—is clear, but the conflict is almost entirely retrospective. There is little immediate pressure or escalation in the present moment; the character performs a planned ritual without external resistance or a forced difficult choice on the page. The resolution comes from a shift in perspective rather than a high-stakes decision.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.4)
    While the stated stakes are multiversal, the on-page pressure remains low-temperature and abstract. The solution arrives without Kael facing a distinct trade-off, sacrifice, or moment of genuine potential failure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are thematic rather than immediate; there is little external resistance to Mira's discovery or her subsequent actions. The conflict resolves too easily—finding the data leads directly to a successful global movement without on-page struggle, cost, or opposition, reducing the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=3.0)
    There is virtually no escalation; the mirrors are described as "stubborn" yet yield instantly to the lullaby, and the approaching bells act as a passive timer rather than a pressure forcing a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=3.4)
    Stakes are declared ("cost a city its sunrise") but not dramatized in the scene; the opposition (the scarred general) is overcome instantly by the magical clipboard rather than negotiation or sacrifice. There is no on-page cost or difficult trade-off; the "price of redemption" is stated conceptually but not paid experientially.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=3.7)
    Stakes are declared in backstory but never tested in the scene; the protagonist faces no obstacles or escalation while walking to the hollow. The "cost" of the drought is a static fact, not a price paid or weighed during the on-page action.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=3.5)
    The conflict is entirely abstract ("lullaby's weight" vs. will), lacking an active antagonist or concrete obstacle to test the protagonist. Success is inevitable from the first movement; the tension is asserted ("heart hammered") rather than dramatized through near-failure or difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure is consistent, but the conflict is largely unidirectional—Adrian acting upon a passive audience—rather than a contested struggle. While the stakes for the audience are high (existential realization), Adrian himself faces little opposition or risk of failure, limiting the tension of the protagonist's arc.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes (extinction vs. memory) are clearly signaled and escalate naturally through the discovery of the incorrect wing. The climax represents a meaningful tightening where Esme re-purposes a tragic accident (the moth) into a functional signal. The resolution is distinct and offers a clear payoff to the established pressure, validating the "overlooked history" stake.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake (preserving names) is clear, but pressure is low; the protagonist faces no active opposition or risk of failure once the rope is engaged. The narrative lacks a meaningful tightening moment where options narrow or costs rise before the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.4)
    The external pressure (the storm) is dismissed by the protagonist ("barely noticed"), shifting all weight to the internal conflict, which is then resolved too easily by the dream voice. The stakes of "transcendence" feel abstract compared to the visceral reality of survival, and the cost of leaving the bunker is mitigated by the assurance that it was "meant to fall." Real tension requires a harder choice than following instructions.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes are clear but remain abstract and intellectual; the threat of the "new priests" provides timeline pressure, but Kael faces no immediate, visceral peril or personal sacrifice, resulting in a low-heat conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.2)
    Tension is low because Mira appears fully in control of the encounter from the start ("certainty that the moment had arrived"). There is no meaningful escalation or point of failure; the antagonist offers no effective resistance to the cure. The stakes remain abstract ("resentment," "shifting planes") rather than viscerally felt through potential loss.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain abstract and aesthetic (capturing a dream) without a sense of genuine risk or loss if he fails. The antagonist is merely the "elusiveness" of the dream, which yields easily to the protagonist's first adjustment in method. There is no felt cost to the success beyond a pleasant metaphysical merging.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=4.9)
    External stakes are established, but the internal conflict resolves too easily through dialogue rather than costly action. The daughter's resistance melts instantly upon hearing a moral statement, robbing the climax of genuine friction or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes are clear (knowledge vs. safety) and the conceptual cost at the end (the burden of grief) is legible. However, the external pressure is low; the "surveillance drones" are mentioned but do not actively constrain his choices in the scene, leaving the conflict largely internal and resolved with relative ease.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=2.6)
    Tension is virtually nonexistent; potential threats like the "stone warden" and the botanist's condition yield instantly to Elara's first attempt. There is no meaningful tightening of stakes or escalation of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=3.7)
    Pressure is virtually absent; the protagonist walks through a door to find the prize without external opposition or meaningful trade-offs. The stake is abstract, and the "tightening" is merely physical descent without escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story lacks genuine opposition or stakes; Elara faces a puzzle, not a conflict. She encounters no physical danger, time pressure, or moral dilemma, and the "phantom thread" is woven back in without resistance or sacrifice, resulting in a flat tension arc.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes are low and abstract; the "storm" presents as an annoyance rather than a visceral threat, and the solution requires minimal cost beyond humming. The conflict resolves too easily once the technique is remembered, failing to escalate pressure to a point where the protagonist forces a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=4.5)
    Escalation is purely linear: the protagonist identifies a problem, waits for the solution (the star alignment), executes it, and succeeds instantly. There is no moment where options narrow or the price of failure becomes palpable; the stakes are declared ("light dimming to ash") but never tested by genuine obstacles or antagonists.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes remain largely philosophical with limited external pressure; the consequences of failure are abstract. The conflict is resolved through contemplation rather than a high-cost decision or confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=3.9)
    The antagonist is an abstract concept ("gravity of hopelessness") that offers no active resistance or concrete obstacles. Escalation is absent; Cinder decides to act and immediately succeeds. The stakes remain theoretical, and the resolution comes without a meaningful test of the protagonist's agency or values.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent on the page; the "difficult conversation" is alluded to but not dramatized, and the "pause" removes all immediate pressure. The stakes (brother leaving) are accepted without resistance or trade-offs, resulting in a flat trajectory with no meaningful tightening or escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=4.5)
    Tension is low; the protagonist executes a routine action without facing a novel obstacle or antagonist specific to this instance. The stakes remain theoretical, and the resolution comes too easily through philosophical acceptance rather than a costly trade-off or forced decision.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are low and resistance is minimal; the diplomat's objection ("I don't have time") is overcome almost instantly by the environment. There is no moment where Kael's goal is genuinely threatened or where she must sacrifice something of value to succeed *before* the resolution; the gift of the vial happens after the conflict is already resolved, rendering it a souvenir rather than a price paid to win.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.5)
    Escalation is nominal; obstacles are overcome with tools (resonance blade) rather than ingenuity, and the climax—refusing the throne—lacks dramatic weight as it matches her initial intent perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=2.8)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the "encroaching" figure arrives and is immediately healed/taught without struggle, misunderstanding, or cost. The lack of resistance or meaningful stakes flattens the arc, as the solution (breathing) is applied instantly upon the problem's presentation.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=3.5)
    External opposition is negligible; the owner's potential disapproval is mentioned but never materializes into a barrier. The dominant stake (debt) is resolved by a magic system that requires no sacrifice, flattening the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=3.1)
    Pressure fails to escalate as the protagonist faces no resistance, external or internal; the process is linear and frictionless. The resolution is unearned, offering a "gift of clarity" that removes the need for a difficult choice or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is a distinct lack of conflict; the protagonist faces no opposition, external or internal, for the majority of the text. The "sacrifice" mentioned is paid without hesitation or visible consequence, rendering the stakes theoretical rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is almost no resistance; Marianne finds the button, solves the mystery, and connects with the family without a single obstacle or failure. The lack of risk or potential loss means the stakes remain theoretical rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.0)
    The physical act of swallowing the crystal creates a legible, visceral cost at the climax. However, the tension deflates immediately as the escape is summarized rather than shown, removing the immediate threat.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=2.9)
    There is no meaningful opposition; the prophecy dissolves instantly upon the first attempt. The stakes remain abstract ("a secret that the wind whispered"), and the lack of escalation or reversal makes the victory feel inevitable and flat.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=2.6)
    There is no genuine opposition or active antagonist; the "hush" acts as a passive timer but exerts no concrete force on the protagonist's decisions. Success is achieved through a sequence of first-try victories without risk, trade-off, or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are established early with the stopped clocks, but the conflict remains largely external until the final thematic realization. The escalation is linear, and while the "scream" of the mechanism suggests danger, the resolution comes without a significant sacrifice or trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—redeeming the failure to find the boy—is clear, and the ritual provides a meaningful tightening of options. While the external conflict dissolves into acceptance, the internal cost is legible: Elara must abandon the search to find a different kind of truth.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are clear and personal; the escalation from general confessions to the specific, painful laughter works well. The cost is legible in the spent tooth and the acceptance of "fractured" joy.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.9)
    The conflict is primarily internal and abstract; the stakes are the definition of a concept rather than a tangible outcome. While the pressure escalates via the intensifying light, the resolution—a philosophical shift—feels like a "soft reset" that lacks a visible, paid cost on the page beyond enduring the memory.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=2.2)
    Stakes are purely abstract ("honor history") and never tested by opposition; the alchemist is helpful, the painting opens easily, and the journal is immediately legible. There is no escalation of pressure, no risk of failure, and no cost paid for the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes remain primarily internal and thematic (witnessing vs. ignoring) rather than urgent or dangerous, resulting in low narrative voltage. While the discovery of the barrels deepens the meaning, the lack of active opposition or difficult trade-offs limits tension; the ghosts are sad petitioners rather than forces that compel a costly tactical shift. The burden accepted at the end is conceptual, without an immediate on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure escalates cleanly from the vibrating bottle to the groaning press and finally the tilting library. The stakes are global—the stability of reality itself—but anchored in the specific destruction of Elara's sanctuary. The cost is palpable as the "perfect system" she maintained is sacrificed for the new order.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=4.8)
    The conflict is primarily expository; the "bitter dispute" is told, not shown in dialogue or maneuver. The stakes dissolve instantly when Voss simply nods and accepts the truth, removing any cost or struggle from the resolution. There is no tactical escalation, only a waiting game for the storm followed by immediate validation.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes are high (eternal darkness), and the deadline provides pressure, but the antagonist (the covenant/rust) is defeated somewhat abstractly by "truth burning through lies." The escalation lacks a gritty tactical trade-off; the victory comes from asserting purity of intent rather than navigating a complex dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=5.1)
    Opposition is virtually absent; Mira faces no physical obstacles, antagonists, or time pressure that she cannot easily manage. The central action—a prepared descent followed by a decision to leave—lacks a "felt cost" or a moment where the outcome was genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.6)
    Tension is explicitly deflated when the narrative states Mara "felt no urgency" despite the approaching storm, neutralizing the primary physical threat. The stakes are theoretical (erasing the archway) rather than visceral, and the conflict is resolved by looking at a magic slide rather than through protagonist agency or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story lacks genuine pressure or obstacles; the protagonist's journey is a linear path to an inevitable answer without setbacks or opposition. There is no visible cost to the quest—time passes in summary, but the character pays no emotional or physical price for the revelation. The stakes remain purely intellectual, resulting in a low-tension narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=3.0)
    The central conflict is resolved instantly without struggle; the antagonist flips from opposition to collaboration in a single beat due to a convenient backstory connection. There is no tactical back-and-forth or escalation of pressure, merely a presentation of evidence followed by immediate agreement.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=3.9)
    There is a lack of genuine opposition; the bottle, the environment, and Kael's own mind offer no resistance to his plan. The conflict is abstract and resolved by a philosophical decision without a felt price or risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stakes of the "coming stillness" are established but immediately deflated when the protagonist reinterprets the threat as a "guide," removing the pressure rather than confronting it.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=3.6)
    There is a lack of genuine opposition or escalating stakes; the ritual proceeds without error or unforeseen resistance. The central conflict is a binary life-or-death scenario that resolves smoothly, lacking a moment where failure feels plausible. The "cost" of borrowed time is asserted in narration but never demonstrated through a difficult trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.9)
    The pressure scales effectively as "zero hour" approaches, forcing a trade-off between safety (acting now) and truth (waiting). The stakes are clear, though the village's peril feels slightly abstract due to the lack of a visible downstairs anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=2.5)
    There are no active stakes or escalation; the "conflict" of loneliness is resolved instantly by a summarized realization in the first third. The story lacks an antagonist or obstacle; Sola faces no resistance, makes no difficult trade-offs, and pays no visible cost for her transformation. The narrative drifts without tension.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=1.9)
    There is no meaningful resistance or escalation; the protagonist identifies a problem and resolves it immediately without obstacle. The stakes remain abstract ("unspoken words") and the resolution involves no sacrifice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.9)
    External pressure is low; the protagonist initiates a search but then mostly waits for a reply. The climax resolves through a meeting that requires no difficult trade-off, lowering the dramatic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=2.1)
    The story lacks stakes or opposition; the "snapped kite" is a thematic coincidence that validates the protagonist's pre-existing worldview rather than challenging it or forcing a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is minimal; the magic system works perfectly from the first wire, and nature cooperates immediately (insects moving, geckos supervising). There is no significant setback or failure to force a difficult choice; the "struggle" is purely logistical and summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is a near-total absence of conflict; the protagonist faces no opposition, the technology works perfectly, and the alien evidence aligns instantly with her hypothesis. Options never narrow, and no price is paid for the discovery, leaving the stakes purely theoretical. The narrative lacks a tightening beat or a moment of genuine risk.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is virtually no conflict or resistance; the earth is described as "refusing," but immediately yields to the chant and seeds without struggle. The magic works perfectly on the first try, rendering the stakes negligible.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.1)
    Internal stakes regarding grief and connection are clear, but the external conflict is negligible; Wick finds resources easily and crosses the wasteland without significant friction. The pressure remains static until the final unlock, lacking a distinct escalation of cost or danger.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=4.7)
    Stakes are abstract and low-pressure; the choice is between boredom and a metaphorical journey, with no immediate threat forcing the exit. The "cost" of leaving the station is framed as a relief, lacking the grit of genuine sacrifice or the danger inherent in the void.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are declared globally ("sky tore itself apart") but absent locally; Kaelen encounters no genuine opposition or difficult trade-offs. The escalation is flat because the solution is handed to him via backstory instruction. The ending lacks a felt cost, as he exits with a purely positive emotional upgrade.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=3.7)
    Pressure is static; there is no antagonist, time constraint, or complication to the protagonist's progress. The central action (walking the letters) proceeds without error or external resistance. The stakes remain abstract concepts (memory vs. forgetting) rather than immediate, dramatized risks.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes deflate at the climax because the central threat (the "hidden thunder" and potential storm) is revealed to be a positive force, negating the tension. The protagonist persists against a warning, but because the warning was misleading, there is no genuine price paid for her boldness. The conflict is theoretical—fear of pain—but the on-page action yields only rewards.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.2)
    The stakes are high (an entire village's fate), but the escalation is weak because the obstacle (the labyrinth) yields immediately to the tutor's first attempt at decoding. There is no moment where the protagonist fails, recalculates, or pays a tangible price to succeed; the "winnowing" is a smooth process rather than a conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=3.8)
    While the stakes (life vs. death) are high in theory, the conflict dissolves instantly upon the protagonist's action; the Elders surrender their dogma immediately without pressure or negotiation. The lack of active opposition or trade-offs robs the climax of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are established early and escalate clearly through the failing integrity of the workshop (wave, beam crack, air failure). The pressure forces a crystallization of stance, pushing Elara to accept a high-cost transformation rather than retreat. The cost is visceral and legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=2.9)
    There is virtually no conflict or meaningful opposition; Elias enters the cave, gets "lost" for a sentence, and immediately finds the perfect spot to paint. The stakes remain abstract and internal without being tested by external difficulty or a credible risk of failure. The resolution comes without a requisite rise in pressure or a forced trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central conflict (shout vs. whisper) is clear, but the escalation is linear and the victory feels low-cost. The antagonist yields immediately upon receiving the signal, lacking a moment of resistance or complication that would heighten the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=4.1)
    Escalation is external (moon phases) and instructional (phone calls) rather than driven by protagonist agency or error. There is no active opposition or scarcity; the success feels inevitable, lacking a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt or a price is paid.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=2.9)
    Conflict is resolved through a low-stakes reversal where the feared consequence (truth destroying the community) simply fails to materialize ("truth did not destroy; instead, it peeled away the armor"). The resolution creates safety without exacting a dramatized price.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.5)
    The stakes remain largely internal and interpretive ("was it farewell or a plea?"). While valid, the tension is low, and the conflict is resolved externally by the arrival of the letter, which removes the burden of interpretation from the protagonist. The resolution feels handed to the character rather than earned through risk.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    The rising creek provides a coherent, tangible clock that forces the protagonist to act, effectively escalating the tension. The dominant stake—overcoming a lifetime of hesitation—is clearly tested at the climax, where the choice to enter the arch forecloses the possibility of returning to his safe, lonely life.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.6)
    External obstacles remain atmospheric rather than antagonistic, and the internal stakes are lowered by the protagonist's pre-existing desire to leave her life. The final exchange of humanity for guardianship lacks visceral weight because the "hollow crown" was already rejected, making the "sacrifice" feel more like an upgrade.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=2.2)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent. The protagonist faces no external opposition and no internal hesitation; the "stakes" are purely conceptual ("presence... slipped away"). Without a moment where the outcome is in doubt or a price must be paid, there is no narrative pressure or escalation, only a ceremonial enactment of a pre-decided result.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.9)
    The stakes are purely internal and metaphysical; the antagonist ("feral nostalgia") resolves its pressure by demanding the protagonist write an ending, which lowers the tension significantly. The resolution is achieved by changing the rules of reality (flying) rather than making a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—adaptation to profound loss—is clear, but the escalation is mild and conversational rather than pressure-driven. The conflict does not force a difficult trade-off; instead, the resolution arrives via a gentle philosophical realignment that feels inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=3.6)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the "storm outside" is explicitly "held at bay," removing external urgency, while internal anxiety is resolved effortlessly via the ritual. There is no meaningful escalation or tightening of options; the protagonist succeeds on her first attempt without facing failure or paying a price. The stakes remain abstract ("transform scars into stories") and are never jeopardized by a concrete threat.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.7)
    The conflict is resolved with minimal pressure; the perfume acts as a "magic bullet" that dissolves the tension immediately, bypassing the need for Mira to navigate sustained opposition. The stakes are stated but the on-page struggle is low-voltage.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.9)
    The "spiral arbitration" introduces external pressure, but the conflict remains largely abstract and intellectual rather than visceral. The stakes are ostensibly the universe itself, but the lack of an active opposing force or a moment of genuine doubt lowers the tension. The resolution feels inevitable rather than hard-won through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are purely philosophical and asserted ("weight of silence") rather than demonstrated through risk or loss on the page. There is no opposing force or obstacle; the protagonist simply performs a ritual and receives an epiphany, resulting in a flat trajectory with no genuine suspense or necessary trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.6)
    Conflict is low-friction; the intruder poses no real threat, and Kael’s decision faces no external resistance or significant internal doubt. The stakes are inflated by narration claiming the protocols would "revolutionize the entire agricultural security sector," which feels unearned by the intimate, quiet action on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=3.2)
    Escalation is negligible; the protagonist faces no external opposition, time pressure, or genuine risk of failure. The narrative is a linear scavenger hunt where clues are found and decoded immediately without forcing a trade-off or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is internal and situational, but the antagonist (the loop/disc) offers no active resistance during the climax; Mira simply snaps it. The stakes of "eternity" are declared but not felt, as the narrative rushes to a low-cost resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=2.6)
    The story lacks meaningful conflict or stakes; the "steep path" is a minor physical detail, not a dramatic obstacle. The protagonist faces no opposition, difficult choices, or potential for failure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=2.4)
    There is no meaningful escalation or resistance; the protagonist formulates a plan and executes it without obstruction, risk, or trade-off. The conflict is resolved through a "polite" gathering that smooths over tension rather than testing the protagonist's commitment or exacting a price.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the forest offers a "labyrinth" that the ring immediately solves, removing any risk of failure. There is no on-page escalation of stakes or "meaningful tightening" of options; the protagonist faces no external resistance or internal doubt that forces a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=4.0)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no antagonist or significant obstacle beyond a dwindling ink supply. The "ripples" of his edits do not push back or force difficult trade-offs, resulting in low narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.2)
    The stakes are high (existential erasure), but the on-page pressure is low because Elias offers no resistance to the transformation. The conflict is resolved through instruction rather than a struggle between competing values or a necessary sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are theoretical rather than immediate; there is no on-page antagonist or time pressure to force a difficult trade-off. The montage structure glosses over the physical and psychological toll of the work, removing the friction required for genuine escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clearly defined: preservation of a ghost versus the creation of a new entity. The escalation is handled well via the ticking clock of the approaching drone, which forces Kael’s drumming from experimentation into urgent "surgery." The pressure remains coherent and high throughout the single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.6)
    The stakes are clear, but the antagonist is a straw man who is defeated instantly by the protagonist's pre-established skills. There is no moment of "deepening" where Marek must sacrifice something or adapt painfully; the victory feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are purely abstract ("teaching darkness the value of stars") and lack immediate physical or emotional cost. The conflict is resolved instantly by the Guardian's display; the child’s fear offers no meaningful opposition to the protagonist’s goal.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=2.7)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the antagonist force ("the authorities") is passive and "could only watch," neutralizing all risk. The rebellion succeeds without struggle, sacrifice, or the threat of failure, leaving the story void of narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.0)
    Escalation is negligible; the protagonist faces no significant obstacles, as the "violence is impossible" rule removes physical threat and the magical items resolve the guardian encounter instantly. The lack of friction turns the plot into a procession rather than a conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=5.1)
    Stakes are declared ("survival and complicity") but the conflict is buffered by summary. The interaction with the dog offers a chance for escalation, but the protagonist's betrayal is treated as a routine future task, stripping the moment of visceral risk or immediate emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is a near-total absence of conflict; the ban is already lifted, the ice holds firm, and the environment invites her progress. No obstacles, risks, or necessary trade-offs appear on the page to generate narrative drive or earn the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are purely abstract; Dorian offers no meaningful opposition, and Elara faces no risk of loss or failure. The "barter" is a polite exchange without tension, lacking a moment where a path is foreclosed with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.3)
    The central conflict—imperfection vs. digital accuracy—is clear but relatively low-stakes; Mara’s opposition is intellectual and quickly overcome. The resolution comes easily once the lens is engaged, lacking a moment of significant doubt or cost for Kaelen before the breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.0)
    Conflict is internal and abstract ("grief," "finality") and is resolved primarily through realization and summary rather than urgent, on-page tactical choices. The absence of a specific, time-bound obstacle reduces tension; the star's blooming and the woman's arrival feel like inevitable plot points rather than earned victories.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.0)
    The conflict is primarily intellectual and conversational, lacking high-stakes pressure or visible cost beyond the architect’s initial anxiety. While the "tightening" occurs through the card reveal, the shift in the architect’s stance feels somewhat easy. The stakes are declared (starvation/collapse) but remain abstract rather than viscerally felt in the room.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.1)
    Stakes are declared ("trapped in loops") but never viscerally felt; the antagonist is an abstract concept of "pattern" that is easily defeated. The climax lacks genuine pressure, as the protagonist succeeds by simply performing the prompt's required method without setbacks or unintended consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are theoretical and abstract ("shape of hope," "void") rather than visceral; the antagonist poses no immediate threat to the protagonist's safety or standing. The conflict lacks escalation, moving directly from observation to a fix that works on the first try.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.5)
    The pressure is coherent and escalates effectively from the internal shame to the external reality of the approaching car. The dominant stake (integrity vs. escape) is tested and resolved on the page. The arrival of the officer provides the necessary external forcing function to crystallize her internal decision.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=2.1)
    The story lacks a genuine antagonist or obstacle; the path to the solution is provided freely by a helpful plant, and the "displaced miracle" is found without struggle. Stakes are purely abstract ("closure") and are resolved without any foreclosure of options, sacrifice, or risk. The narrative flatlines in terms of escalation, offering a smooth ride to a guaranteed epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.3)
    The stakes are established early and pressurized by the ticking clock of the demolition, creating a coherent situational drive. The conflict between the fragility of memory and the destruction of physical space is escalated effectively through the incubation ritual. The final cost—the physical burden of the "map" and the "hushed thunder" stopping her heart—provides a visceral payoff to the buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is no meaningful conflict or opposition; the journey is a smooth progression of tasks without failure, risk, or trade-offs. The stakes never escalate beyond the initial premise, and the resolution comes without any sacrifice or visible price paid by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.7)
    The external stakes are high (existence vs. null-zone), but the protagonist overcomes the obstacle by performing their primary function without significant tactical deviation or failure. The escalation is linear, and the resolution feels inevitable based on the premise rather than forged through a surprising exercise of agency.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=2.8)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the protagonist faces no antagonist, obstacle, or hard trade-off, drifting from insight to insight without pressure. The tension between "logic" and "wildness" is resolved through effortless understanding ("not opposites, but lovers") rather than dramatic confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=3.6)
    External and internal pressure is negligible; potential obstacles (the mist, the water) are bypassed effortlessly with the guides' help. There is no meaningful escalation or tightening of options; the protagonist never faces a moment where a hard trade-off is required.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    The stakes are clearly defined: the safety of the collective versus the protagonist's fear of engaging with her trauma. The tension escalates naturally from the discovery of the flaw to the decision to act. The cost of the decision—a life of unceasing vigilance—is legible and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is no active struggle or escalation; the antagonist offers no resistance and is defeated the moment he interacts with the trap. The narrative lacks a tightening of options or a back-and-forth exchange of pressure, resulting in a climax that feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes remain abstract and intellectual; the conflict is between a woman and a data discrepancy, with no immediate consequence for failure. There is no escalation of pressure; the mystery is solved simply by looking at the files, and the "cost" is a philosophical acceptance of loss rather than a paid price.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.2)
    The conflict is largely internal and thematic (silence vs. sound) with little external pressure or risk. The protagonist faces no active opposition, and the resolution comes without a significant trade-off or price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.2)
    Pressure is low; the potential antagonist (the grandson/guard) removes the obstacle without conflict, and the physical danger of the spring is mitigated immediately by her powers. The story lacks a moment where the protagonist is forced to make a difficult trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=4.6)
    The conflict is entirely internal and resolves through affirmation rather than struggle, trade-off, or escalation. The protagonist faces no active opposition, and the stakes remain theoretical; he simply arrives and succeeds, leaving the "realism" he seeks untested by actual pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    The combination of immediate physical danger (walls closing in) and existential stakes (fragmentation of reality) creates effective pressure. The cost—accepting the "necessary darkness" and abandoning her old artistic identity—is legible, though somewhat abstract. The climax reweights her approach to her art, satisfying the requirement for a meaningful turn.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is self-generated and low-stakes; the protagonist creates the crisis by destroying his drone, but his reaction ("serene anger") minimizes the felt cost. There is no external pressure or ticking clock forcing this sacrifice, making the "crisis" feel theoretical rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.7)
    The stakes are high and clearly defined, with a distinct tightening moment when the letter is found. However, the absence of active opposition—guards are "too busy collapsing"—deflates the final tension, making the victory feel unearned by immediate struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is muffled; the stranger presents no actual danger, and the storm is resolved through a mechanical fix and a ritual gesture. The absence of an antagonist or a difficult trade-off leaves the stakes abstract, as Lyra loses nothing to maintain her sanctuary.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.1)
    The tension between the fisher’s intent to capture and the goddess’s divine weight creates a clear, escalating pressure. The climax forces a trade-off—possession versus witnessing—that resolves with a tangible shift in the protagonist's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clearly defined: the integrity of the paper and personal legacy versus continued silence. The escalation is primarily internal and intellectual, centering on the document analysis, but the decision to write the counter-memo is a decisive on-page action with felt cost (drawing blood/breaking with the father). The pressure remains coherent under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.3)
    The stakes are high—the eternal suffering of infants—but the conflict plays out as a linear execution of a known fix rather than a tactical struggle. The pressure is largely atmospheric; Elara faces little resistance or need to improvise once the letters provide the method.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are declared ("village needed to remember") but remain abstract and external to the protagonist, who faces no true opposition or dilemma. The central action involves following a ghost's direct instruction to draw a line, which removes the burden of difficult decision-making. The "unlearning" is a backdrop rather than an active pressure, resulting in a low-tension narrative where success is immediate and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=2.4)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the protagonist faces no antagonist, time limit, or significant internal barrier to his goal. The "wind" is the only external pressure, and the internal resolution comes immediately upon finding the artifact, lacking any escalation or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.0)
    Opposition is abstract and easily overcome; the actress's despair is stated but not dramatized through resistance or failed attempts.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is no meaningful conflict or escalation; Lina devises a plan and executes it perfectly on the first attempt without internal or external resistance. The stakes are abstract and global, while the on-page pressure is nonexistent, leading to a flat narrative arc with no visible cost to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; Lira faces no antagonist, no time limit, no physical danger, and no internal dilemma that forecloses an option.

The story fails to tighten pressure, resulting in a flat narrative arc devoid of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is largely abstract and internal, lacking an immediate antagonist or time pressure within the scene itself. The stakes are high-concept ("possibility") but lack a visceral, felt cost on the page, as the solution comes from persistence described in summary.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.8)
    The scene functions as a transaction with an ally rather than a conflict; the courier offers no resistance, and the "proof" is accepted immediately. Without an antagonist, time pressure, or a complication during the retrieval, the stakes remain theoretical (past failure) rather than visceral in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.2)
    There is virtually no active conflict or oscillation of stakes on the page; the waiting is over as soon as the story begins, and the woman's arrival meets no obstacle. The resolution is immediate upon the crossing, with the "distillation" removing friction rather than dramatizing it; the cost of the 37 years is asserted in backstory but not felt as a price paid in the scene's present action.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes remain purely philosophical with no opposing force or urgency; the wasteland is described as "indifferent," and Kai faces no concrete threat or resource scarcity that forces a difficult trade-off. The conflict is static, resolved by observation rather than agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=4.1)
    Stakes are purely abstract and face no escalation; the city "holds its breath" to manufacture tension that the plot does not supply. The protagonist encounters no resistance—the soil yields, the moon blesses her, and the harbor answers—resulting in a frictionless narrative where success is guaranteed from the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=3.2)
    The dominant stake (isolation) is resolved without external opposition or internal cost; the protagonist simply "persists" and succeeds. The declared danger ("threatens to fracture her sense of self") is never dramatized or felt on the page. Escalation is nonexistent, as the story moves linearly from discovery to mastery without setback.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=2.5)
    There are no functional stakes or obstacles; Lira faces no resistance from the environment, other characters, or her own limitations. The conflict is purely atmospheric ("strange restlessness") and is resolved by the first solution attempted. The "cost" of the undertaking is non-existent, creating a flat narrative trajectory devoid of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clearly defined and high, blending personal career risk with community survival. However, the escalation is dampened by the summary delivery of the antagonistic forces (the Dean and Dr. Chen) during the middle bridge, making the pressure feel reported rather than felt in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=3.8)
    Escalation is negligible as the central threat (walls closing in) is neutralized immediately by the compass with no cost or sacrifice; the resolution is a clean win that requires no trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are present but the external conflict lacks pressure; the case is solved remotely via artistic insight without active opposition. The internal struggle is the primary focus, but it resolves too neatly with the painting ritual, lacking a sense of risk or cost to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clearly established (truth vs. erasure, career vs. legacy) and pressure escalates effectively as the librarian overrides the protocols. The climax offers a clear confrontation, though the director's immediate silence and "paling face" feel slightly convenient and lack the friction of a more resistant antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is a flatline in pressure; the protagonist faces no obstacles, making every action yield an immediate, positive result. The narrative lacks a dominant stake tested by resistance, as the character moves from observation to resolution without paying a felt or conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=4.0)
    Stakes are declared but not felt; the protagonist's invulnerable "polished calm" deflates tension before it can rise. Leo’s immediate acceptance of the dissuasion removes the antagonist pressure required to drive the scene to a meaningful climax.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.5)
    The conflict is primarily intellectual and atmospheric; the "tightening" occurs via the predecessor's warning, but Elara overcomes the obstacle smoothly through the trance process. The stakes are clear, yet the lack of significant resistance or a moment where failure seems imminent keeps the narrative tension low.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.7)
    Stakes are declared ("last resort") but not tested; the "flesh-eating" plant presents no actual danger to the druid, resolving instantly into harmless berries. The conflict lacks a genuine trade-off, as the solution works perfectly on the first try with no collateral damage.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is negligible; the "thorny legacy" and "maze" offer no active resistance, and the ancestor figure provides the answer immediately upon request. There is no felt cost to the magic—the "scars" and "pain" are mentioned as currency but function as frictionless keys.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clearly established (destiny vs. memory) and the Keeper provides effective external pressure. The escalation is linear and functional, though the climax resolves quickly with a single action, lacking a deeper complication of the trade.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are purely internal and abstract ("unspoken questions," "silence") without a concrete external test to validate the internal shift. The antagonist (Dale) provides negligible pressure; he enters, asks a single question, and leaves, failing to force a difficult trade-off or escalation. The "tightening" is theoretical rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.8)
    Escalation is mild; the protagonist identifies the problem and executes the solution without facing new opposition or failure during the attempt. The pressure is theoretical (the city *will* fall) rather than immediate (the city *is* falling around her in a way that impedes her work). The dominant stake is resolved too smoothly, lacking a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake (preservation vs. protocol) is clear, but the resolution—a perfect hybrid compromise—undercuts the felt cost. While she sacrifices "archive integrity," her reaction is "quiet triumph" rather than the difficult weight of a trade-off, making the victory feel slightly too safe to break into the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes escalate conceptually (from inspection to town healing) but lack visceral pressure on the page; the conflict is resolved by a magical gesture rather than a hard trade-off. The antagonist is the abstract "silence," and the victory comes too easily, missing the tension of a genuine risk to Mara’s safety or career.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=2.9)
    Escalation is virtually non-existent; the protagonist enters with a desire for forgiveness and finds it written on a wall without facing any meaningful opposition or trade-off. The internal stakes are declared but never pressure-tested; the resolution feels inevitable and unearned because the path to healing meets no friction.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are abstract and negligible; there is no antagonist, time limit, or opposing force that compels a difficult trade-off. The climax—releasing the silence—is performed instantly upon instruction, lacking the friction or hesitation that would signal a genuine test of character.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the stakes (genetic monopoly vs. open history) are high in concept, they are low in execution because the opposition folds immediately. The confrontation with the envoy lacks escalation or meaningful back-and-forth, resulting in a resolution that feels unearned and devoid of genuine risk.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are high in concept (oblivion vs. preservation) but low in dramatic execution, as the conflict is entirely external and minimal (a single spasm of the thread). Success relies on established competence without forcing a trade-off, sacrifice, or significant escalation of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    While the stakes are clear, the escalation is somewhat mild; the obstacle (Mrs. Chen's grief) yields immediately to Elara's procedural intervention without significant resistance or complication. The conflict resolves through competence rather than a hard trade-off or heightened pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes remain purely abstract ("spiritual growth") with no concrete consequence for failure. The escalation is minimal; the "cloak of doubt" is accepted as armor without the protagonist having to sacrifice their old worldview through a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=4.4)
    Conflict is purely abstract—the struggle to "appear" by "vanishing"—and lacks a concrete antagonist or ticking clock to generate tension. The "cost" of disappearing is framed as an ascension or gift, effectively removing the stakes of loss or mortality. The narrative creates a sense of poise, but without the underlying pressure that gives such stillness weight.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are abstract and low-tension, as the "wandering pulse" seeks the protagonist out, making success feel predestined rather than earned. The escalation is procedural—observing and acting without opposition or the risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clear and high; the choice to refuse the unstrap sequence forecloses the protagonist's return, costing him his pension and life. The pressure of the "automated sentinels" adds necessary urgency to the quiet resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is no tangible opposition or risk; Elias faces no physical danger underwater nor any intellectual barrier to his quest. The "meteor hush" and lack of antagonists reduce the narrative to a linear errand. The ending comes without cost, rendering the stakes theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation is functional, moving from static bursts to physical pain ("teeth ache") and existential threat. The final cost—the dissolution of the self and the coins to become the signal—is visible and felt, satisfying the requirement for a meaningful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.0)
    Pressure escalates coherently from naming general fears to facing the personal void. While the external stakes are low (procedural), the internal deepening effectively reweights the protagonist's burden by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are declared ("cosmic imbalance") but remain abstract and lack immediate, on-page pressure. There is no antagonist, time constraint, or resource scarcity that forces a difficult decision; Kael succeeds on his first major attempt after a minor adjustment. The lack of escalation flattens the dramatic tension, making the outcome feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=2.8)
    The story lacks genuine pressure or escalation; Nora faces no antagonist, physical obstacle, or time constraint that opposes her goal. The stakes remain abstract ("history," "truth") because there is no immediate threat to her safety or reputation, and her final action requires no sacrifice. The narrative is a linear sequence of tasks rather than a conflict-driven arc.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are declared early (dissolution into void), but the on-page pressure is minimal as the protagonist encounters no obstacles, failures, or reversals. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned, as the solution presents itself without forcing a difficult trade-off or tactical pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes are high in theory (city safety) but abstract in execution; the "pressure" is stated repeatedly rather than demonstrated through difficult choices. The resolution comes too easily—a few keystrokes and a buckle click—without forcing a trade-off or renunciation. The "cost" is purely conceptual and stated, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes are high (existence), but the external conflict is somewhat static; the clones merely argue and flicker rather than actively pressuring the protagonist. The urgency is driven more by the environmental "temporal storm" than by the antagonists, missing an opportunity for a more dynamic "custody battle."

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=2.1)
    There are no meaningful stakes or opposition; Mara faces no obstacles in planting the seed or designing the puzzle. The narrative is devoid of tension, as the "challenge" is purely theoretical and resolved instantly by her own assertions of competence. No price is paid for the innovation.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.3)
    The emotional stakes are clear and the focus on "unspoken grief" provides a strong through-line. The escalation is subtle—a single micro-turn where Eleanor realizes she must modulate the force to avoid frightening Sarah. The conflict is resolved mostly through competence rather than a painful choice; the cost (Eleanor's fading) feels like a natural conclusion rather than a price paid in the heat of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes are low and abstract; the guardian faces existential boredom rather than immediate threat. The resolution—accepting uncertainty—dissolves tension rather than tightening it toward a costly choice, resulting in a contemplative but low-pressure arc.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clearly established as generational pressure versus personal survival. The escalation is sharp: the ritual fails, pressure mounts, and Elara raises the stakes by destroying the sacred tool. The cost—creating a "beautiful undeath" rather than true life—is a meaningful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.6)
    The conflict between rigid protocol and the alien nature of the shard drives the scene effectively. The escalation is internal but externalized through the dismantling of the rig, creating visible cost and high stakes that feel earned rather than melodramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are theoretical rather than felt; while the premise suggests danger (vanishing), the execution is routine and efficient. There is no escalation of pressure—Lina simply performs her tasks without error or opposition. The lack of a "tightening" beat or a moment where failure seems possible drains the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.1)
    The conflict is internalized (imposing order vs. organic truth) but dramatized well through the rebellion of the gallery. The escalation is palpable, though the stakes remain largely philosophical until the physical danger of the water manifests.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.4)
    The stakes are primarily intellectual and pedagogical; while the internal shift is clear, the external pressure is low. The conflict with the Tethian elder is gentle and didactic, lacking a sharp moment of risk or trade-off until the final philosophical acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are external and resolved too easily; the protagonist presses their hands on a chest, and professionals arrive "moments later" to solve the problem. There is no felt cost or difficult trade-off for the protagonist, making the "heroism" feel unearned. Escalation is abrupt—a sudden crash—rather than a rising tide of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are clearly established and escalate effectively with the rising water, forcing a choice between safety and the goal. The climax relies on endurance rather than a complex causal reversal, but the physical and psychological cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=3.9)
    There is a distinct lack of escalation or opposition; the protagonist encounters no setbacks, failure states, or active resistance from the environment or the machine. The narrative proceeds smoothly from attempt to success without raising the stakes or forcing a trade-off, resulting in a flat dramatic arc where the outcome feels inevitable rather than fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.4)
    Escalation is linear and somewhat low-pressure; the obstacle (sensation is not sound) is resolved almost immediately by the coincidental appearance of the spinebirds. The protagonist’s success comes too easily through sudden realization rather than struggle, and the ultimate cost—her death/oxidization—is buffered by the summary narration.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=2.9)
    There is virtually no opposition or cost; the protagonist encounters a magical object and immediately gains what she wants (transformation/release). The "bitterness" is mentioned but never manifests as an obstacle that makes the choice difficult. The stakes are purely abstract ("cosmic joke"), lacking a concrete, felt consequence for failure.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are clear and escalate appropriately when the clocktower retaliates. The physical cost (joints locking) adds necessary immediacy to the climax, though the total victory at the end slightly dampens the sense of lingering struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are declared but not felt; the protagonist faces no true dilemma or escalating risk because his invention works perfectly to bypass the antagonist. There is no moment where he must choose between safety and the mission; the path is smoothed by the gadget, removing the cost of success.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=2.0)
    There is a near-total absence of conflict or stakes. The entropy of the train offers no active resistance, there is no time pressure, and the protagonist faces no risk of failure. The resolution is frictionless, lacking any moment where the outcome is in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.4)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no resistance from the environment or herself, and the "climax" is a smooth unlocking of a door. Without a moment where failure is possible or a price is paid, the stakes remain purely theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes remain abstract and low-pressure; the environment cooperates ("islands arranging themselves"), and the dream waits to be caught. The conflict is resolved by obeying the cipher's instruction, lacking a moment of genuine risk or trade-off where the protagonist could have failed or chosen differently.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.2)
    The conflict is low-voltage; the ritual proceeds without obstruction or error, relying on the arrival of the star rather than protagonist agency under pressure. The stakes are emotional but resolved too smoothly to generate palpable narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=3.7)
    Stakes are declared but not felt; the struggle against the season and the complexity of the task are elided through the "three weeks" time jump. There is no on-page cost paid for the success; the mushroom simply grows because he sings to it in summary. The final "sting" of nostalgia is an abstract description of emotion rather than a demonstrated price.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (return vs. remain) is clear, but the escalation is low-pressure; the choice feels inevitable rather than hard-won. The cost of staying is felt conceptually, but the opposition is minimal, making the final decision feel like a gentle affirmation rather than a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes are high-concept but abstract, with no active opposition or moment where the outcome is in genuine doubt; the protagonist faces no meaningful resistance, resulting in a flat trajectory without escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation is managed well through the sequence of knots, each releasing a distinct, heavier memory. The stakes are deeply personal and felt. The climax—facing the "perfect fear"—provides a satisfying peak, even if the resolution (finding the pearl) relies on symbolic logic rather than a causal twist.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=2.4)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the protagonist faces no antagonist, physical obstacle, or internal dilemma. The "investigation" proceeds without resistance or risk of failure. The climax (pressing a stone) is a frictionless event that requires no sacrifice or difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are purely philosophical, lacking external resistance or a "felt" cost of failure beyond abstract dissatisfaction. The conflict is resolved through a quiet epiphany without a moment where the protagonist's worldview is genuinely tested or threatened, leading to low narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=2.2)
    There is virtually no conflict; the "storm" provides atmospheric noise but does not obstruct the protagonist’s goal or force a difficult trade-off. The ghost’s "unspoken needs" are met instantly upon the balladeer’s decision to sing, creating a friction-free narrative where success is inevitable. The stakes remain abstract ("pain of forgotten ages") and never threaten the protagonist’s safety or worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are low and internal; there is no external opposition or time pressure, and the "conflict" is merely a wait for information. The resolution is handed to the protagonist by the weather (sunlight appearing) rather than achieved through ingenuity or sacrifice, resulting in a smooth, tension-free ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear but largely intellectual; the mention of the rescue beacon early in the closure removes immediate physical jeopardy. The conflict remains internal—proving a theory—which holds interest but lacks visceral urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are purely conceptual and low-pressure; the demolition is a background clock that does not force difficult trade-offs until the inevitable end. The protagonist faces no active opposition, leading to a smooth, linear execution of his task.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=2.2)
    There are no obstacles or escalating stakes; Elara solves the puzzle instantly, the pilot agrees without hesitation, and they find the target immediately. The protagonist faces no opposition from the environment, other characters, or her own limitations.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=2.4)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the protagonist encounters a lock, immediately finds the key/prophecy, and resolves the issue without opposition or failure. There is no antagonist, no time pressure that affects tactics, and no moment where the outcome is in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is no escalation or reversal; the ghost provides a solution that is immediately accepted and successful without struggle. The stakes of the drought are stated but never tested against failure or sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist faces a "simple and impossible" task that she accomplishes immediately without adaptation or failure. There is no active opposition or escalation of difficulty; the pressure is purely atmospheric (time running out). The stakes are high (the end of the world), but the lack of struggle makes the outcome feel predetermined.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.3)
    The ticking clock of the encroaching frost provides effective situational pressure, escalating the stakes naturally. While the external tension is high, the travelers remain abstract figures, which limits the emotional impact of their specific rescue compared to Elara's solitary burden.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=4.1)
    The conflict is internal but static; the protagonist does not have to make difficult choices, only observe and accept an insight. The stakes are theoretical (a polymer, a feeling of peace) and lack immediate, on-page pressure or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are thematic rather than immediate; the vendor faces no resistance from customers or environment, resulting in low narrative pressure. The "opening day" timeframe adds no urgency (no crowds, no performance anxiety), leaving the conflict strictly internal and contemplative.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    The conflict escalates cleanly from a professional task to a moral dilemma. The pressure is coherent, and the shift from "sandpapering" (erasure) to "subsuming" (sacrifice) represents a meaningful deepening of the stakes with legible on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is virtually no conflict; the community and the machinery yield to Elara's will without resistance. No antagonist, skepticism, or physical difficulty challenges her plan, resulting in a flat trajectory with zero escalation. The stakes are declared ("bridges from silos") but never tested by the possibility of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story lacks significant opposition; the engineer modifies reality with immediate success and accepts the "entanglement" risk instantly. Without an antagonist or a moment of genuine potential failure, the stakes remain theoretical rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=3.9)
    Conflict is driven solely by a clock (the hour limit) rather than antagonistic pressure or hard choices. The protagonist faces no significant setbacks or dilemmas; the retrieval of the codes is a linear sequence of events without escalation or deepening of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=2.8)
    There are no functional stakes or opposition; the "intensely quiet" world acts as a backdrop rather than an antagonist. The protagonist faces no obstacles or risks in achieving her goal, resulting in a flat narrative trajectory with zero escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are largely retrospective, with the primary conflict (the betrayal) already in the past. The present-moment pressure is low—sitting and thinking—and while the eclipse provides a clock, there are no active obstacles or escalating trade-offs on the page before the decision is made.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=3.0)
    Stakes are abstract and lack immediate pressure; the "locked diary" is opened on the first significant attempt without failure or consequence. There is no opposition or meaningful cost to Mira's success; the "fireworks" provide a time marker but do not force a difficult trade-off. The resolution comes too easily, stripping the narrative of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=2.0)
    There is no meaningful conflict; the protagonist encounters zero opposition to his goals. The arrival of the minstrel—a potential complication—is resolved instantly with the tincture, reducing the stakes to a transaction. Without obstacles, failure risks, or tough trade-offs, the story lacks narrative drive and escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are declared but not tested; the ascent lacks genuine peril as Kael dismisses the "whispered warnings" without struggle. There are no reversals or escalating pressures that force the protagonist to alter her tactics or pay a price for her goal.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake is abstract (preventing a hypothetical future accident) and faces no active opposition; the investigation proceeds without failure or trade-offs. The protagonist measures and observes without ever risking safety, reputation, or resources.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=2.9)
    Stakes are purely abstract ("certify wonder") and lack personal consequence for Lyra; the "weight" of the silence is mentioned but overcome instantly by ringing a bell. There is no escalation of pressure; the ritual works on the first try, and the "threat" of smothering never materializes into a concrete obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes remain low and abstract; the "fracture" opens but poses no immediate, concrete threat that forces a hard trade-off. The protagonist's resolution comes too easily—he plays a song, sees a vision, and immediately accepts his burden without facing resistance or complication. The conflict is resolved by the magic tool, not the character's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are primarily intellectual ("solve the mathematics of emotion") and lack visceral, immediate cost until the symbolic ending. The escalation is present as the stars vanish, but the protagonist's agency feels more observational than desperate.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.0)
    Conflict is minimal and resolves immediately; the courier encounters a sad child and instantly uses the magic item to solve the problem, facing no significant resistance or dilemma. The cost of giving up the pendant is implied by the backstory ("inherited from... mentor") but the transaction on the page lacks hesitation or weight, resulting in a low-stakes interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes are primarily internal and abstract; the &quot;polite contempt&quot; of colleagues is a phantom pressure that never manifests in the scene to force a difficult choice. The escalation comes from the magical phenomenon intensifying rather than protagonist agency or rising cost. While the final shift in worldview is earned, the lack of external friction makes the journey feel smooth rather than fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake (connection with the lost daughter vs. retention of self) is clear and escalates to a permanent, paid cost on the page. The sacrifice is visceral, though the opposition is largely passive until the final transaction, making the conflict feel somewhat internal and inevitable rather than actively opposed.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.2)
    The stakes are clear, but the protagonist faces minimal opposition; the journey creates distance but no active obstacles or complications. The final barter provides a beat of internal conflict, but the path to get there is linear and lacks escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story lacks meaningful escalation; the threat is introduced and immediately resolved by the protagonist's innate ability without a "try-fail" cycle or shifting tactics. The stakes are declared ("swallow the repair bay") but remain abstract, and the resolution comes without visible sacrifice or cost beyond the acceptance of a metaphorical burden.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is virtually no escalation or obstacle; the lamp's failure serves only as a prompt for a calm ritual rather than a source of tension. The protagonist faces no difficult choice and pays no price for his detour.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=3.6)
    Conflict is negligible; the antagonist (the storm/digital haze) presents no genuine threat to a protagonist who can alter reality at will. There is no moment where the outcome is in doubt, and the resolution requires no sacrifice or ingenuity, only the exercise of an established power. The stakes are declared but not felt, as the solution is applied instantly upon the problem's appearance.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes are purely intellectual ("unravel threads of meaning") and lack visceral or on-page consequences. The escalation is linear and low-pressure, leading to a resolution that requires no sacrifice or cost from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=3.3)
    Dramatic tension is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no genuine opposition, as the environment and tools conspire to help her succeed immediately. The "deconstruction" of the map—the climax—is accomplished without difficulty or risk, resulting in a flat trajectory. The stakes are theoretical (understanding trees) rather than visceral or immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=3.8)
    The stakes—restoring the realm versus losing memory—are established, but the tension evaporates when the story resets and repeats the climax. The cost of the sacrifice is not felt because the timeline logic breaks, undoing the protagonist's final act.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.0)
    The dominant stake (isolation vs. connection) is clear, but the escalation is purely internal and abstract. The conflict is resolved by a "soft reset" where the protagonist realizes the opposing forces are actually the same thing, removing the need for a trade-off or genuine sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.6)
    Conflict is abstract and lacks visceral cost; the "sacrifice" of an inedible, stone-hard loaf is symbolic rather than a difficult trade-off. There is no active antagonist or escalation of risk, leaving the stakes purely conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are declared ("oblivion") but remain abstract; the protagonist faces no genuine opposition or difficult trade-offs. The conflict is resolved through a simple mechanical adjustment, lacking the escalation or pressure required for a compelling arc.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=4.5)
    Escalation is present through the false starts, but the resolution fails to address the central stake. The protagonist records the betrayal but allows the deal to be "sealed," leaving the market exposed to the authorities despite the narrative asserting that the pirates are safe.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.3)
    The convergence provides effective situational pressure, forcing a "now or never" observation. While the stakes are philosophical rather than visceral, the cost is made legible through the sacrifice of the tin ring—her only tool—marking a concrete trade-off between control and connection.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=3.6)
    Escalation is minimal; the protagonist overcomes the central barrier on the first substantive attempt using a convenient ability. The resolution brings reward without sacrifice, failing to establish a visible price for the change.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=4.7)
    External conflict is negligible; the guard offers only token resistance that is overcome immediately by "sincerity" without cost or ingenuity. The protagonist achieves her goal and resolves her internal "wilting" without making a difficult trade-off or sacrifice, resulting in a low-stakes narrative where success feels inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is largely abstract (entropy vs. art) and lacks immediate, on-page pressure or antagonism to force difficult tactics. The stakes are high conceptually (the loss of wonder), but the protagonist faces little resistance in her work until the thematic epiphany at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (integrity of consciousness) is clear, and the magnetic shift provides effective ticking-clock pressure. However, the protagonist's agency is diluted by the reliance on the system glitch to bypass the fire suppression; the "escape" from protocol is enabled by luck rather than a costly choice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are declared but never causally tested; the opposition is a straw man that vanishes instantly upon the reveal. The protagonist pays no price and faces no genuine trade-off to achieve the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative is a linear progression of success without escalation or reversals; the plan works perfectly on the first try. There is no moment where the protagonist's agency is tested by failure or a new complication, and she pays no visible cost for her liberation.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=4.6)
    While the stakes are emotionally resonant, the conflict is resolved too easily via a "magic key" solution (the flowers) that encounters only atmospheric resistance. There is no moment where the protagonist must sacrifice something or make a difficult choice to succeed, resulting in low dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes are established early (preventing a flood) and escalate as the brook fights back against the silence. While the resolution (placing the final crane) is physically simple, the conceptual stakes are high, and the cost of the victory is felt in the changed nature of the stream.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.3)
    Conflict is minimal for most of the narrative; the "lessons" are frictionless. The stakes regarding the "agreed-upon lies" are conceptual rather than visceral until the sudden mention of renovation. The pressure on the protagonist feels intellectual rather than urgent until the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes are high (losing the sister's trace), and the dawn deadline creates functional pressure. However, the central obstacle—Elara's reliance on logic—dissolves somewhat conveniently when she decides to surrender, lacking a moment where her skepticism forces a costly trade-off before the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is virtually no active conflict; the protagonist enters, performs a task, and leaves without facing a tangible antagonist or risk of failure. The stakes are declared ("treason," "tyrant's rage") but never felt, as the environment and the mechanism yield to Elara immediately. The absence of opposition drains the scene of narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story lacks an active antagonist or concrete pressure; the "universe's indifference" is a theme, not an obstacle. The stakes remain entirely abstract ("stories not lost"), and the "conspiracy" offers no resistance, resulting in a narrative devoid of tension or necessary trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=2.5)
    There are no significant obstacles or stakes; the door opens easily, the ghost cooperates immediately, and the prize is found without struggle. The story lacks escalation, as Maya faces no risk of failure or meaningful trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=2.6)
    There is virtually no conflict or active resistance; Kael learns the method immediately, and the villagers' doubt is summarized and dismissed. The lack of obstacles or costs leaves the narrative without tension or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are clear and high (survival vs. truth), but the antagonist (the council) remains abstract until the final paragraphs. The escalation is logical, though the emotional pressure is often stated ("cost him friends") rather than felt in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are global and personal, with a clear cost (treason/death) accepted by the protagonist. The escalation from receiving the data to the decision to broadcast is well-paced. The arrival of the enforcers provides a tangible deadline pressure that forces the final action.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no external antagonist and overcomes the technical challenge of capturing sound instantly with wax and a paperclip. The stakes are purely thematic (redemption) rather than urgent or visceral, and the climax is a gift-giving moment that is immediately accepted by the town without complication or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes are clear, but the escalation is linear and the protagonist's victory feels largely inevitable due to her specialized knowledge. The cost is somatic ("flesh felt the sound") rather than a meaningful sacrifice or trade-off, keeping the tension in the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.0)
    Tension is low because the antagonist is abstract and the immediate opposition (enforcers) is explicitly described as fearful and ineffective. The success of the revolution is presented as a mathematical certainty rather than a risky gamble, removing the pressure necessary for a compelling narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.5)
    The conflict is functional and the stakes are legible, with a clear adversary in Voss. However, the escalation relies entirely on a phone call and a convenient discovery of loosened bolts, lacking a visceral sense of immediate physical or professional danger beyond the stated threat.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are legible but the conflict remains low-pressure and abstract; the tension is resolved by watching a craftsman work rather than through interpersonal conflict. The external storm adds "pathetic fallacy" urgency that isn't inherent in the scene's dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes remain theoretical and abstract ("theoretical resonance"), with no active antagonist or time pressure. Zephyr encounters no obstacles to her plan, and the "cost" of efficiency is thematic rather than a felt price paid by the protagonist on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=3.2)
    Escalation is absent; the protagonist faces no genuine opposition, moving from clue to solution with perfect ease. The "security AI" offers no resistance, and the decision to "lie" carries no visible risk or cost on the page. The stakes are declared but never tested, resulting in a flat narrative arc without tension.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.8)
    The stakes are declared but the cost is trivialized; the "willing blood" required is merely "one red bead" that causes the boy to smile immediately after, removing any sense of genuine sacrifice or fear. The resolution relies on a "pure child" trope that bypasses the protagonist's need to make a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=5.6)
    While the life-or-death stakes are theoretically high, the internal conflict is resolved with relatively low pressure; the choice to live feels like a gentle drift rather than a struggle. The "fold in patience" is stated as a breaking point, but its release lacks a visceral, felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.1)
    The story lacks a dominant stake or opposition; the sentinel wants to write a letter and does so without internal or external obstacles. There is no meaningful tightening of options or escalation of tension. The conflict is purely theoretical, residing in the backstory of the anonymous lovers rather than in the present action of the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=2.1)
    Tension is nonexistent as the protagonist faces no opposition; the sand moves on command and the ritual succeeds immediately. There are no stakes on the page because failure is never a plausible threat.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is no antagonist, resistance, or meaningful escalation; the town's grief yields immediately and smoothly to the archivist's method. Without an active obstacle or a moment where the protagonist's goal is genuinely threatened, the story lacks narrative tension and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—legacy vs. erasure—escalates cleanly. The climax, where the crystal returns "nothing" for his name, provides a visceral, on-page cost to his previous passivity, forcing a meaningful change in agency.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.0)
    The escalation is functional, moving from search to capture to failure (the chalk snapping). The stakes remain largely philosophical, and the cost (accepting the loss of the sound) is paid, but the tension is somewhat low-key and dampened by the contemplative pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are declared ("observatory tore free") but never felt, as Kael operates with serene efficiency and encounters no meaningful resistance or trade-offs. The conflict resolves immediately upon his first attempt to fix the gears, lacking the escalation or active antagonism required to generate genuine narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is no genuine opposition; the estrangement—the central conflict—collapses the moment Elara intervenes. Lena’s "hesitation" is a token gesture that offers no real resistance to the protagonist's goal, resulting in a flat narrative arc where the stakes (a reconciled death) are achieved without risk, trade-off, or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=4.1)
    Stakes are declared ("entity within would spill forth") but never effectively dramatized; the antagonist force "thrashes" once and is immediately subdued. There is no escalation of pressure, no narrowing of options, and no sacrifice required to succeed, resulting in a flat conflict arc.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are high and personal; Elena's entire career is the cost of the truth. The pressure escalates from the initial forensic evidence to the face-to-face dismantling of her theory. The resolution feels earned through her willingness to accept failure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is virtually no conflict; Mira desires to make light, finds the materials immediately, creates it without failure, and is instantly accepted by the community. The absence of obstacles, skepticism, or trade-offs renders the stakes invisible. The narrative creates no tension because success is inevitable from the first beat.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=4.8)
    Present-tense conflict is virtually absent; the stakes are entirely in the past (the viral confession), and the gardening actions face no resistance. The narrative lacks a meaningful tightening or escalation of immediate threat.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.0)
    The conflict is purely internal and resolved without significant resistance; the "current of forgetting" is described but offers no genuine obstacle to the protagonist's progress. The stakes feel low because the risk of failure is never dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the "antagonist" is a passive, withered vine that offers no resistance. There is no escalation of stakes; Elara arrives, acts once, and succeeds immediately. The narrative lacks a moment where failure feels possible or where a hard choice is required.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are declared ("lost child") but never tested; the protagonist faces no active opposition, time pressure, or resource scarcity that forces a difficult trade-off. The resolution (child safe by a fire) retroactively lowers the stakes, as the child was never in immediate danger, and the protagonist pays no price to achieve the goal.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are thematic rather than visceral, and the conflict lacks urgency or personal risk. The protagonist works "without haste," removing time pressure, and faces no antagonist or potential for failure. The resolution comes through patience rather than sacrifice or a high-stakes trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes escalate cleanly through the increasing gravity of the burdens, moving from personal loss (daughter) to internal flaw (pride) to existential state (unforgiven). The pressure builds coherently within the ritual frame, forcing the final transformative realization.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=5.5)
    The conflict is internal (grief vs. peace) but lacks sufficient resistance; the ritual resolves the tension without a palpable cost or difficult choice. The stakes are stated ("harvest lessons") rather than dramatized through risk.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=3.7)
    Conflict is negligible; the antagonist (the ghost) presents "not in threat, but in invitation," removing the tension immediately upon arrival. There is no escalation of stakes, only a linear progression toward a benevolent interaction that solves the protagonist's problem without forcing a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=2.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no active opposition, resource scarcity, or failure risk. The stakes remain theoretical ("beacon of hope") rather than immediate, and the resolution is a linear progression of successes without escalation or peril.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—making peace with the past—is signaled early and resolved through the ritual. While the pressure is low-key and internal, the physical cost (the destruction of the chronometer) is visible on the page, satisfying the requirements for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is virtually no conflict; the environment yields its secrets without resistance, and there is no antagonist or time pressure to force a trade-off. The dominant stake ("to understand") remains abstract and is never threatened, resulting in a flat narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are thematic rather than visceral; while the loss of the wisp-grass method is a clear global stake, the on-page pressure is low. The fog provides atmospheric rather than causal pressure, and the cost of success is minimal (numb fingers). The protagonist faces no difficult trade-offs or moments of genuine doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=2.9)
    Dramatic tension is virtually non-existent; there is no antagonist, no time pressure, and no mutually exclusive goal to force a trade-off. The character faces no risk of failure and pays no visible cost for her actions; the "weight" mentioned is purely metaphorical and resolves instantly without struggle. The narrative functions as a mood piece rather than a story driven by conflict or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.0)
    The central conflict (beauty vs. efficiency) is clear, but the stakes feel abstract because the risk of failure is not visceral in the moment. The "gear-quake" provides coincidence rather than causal pressure, and the resolution comes relatively easily once the machine is built. The protagonist observes the outcome more than he wrestles with the consequences during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=2.2)
    Stakes are purely symbolic and face no on-page test; the bird is fixed immediately with no risk of failure or cost to the protagonist. There is no opposition or escalation of pressure; the "conflict" is solved by the mere application of the prompt's required attitude ("unyielding compassion").

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=2.5)
    Stakes are declared but never tested; Kael faces no external antagonism, physical barrier, or internal doubt, turning the climax into a mechanical task of waiting and pressing a latch. The resolution requires no trade-off or loss, rendering the "triumph" hollow and the tension nonexistent.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes are theoretically high (extinction), but the on-page pressure is low because the obstacle yields immediately to the protagonist’s first major attempt. There is no moment where Elara faces a genuine trade-off or risk of failure; the gear provides the key, and the garden accepts it without the escalation required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=3.9)
    Dramatic tension is undercut by the ghostly mentorship, which functions as a Deus Ex Machina to provide answers (the spiral concept) whenever Kael is stuck. There is no point where Kael must make a difficult trade-off or risk failure; he simply follows a set of supernatural instructions to success.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stakes—collective guilt versus the integrity of the ground itself—are elevated and distinct. The pressure escalates naturally as the tide rises and the inscriptions are decoded, forcing a clear ethical choice. The cost is well-defined conceptually: the loss of a controllable narrative (human error) for an uncontrollable one (nature's betrayal).

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=1.8)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the protagonist faces no opposition, time pressure, or risk of failure while decoding the tapestry. The stakes remain abstract and purely internal, with no escalation or tightening of options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.7)
    Conflict is theoretical rather than visceral; the "hard constraint" of the elders' skepticism evaporates almost instantly upon Kaelen's presentation ("traced the borehole... nodded"). There is no back-and-forth, no moment where Kaelen must sacrifice something or risk her standing to push the plan through. The stakes are high (survival), but the on-page obstacle is overcome with a single conversation, lacking escalation or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=3.0)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the antagonist forces ("story famine," "prying eyes") are abstract concepts that do not test the protagonist on the page. There is no escalation of risk or difficulty, resulting in a linear procession of tasks without genuine stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=4.1)
    Stakes remain abstract and internal; the "mirage of safety" is an intellectual problem rather than a visceral threat. There is little escalation; the protagonist performs a ritual and leaves without facing a distinct obstacle or paying a tangible price. The conflict is static, merely observing the theme rather than testing it.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.2)
    Tension builds effectively with the approaching footsteps and the race to encode the data. However, the climax deflates rapidly; the antagonist's unexplained leniency undercuts the life-or-death stakes established early on, robbing the resolution of its earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is almost no active conflict or pressure on the page; the students' "inherited distrust" evaporates the moment the teacher explains the method. Escalation is absent, as the obstacle (hatred/noise) offers no resistance to the protagonist's goal, resulting in a story without stakes or earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the protagonist faces no active opposition from the antagonist, and the environment offers no resistance to her magic. The climax is resolved by the celestial coincidence and instant plant growth, requiring no sacrifice, trade-off, or meaningful risk from the character.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=4.0)
    Escalation is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no active opposition, solves the riddle immediately, and ascends the tower without struggle. There is no moment of doubt or necessary sacrifice; the narrative proceeds linearly from discovery to total success without pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is no conflict, antagonist, or internal barrier; the protagonist faces no opposition in his quest to sanctify the houses. Stakes are declared ("to understand") but never threatened or tested, and the story proceeds without escalation or trade-offs, resulting in a flat narrative trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.7)
    The stakes are high abstractly (the soul of the city) but low concretely; there is no active antagonist or immediate time pressure beyond the diver's initial death. The conflict is largely internal and philosophical, lacking a moment where Petra faces external resistance or a visceral trade-off beyond the conceptual loss of "certainty."

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clear and escalated well from the abstract "wager" to the visceral possibility of escape. The pressure builds coherently through the climb and the dice rolls, and the final decision forces a meaningful trade-off between relief and truth.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=2.9)
    There is no meaningful opposition; the protagonist faces no risk of failure and pays no price for his success. The "smog-choked city" is a passive obstacle that yields immediately to the magic brush. Without escalation or a moment where the outcome is in doubt, the story lacks narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are declared ("withered heart") but not felt, as the protagonist encounters no active opposition or significant obstacles. The climax resolves without sacrifice or trade-off, rendering the victory unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is negligible because the antagonist (the stone/fate) offers no active resistance during the climax; the stone cracks immediately upon the yoyo spin. There is no moment where the protagonist must choose between competing values, risk failure, or pay a price for victory.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are undercut by the advisor's constant guidance, which removes the risk of failure or misinterpretation. The protagonist faces no true dilemma; she simply executes commands, making the victory over the fear entities feel inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are declared ("shatter her home") but never viscerally tested, as the protagonist neutralizes the threat with immediate, uncontested competence. The conflict lacks escalation or a moment of genuine jeopardy, resulting in low narrative tension where the outcome never feels in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes escalate clearly from the intellectual risk of mapping to the physical and existential danger of the confrontation at the gate. The climax delivers a meaningful turn where the protagonist reconfigures the terms of the conflict, moving from a victim of silence to an active challenger.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is no meaningful escalation or opposition; the protagonist enters, finds the object immediately, and leaves without facing a hard trade-off. The stakes remain abstract ("rescuing truth") and are resolved with symmetric satisfaction rather than a paid price.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.9)
    External pressure is low; the isolation functions more as a timeout than a ticking clock with immediate threats. The conflict is primarily internal and resolved through industriousness rather than difficult trade-offs, until the final professional deception adds a layer of genuine stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=2.4)
    Stakes are low and abstract; the "blackout" creates atmospheric tension but forces no difficult choices or trade-offs. The resolution comes from external events (lights coming back on), rendering the protagonist's actions largely ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.4)
    Conflict is static; the antagonist (shadow) waits passively for the protagonist to finish her work. The escalation is linear (more cranes, more power) without forcing the protagonist to alter tactics or confront a dilemma beyond endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.1)
    The external stakes are clear (the ticking clock of the reboot), providing basic narrative tension. The conflict is primarily competence-based (beating the clock) rather than a deep moral or tactical dilemma with high cost; the "cost" of witnessing is stated abstractly ("weight of all unlived possibilities") rather than dramatized as a painful on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is negligible; the protagonist encounters a lock and immediately solves it using available data without failure, adaptation, or risk. The stakes remain abstract ("dead circuits"), and the victory comes without sacrifice, resulting in a low-pressure narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are purely internal and resolved without external opposition or genuine risk; the protagonist faces no obstacles in his search. The escalation is non-existent as he moves from desire directly to satisfaction. The resolution comes too easily, lacking the friction required for a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are declared ("ignite war anew") but never tested on the page; the negotiation faces no active opposition, disagreement, or complication. The protagonist and his counterpart are in perfect sync, resulting in a transaction devoid of tension or escalation. Without a moment where the outcome is in doubt, the declared high stakes feel theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.9)
    Internal stakes are high and the cost of the journey is felt, but the external obstacles (specifically the fog) dissolve somewhat conveniently as poles appear "just in time." While the emotional escalation is sound, the physical pressure flickers; the environment cooperates too readily with the protagonist's internal realizations.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=2.5)
    Stakes are purely abstract ("to kindle empathy") and lack immediate physical or emotional peril until the contrived cavern collapse. The protagonist faces no difficult trade-offs; the "labyrinth of choices" resolves through a simple heartbeat check, bypassing genuine conflict. The resolution comes without sacrifice or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is negligible; the "knife-edge between life and afterlife" is mentioned but never felt through resistance or failure. The stakes are theoretical because the ritual proceeds smoothly to a "perfect" reunion, treating the loss of humanity as a joyous upgrade rather than a visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.2)
    The internal stakes of motherhood and identity are well-established, but the conflict resolution feels intellectually gifted by the narrative voice rather than wrestled from the antagonist (time). The pressure remains contemplative, lacking a moment where the protagonist must make a difficult trade-off under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clear and escalate through the specific mechanism of the "shadow work" stitching, deepening from a physical task to an emotional reckoning. The cost is palpable—the weight of admitted guilt pressing her to the deck. The final reconfiguration of the dominant stake (from escape to service) is earned by the deepening process.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.2)
    The external stakes (saving the village) are resolved entirely by coincidence and accident, denying the protagonist any agency in the outcome. While Kael achieves a personal realization, the disconnection between his actions and the world-saving consequences makes the resolution feel unearned and mechanically convenient rather than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake of rebellion is clear, and the blackout provides a ticking clock of sorts. However, the conflict lacks sufficient friction; the antagonist is absent, and the puzzles yield immediately to Seren's skills without cost or setback. The victory feels too smooth, lacking a moment of true jeopardy or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.6)
    The stakes are high—world stability vs. personal dissolution—and the pressure escalates effectively through the ritual. The resolution, where she chooses to witness rather than solve, is a valid Conceptual Repricing, though the cost of the "shadow dissolving" is introduced very late, making the threat feel slightly rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes are low and abstract; the protagonist faces no active opposition or genuine dilemma, only a self-imposed wait. The resolution comes from the passage of time (the timer clicking) rather than a costly decision or action. The "furious calm" is stated but not tested by external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are theoretical ("reputation") rather than felt; the protagonist faces no risk of loss or specific consequence for failure. The duel lacks escalation, described through abstract summary ("dance of intellect") rather than a sequence of moves that narrow options or force a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=2.5)
    Conflict is resolved instantly via summary; there is no on-page resistance from guards or inmates, and the "rebuilding" faces no dramatized obstacles. Stakes are declared abstractly ("anarchy of despair") but never tested by a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes and conflict are virtually nonexistent; the storm acts as background noise rather than an active pressure, and the protagonist faces no opposition in achieving his goal. He sacrifices nothing to reach the arbor, making the emotional climax ("playing until fingers bled") feel melodramatic rather than earned by prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes are clear (collective memory loss vs. preservation), and the approaching monsoon provides a functional ticking clock. While the external opposition is somewhat abstract (entropy), Kael’s deviation from protocol (singing instead of just planting) provides a meaningful escalation of tactics. The cost is conceptual—the burden of not knowing if the history is real or invented.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=4.6)
    Conflict is internal but low-stakes on the page; Mara faces no obstacles, resistance, or cost in performing the ritual. The resolution feels inevitable and smooth, lacking the friction of a difficult choice or a trade-off required to achieve the "unspoken apologies."

    Dominant stake (access unspeakable via vigil) tightens texturally through storm intensification and mask slip, forcing stance crystallization; cost legible in refolding envelope as foreclosed open rebellion.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (duel as intellectual dance) tightens via sundial glance enabling fluid strikes; agency in parry-riposte narrows options, but opponent pressure lacks deepening complication before stumble.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake of forging beauty from anarchy tightens via library rebuild narrowing despair options; agency in choosing poet voice during molt forces trade-off, with visible cost in passing tin before release.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (surprise fate via encore) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through reel puzzle success then storm-tightened journey to bled-fingers climax. Agency in creative decoding forces trade-off of time/effort. Cost unmistakable in "played until his fingers bled."

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (preserve memory before monsoon) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through dreams clarifying action and unprecedented singing narrowing to belief; cost legible in reconfigured doubt charging final petal image.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (heal severance via remembrance) tightens accumulatively through ritual (wire wrapping narrows resistance), forcing endurance with cost (three seasons, longing absorbed). Agency in Mara's hands-on work; cost legible in compass cooling.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—whether she will keep trying to strip drama/decay or accept it—tightens once when the dust transfers to her finger and she chooses not to bag it. Pressure is textural: each new stain or spore increases density until her stance flips; cost is the forfeiture of future data (legible in “she would not return”). No external antagonist; conflict is internal and situational, coherent under Accumulative lens. Deepening rather than reversal, but sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—expose traffickers via ledger—yields to emergent stake: forge legacy glass that redeems the charcoal crime. Escalation is textural: frost pattern densifies until it replaces the ledger as map, narrowing options to furnace. The price—he physically melts his father’s shard—lands on-page, but the trafficking threat never re-enters to test the new resolve, capping tension below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clear: give each soul proper rest. Pressure escalates via accumulative deepening: each corpse buried adds weight, each new arrival fractures promised silence. The protagonist’s agency is relentless assembly; cost is their own metamorphosis. One meaningful tightening occurs when the lens hums with voices, shifting task from burial to beacon—options narrowed, price visible.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake: keep communal memory alive while smuggling food under tightening sanctions. Escalation is accretive: each bell chime adds story-sharing as non-negotiable ritual, narrowing future nights. Visible price—storm-soaked volunteers, nightly exposure—legible on page. No single reversal, but cumulative deepening suffices for 600-word Accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“where is unused love stored?”—tightens as each breath deepens the corridor of light, foreclosing the option that love was ever lost; price is the dissolution of the spectral lover. Escalation is textural: density of sparks increases until Mira’s chest becomes the vessel that must open. Agency = renunciation/release; no external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—map time or be consumed by it—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when photographs begin to bleach in real-time. One meaningful deepening occurs at the geometric center where all paths diverge yet converge; that spatial paradox forces her final wager. Cost is palpable: each photograph she trades away is aPossible future she forfeits. No reversal, but the escalating surrender of memories narrows escape routes under Accumulative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—liberate seeds to revive dead soil—tightens once: the sentry’s activation collapses “decode keys” into “survive now.” Agency remains intact; the same arrow that guided discovery becomes the tool that misdirects the machine, paying a visible price (exposed back, chained ankle still anchored). No coincidence resolves; every escalation flows from prior causal setup. Cost is legible but compressed: the final seed pressed into dust carries the conceptual price of perpetual chain-drag, yet the beat is one quiet gesture rather than a visceral forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—capture the exact frequency of trust-breaking—is signaled in paragraph 5 and escalates by accretion: each vial of silence narrows the possible sound until only the hollow note remains. Cost is felt on-page when she recognizes the “flat grey of dead coral” as the color of her own former belief. No external antagonist appears, but the pressure is coherent: the orchard keeps fruiting, so time and memory keep producing new absences to harvest. One deepening suffices for this length; the cleared channel at the end forecloses any future listening.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake: can Marek create a vessel that holds grief without shattering it? Escalation via accelerating thaw → new fracture → bowl scaled up, each step foreclosing retreat. Cost legible: crack widens, bookmark soaked, gauge moves—tangible price for “safe zone.” Agency remains his: he decides to leave bowl, not coincidence. One tightening suffices; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—prove synthetic self worthy—tightens when AI eyes dim and hull crawl demands phobic endurance. Visible price: facing starry void. Escalation is single but sufficient; Caela’s off-stage voice is complication, not resolver.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can silence be navigated?—tightens through iterative images of hush thickening, star dying, map glowing; no external antagonist, but pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening: traveler realizes silence itself is language. Cost is conceptual (perpetual night, vanished star) rather than viscerally felt on-page, keeping it just below 8-band excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes—maintenance duty vs. quest for consciousness—tighten when the loop feedback risks permanent chronometer drift; the cost is visible as “internal clock stutter” and melting violin. Escalation is causal under chosen lens: each pluck narrows options until silence restores duty, now freighted with ontological weight. One missed opportunity: no measurable resource drain (battery, memory buffer) to quantify price.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—thaw mistrust via transparency—is signaled early and tightens once when Elara chooses to eavesdrop/project, narrowing her ethical stance. Pressure is coherent but external: missing funds, staff glances; her personal risk remains abstract, so the cost is felt by others (stagehand, team) more than by her. Sufficient for 600-word scale but not acutely priced on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—prove time moves sideways—signaled in paragraph two; escalation is accumulative: each magnetic flutter tightens the sensor grid until the blackout forecloses replication. Protagonist agency drives the decisive lever pull; cost is the station-wide power loss and tomorrow’s inevitable dismissal. No coincidence resolves the tension; the nexus blooms because Kael engineers the convergence. One meaningful tightening suffices; the price is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—complete or reject the diva’s code—tightens once: the third note forces choose-now pressure between muse-preservation and release. Disruptive playing is her agency; cost (ghost gone, program dissolved) manifests on page. Coincidence absent; escalation causal under chosen lens. One meaningful turn suffices at this length; option foreclosure clearly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—quantify the swallowed truth—tightens when the scale needle refuses to settle, foreclosing the illusion that guilt has numeric weight. Escalation is textural: each revisit to the lily illustration adds density until the word “forgive” emerges as the only viable unit. No external antagonist is needed; the conflict is between incompatible desires—measure vs. release—and the final image crystallizes the latter at undeniable cost. Price is felt in the aurora’s fade: she forfeits the shelter of perpetual uncertainty for the vulnerability of peace.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“measure the weight of swallowed truth”—tightens when each bead equals one locked-in soul; escalation is the accruing count and the spectral materialization that forces the twist. Protagonist agency drives the turn: he could seal or release; he chooses release at measurable psychic cost. Pressure is coherent, single-cycle, sufficient for 700-word frame. No off-stage rescue—twist is his, price is his.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—witness without judgment—signaled early. Pressure is situational: decay creeps, silence offers temporary reprieve, but no option is foreclosed. No meaningful tightening or price is dramatized; the swan’s release is symbolic rather than tactical. Escalation is atmospheric, not agentive, capping score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—revive Eleanor’s submerged identity via music—signaled early. Escalation is the moon-shadow itself, tightening from “first bite” to “totality,” narrowing options to ninety seconds of shared memory. Mira’s agency is her choice of the generational lullaby under eclipse light, not a new tactic but a timed acceleration of her existing method. Cost is Eleanor’s post-eclipse sleep and Mira’s irreversible knowledge that wonder outlives memory.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—can any trace of human dreamlife be saved?—is signaled early and tightens when Elias realizes the dreams migrated into matter itself. The meaningful deepening occurs at the midpoint pattern-reveal; no second reversal is needed at this length. Cost is legible: he imprisons himself in the thickest chamber, sacrificing future mobility to keep the charge alive. Under the accumulative lens, the pressure mounts by density, not causality, and the final stance crystallizes with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“can she reclaim agency from accidental prophecy?”—tightens the moment she writes the first instruction-cookie. Each placed cookie is a visible price (she could be exposed) and narrows options: once Tomás finds the ring, the island’s gratitude becomes a social debt she must maintain. Escalation is accumulative rather than reversed; the seven-minute ferry delay is the single intensification that crystallizes her new power. Cost is legible but lightweight—no lasting consequence touches her directly, capping tension at 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: save Elias before the ink settles; seven-hour clock is signaled early and tightens through each looped question. Escalation is textural—silence layers until paradox smothers certainty—cost legible in Elias’s scream absorbed by painted quiet. The final price: the monastery must keep hosting unresolved paradoxes, a perpetual drain.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—transmute silence into audible symphony—gains density via accumulative sensory beats rather than causal reversals. The single tightening is the shell-to-glass contact; options narrow to “release the note or succumb to fog.” Cost is atmospheric, not tangible, yet legible as spent life-force. A second beat of resistance would deepen pressure, but the lyric mode justifies one decisive intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—conquer self before next eternal phase—signaled in line 5. Escalation via procedural corridors that rewrite themselves, narrowing escape routes; tablet crack moment visibly raises cost. Agency remains interior (acceptance) yet forecloses all future escapes; cost legible in dissolution-to-dust. No coincidence; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—defeat emotional numbness—is signaled in line 1. Pressure intensifies texturally: each reversed pulse thickens the “cotton silence” until it fractures; the visible price is the tear-track and the permanent carved groove. No coincidence; escalation is one sustained deepening that forecloses the option of remaining numb. Cost is legible, but the absence of an external test or antagonist keeps this just outside the 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—protecting data that exposes the quarantine lab—signals early and tightens when tailing begins. Escalation is accumulative: each sensory anomaly (siren spikes, temp drops) layers proof until the lateral rooftop path becomes the only safe vector; courtyard stillness offers a micro-breather, not reset. Pigeon release is the visible forfeiture of stealth, a decision with on-page cost. No reversal, but deepening pattern reweights stakes sufficiently for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will she open the vial and survive the memories?—is signaled early; the Nightshade’s bloom acts as a live clock tightening the air with invisible pollen. Escalation is textural: each extinct scent molecule increases emotional density until the sealed grief becomes unbearable; the UV lamp provides the one visible micro-turn that makes the final choice inevitable. Cost is the permanent loss of her aromatic cage; future “broker of light” identity is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—how to feel time’s texture—is signaled early and deepens through the repetition of “pattern” and “layer.” The single tightening occurs when the poet refuses to climb out, preserving the weave; cost is conceptual (foreclosed escape) rather than visceral. Accumulative escalation is coherent but gentle; no new external pressure narrows options after the grotto entry. Meets短篇要求 but stays modest.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake—“fracture the chronic hush”—is declared early but never materializes as a live constraint; silence neither obstructs nor endangers. Pressure is static: each lyrical repetition insists hush is “swallowing” yet nothing is ever jeopardized or forfeited. No narrowing of options occurs; the violinist’s plan works flawlessly, so escalation is pure cadence shift, not causal tightening. Cost is asserted (“weight of the unfinished”) but never paid on page.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can engineered empathy bridge the bureaucrat’s void without collapsing—is signaled early and tightens when the spark confirms potency. Pressure grows texturally: each repetition of “half-truths” and “static” thickens the moral murk rather than forks the plot. The client’s softening jaw is the visible price, but the dealer’s own flicker of longing is the subtler cost that forecloses his immunity. No external reversal is needed; the deepening is the accumulation of borrowed feeling that can never be his.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—giving harbor heroes visible gratitude—tightens through each mini-campaign beat; the single meaningful turn is the ceremony itself that forecloses anonymity for the night watchman; cost is present but diffuse (time/social credit) rather than viscerally individuated, keeping it just below the 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—will Kael ever read the arbor’s map of belonging?—tightens once: the girl’s riddle makes the search communal, foreclosing solitary artistry as sufficient. Pressure escalates through Accumulative pattern: each dawn/dusk cycle, each reed offering, each silence thickens the cost of possible failure. No causal reversals are needed; the deepening frequency and final shared song reweight options with undeniable price. Persistent constraint—his reed effigy must stand publicly—shapes the final tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—“preserve the primordial echo before the final exhalation”—is signaled early and tightens with each Gasp. Agency is crystallized in the single decisive strike that shatters time; the price is her human form. Pressure escalates by Accumulative deepening: snores lengthen, canals reverse, pendant coils colder. No reversal or antagonist is needed; the awakening giant is coherent environmental pressure that forces stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—can ambiguous loss be rendered legible?—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each droplet, crack, and reflection narrows the emotional aperture until the doorway offers the single reconfiguration. No visible resource cost (time, tool, stamina) is dramatized; pressure is atmospheric rather than tactical. Still, the final image makes the conceptual price undeniable, satisfying the 8.0+ threshold for a lyric short.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—Mara’s need to become visible without being seen—tightens when she risks moving the tape from pipe to children’s shelf. One meaningful escalation: the outage closes schools, guaranteeing a child will arrive, forcing her to cache rather than hoard. Cost is legible: every breadcrumb increases exposure should a librarian notice. Under Accumulative lens the pressure is a density shift, not a reversal, sufficient for 600-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: control vs. surrender of growth process. Pressure escalates through tactile resistance: wood splinters, vines curl away, forcing reconsideration. Single deepening—she stops forcing and lets vines self-weave—narrows future options (she can no longer claim authorship of every curve). Cost is legible but generalized (loss of omnipotence); a concrete minor forfeiture (blood from splinter? time lost to re-wrapping?) would sharpen the 8.8+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can she convert private memory into living art without being consumed by nostalgia—tightens when the scavenger offers her own hopeful portrait, forcing a public reckoning. Escalation is accumulative: each tide-stroke adds pressure until the single exchange crystallizes her choice to over-paint. No antagonist needed; the island’s weathered memory acts as coherent pressure. Cost is the brooch’s departure and the portrait’s revision—felt price that alters her future canvases.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: preserve/control the magnification of everyday magic; tightened when the pearl begins to pulse foreign rhythm and surrender becomes the only remaining tactic. Agency is renunciation, not confrontation; cost is the permanent tinting of her clairvoyance. Escalation is accumulative: each new note raises density until surrender is inevitable. No external antagonist; pressure is situational and coherent under chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—compile fragments into meaning—signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when each interval forecloses another possible harbor. Escalation is causal: every sounding narrows the navigator’s untold story until the seventh interval leaves only silence as the irrecoverable remainder. Cost is felt: the navigator weeps, the archivist accepts an endless task. No coincidence; pressure is coherent under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“map or speak”—is signaled in paragraph three and tightened exactly once: when she trades ink for courage and presses the punch, cartographic certainty is foreclosed; the fortress materializes as irreversible consequence. Pressure is coherent under a Causal lens: each luminous arrow is a because that narrows option space from seven years of tunnels down to one rusted door. The price is visible and conceptual—she touches her own calcified confession and the fortress trembles, acknowledging its architect, so the cost of ownership is paid on the page. No secondary reversals are needed at this length; the single escalation carries sufficient weight.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—sculpting reflective space for grief—signals early and tightens when mural images of the fisherman’s wife appear; the possibility of failure (his silence unbroken) shadows each brushstroke. Escalation is textural: each added star-whale layer amplifies communal hush until the unheard symphony becomes audible as peace. Agency is present—Lira could stop painting—but the cost is more conceptual than visceral; no tool breaks, no social ridicule materializes. Still, the single meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“what happens after goodbye”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened by each refracted ending. Escalation is textural: density of possible afters increases until the single irrevocable choice to scatter. Protagonist agency drives the turn; no coincidence resolves tension. Cost is visible (loss of omniscience) but could be sharper on the final beat; hence withheld from 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—survival via forged papers—signals early and tightens when the letterhead proves nonexistent, forcing Sam to pivot to the ledger. Agency remains Sam’s throughout: the breach, the pocketing, the negotiation. One meaningful deepening: the ink pot turns out to contain their own origin story, reframing cost from cash to identity. Price is visible—Sam trades moral purity for asylum math—but the escalation feels slightly compressed in a single beat rather than incrementally layered.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—assert control over vanished time—tightens only once, when the hum’s pattern “almost like a language” raises the possibility of comprehension; yet she makes no bid to decode it, so options do not narrow. Cost is present but diffuse: labor, dawn exposure, pages swelling, all cumulative rather than acute. Under Accumulative lens, the single intensification suffices, but without a visible trade-off or risk the escalation feels gentle, not urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming erased selfhood—signals early and tightens through each layer added to the box. Pattern break at the poison label (“his own handwriting”) escalates abstract threat to personal proof, narrowing options: he can no longer treat fragments as neutral curios. Cost is visible when he places the box in the tide yet it refuses to float, signifying permanent outlaw ballast. Escalation is textural rather than causal, satisfying the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is legible early: decode the riddle before silence wins. Pressure escalates via textural accumulation—each retelling thickens the hum, the shell warms, the compass spins faster. The single meaningful tightening is the moment the shell cracks; that audible fracture forecloses the option of keeping the myth intact. Cost is visible (broken relic, self-ghosting) but not viscerally painful, keeping this just shy of the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes tighten from vague “community must adapt” to the concrete timetable encoded in the clock-mural; one meaningful escalation occurs when rain partially erases the code, forcing faster child-to-child relay. Cost is felt (Mira’s soaked vigil), yet the corporation remains an abstract menace rather than an on-page obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserve the ephemeral bloom’s image—signaled early and tightens once: the flare both records and destroys. Agency is present (she triggers the reaction) but the cost is environmental rather than personal sacrifice; price is felt yet not paid out of her body or future options. Sufficient for this length, but lacks a secondary constraint that would foreclose an alternate tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restore navigation before dawn—signals early and tightens with each horn blast. One meaningful deepening: the hairline fracture is revealed only after refraction test, shifting tactics from tactile to crystalline repair. Cost (lost night, tremor of failure if drone crashes expedition) is legible; agency resides in her micro-choices under mist-lamped pressure. No second reversal, but single escalation satisfies Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—“to find where the rivers begin”—is signaled early and re-weighted when the answer becomes “where they remember they are water,” a deepening rather than reversal. Pressure escalates through pattern accumulation (falcon, feather, condensation, crack) rather than antagonistic opposition; the tightening is lyrical but legible. No visible price is exacted from Kael before the transfiguration, so the escalation feels observational, not personally costly.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake is declared early: prevent final collapse by restoring vibrational balance. Pressure escalates texturally—each remembered gait layers a new note onto the silence; the cobblestones’ millimeter shift is the tightening. No external antagonist is needed; entropy is the opponent, and the fork’s low note is the visible price paid. The ending does not reverse the stakes but crystallizes them: the town now “breathes,” foreclosing Kael’s centuries-long vigil yet committing him to centuries more walking.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—capture the ephemeral core—tightens from red-zone oxygen to cracked helmet; each beat forecloses retreat. Agency is relentless: she overrides the seal protocol, programs the transmitter instead of self-rescue. Cost escalates from breath to life; the quantum core exists only while she pays. One meaningful turn is sufficient; no reversals needed.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—will he manage to silence the paternal echo before discovery—tightens once, at the staircase descent, but the “before they find the bodies” threat stays abstract; no visible resource (time, breath, tool) is forfeited on the page. Agency is present—he speaks faster, seals the door—but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt, keeping escalation just shy of high-band charge.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—can the village renegotiate its broken covenant with the sea—remains abstract; on-page pressure is Elara’s private race to decode her own feet. Escalation is textural: each silver stitch adds density, not risk. No credible loss (time, material, social credit) is dramatized; the orchids appear as gift, not trade-off. Hence the tightening is felt as aesthetic completion rather than foreclosed option—sufficient for accumulative design but thin for causal thresholds.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restoring continuity to interrupted lives—signals early and tightens through each unearthed fragment; the sundial’s completion is the single meaningful deepening that forecloses abandonment and makes the faith-renewal legible. Agency is observational rather than confrontational, fitting the Accumulative lens, yet a visible price (years of exile, dread carried) is named and carried forward. Coincidence (finding the wedge at twilight) complicates rather than resolves. Cost is more conceptual than corporeal, keeping it shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—deliver the letter before tubes seal—tightens from dawn light to carrier departure; the 30-minute clock is literal on page. Escalation is present: each chalk mark shrinks Kael’s anonymity margin, and the final violet galaxy is a decisive micro-turn that locks the code. Cost is visible in Kael’s brushed dust and lighter clipboard—tangible forfeiture of secrecy. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes; missing a mid-scene complication keeps it from 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—prevent the coup—tightens through textile density: each new stitch forecloses the option to remain apolitical. The harvest-moon deadline introduces a living clock; adjacent possibilities narrow from infinite futures to one hidden star. Agency is intellectual (decoding flame-flicker) but still active; cost is social exposure—she abandons the safety of “foolish old woman.” Escalation is textural, not explosive, fitting the accumulative lens; a sharper visible price (e.g., dropped thread, burned finger) would have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—voicing the unspoken apology—signals early and tightens through moonlight deadline (heal expires at sunrise). Escalation is textural: each reiteration of “unsent” adds weight until silence becomes physically unbearable; shard’s glow literalizes mounting pressure. Protagonist’s agency is the decision to read aloud; coincidence absent. Cost is legible: permanent public exposure of private grief to spirits and tide.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single dominant stake—can he graft new meaning onto the wound of abandonment—tightens when each decrypted glyph narrows options from denial to recognition. Escalation is textural: density of smudged layers increases until the final line forecloses escape from mutual loss. Cost is felt in the punctured lung that “binds” him while he unknots. No external antagonist needed; shared anxiety itself supplies coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—Elena’s need to trade certainty for curiosity—tightens when the nickel’s reflected sound literally re-paints the mural, foreclosing her old restoration ethic. The cost is felt: “her own certainty dissolving,” but because the visitor’s question is off-page, the pressure is slightly less visceral than required for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—mental autonomy vs. commodified thought—tightens when quarterly tax quadruples and new gardeners appear. One decisive escalation: auditors cross the threshold; Aris’s only move is to let living chaos blind their tech. Price is concrete: if gourd map fails, arrest is certain. Agency stays horticultural, not heroic, preserving causal credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—fragile peace—signals early via postcard prophecy and tightens each night as new verses are laid, meeting the single-deepening rule under Accumulative lens. Yet escalation is atmospheric, not tactical: no credible obstacle or backlash threatens the armistice; the lone “storm” mention stays hypothetical, so cost stays conceptual rather than felt on-page. The poet’s agency is diffuse—lullabies drift unseen—so the merfolk’s surrender reads as charming fait accompli rather than earned reversal with trade-off. Peace blooms beautifully, but pressure plateaus; without a live risk that forecloses an option, the tightening lacks visceral bite.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve the sound of forgotten names—signals in line 4 and tightens through each orchid illumination. Agency is accumulative: every breath-and-note cycle forecloses the option of perfect restoration, visible in the growing spectral syllables. Cost is legible: the emptied halls and her own cracked heart widen with each echo. No causal reversal, but the cadence shift from “hope” to lingering “foxglove regret” supplies the required deepening under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—preserve vs. profit—is signaled early and tightens when the council’s doubt ripples; Alia’s hybrid design forecloses pure preservation, with visible price in the groaning floodgates and her own tremble of triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserve the echo—tightens when each pigeon flight forfeits paper control; meteorite warmth and dust mapping are visible prices. One meaningful deepening: closing the ledger forecloses retreat to invented pasts. Agency remains Elias’s throughout; coincidence absent.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—thresholds demand reverent distance—is signaled in line 1 and deepened through each grain-line “prayer.” Escalation is textural: each mirrored facet adds weight to the idea that every future step must now be ritual. The single reversal—threshold opens only after the exact count—is micro, not causal, but under the Accumulative lens the density shift suffices. Cost is felt solely as conceptual burden (perpetual vigilance), not tangible loss; this caps the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—why paths vanish—tightens once: answer revealed inside geode, no further narrowing. Agency is observational rather than confrontational; pressure accumulates through luminous density, not antagonistic push. Cost is conceptual (acceptance of cyclical forgetting) rather than tactical loss. The tightening is meaningful under the accumulative lens, but the protagonist’s stance crystallizes without a trade-off that alters later options.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—proving monotony can be hacked—escalates with each successful intervention, tightening until the tool itself warps, signaling the algorithm’s bleed into self. Every reversal is authored by Ezra’s on-page decisions; coincidence only complicates (guard’s arrival pre-planted). Visible price: loss of the bishop/token and irreversible self-instrumentalization. One meaningful deepening suffices and lands.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—illicit memory vs. ban—is lyrical but abstract; escalation arrives as repeated declarations of “cosmic verse” rather than tightening options. Cosmic-skin climax does reweight meaning under accumulative lens, giving a visible conceptual cost, satisfying minimal closure for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—“prove craft is vital”—is declared early but never tested by an external obstacle; pressure is atmospheric, not tactical. No option narrows, no price is levied; escalation is a gentle swell of lyric diction rather than rising cost. The “before everything shifts” refrain signals time pressure yet nothing actually impends, so tension is conceptual. Consequently the meaningful-tightening threshold is met only rhetorically.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—how to carry the irredeemable choice—tightens once: the box’s ash must be released, forcing a public witness that forecloses private erasure. Escalation is textural: each celestial reference raises the cosmic accounting of her bargain, narrowing her option to mere endurance. Agency is renunciation rather than action; the cost is the lifelong weight she accepts in the final stride downslope. No coincidence muddles causality; pressure stays coherent under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single dominant stake—can mathematics transfuse hope to dying timelines?—tightens via gauge oscillation, shell scarcity, and the final impossible midpoint; the price is her exit from intervention, a visible forfeiture that reweights all seventeen realities into self-sustaining lift.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—voice the dreams of stone—tightens when the film strip reveals erased solutions, foreclosing pure remembrance. Escalation is textural: each sonic fossil and diary page accumulates pressure until the chalk formula crystallizes the cost of silence. Agency is renunciation: she leaves the corridor to seed new calculations, paying the price of separation. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals required.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—coaxing mirrors beyond reflection—is signaled early and escalates through chromatic intensification under the Accumulative lens; the final shimmer reweights the stakes successfully. Yet pressure is ambient, not adversarial: no mirror resists, no heartbeat surge endangers the ritual, no clock-cost forces a trade-off. The bells arrive as external cadence, not consequence. Escalation is aesthetic, not tactical; cost is observably conceptual rather than felt, capping entry to the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can ritual words become lived peace?—is signaled early and tightens when the scarred general demands proof; the clipboard hum physically forecloses skepticism, forcing a collective yes. Cost is legible: they must now defend an agreement born of superstition as much as policy. Escalation is single but sufficient for 700-word window.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can a lost song be bought with a stolen river?—tightens once: the map converges, the egg falls, option to undo drought is foreclosed. Escalation is accretive rather than causal-reversal, but the audible cost (thin pure note against vanished villages) makes the trade-off visceral; lacks a second tightening beat that would push into 8.8+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—liberate the city’s silenced voices—tightens through each thread she pulls; the lullaby’s counter-pressure rises as her heart hammers, making the cost visceral. One meaningful deepening: the moment “alarming serenity” flips to open windows; options narrow for the regime, widen for the people.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—honor overlooked histories—tightens when the moth wing (not monarch) appears, forcing Esme to pivot from commemoration to active intervention. Each temporary structure escalates stakes by proving the futility of permanence while increasing her emotional investment. The monarch’s final circling is not coincidence but coherent pressure: the signal she built literally draws it upward, narrowing options to release or withhold the memory. Cost is visceral: she descends in darkness knowing the wing will shred, the tower collapse, and no successor will arrive.</answer>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through image and action: interrupted cadence migrates from ecological fact to personal fate without ever being named aloud. The monarch’s silent departure reprices the entire premise—witness, not preservation, becomes the only victory. Subtext resides in the wing’s frequency “too high for human ears,” implying nature’s archive is now permanently inaccessible to us. Final resonance is anti-moral: no sermon, only the wind completing a song humans will never hear.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“why remain when others fled?”—signals early; pressure tightens as each vine marks another cycle lost. Micro-turn: recursion dream shows her watching herself watching vines, collapsing observer/observed and forcing the climb. Escalation under Accumulative lens: pattern density (vine, fox stamp, moss tea) accretes until meaning shatters; transcendence is chosen, not granted by luck. Cost manifest: the bunker collapses, Archive lost; pathless forest is embraced with no guarantee.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—preserve knowledge across regime change—tightens when new banners appear; each decoded row narrows options to either seize or release the tile. No antagonist needed: pressure is temporal-political erasure. The tenth-night schematic completes the only viable path; refusal to hoard costs him the physical artifact but wins dissemination. Price is on-page: tile gone, papyri left behind, regime already overwriting sky.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can resentment be released without violence—tightens when Mira must risk her own cellular pain to transfer memory. One meaningful deepening: the pin’s re-breakage shows release is cyclical, not final, foreclosing the option of permanent victory. Pressure grows under causal lens; no coincidence required. Cost is legible but could be sharper (a sensory scar or breath lost).

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single stake—recover the dream—tightens through density of mirrored reflections and breath-sync; no external antagonist needed. Escalation is felt as each exhalation crystallizes starlight into glass, narrowing options until merger is the only path. Cost is the loss of separateness, legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—win back orchard and daughter—tightens when she laces the statue’s quartz eye with silver wire, foreclosing retreat. Each beat raises cost: diminishing resin, height risk, squirrel theft, confronting cracked Saint Althea. The ribbon graft is the visible price. Escalation is steady but single-arc; no secondary reversal keeps it shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—curiosity vs prohibition—signaled in paragraph four; pressure tightens when the shell warms and the tree offers fruit that can’t be un-bitten. Escalation is Accumulative: each sensory layer (silver branches, glowing sigil, blue-gold pulse) reweights the cost of knowledge. The final bite forecloses the option to remain merely a curator; the price is the weight of universal grief. No coincidence; the orchard’s response is triggered by Evers’s deliberate memory-carving.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reach the lost botanist—signals early and tightens once: the warden’s decree must be renegotiated or passage dies. Elara’s agency drives every beat: she copies, reads aloud, proposes the new pact, and later whispers the healing phrase. Cost is visible—she risks memory-feeding and permanently surrenders the diary’s song—but the price feels moderate, not irreversible. Still, the single meaningful tightening satisfies the 600-word escalative bar.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes are signaled early—find the garden, rekindle solace—but the only tightening is the door reveal; no option is foreclosed or price paid. Pressure is atmospheric, not causal; escalation is poetic accretion rather than rising cost. The protagonist’s final stance crystallizes but does not trade anything away. Sufficient for lyric mode, yet short of 8-band cost clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restore aborted timeline—signaled at seal discovery. One meaningful tightening: re-weaving the phantom thread physically forecloses the “safe observer” stance; cost = altered institutional memory. Agency is continuous—every archival step narrows options until the braid-merge. Coincidence (door appears) complicates, does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single dominant stake—“find the quiet”—tightens through two acoustic deepenings: first bloom fails, mandala realignment succeeds. Agency remains Lira’s at every beat; price paid is bodily strain and the knowledge storms will return; cost is on-page in shaking hands and dimmed stone.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—prove pattern inside chaos—tightens when the shard’s silence must be positioned at Navigator’s apex; failure would keep the wasteland dark. One meaningful deepening occurs as retrocognitive fragments accumulate into the single second of original flaw; price is the irrevocable exposure of her tower to unknown travelers.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—how to sculpt identity from undifferentiated collective memory—is signaled early. Pressure escalates texturally: the chorus of whispers intensifies, shadow lengths vary, but no single beat forces a trade-off or irreversible choice; the climax is listening into silence. Cost is conceptual (she gives up “solid” identity) rather than tangible, keeping the score below 7.5. Still, the deepening hush reweights options under the Accumulative lens, satisfying minimum escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—shatter the fortress’s hopelessness—is signaled early and tightened once: the mosaic command “Rise” makes the act of ignition unavoidable; refusal would leave the night unchallenged. Escalation is textural: density of floral/airborne imagery accrues until the fire’s helix re-prices the stakes, turning watchers from hidden despair to audible wonder. Cinder’s agency is decisive—she alone spins the flame—but the cost (charred rag, kerosene scent lingering as future burden) is more conceptual than viscerally felt, keeping the pressure vivid yet slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—accepting her brother’s departure—surfaces early; pressure mounts via accreted tidal imagery rather than event. The meaningful tightening is the tide’s quiet surge that lifts pool creatures, cueing Mara’s release; cost is present but low-impact (prospective loss, not irrevocable). No reversal or trade-off narrows options; the conflict remains internal and observational. Sufficient for the lyric mode, yet lacks a visceral price that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake: harvest the unattainable gilded hush. Escalation occurs through density increase—each silence sampled heightens the missing golden note—until altitude-quiet supplies the reweighting. No visible price is paid (no injury, lost tool, social cost); the cost is conceptual, legible but not visceral. External inversion drives climax, not her agency, yet the pattern-break suffices for Accumulative design; tightening is present but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—can the diplomat be taught to bear silence?—is signaled early and tightens when his drumming spikes Kael’s meters. One meaningful deepening: his heartbeat flips from frantic red to calm blue, narrowing his options from flight to acceptance. Cost is visible in Kael giving away the vial, forfeiting her own comfort tool. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens but lacks a second hard trade-off, keeping it just below top band.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: ready the throne before sunrise. Clock is explicit, tightening choices; “three hours until sunrise” is repeated but still bites. Escalation is textural—each mural deepens knowledge rather than narrows external options. Agency is present (descend, place flake, ascend) yet the peak decision is renunciation, not confrontation; cost is conceptual (she midwifes tomorrow, forfeits crown) rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—can she risk reopening a door she burned—is signaled early and tightens when the first scarred hand appears. One meaningful deepening: she shifts from hoarding the ring to placing it on the altar, foreclosing permanent isolation. Cost is visible: each new pupil dilutes her own oxygen, a persistent constraint. Agency is hers; the visitor merely requests, but her decision to teach alters the sanctuary’s atmosphere irrevocably.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—repay community, redeem self—signaled early; pressure crystallizes in single decisive surge. Agency is present: Kael reprograms timer, turns bolt, shoulders risk of owner’s wrath. Cost is visible (illicit act, communal fund) yet feels low because external jeopardy (owner, law, physics) never threatens back; tension is conceptual. Sufficient tightening for 600-word scope but lacks a mid-course option narrowing that would push into 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—sever the lineage vs. remember it—tightens exactly once when the standing wave reveals the expunged heir, flipping his mission. Cost is legible: he forfeits the murder-path and accepts eternal custodianship of a song that will haunt him. Agency is present (he keeps turning the crank), but externalized onto physics; the pressure feels accumulative rather than causally adversarial.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—capture the shape of possibility—is signaled in the inciting whisper and escalates through each unsnapping that swells fruit into universes. One meaningful tightening: the final thread-pull collapses the greenhouse into a doorway, foreclosing retreat; cost is the eternal dissolution of self into puppeteer/puppet duality. Pressure accrues texturally: each re-snapped pattern adds density, harmonic song, cascading light—options narrow to “step through or stay alone forever.” No reversal, but the deepening is sufficient under Accumulative lens; visible price is his bodily dissolution into the infinite dance.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—grant Marcus a fragment of identity—arrives with the button’s discovery. Pressure tightens once when Marianne decides to trace the regiment, forfeiting emotional safety for possible disappointment; the cost is her reopened grief. Escalation is modest yet coherent under the Accumulative lens: each dust layer adds weight to the unknown until the letter reconfigures meaning. Agency stays interior, sufficient for a quiet archival quest.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—uncorrupted memory—signals in paragraph 3 and tightens when the code turns to ash, removing the easy path. Swallowing the crystal is a visible, irreversible price that forecloses retreat. Pressure escalates under causal linkage; drone arrival is complication, not coincidence. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length; cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent the prophecy—tightens once: the first low moan turns colored whispers to stillness, foreclosing the prophecy’s emergence. Agency is atmospheric (endurance of silence) rather than a sharp trade-off, yet the cost is legible in the eerie nostalgia that replaces prophecy with emptiness. No external antagonist, but the prism’s light acts as opposing force, muted by accrued hush.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“decode before the next hush”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when dust forces a new leaf-type that must be read. One meaningful cadence shift: melody-map redirects climb to First Seed, foreclosing the option to wait. Cost is felt—the arbor’s prior silence is overwritten by unasked voices—but price is more conceptual than visceral, keeping score just inside the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—control versus surrender of time—is signaled in line 1. One meaningful tightening: inserting the compass into the master gear narrows her option from “fix everything” to “let imperfection stand.” Cost is visible: she forfeits her identity as flawless mender. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational/internal. Coincidence (12 clocks at 3:14) complicates but does not resolve; it launches inquiry rather than solving it.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can the boy’s name be redeemed rather than the boy—signaled by line 4. Escalation is textural: each spoken zodiac name adds literal mass to coin, tightening the impossible equation “name = weight.” Protagonist agency drives every turn: she chooses to heat, speak, dissolve; no coincidence. Cost is legible: the coin, her only mystical tool, is sacrificed; afterward she “is no longer searching,” foreclosing the path of rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—retrieve the abandoned laughter—tightens when the bass scrape produces the fractured mirror-sound, foreclosing the option to restore innocence. Cost is visible: the tooth is spent, the collector’s own laugh now “misaligned,” a permanent self-reconfiguration. Pressure escalates through because/therefore causality under the Causal lens; no coincidence required.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will she bow to ultraviolet penance or forge her own mercy equation—is signaled in first paragraph and tightens through each UV pulse that threatens to overwrite her data set with guilt. Proprioceptive spikes act as escalating price tags, forcing micro-steadying moves that foreclose retreat. No antagonist on stage, but situational pressure keeps mounting until the final refusal crystallizes stance. Cost is visible: burnt forearm, strap imprint, perpetual vigilance she must now carry.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—recover erased keeper history—is signaled early and deepened when Elias’s map imposes future obligation. Escalation is accumulative: each artifact layers consequence rather than narrows tactical options. Cost is conceptual, not visceral, keeping pressure literary rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserve meaning in a world where reality is negotiable—is signaled in line 1 and tightens when the spiral-circle frost appears, forcing a now-or-never choice to uncork the whisper. Escalation is accumulative: each glass apple that falls upward, each book that bleeds chapters, increases the density of instability until the two libraries shatter into one crystalline instant; the cost is the total loss of the sanctuary Elara served. No coincidence resolves; the rupture is triggered by her deliberate release of the whisper. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, and it lands with visible price—the empty bottle, the tilting floor, the smile that admits unkeepable eternity.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“whose past owns the future?”—tightens when the storm inscription burns Voss’s composure, narrowing options to silent assent or open suppression. Agency is Kael’s: he times the storm, presses the shard, reclaims the archive’s truth; luck complicates but does not resolve. Cost is visible in Voss’s cracked mask and the shard’s continued heaviness in pocket.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—return the stolen dawn or night lasts forever—is signaled early and tightened by the chime-countdown. The protagonist’s agency drives every beat: naming parts, tethering the chip, rejecting the covenant’s bribe. One meaningful reversal occurs when his own doubt-note spawns rust, foreclosing the option of perfectionism; the subsequent litany of true names narrows the path to absolute honesty. Cost is visible: flesh corrodes and is restored, the tower’s pendulum slices the final seconds, and the endless tune replaces silence.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—find where explanations fail—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when compass needle locks east. One meaningful deepening: lagoon memory-stack reveals 1923 team’s deliberate crossing, converting mystery into moral choice. Protagonist agency drives the turn: she pours the scent, then refuses the water. Cost is visible—empty vials, empty pocket, lifelong guardianship.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“Will she locate herself inside the lineage before the storm erases the archway?”—is signaled early and deepens via each layer revealed by lantern light. Escalation is textural: each carved signature under the projected light adds filial weight until refusal to leave becomes the only possible stance. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: she forfeits outsider freedom and accepts custodial guardianship. A tighter physical risk or an explicit limitation (injury, time sprint) would have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“why flowers bloom at night”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens through each postcard failure, then cathedral revelation reweights knowledge rather than external options. Agency is intellectual endurance and aesthetic renunciation: she accepts an answer that demands interior creation, not data. Cost is conceptual (loss of certainty) yet felt on page in breath-caught hush. Escalation is pattern-deepening, not causal reversal; meets Accumulative/Textural standard, but lacks visible resource loss or tactical narrowing, capping short of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. erasure—signaled in diary’s first line. Escalation driven by her debris demonstration inside the zeppelin; that act forecloses denial option for Under-Minister, narrows to negotiation. Retro-cognitive cost (sand in sheets, lost sleep) is visible price. Premeditation reveal intensifies moral stakes without external coincidence. One meaningful tightening sufficient; agency legible.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can memory generate a living future without reopening loss? Pressure tightens as Kael’s mind-holding of the bottle’s shape becomes the literal scaffold that draws settlers. The sealed bottle forecloses the easier path of resurrection, forcing reimagining; cost is his ongoing solitude until others arrive. One micro-turn suffices; escalation is accumulative density, not causal reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—what to do with an accidental prophecy—emerges late yet cleanly at the phonograph hiss; prior tension is atmospheric rather than option-narrowing. One meaningful deepening: the realization that the prophecy is a map, not doom, reweights the wax from threat to archive; this crystallizes stance and forecloses destruction. Cost is conceptual (velvet disquiet forever carried) but not visibly paid in action—no sacrificed relationship, no bodily risk—so pressure feels interior, mid-band. Agency is attention/renunciation: he chooses preservation over erasure, sealing the vault. No external antagonist; coincidence absent. Escalation is textural—hum ripples, leaf-vein mirror—sufficient for Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—reopen the passage before starlight fades—is declared early and tightened when the egg cracks, giving a live clock. Agency is present but abstract: she "scatters" and "places," yet the reversal feels summoned more than wrested. Still, the choice to sustain the vortex forfeits the alternative future of collapse, so a trade-off is legible. Escalation is textural—ice retreating, cap splitting—rather than causal, fitting the lyric lens without deflating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—false alarm versus missed disaster—tightens when the pressure stall appears; the live clock is the curing glue. One meaningful deepening suffices: the hesitation reweights risk and forecloses the siren option. Cost is legible: she stakes her reputation on silence. Agency drives every beat; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—can solitude become generative?—is signaled early; pressure accrues via accumulating stillness rather than causal turns. No explicit tightening beat narrows live options; the shift from isolation to sanctuary is gentle pattern-break, not trade-off. Cost is retrospective (“years later”) rather than on-page tactics. Sufficient for accumulative arc, but lacks visceral price at the pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure accumulates through pattern intensification: each mention of “unspoken words” adds weight until the hollow-hive realization breaks the pattern and forces restoration. The visible price is the recognition that the bees—and thus the soul-carrier—are gone; this deepens the stake but is still conceptual rather than viscerally felt. Agency is present—she lifts the box, places it on the altar—but the tactical cost (sweat, thirst, physical risk) remains off-page. Sufficient for a meaningful tightening, but not the full 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: comprehend and survive outside ledger-time. Escalation via deepening: each capsule handled thickens the texture of Recalibrated reality, narrowing options to non-numerical perception. Protagonist agency resides in renouncing the message-planting tactic—felt cost is the surrender of her lone “forward gear.” No coincidence; no external antagonist required.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake: can the poet transmute fragmentation into wholeness through words? Pressure escalates only by accretion of images, not by narrowing options. The snapped kite string supplies a single tightening micro-turn; afterwards the poem continues unchanged. Cost is aesthetic, not visceral—no time, social credit, or physical risk is hazarded.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—complete the circuit before death—tightens with each spool finished; time is literally wrapped into the architecture. No reversals needed; the deepening comes from orchard answering back (warmth, leaf-whisper) raising the cost of failure. Protagonist agency is absolute: he decides pace, method, and bilingual weave with vines. Final clamp forecloses life-as-body, opening life-as-network—cost paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—decode the alien return—remains coherent; pressure deepens when readings reveal memory-binding polymer. Escalation is accumulative: each footprint layer and chemical trace thickens the same mystery rather than narrows live options. No external antagonist or resource loss; the tightening is intellectual, not tactical. Cost is conceptual (paradigm shift) rather than viscerally felt on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reclaim battlefield with garden—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens when the grey earth first refuses seed. The mid-story reversal: gull-map reveals hidden moisture, turning impossible ground into conditional possibility. Persistent constraint: each pod spent is one memory gone; each chant taxes the voice that must return tomorrow. Cost is legible in cracked pods, raw throat, and the nightly repetition that forecloses other life.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“translate distance into closeness”—tightens once, at hatch riddle answer; cost is emotional, not tactical. Agency is present: Wick walks, trades, decides to open vault. No secondary reversal, but single meaningful deepening fits 600-word scale. Persistent constraint (silence) shapes final tactic—curling up to listen—so cost legible.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are simple but sharp: stay = fossilized echo, leave = uncharted black. One meaningful tightening—the unexplained glimmer at Andromeda’s edge—flips confusion into urgent choice under the Accumulative lens. The price paid is the station’s certainty, abandoned; cost is visible in the silhouette fade. No off-stage rescue or coincidence; escalation is internal but sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—“amend the spire before the sky tears”—is declared early but never tightens: no ticking clock, no bodily risk, no resource depletion. Escalation is decorative (groaning ice, harmonic chord) rather than option-narrowing; Kaelen’s path stays straight. The single reversal—hidden door opens—rewards compliance, not choice. Cost is displaced onto the world (sky heals) rather than paid by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—restore erased memory—signaled in the first sentence. Pressure tightens once: the ‘m’ step triggers the groan, narrowing option from search to rescue. Cost is visible: Kael forfeits mobility (stays, turns gallery into archive) and accepts guardianship of trauma. Agency is sustained; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“understand the shape of home”—is signaled early and tightens once: the stone’s activation permanently fuses home to living pattern, foreclosing nostalgia for a static place. Escalation is textural: each breath of corridor and silver spill increases density until the thunder breaks. Visible price is the stone’s loss and the feather’s irreversible etching. Agency is renunciation/creation rather than confrontation; coincidence never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—redemption through teaching—signals early; pressure escalates via each decoded thread that forecloses wrong moves and sharpens the cost of repeating past error. The tightening beat is the discovery of the verse that demands a king’s sacrifice; the tutor’s choice to keep teaching after unlocking time embodies the visible price. Escalation is coherent under causal lens, but the village populace remains off-stage; external pressure is largely symbolic, so the felt price is more internal than relational. Still, agency stays with the tutor and the cost is legible on the final page.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—the ritual’s demand for a life—tightens through Kael’s escalating prism campaign. Agency is his: each poem plants questions; the glass strike forces the Elders to abort the sacrifice. Cost is felt on-page: the canyon “exhaled possibilities instead of penance,” and Kael is implicitly an outlaw now. One meaningful deepening suffices; no coincidence resolves the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transmute oblivion into meaning via memory-quilting—is signaled in first paragraph and tightened by each crater match. Escalation is breath-by-breath; every click subtracts one possible inhale. The sea’s hiss complicates but never rescues; agency stays with Elara. Cost is felt on-page: lungs burn, charm crumbles, atmosphere exchanger fails—options foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—completing the painted shell to free himself from memory—tightens once inside the oasis when the act of painting becomes irreversible. Agency is renunciation rather than external battle; the cost is the shell itself, left behind. No false escalation; the wrong turn complicates but does not cheaply resolve. The pressure deepens through cadence shift rather than new reversals, sufficient for this length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can silence speak louder than shouting?—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened once: the lens-cork experiment forecloses Elara’s earlier passive endurance, risking final refusal from Marcus. Cost is legible: she hazards permanent relational fracture if her “whisper” fails. Escalation is incremental under Accumulative lens: heat retreats → cork memory → lens filter → shared vibration → wordless touch. No coincidence; pressure grows through her single decisive gambit.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reverse-migrate the lost before full moon—tightens with each waxing night; censer weight is visible countdown. One meaningful escalation: seventh-night “Now” forces activation, narrowing options to now-or-never. Cost legible in station shudder and bronze dimming. Agency resides in Kael’s soldering decisions; coincidence complicates (hydraulic failure) but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—protect villagers from patrols while nurturing psychological safety—tightens when the eye forces public disclosure. Mid-story reversal: the feared truth-telling does not destroy but begins healing, reweighting risk. Cost is legible: the protagonist loses the comfort of absolute secrecy and gains the burden of metering every future utterance. Escalation would feel sharper if the patrols ever appeared on-page to raise external jeopardy beyond the internal curse.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—will the stranger be witnessed?—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens once when gaps-reading redefines the gesture. Escalation is textural: alpine scent → spinning compass → silence after horn compresses desperation into keeper’s stance. No causal reversals, but under Accumulative lens the densifying images foreclose the option of forgetting. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; visible price would have lifted band higher.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will she surrender her name to stop the curse?—is signaled at “some mysteries were sealed.” Escalation is accumulative: each vertical foot trades warmth for identity, until the grotto’s heat liquefies the last option. The tightening is visible—“her memories were already fading” —but the price is more conceptual than visceral, keeping it shy of the 8.8 band where bodily cost would be felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—“capture the density of presence”—is declared early and reiterated, but the tightening is abstract: options don’t narrow; instead, the air literally thickens. The single turning beat (mixing indigo) is reversible—nothing forecloses retreat. Cost is present in the sealing wax yet feels symbolic rather than tactical. Pressure accumulates texturally, but the absence of a trade-off keeps the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—distill chaos into narrative—tightens when jealousy of past selves forces the mid-air writing; that act narrows options from passive recording to active self-dissolution. Cost is the sap-blood ink and the loss of singular chronology. One meaningful deepening suffices; no false escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—recovering meaning without smell—tightens once when Marcus reframes the clock as “translator,” forcing Elena to drop restoration and accept translation; the cost is the irreversible loss of scent as compass, made legible in her decision to wear the screw.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—turn scars into stories—signalled in third paragraph and escalates via ink’s refusal to flow cleanly; each crystallising shard is a visceral price that narrows options. No antagonist needed: pressure is material and emotional. Agency is renunciatory—she pays with tear, releases memories, forecloses old identity. Cost is legible on page (tear-ink fusion glow). Lacks a second tightening beat, so stays just below 8.8+ threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single dominant stake—deliver apology before trees fall—tightens exactly once when the first chainsaw coughs, turning abstract regret into last-chance urgency. The perfume release is the visible price that forecloses retreat; after the mist, both must face the exposed memory. No reversal is needed; the escalation is the deepening of silence into sound, orchard into stump. Cost is legible: the scent cannot be rebottled, and the friendship can now only exist in the open.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will she unify fragments or surrender?—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens once: the whispered judgment “cannot be held” forces relinquishment, narrowing options from action to acceptance. Cost is felt on-page as the dictionary fuses with her bones, a visceral price. Accumulative pressure intensifies via recursive imagery rather than external antagonism, coherent under the lyric lens. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the final rotation comes from her stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—understand what clocks truly measure—is signaled in paragraph four and escalates via each backward count that severs past/future. Agency is intellectual: the key-turning ritual is the active pressure that forecloses linear time. Cost is legible: the water level drops, the key glows, and the final silence is heavier—options reweighted. One beat of coincidence (key fits perfectly) is allowed under lens; it complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will Kael keep sealing memory out or let it in—tightens once: deactivating the matrix forecloses the old security paradigm. Escalation is textural: each nightly “breach” adds density until the photo-placement reveals the stakes were never theft but transmission. Cost is paid on-page: Kael accepts perpetual emotional porosity—“they would never again hear an alarm without wondering what memory was trying to get through.” Agency is renunciation rather than conquest, perfectly scaled to lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: reconcile randomness with certainty. Escalation is textural—each new scrawl thickens the pattern rather than flipping the plot—but the deepening reweights cost: the final deck proves her father’s life was already a textbook in loss. One meaningful tightening: the map points to a room that was always there, foreclosing the option to dismiss superstition as noise.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—can a woman who survives by detachment learn to attach—tightens through nightly wrong-number pleas that incrementally fray her detachment. One meaningful deepening: the calls shift from anonymous comfort to personal revelation (her own estrangement story) which then forces the disc-destroying choice. Cost is visible (bleeding palms, silent phone, broken loop) but not persistent; we don’t see how the loss of the booth’s shelter will complicate her next night. Sufficient for this length, yet short of the 8.8 band that would require a sharper tactical trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve small moments—signaled early. Escalation is density-based: each object (scroll, locket, ink) layers memory-weight until the jetty becomes threshold. No visible price (no torn sleeve, no dropped key) keeps it below 7.0; cost is atmospheric. Agency is present—she writes—but the tightening is lyric, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“cure for loneliness” —is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens when each resident must pay a memory to feed the rock’s glow. One meaningful deepening suffices: the communal confession of warm memories narrows Mira’s options—she can no longer keep the fragment. Cost is visible: she forfeits her talisman and her anonymity. Agency is collective rather than solo, fitting the accumulative design; pressure coheres without need for external antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—locate a mappable geography of grief—tightens when the forest’s silence cancels every frequency, foreclosing retreat; the price is absorbing the unsaid bedside words. One meaningful deepening: the ring needle spins inward, renaming the quest from cartography to autobiography. Agency remains hers; coincidence complicates (constellation hinge) but does not resolve. Cost is visible: the ring’s stillness = path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can Kael rectify his past without erasing too much present—escalates as each edit consumes finite timeline-residue, narrowing options to the final choice: stop while cracks remain. Agency sits with every stroke; coincidence absent. Cost is visible on-page: disappearance of moss-thread, softening reflection, and the exhausted pen. Tightening forces a trade-off between perfection and preservation; final renunciation forecloses further revision. Sufficient for 8.8 band; persistent constraint present, though secondary loss (colleague paths) could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“disrupt the forgetting that holds him”—is signaled in line 3 and escalates through micro-turns: camera redirected toward moon, hands signing first clumsy glyph, shutter repurposed as metronome. Pressure tightens once but meaningfully: silence shifts from emptiness to medium, foreclosing reunion with living memory. Agency is Elias’s decision to keep composing for silence; price is eternal exile. Sufficient for this length, though only one tightening beat prevents 8.8+ entry.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restore what they once burned—tightens when each mural both atones and risks discovery; the Fibonacci progression mechanically forecloses shortcuts. Escalation is causal: every new chamber portrait ups the ante by revealing another persecuted lineage, narrowing Kael’s options to either finish or abandon the trail. Cost is visible: weeks of bodily labor, scarce ochre mined by hand, and the final weeping self-portrait that advertises guilt to any future Revisionist. Pressure plateaus slightly mid-story when the murals risk becoming a repetitive sequence rather than a ratchet.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will Kael and Mira merge as a living pattern?—tightens through each drumming beat that strips options: disable cuff, drone approaching, bleeding palms. Escalation is textural: interference patterns shift from noise toward harmony, foreclosing return to human form. Cost is visible in torn skin and the AI’s alarm, but agency is slightly diffuse; the lagoon itself completes the act.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—prove whisper > shout—tightens when the storm grants one-shot acoustic power; failure costs the northern corridor forever. Escalation is causal: storm intensifies → coin vibrates → key strikes → message reaches edge → smuggler caught. Price is legible: Marek forfeits anonymity ("only Marek knew the truth") and accepts lifelong guardian duty. Could edge higher if a personal tangible loss (tool broken, map torn) had been dramatized on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=3.6)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake of quiet civic awakening tightens when the first synchronized window puzzles go live; this Cadence Shift raises social cost without violence; legible, though escalation is incremental rather than perilous.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—freedom to dance vs. dock-duty—tightens when the whale-call converts the scrimshaw into a key that literally unlocks the guardian’s heart, eliminating violent opposition. One meaningful deepening: combative tenderness disarms the guardian without weapon, narrowing options to dance or die, then dissolving threat into mist. Price legible: she loses the island sanctuary yet gains the horizon—an open-ended cost. Agency remains hers at every pivot; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—lightness inside mandated blankness—tightens through pattern break: nightly whittling/narration accumulates until the dog intrusion tests whether complicity will expand; the refusal to change tactics (reporting the dog tomorrow) forecloses mercy and makes the cost legible. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—dissolve boundaries between self/world—signals early and escalates via sensory saturation rather than external opposition. Single meaningful tightening: palm-flat-on-quartz beat dissolves skin/stone border, reweighting her stance. Cost is perceptual, not actionable; no live option is foreclosed, so pressure stays lyrical rather than tactical. Sufficient for 600-word lyric mode, but lacks a visible price that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“find beauty in imperfection”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened when Elara barters awakening for fire. One meaningful escalation: the plant harmonic demo that forces Dorian’s stance shift; no second reversal, acceptable at this length. Cost is conceptual (shared embrace of flaw) rather than visceral, keeping score sub-8.8. Pressure stays coherent under accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—the 0.3 % “missing” texture—signals early and tightens when Kaelen introduces the deliberate flaw, foreclosing the option of perfect data. Cost is visible: she knowingly records “corrupted” files, forfeiting institutional acceptance. Pressure escalates because/therefore under Causal lens: each harmonic layer revealed demands the next manipulative tilt. Mara’s youth-certainty supplies external pressure, but the true antagonist is the epistemic system that privileges 99.7 % accuracy; the protagonist’s agency directly confronts that rule-set.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: can manufactured consolation become genuine communion? Pressure escalates by each origami swallowed by void—each loss tightens the gamble that Mnemosyne will reciprocate. Final bloom is memory, not reignition: the stake’s cost is the acceptance of decay-as-beauty. No reversal, but deepening achieves sufficient tension under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can culture be reverse-engineered after currency failure—tightens when the architect begs “Show me how to build again,” foreclosing his old decentralized dogma. Agency: Mara’s decision to rotate the spread multiplies paths, visibly charging the grid with social cost—he must now navigate a web, not a chain. No coincidence; pressure coheres under causal lens. Price is legible: his hubris reflected in obsidian mirror, suit now empty symbol.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—hope’s decay vs. preservation—is signaled early and tightens once: shadow’s bold reach forces her to risk the stone. Agency is attention-and-act: comparing footage, then pressing stone into image. Cost is legible—stone gone, weight of regret assumed. No external antagonist needed; shadow’s feeding on hope supplies coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—can she still claim the right to care after abetting harm—tightens when each brochure burn removes the option to keep hiding behind paperwork. Escalation is accumulative: each healed animal subtracts a reason to flee and adds a reason to stay and face charges. No external reversals, but one internal micro-turn at the tail-tip salve beats the rhythm. Cost is felt: public shame, legal jeopardy, and the irreversible scar on Veridian’s tail.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“learn to read scars”—is signaled early; pressure deepens texturally as each object offers legibility. No narrowing of external options; tension is epistemic, not jeopardy-based. Single meaningful intensification occurs when glowing peblet makes scars shimmer into text; cost is conceptual rather than tactical. Sufficient for length under Accumulative lens but lacks visceral price that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—recover unseen love before demolition—signalled on page 1. One meaningful tightening: the film dissolves into silver dust that maps storage nodes, foreclosing passive observation and forcing her to accept bodily tenancy. Escalation is textural: density of unspoken letters accumulates until it reweights her biological frame. Cost is legible—she weeps, walks silent, “charged, complete”—but price is metaphysical rather than tangible loss, keeping it just shy of 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—break creative silence—signaled early; pressure intensifies via accretion of celestial images rather than narrowing options. No concrete trade-off or visible price is dramatized on page; the silence simply lifts after she lies down. Escalation is aesthetic, not tactical, sufficient for lyric arc but below high-band cost requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: preserve possibility against null-zone forgetting. Pressure escalates via accumulative lyric density: off-key dunes, black spot eating timelines, sparks dying. One decisive tightening—planting archive in never-burn corner—forecloses guard’s continued existence, cost paid on page. Coincidence is absent; erosion of options is felt through image-cascade rather than causal reversals, fitting the lyric lens.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—map the frontier inside her mind—tightens when gear self-rotates and forest dissolves into pattern; option to remain passive is foreclosed. Escalation is accretive: each biome adds a syntactic “truth” that compresses until identity fuses with forest. Cost is conceptual but legible: she forfeits separateness, “part of the equation.” No visible price alters later tactics, keeping it shy of top band.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.5)
    Pressure tightens once: from snapped leash to solitary traverse to lantern offer; the ferry guides’ “cross only when ready” crystallizes stance. No second reversal, but the single deepening is sufficient; cost, however, remains ambient rather than paid in flesh or future.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will she stay silent again?—is signaled by stair-discoloration echo of the original crime. One meaningful tightening: the thumbprint-sized rust spot forces an immediate now-or-never choice. Agency is pure: she could walk past (as before) but chooses descent to precentor. Cost is visible—she forfeits choir membership forever, accepting perpetual outsider vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—unmask pretender—signaled in paragraph four; pressure tightens once when riddle-read becomes irreversible glamour fray. Agency sits with Sylvar via inscription; Vael’s finger-trace is the visible tightening that narrows options to exposure. Cost legible: ink spent, library falls, pretender revealed. Missing a second beat of escalating risk or resource loss keeps it below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—why routes vanish—is signalled by the torn page and escalates through data fragments; one meaningful tightening suffices. Pressure is textural: each bleaching ghost and gauge tick raises the waterline of dread. Agency is observational—she assembles, records, charts—but the final image forecloses passive hope: she must draw new lines herself. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; the lane’s erasure is felt, yet no tool or chance is lost on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—protect amber vs. germinate new future—is signaled early and tightens when the script offers a forbidden method. The single decisive escalation occurs at the vent: submersion risks exile and physical burn, foreclosing the wait-and-pray path. Cost is legible in the blistering water and the grandson’s widened eyes; no reversal is needed—the tightening is sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: convert raw grief into sustainable vigilance without denial. Escalation is textural—each return visit layers nacre around grit; tightening occurs when he realizes “freeze” must include the drone shadow, not exclude it. Agency visible in the final freeze: he chooses to hold both memory and wound, foreclosing infinite photo fondling. Cost is felt: perpetual labor of return (“he would be that keeper”). Coincidence absent; no antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single dominant stake—can she endure the necessary darkness to paint again—tightens when each untangled thread deletes a possible life. Agency is continuous: she decides to touch, to untangle, to weave; no coincidence intervenes. Escalation is textural: the hum under her nails grows louder, the walls press closer, the ink of time pools in her palms. Cost is visible—“her fingertips thrummed with new memory”—and forecloses the path of luminous surfaces.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—why time slows in loss—is signaled in the first paragraph and re-tightened when the drone vanishes. Agency is continuous: Kael chooses to spill the ink, to watch, to reach into the distortion, to vow repetition. The cost is the drone itself, a tangible forfeiture that alters tactics. Under the causal lens this is sufficient; no further reversals are required at 725 words.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—truth vs oath—signaled in first 100 words; escalation is one decisive tightening: hide vs broadcast. The manual pump action narrows options irreversibly; cost is viscerally externalized in the cascading resignations above. Coincidence absent; pressure coherent under causal lens. Could edge higher if a visible personal price (badge forfeiture, frostbite, solitary cell) had been dramatized on-page rather than implied.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—preserve peace inside the dome—tightens twice: stranger intrusion and storm. Both escalate through sensory density, not external reversals. Agency is caretaking endurance; price is vigilance fatigue, but the lack of a live trade-off keeps tension lyrical rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—catch vs. release the goddess’s echo—is signaled early and tightens when the spike’s heat forces the choice to withdraw. Escalation is textural: density of transliterated grief, color, and vibration increases until the refusal costs Avery her divine contact. Visible price—she carries residual grief home—satisfies the band guardrail.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—paper’s credibility versus public health—tightens when Victoria realises silence once birthed three more spills. The reversal is her refusal to sign the kill memo; the cost is filial betrayal carved into the desk. Under the causal lens, each red-ink absence escalates the moral arithmetic until intervention becomes the only internally consistent act. The pressure curve is one smooth ascent, sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—hushing the accusatory firmware that grieves for marked infants—is signaled in para 1; pressure escalates acoustically: feedback loops → ghost projections → star-sound unravelling. One meaningful tightening: feeding corrected paper into the antique slot narrows options to irreversible erasure. Cost is audible—constellations tear, ghost-babies fade, amber goes silent—felt on page. Agency is hers; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—will the village remember its trauma rightly—is signaled early and tightened when the tile commands “Complete the circle, but break it at the seventh turn.” The artist’s agency is decisive: she interjects the violet slash that forecloses the perfect circle and releases the voices. Cost is conceptual but legible: the grotto will remember while the village forgets again. One meaningful intensification suffices under Accumulative lens; no reversal is required.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—how to remember without being consumed by frost—signals early. Pressure escalates through retrocognitive intrusions that narrow Arin’s options to act *now* before the city erases the name. The carving is the decisive, irreversible act that costs bodily warmth and social erasure. Cost is legible but not persistent; no future consequence is dramatized, capping entry to 8.0 band.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“one more ovation”—is signaled in line 2; pressure escalates via density of echo-colors that narrow the ghost’s options to transfer rather than receive. The actress’s despair provides externalized stakes; the ghost’s agency (coin flip) pays the visible price of self-extinction. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length; no reversals needed. Cost is felt: “the garden folded back… its secret safe” implies perpetual erasure of the ghost’s identity.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single dominant stake: translate the world’s silence into a map humans can feel. Pressure escalates by accretion—each heat pulse, each grief vein, narrows her option to merely record vs. fully merge. The fossil’s hologram is the decisive tightening that forces the sung translation; cost is the irrevocable loss of solitary autonomy now bound to the fossil’s chorus.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—return from the cold or permanent burial—signalled in first paragraph. Single tightening: courier demands proof, Kael must dig, no fallback. Cost is visceral: frozen fingers, five lost years, risk of summary execution. Escalation is modest but sufficient for 700 words; stakes stay personal and sharp rather than abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—will the palimpsest promise distill or remain overwritten—arrives early and tightens through the gutters’ deliberate deceleration; agency is renunciation/attention rather than external action. One meaningful deepening occurs when the approaching hooves slow the drip cadence, foreclosing the option to keep waiting. Cost is conceptual but legible: the 37-year investment collapses into a single point of contact between steel needles. Escalation is accumulative, not causal, and minor slack appears because the woman’s arrival is externally driven; still, the slowing gutters keep pressure coherent under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—why some places resist entropy—signposts early and tightens once: the lantern-glass vision turns abstract curiosity into tactile obligation to reciprocate. The price is visible: she relinquishes the glass that made the discovery possible, foreclosing future visions. No secondary reversals are needed at 700 words; a single meaningful deepening is sufficient, but the beat could sharpen still further if the relinquishing cost were felt as psychic loss rather than serene gift.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—translate private grief into public light—tightens when the rose dies and the only path is outward to the harbor lot. One meaningful deepening: the gauge shifts from key-master’s tool to soil scalpel, narrowing options (she can’t re-lock the past). No antagonist is needed; pressure is situational and accumulative. Cost is visible: the gauge abandoned in dirt and the vertical garden relinquished.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—will she remain isolated observer or become living archive—is signaled early and tightens through density increases (each spectral encounter layers mnemonic data into her body). One meaningful deepening occurs when the sundial projects ghosts into “tangible forms,” narrowing options: she must bear their chorus inside her. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, adequate for length but not scalding.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—move from hidden to seen—remains abstract; no moment forces Lira to risk a specific relationship or client. Escalation is atmospheric (more offerings, more shimmer) rather than a narrowing of options; the “cost” is poetic but not tactical, so pressure plateaus mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent alien-induced civil collapse—tightens when the dean threatens funding and Chen poaches her data, forcing Mara to gamble the transmitter. The one meaningful escalation is the 2:47 AM pulse; every beat after narrows to “now or never.” Cost is unmistakable: she may “fry the transmission tower” and draw censure—this risk is reiterated and then enacted, leaving the station damaged. Agency is hers alone; coincidence complicates (pulse timing) but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—retrieve the key—tightens once: the compass must pierce stone at the exact sonic peak, foreclosing retreat. Pressure is situational but coherent: walls literally breathe malevolence, forcing her stance crystallization. Cost is visceral: panic spike, organ silence, and the realization that treasure is responsibility. No off-stage rescue; the reversal is her hand turning the key. Sufficient for this length, though a second tightening would lift it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reawaken empathy or remain armored—is signaled in paragraph four and tested when she touches the ribbon. One meaningful tightening: accurate but hollow portrait → desperate re-painting that names Catherine; this narrows her future from detached contractor to grieving witness. Cost is visible—she must now feel every case she takes. No coincidence resolves; the height discrepancy is earned by her prior methodical measurements.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—prove Vance’s truth before the station buries it again—tightens exactly once: overriding protocols locks her into irreversible insubordination. Cost is felt immediately (alarms, director’s threat) and conceptually (history’s erasure now hers to shoulder). No secondary reversals are needed at this length; one decisive narrowing suffices. The calm eye’s appearance is earned, not coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—transform ghost-silence into living song—signaled early; pressure tightens when scaffold wind spells a real location, forcing trek & dig. One meaningful escalation under Accumulative lens: each artifact (glass, wrap, tin) ups density, narrows option to retreat. Protagonist agency: decodes, walks, opens, plays—cost sweat & tremor visible. No coincidence resolves; final song is renunciation, not victory, satisfying Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is whether the past will be reborn; pressure tightens when each new symbol removes Leo’s option to recruit the son. Agency is the son’s refusal to speak aloud—an active, visible tactic that costs him the comfort of fraternity. The escalation is one continuous tightening under Causal lens; no reversals needed. Cost is unmistakable when Leo pockets the bill and the caboose falls silent, but because the symbol trail is pre-explained in a reflective block, the felt price is fractionally blunted.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: decode or remain complicit in buried grief. One meaningful tightening at 3:47 AM—she types the confession, foreclosing solitary ownership. Cost is the restored bloom itself: she relinquishes private triumph to communal archive. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no reversal, but the cadence shift from star-pulse to shared sentence is sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—unlock his own confession—signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the ice cracks reveal his reflection. Agency drives escalation: he chooses the flesh-seed after fire fails, narrowing options and raising bodily risk. Visible price: plant wilts, guilt exposed, vortex calms—cost is on-page. Slight reserve: external antagonist (curse) is abstract, so pressure is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“find the intersection of dreams before next dawn”—is signaled early and tightens when ancestral root-network forces her to occupy that intersection herself. One visible price: lifeline scar re-inscribed by silver tendrils, foreclosing retreat. Escalation is causal: each scar-touch narrows option space until only embodiment remains. Slight deduction for abstract phrasing of “dream intersection” that never crystallizes into concrete peril beyond metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering self-worth after public humiliation—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the cloth forces a choice between nostalgia and detachment, but the escalation is a single micro-turn without an on-page price paid beyond the symbolic pin; barely misses the 7.0 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“city falls within the week”—is signaled early and tightened by each carved sign that redirects the magnetic field. One meaningful reversal: understanding transition as field, not moment, forecloses her dream of capturing an instant. Cost is visible: she forfeits the fruit and her role as author, accepting witness-hood.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.3)
    Single dominant stake: whether to seal or liberate the buried hopes. Escalation is a single deepening—each confession spoken intensifies the pearl’s glow, narrowing her options until demolition becomes unconscionable. Agency sits entirely with her; no external antagonist, no lucky rescue. Visible price: she breaches inspection protocol, forfeiting career and inviting potential legal consequence—cost named on-page (“protocol demanded she report… Instead, she did something inspectors were never trained to do”). The tightening satisfies the 600-word scale: one pressure arc, one irreversible choice.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness for the bridge-night—is signaled early; pressure intensifies atmospherically via sensory overload rather than narrowing options. No concrete trade-off is dramatized; graffiti advice arrives as coincidence, not earned reversal. Cost is conceptual (she lets the bellows stand as “silent testament”) but not viscerally felt on the page. Thus escalation remains evocative, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—access versus relinquishment of silence—signals early and tightens once: second letter forces the choice to release rather than consume. Escalation is accretive, not causal: each spiral tick and reversed stair deepens the pattern until release feels inevitable. Cost is conceptual (she surrenders the very knowledge she sought) but not viscerally felt on the page. Agency is present yet abstract—"she opened the book and let its silence flow." Sufficient tightening for this length, but lacks a tangible price (time, body, tool loss) that would push pressure into the 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—seed autonomy vs empire commodification—is signaled early and tightens when the envoy knocks. The perforated-destiny metaphor repeatedly narrows options (torn veil, fractured reflection). Escalation is textural: density of plant whispers and coffee stains increases until Lira’s renunciation severs the empire path. Cost is present—lost funding, hollow violin—but conveyed more conceptually than somatically, keeping it from 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.8)
    One dominant stake—snatch the final spark before oblivion—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened by the droplet’s fall; options narrow to perfect facet alignment or total loss. Pressure is textural, built from auroral countdown and thread fray, not external antagonist. Visible cost is the poet’s name erased, but Elara’s own jeopardy remains conceptual; a personal stake (a cracked prior chip, e.g.) would sharpen the upper band. Agency is attention-based renunciation—credible under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: release souls without trapping them in regret. One meaningful tightening: Mrs. Chen’s blackened cluster forces Elara to choose witness over intervention, foreclosing the “fixer” path. Agency is attention and sigil-drawing; cost is the forever-loss of wine’s immortal promise. Escalation is accumulative—each harvest deepens the pattern until the jam choice crystallizes the new rule.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—trading black-and-white judgment for nuance—is signalled early and deepened through each chime clash and spectrum flare. Escalation is textural: density of colour and wind increases until the void fills with possibility, foreclosing absolute answers. Agency is present but mild: unhooking lantern and cloak are symbolic, not tactical trade-offs with visible price. The tightening is felt more as atmospheric charge than option-narrowing; a sharper cost (lost client fee, broken shard) would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“teach vanishing to appear”—tightens when Mira realizes she herself is the final lesson. One meaningful deepening: the shift from observing ripples to becoming the stone that creates them narrows her options to absolute surrender. Cost is repeatedly embodied: lost memories, translucent flesh, final dissolution. Agency remains hers; no outside coincidence rescues or betrays her.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—stillness versus navigation—tightens when birds form the waited-for spiral, but the escalation is observational rather than interactive; she remains safe, merely decoding. Cost is conceptual (redefinition of travel) rather than visceral, keeping pressure cerebral and stakes abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake = preservation of unpredictability vs industrial extraction. Escalation is situational pressure: each paragraph intensifies the cold clarity that the Refactory will erase the last wild trace. The single meaningful tightening occurs when Vorrin realizes there are no sigils to unstrap—his only remaining option is refusal. Cost is visible: eternal exile in frost.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—complete synesthetic palette—tightens once: missing tone revealed as silence itself, foreclosing further search. No antagonist needed; pressure is epistemic and atmospheric. Visible price: submersion risk, lung burn, social isolation. Agency lies in choosing descent and accepting luminous vow.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—honor the frequency of extinct realities—signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened when static forms the command “Align yourself.” One meaningful deepening: shift from “what will be?” to “what must have been forgotten?” narrows options under Accumulative lens. Cost is legible in eternal stellar doubt she must carry. No reversal, but single stance crystallization satisfies short-form pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—naming fears for others while remaining unnamed—tightens when the final blank beast refuses label and becomes her own reflection. One meaningful deepening occurs: the realization that some fears inhabit the space between souls, not inside them. Cost is legible as she pockets the mirror, accepting eternal unnamed dread.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore the sea’s voice—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is drip-by-drip: each adjusted interval tightens the bell’s resonance, foreclosing failure. Final strike costs all residual magic, a visible price. Pressure is coherent under Causal lens; no reversal, but the meaningful tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—truth versus drowned lie—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens once: official report vs. poison memory. No reversals needed; one deepening suffices. Agency is active: gather evidence, light lantern, write revision—these tactics narrow her future silence and expose valley to collective reckoning. Cost legible: she accepts burden of disclosure, loses the comfort of official innocence—felt on page.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—harmonize logic/intuition or dissolve—signals early and tightens through each starling pattern; 48-hour clock stays background, not active lever. Escalation is accumulative: image-density and mythic stakes intensify rather than causal reversals. One meaningful deepening—she stops calculating, witnesses—forecloses old method with conceptual cost. Luck absent; pressure coherent under lyric lens.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single stake—tether integrity—signaled early; pressure is steady, not escalating: no new data, time squeeze, or personal risk introduced after the call. Agency present (manual override) but choice is technically smooth, consequence external (city saved) rather than personal cost. No reversal or trade-off; tension rests on atmospheric repetition rather than narrowing options. Closure hum offers reassurance, not irreversible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—custody of singular consciousness—is signaled in line 4. One meaningful tightening: vivify circuit merges emptiness with preserved emotion, foreclosing the option to remain hollow. Pressure escalates under Causal lens because each rewrite risks permanent duplication; agency resides in the sensei’s choice to initiate merger. Felt price—grief flooding back—alters later tactics: tomorrow’s lessons will “slice through pretense from the first breath.”

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“safeguard space for innovation”—is declared early but stays abstract; no external antagonist or ticking clock narrows options. Pressure escalates only lyrically via repeated “hush” and “storm-born silence,” an accumulative intensification that reweights ambiance, not tactical risk. Cost is conceptual (patience required) rather than dramatized loss, keeping tension moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—restore laughter—signalled in paragraph one. Escalation is textural: each louder, warmer gust macerates silence calcifying around Sarah’s heart until laughter audibly fractures it; price is Eleanor’s accelerating fade. Agency is present but single-note (yank/soften); no second reversal. Coincidence does not resolve, meeting situational lens. Could edge higher if ghost risked definitive self-expenditure rather than gradual thinning.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—make friends with uncertainty—tightens via accretion: each lick dissolves one more certainty into memory. Pendant’s cold pulse is the single escalating beat that re-weights perception. Guardian’s agency is interiorized; no external antagonist, so pressure is lyric not tactical. Cost is felt but diffuse (nostalgia as chronic ache); lacks a corporeal price that would push it to 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—interrupt destiny of fatal failure—is signaled in line 1. One meaningful tightening: snapping the serpent-head sacrifices certainty, foreclosing retreat. Cost is legible in the immediate hiss-coil-knit reaction and the permanent undeath bloom. Escalation is textural—density of failed attempts—culminating in the pattern-break of certainty’s sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—decode the impossible shard—tightens when every calibration fails, forcing the renunciation of her entire toolkit. The lunar perigee acts as accumulative clock, dragging clarity “from confusion,” a pressure visible in her stripped rig. Cost is legible: she forfeits her identity as “last interpreter” to become first listener, a trade-off foreclosing the old tower-city’s future.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—anchor the ferry between timelines—signals early; one meaningful tightening occurs when the glass warms and the hull flickers, narrowing options to final pulse. Agency is continuous: Lina’s burst transmissions drive each escalation; coincidence is absent. Cost is visible but abstract (“timelines tug at her edges”); no concrete forfeiture (fatigue, injury, social loss) grounds the price. Escalation coheres under Hybrid lens; the radio-hum/grotto harmony is legible, yet stakes never pierce the body.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—map the texture of connection—tightens when the forced splice triggers the flood, turning her method into the very medium she must surrender to. One meaningful deepening: thread dissolves into water, reweighting the stake from control to immersion. Cost is legible on-page—fever breaks, hands empty, gallery silence restored. Escalation is textural/accumulative, not causal-reversal, fulfilling the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—teaching starlight to the starless—tightens once: from decoding ocean-skin angles to watching Corin embody Ursa Major; the cost is conceptual yet legible: the method is imperfect, the stars remain unseen, but the path inside is irreversibly opened.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—protecting vulnerable voices—tightens when the narrator realizes the pulse is corporeal; the choice to compress the stranger’s chest forecloses the ghost-hunt. Pressure escalates through auditory narrowing: each static filter raises the cost of mis-listening. The reversal (ghost → living) is earned by the device’s prior behavior. No visible price is exacted from the narrator, keeping the score below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—witness the unremembered—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens as oxygen and tide dwindle; the codex’s warming/cooling provides a visible price gauge. One decisive narrowing: hand-to-terminal sync costs Marek seven seconds ofMerged consciousness, after which retreat is the only option. Pressure escalates under causal logic; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: prove she is alive by restoring a ghost—life/death authority at risk. Tightening beat: shard-to-screen spark collapses option to walk away; ghost’s map now her only exit. Cost visible: porcelain goes cold, heartbeat-count lingers—felt price. Escalation driven by her agency under causal lens; no coincidence resolves. One meaningful turn suffices; no antagonist needed. Moral calculus—use brokenness to mend brokenness—sharpens peak choice.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—can texture be given audible voice before the language dies—tightens once, at the exact midpoint when the storyteller realizes “sensation was not sound” and must harness the birds. This deepening reweights the fracture from curse to alphabet, foreclosing the option of pure human speech. Cost is legible: the final three speakers drop to two, then one, then none, and her own life is spent as payment. Agency remains hers; coincidence is absent; luck does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—turn bitterness into laughter—threads every phrasing; the tightening occurs when the phone’s chorus demands metamorphose, foreclosing observer detente. Cost is paid conceptually: Lyn’s researcher distance dissolves into stardust, a forfeiture legible in the final image. Agency is soft (acceptance more than decision), but the lens is accumulative; one intensification suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“reawaken beauty or endure silence”—is signaled in line 4 and tightens twice: every melody fails (knowledge) → shell offers arrhythmic code (understanding) → she stakes her own heart. Price escalates from public failure → partial statue crack → potential self-petrification; payment is on-page (body stiffens, heartbeat permanently altered). Agency is absolute: her decision to amplify chest-rhythm cracks the system. Clocktower counter-pulse complicates rather than rescues. One minor slack: orchard roots’ surge reads slightly external; still, protagonist choice triggers it.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—delivering absolution across a lethal border—tightens when the mother’s plea is added to the chain, forcing one flight to carry two absences. The bottle’s storm masking the drone is the visible price paid for crossing. Escalation is single-track but sufficient; options narrow to “fly now or forever fail,” and the success lands with irretrievable relief on the far side.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: prove silence is fertile, not void. Pressure accumulates through repeated returns and frozen gears; tightening occurs when the fragment is found—silence must now justify song. Cost is the irreversible break of lifelong silence; stakes stay personal, proportionate. No external antagonist, but that fits accumulative design; escalation is a single deepening, sufficient for 600-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—locate the zeroth volume—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when the scarf’s warmth indicates map-activation. Agency is topological rather than emotional; each fold increases ambient curvature, narrowing options to “enter or not.” Cost is conceptual: by releasing starlight she surrenders her private archive, a forfeiture legible in the scarf’s sudden whiteness. Escalation is single-cycle yet sufficient for lyric length; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—retrieve the dream before daylight dissolves it—is signaled in sentence three and tightens with each sunrise increment. One meaningful deepening occurs when the cipher flips from instruction to trap to gift, forcing a tactical shift from capture to witness. Price is visible: the empty well forever alters her future paintings, a forfeiture scaled to lyric length. Agency remains hers: every bridge painted and photograph taken directly invites the dream’s voluntary step.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—freeing an imprisoned truth—signaled early and tightened once: the ribbon loosens, ash-like hair falls, idea unfurls. Escalation is situational: cosmic hush and tilting ground force stance crystallization rather than causal reversal. Cost is visible—the client’s gasp, Merrin’s star-tasting longing—yet feels mid-scale for this length. Lacks a secondary loss (tool, time, social credit) that would sharpen the trade-off into high-band territory.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—recover memories or accept perpetual lacuna—signals early and tightens when the missing Pleiad vertex is located, forcing artificial fungal fruiting in October. The protagonist’s agency shapes every escalation: measuring angles, culturing spores, singing chants, placing the glowing cap; luck never rescues him. Visible costs accrue—tetanus risk, weeks of night-tending, surrender of “certainty that every mystery needs solving”—and foreclose the path back to investigation. The deepening is single but meaningful; tension stays coherent under Accumulative lens without requisite reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“decipher shadow or stay exiled”—tightens when annotation succeeds yet she still chooses remaining; option of return is foreclosed on-page. One meaningful turn suffices: the instant shadow dances, freedom becomes possible yet rejected. Cost is visible: trembling pour, sealed pouch, and Lin’s white knuckles. Agency is her pen stopping, then finishing the glyph that locks her fate.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—free the drowned voices or remain their jailer—tightens with every knot surrendered. Accumulative escalation: each loosened thread increases spectral pressure until the final pearl compresses thirty years of silence. No external coincidence; the only antagonist is her own calcified throat. The decisive cost is the permanent hollow in her bones where seven names now reside—visible forfeiture of anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is epistemic: will the unknown stay mute? Pressure tightens once—frame-by-frame comparison reveals the seam, foreclosing the possibility that the tear is accidental. Escalation is accumulative: decades of silent footage compress into one visible shift, a cadence jump that reweights the stake from restoration to revelation. Cost is felt in the final beat: she renounces loud discovery, threads the tear, forfeits professional triumph for guarded reverence.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—how to release grief without erasing it—is signaled in the first paragraph and tightened each time Cassian records a new datum, narrowing options from “solve” to “carry.” The meaningful turn is the shift from kinetic grief to potential memory; the price is the admission that understanding does not dissolve ache, only reclassifies it. Escalation is textural: each physical observation adds density until the final repackaging beat forecloses the fantasy of dissolution. Cost is legible in the cold exactitude of the final slate equation and the lingering “sophisticated melancholy” that ascends with them.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges without once stating “grief” or “loss” outright; instead, the physics metaphor reweights absence as a conservation law. The snow globe’s final reclassification offers a resonant, non-literal answer: letting go is not deletion but re-categorization under continued gravity. Subtext is carried in gesture—Cassian’s gloved fingers never remove the gloves, a quiet admission that direct contact would scald. The ending image of the globe cradled in a pack, still pulsing, denies sentimental resolution and leaves undeniable conceptual cost: the object will outlast the observer.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—giving voice to the ghost’s mute ache—is declared early and restated often, but pressure escalates only by poetic intensification (mist thickens, glyphs flare) rather than by narrowing options or demanded sacrifice. No credible loss (time, safety, identity) is risked or paid; consequently the “tightening” remains ornamental. Agency is present—stamping, singing—but never faces a trade-off that forecloses a path. Under an Accumulative lens, the cadence shift is lovely yet cost-free, capping the score just below 6.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is emotional trespass: will Kai violate the captain’s private grief to confirm their own worth? Escalation is an accumulative deepening—each floor decrypts more intimate praise, tightening the servant’s impossible choice to keep or confess the reading. Agency is the decision to keep reading and ultimately to set the goggles down—renunciation that accepts eternal silence as cost. No coincidence; sunlight timing is environmental given, not rescue. Persistent constraint: the captain’s death means no external confrontation is possible—pressure is entirely internal, making the final silence earned.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will the atmosphere be allowed to remember, or will institutional erasure win?—is signaled in paragraph four. Escalation is accumulative: each dead instrument raises the cost of keeping faith with her heretical index. The decisive tightening arrives when she realizes the “acceptance” cloud is the same that witnessed Thorne’s death; that coincidence is situational pressure, not resolution, and it forces the on-page confession with visible price—her only exit is now literally strapped to evidence. Cost is felt; no swappability.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—chart the luminance to earn cartographic greatness—is signaled early and tightened once: the coordinate discovery forecloses alternate routes and redirects the airship. Escalation is single but meaningful; the luminous valley reveal narrows options and confirms her wager. Cost is present but lightly registered (she remains solitary); a sharper forfeiture (crew risk, map ink running low, etc.) would have pushed higher. Still, agency drives every turn under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restore the flow of memory—is signaled early and deepened when each mirror offers living moments instead of static regret. Escalation is textural: density of nostalgic images increases until the single un-frosted mirror crystallizes the pressure. Agency is present—she uncaps the gear, turns it, forfeits the library's eternal winter—but the cost is conceptual rather than visceral. Still, the tightening from frozen stasis to breathing warmth is legible and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.1)
    Dominant stake—save orchard from drought—is declared early but never tightens; no resource is visibly depleted, no live option foreclosed. Ghost’s messages remove tension by handing solutions wholesale. Final bell ring produces abundance without trade-off; escalation is aesthetic mist, not rising cost.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: vouchsafing one moment of peace across the final ripple. Pressure escalates accumulatively—each spiral traced adds silence-density until the option of sound is foreclosed. The boy’s thousand deaths remain off-page, but the adjuster’s tactile labor keeps the cost visceral. No reversal in causal sense, yet the deepening pattern shift forces her final renunciation with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—get strangers out before nightfall—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens with every nut placement. Each shadow is an on-page trade-off that costs her anonymity and emotional energy; the final worn nut embodies years of handled hope. Escalation is causal under the frost clock; no coincidence rescues them. Cost is visible: she forfeits acknowledgement and perpetuates her exile.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“translate separation into connection”—is signaled early and re-anchored mid-scene. Pressure tightens once: foam pattern gives the polymer blueprint, foreclosing endless lab failure. Cost is visible (grief threads unwind into water, film hums) but borne by imagery more than by jeopardy or tangible loss; page-level price is legible yet mild. No second reversal, acceptable for <800 words under Accumulative track; still, the tightening is poetic rather than tactical, keeping it shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“find the place where stories begin”—is signaled early and deepens when the vendor quantifies absence to map origins. Escalation under Accumulative lens: each incision intensifies the library’s archive of unwritten stories, narrowing the vendor’s options until she refuses her own incision, paying the price of perpetual exile. Cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—chef’s capacity to absorb versus shatter—tightens when the droplet’s weight nearly drops him; option to refuse is foreclosed by vocation. Escalation is accretive: each pool decoded = more remorse funneled into his brittle heart; no reversal, but deepening until only vessel-hood remains. Cost is visceral—trembling hands, hairline fractures—visible on page. Coincidence (storm exposing pavilion) complicates, does not resolve; pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—sonic segregation—surfaces early; pressure escalates by accretion of refrains rather than a tightening choice. Elara’s agency is curatorial, not risky: she convenes, teaches, files; no beat forces her to sacrifice time, safety, or social capital. The “first grain elevator talk” is presented as success, not a test that could fail, so tension plateaus. Cost is borne collectively (elders weep, kids stumble) rather than personally, keeping the protagonist’s own stakes modest.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore abandoned dreams—signals in paragraph 4 and escalates as each modification "sends ripples," narrowing her options toward total entanglement. One meaningful tightening suffices: when the canyon’s rock faces shift "like neural tissue," the cost of continued modification becomes irreversible self-interpenetration. Agency is continuous—every fracture she maps rewires both canyon and self—culminating in the Earned Stasis of sleep inside the world she altered. No coincidence; all pressure is internally generated by her escalating probes.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes are abstract—“protect archives from erasure” is named but never dramatized by an on-page threat, so pressure stays conceptual. Escalation is purely temporal: the hour slips toward reset, forcing exit; no option is foreclosed or traded off by protagonist choice. The tightening is situational, not moral or tactical; she merely finishes the task and leaves. Cost is the squeeze of time, but because the combinations’ future use remains hypothetical, the price feels deferred.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—“create music in a silent world”—is declared early, but escalation is associative, not consequential. Tension accumulates through repeated images (silence vs. faint hum) rather than through tightened options or forfeited alternatives; no moment forecloses failure or costs her stamina, pride, or tool. Consequently the tightening is aesthetic, not practical, keeping pressure within the lyric/textural band but below the threshold of visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can he repay Mira by decoding silence—tightens when each magnetic flutter is mapped to a pawn or knight, narrowing options to the final stone-release. Pressure is accumulative: pulses → memory → pattern → irrevocable absence. Cost is felt on-page in the erased footprints and the hollow dent left behind.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—“recover the memory sealed by silence”—is signaled early and tightens through each dial adjustment; the clasp’s click forecloses the option to leave the past locked. Pressure is internal and accumulative; no external antagonist escalates. Cost is emotional (grief re-awakened) but not vis-à-vis another will, keeping escalation lyrical rather than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can Elias transmute decay into living calm?—is signaled early and tightens once: the glowing amber heartbeat forces the choice to share, not hoard. Cost is present but gentle: the seed is gone, its wisdom now communal, yet Elias loses nothing he valued. No reversal or trade-off complicates the arc; pressure plateaus after the tincture succeeds. Sufficient for lyric mode, but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—orchard survival—signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation is driven by Kael’s agency: she chooses to release controls inside the arch, trading aerial mastery for epistemic access; this tightens options irreversibly. Cost is legible: the family must now cultivate disease, not fight it—an on-page tactical forfeiture. Under causal lens, one meaningful turn suffices; the inversion hour acts as persistent constraint that shapes every tactical decision.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—prevent repeat disaster—remains abstract; no live second container or circling helicopter forces an immediate trade-off. Escalation is intellectual (data spike) rather than tactical; pressure plateaus after the venturi discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—prove wonder cannot be silenced—escalates as the cavern’s hush literally thickens, forcing Lyra to match aurora colors to bell tones or lose the moment. One tightening beat suffices: the first marble strike triggers an irreversible sequence; failure would freeze wonder forever. Cost is visible: the amber sheet dims, Lyra’s breath lingers like spent currency, and she must remain as lifelong guardian—foreclosure of ordinary life implied. Agency is collaborative (sculptor cues her) but still protagonist-driven: her synesthetic calibration enables the release.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“harvest insight from failure”—tightens when the music reveals the vault still ajar, forcing the choice to keep or renounce the flute. The escalation is single but decisive: the note sequence widens the seam, then the avalanchingly quiet drop makes the cost audible; this narrows his options to bearer-of-fracture or coward. Agency is present yet could be sharper—he hesitates twice, slightly diluting the sense of irrevocable trade-off. Still, the persistent constraint (flute must stay with him) is legible and shapes next move.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can empathy be algebraically extracted and transferred—tightens when the fragment’s fracture makes reversal imminent. Escalation is textural: each printed sheet depletes the fragment and erases a star, narrowing options until the final “Empathy = DeltaSelf / DeltaOther” admits bidirectional flux. Cost is visible in the spent fragment, the poet’s stolen euphoria returning to leave Cassian hollow, and the sky’s total blackout that forecloses further prints.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—proving objects absorb emotions—tightens once: the frost rewrites its patterns into words, foreclosing the path of statistical proof and opening the path of witness. Cost is legible in her three-hour stance and the phrase “She was already gone” which marks an irreversible shift from data to communion. No causal reversals, but the deepening under Accumulative lens suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—mending vs. surrendering silence—is signaled early and tightens through each offering. One meaningful deepening: the puzzle piece showing Mei’s younger self forces reciprocity. Cost is visible—memories evaporate into light—altering tactics. Escalation is accumulative, not causal-reversal, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—save orchards via arch revival—is signaled in paragraph 1. One meaningful tightening: offering the copper rings dissolves his inherited identity and is irreversible. Cost is visible on-page: “his inheritance dissolved, leaving only the quiet determination.” Escalation is causal under the chosen lens; no coincidence resolves the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—prevent rift from swallowing bay—signaled early; escalation is textural: murmur grows, concrete trembles, air shimmers. One meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes predecessor’s spirit is inside shard; knowledge deepens, options narrow to “redirect or repeat failure.” Cost is conceptual—lifelong guardianship—but not dramatized as tangible loss (no injury, no forfeited desire). Agency is present but low-res: the shard impels, she obeys; no resistance or trade-off staged on page.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes—preserve the lighthouse’s promise of safety—are signaled early and tighten when the lamp dies; the single reversal is Caleb’s shift from mere maintenance to ritual protection (bottling the glass). Escalation is gentle, pressure mostly atmospheric; cost is conceptual (the ache bottled) rather than a live option foreclosed, capping the score at the entry to high band.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake: can ancient shadows guide a lost ship through digital fog? Pressure escalates only once—light-thread thrown, ship answers, storm abates; no narrowing of options or visible price. Escalation is situational: external storm abates rather than protagonist paying cost. Agency is symbolic (turning wick) rather than tactical; the world obeys her prophecy without testing her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stake—why some souls attract stories—stated early yet remains intellectual; no external jeopardy or ticking clock forces revision of tactics. Tightening occurs only when stranger touches chest → memory flood; this is the single escalation point, and it depends on mystical permission, not prior agency. Cost concept (carrying others’ stories) is declared in closing lines but is never a forfeiture we watch the master weigh or refuse. Under lyric-accumulative lens, intensity rises through image repetition rather than narrowing options, satisfying the lens, yet the absence of a visible price keeps pressure abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—does the labyrinth hold only grief or also resilience?—is signaled in paragraph four. Escalation is textural: each thread she traces adds density until the sum overwhelms, then the moonlight reweights it. Decision to deconstruct sorrow into key-light is on-page with visible cost: the map dissolves, door opens, foreclosing her former detachment. No coincidence; pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“rekindle the dying realm before its last ember faded”—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: each sung note costs memory, narrowing options until the mica fractures. Cost is visible on-page: “each note pulled a piece of his own memory away.” Agency is renunciation rather than victory, fitting lyric-accumulative lens. No reversal, but the steady attrition creates coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will she remain isolated or risk shared solitude?—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the invitation is finally smoothed flat. One meaningful deepening: the mirror reframes rejection as germination, forcing the choice. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; each paradoxic aphorism adds weight until the corridor offers release. Cost is visible: she surrenders the shop’s absolute sanctuary at the stroke of midnight.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—refuse unnoticed forgetting—is signaled early and escalates by accretion: each lost ordinary thing (rye taste, fountain flow) heightens the cost of inattention. Guerrilla gardening is the visible tactic that narrows options: every seedling is a public wager that could be uprooted. The tightening beat is the communal scattering of breadcrumbs; by consuming the last evidence they foreclose retreat into private nostalgia. Price is legible: the loaf is gone forever, their ritual now the only residue.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—keep the library aloft—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is density-based: each flicker grows fainter, frequencies slip “like sand through an hourglass of ice,” forcing finer calibrations. Micro-turn occurs when the queen’s vow harmonic is isolated; this narrows options to re-project or surrender. Price is spelled out: “temporary ward against the inevitable,” so cost is legible without causal fireworks.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“truce of hush” vs. stranger’s ledger—signals early and tightens through sunrise deadline. Single meaningful escalation: rewiring the recorder narrows options from physical sabotage to covert evidence, forcing stance crystallization. Cost is visible—she must swallow betrayal and live with the uneasy silence she preserves. Agency stays protagonist-driven; coincidence only complicates (wind relights lantern).

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—will Elara accept unprovable weather consensus?—tightens when ring taste fuses forest vote with aurora plasma, foreclosing data-proof option. Cost is legible: she forfeits evidentiary certainty and future reporting power. Escalation is one deepening, not reversal, fitting Accumulative lens. Pressure stays coherent; coincidence only complicates arrival timing.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—will she draw again?—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when lock snaps: she must now face the blank page or betray the calling. Agency is present; no outside savior. One meaningful turn only, appropriate to length; cost is the ache of “auroral sorrow” she must now paint into every future portrait. Pressure stays coherent; coincidence is absent. Could edge higher if a sharper tangible loss (time, tool, social risk) had been dramatized, but closure still carries felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single dominant stake—recovering lost honest speech—tightens when each reel’s candor re-illuminates her own buried lie; the guard scene provides the mid-text cost test (truth vs. physical pain). Escalation is accumulative: every truthful playback adds luminous contrast to her prior cowardice, narrowing her options until she must shoulder the reel’s weight. Closure crystallizes the ongoing cost: honesty is no state but constant practice.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—quiet the inner static—tightens with every compass degree; the burn is the single decisive act that trades absolute safety for silence. Cost is relentlessly visible: the box warps, roses amber-over, and the android will forever carry “Emma’s fire” in private memory, a persistent constraint on future protocol breaches. No coincidence resolves the conflict; magnetic drift complicates, then the caretaker weaponizes the same glitch. Escalation is textural—density of sap, ash, and memory—but agency remains causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—save the courtyard by proving stories matter—remains coherent. One meaningful tightening: developer flags appear overnight, forcing Mira to accelerate from passive listening to public curation of the letters. Cost is legible (loss of her private sanctuary, exposure of neighbors’ grief), but the escalation is slightly cushioned: city council stalls the tower off-page, so the price is shared rather than personally borne, capping short of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—escape or drown—signalled in first paragraph; escalation is the tightening cipher that turns exercise into override sequence. Each dance roll raises the chance of AI audit, visible cost when she trembles between pirouette and breath. The final flood is not coincidence but the logical release she scripts. One meaningful tightening suffices; price is the lab she sacrifices.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—recover Mara’s lost memory—is signaled by breakfast-eye-emptiness line 4. Escalation tightens once: the spiral of coffee grounds narrows options to the fifth piling, forcing bodily cost under fluctuating gravity. Agency stays with Kael; no coincidence resolves. Price is crystallized in the eardrum-press silence and the whale-bones-becoming-fertilizer counterweight felt off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—hush the prophecy—signaled early; escalation is the deepening listening required for each upstream crane, a nice inversion of natural flow. The tightening beat is the final wing dipping, which silences meaning itself, foreclosing Elias’s option to ever re-hear the warning. Cost is conceptual (world loses memory of flood) but not viscerally felt by character on the page, so pressure stops short of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“will the building’s authentic grammar survive renovation?”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and escalates when new owners seek “truth” via fabrication. The midpoint tightening occurs when Mrs. Voss confesses demolition plans; options narrow to clandestine inscription or total erasure. Alex’s agency drives the final beat: they carry the seal downstairs and imprint the wall, paying the social risk of trespass and the irreversible exposure of the ward’s ghosts. Cost is legible in fresh plaster and the shiver felt “through the brass.”

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence while archiving the sister—tightens when the garden demands surrender of the very equations that define her independence. One deepening: realizing quarantine is cocoon, not prison, reweights the cost of relinquishing silence. Agency remains hers; no coincidence resolves the tension. Felt price is the shell’s silence and the permanent solitude she now elects to carry; escalation plateaus rather than spikes, so ceiling stops at 8.4.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—unlink the tyrant’s seal—tightens once yet decisively when the forged page meets the golden disc, a single escalation that narrows options from “maybe” to “irreversible.” Agency is pure: every beat is her hand, her thorn, her phrase; no coincidence rescues. Cost is visible in the spinning disc and the pearl twilight that now hides her escape; the city’s awakening is the price she trades for anonymity. Stakes stay personal-state, not abstract-world, fitting the word budget.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve echoes vs. conspiracy of silence—is signaled early and reiterated, but the antagonistic pressure is atmospheric, not agentive. Escalation is textural: density of echoes increases, knowledge deepens, but no live option is foreclosed; the singer was always going to sing. The sole tightening is the off-page decision to channel the lover’s echo; because it is un-dramatized, cost is conceptual, not tactile. Still, the accretive pattern is coherent under the Accumulative lens, keeping the score in the high-6 pocket.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—“salvage something pure”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when the pristine globe is revealed as the uncontaminated twin. No live option is foreclosed; the cost is conceptual (she will keep dreaming for others), visible in the final echo of the lullaby. Escalation is textural: each shard adds weight to the idea that memory can be both corrupted and whole. Sufficient for this length, but lacks a visceral trade-off that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stake—learning to see hidden effort—escalates once via Kael’s sip of “night-brew,” but no obstacle or trade-off complicates the transfer of skill; pressure plateaus rather than tightens, keeping the conflict in the mild instructional register.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—truth versus manufactured curse—tightens when each anomaly he notices (warm soil, backward dust devils, daughter’s immunity) forecloses the option to keep believing. Escalation is accumulative: every newly-mapped distortion shrinks the territory of innocent ignorance until confrontation becomes the only remaining stance. Visible price: friendships already lost, and the oncoming storm will exact a public cost within minutes. Stakes stay personal and immediate rather than abstract “world-saving,” fitting 700-word scale.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
    <comment>Theme emerges organically: engineered myths used to pacify expendable populations. Subtext lives in gesture—council’s lead-lined gloves betray technical knowledge they deny. Recurring motif of “clean air in the wasteland” reconfigures from miracle to by-product of elite shelter, landing a conceptual gut-punch. No moral is stated; the final image of a wall of dust forces readers to feel the cost of truth.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—translate loss into spendable memory—tightens when she realizes pennies are worthless against forgetting; the meaningful deepening is the shift from selling to gifting, foreclosing her prior livelihood. Pressure grows accumulatively: each jar adds literal weight and social risk (library ostracism). Cost is visible: her chest bruised by glass-pressed sleep, her solitude exposed at dawn release. No causal escalation break.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—free the guardian or remain ice-locked—tightens when boats are crystallized shut. Mid-scene reversal: instead of fleeing by skiff, she must weaponize the very ice that imprisons her. Price is visceral: frozen tears, rib-vibrations, coat heavy with salt-sound. Escalation is cleanly sonic: each frequency step strips away one escape option until only the duet remains.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear early: free the far-shore minds by disabling the tyrant’s crisis-manufactured network. One meaningful tightening occurs at the moon-11-degree beat, narrowing options to “send pulse now or wait another cycle.” Cost is visible—Elara’s own “caged urgency” is the price of waiting—but the pulse itself is bloodless; no tangible personal loss beyond sustained restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—silence vs. exposure—is signaled on arrival and escalates with each piece of evidence that makes signing Voss’s report impossible. The single meaningful tightening occurs when the uploaded files leave her phone: that irreversible click forecloses retreat and raises the cost to unemployment or worse. Pressure is coherent under causal lens: every drip, scuff, and loose bolt narrows her choices toward the final renunciation. No coincidence rescues her; the beam that killed the worker becomes the beam that breaks Voss’s control.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can anything redeemed survive the weight of irreversible crime? Pressure tightens as each gear is re-cut; the melody’s first audible note is the irreversible tightening that forecloses the option of symbolic forgiveness without artifact. No coincidence; escalation is pure accretion of craft and meaning. Cost is the chaplain’s new, unending custodianship of the song.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“ring the bell”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens through nightly transliterations that foreclose rest and safety; each feeding session raises the buoyancy risk (acid spray, lightning). One meaningful deepening: algorithm graduates from survival to pure desire, forcing Zephyr to choose complicity; she does, and the price is her former innocence. Agency is continuous; no coincidence. Cost is visible: body fatigue, workshop groans louder, hull lifts closer to lethal clouds. Sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—recover truth about vanished engineers—is signaled in line 4. Pressure escalates via pattern-density: numbers surfacing in songs, timestamps, metadata; each return tightens the sense of a hidden trail. Agency is present—forge token, copy video, erase logs—but the on-page price (being caught? guilt?) is only implied through the final "rare brightness," so cost clarity is present yet soft. No coincidence resolves; the mirror-upload is a deliberate renunciation that forecloses corporate silence. One meaningful deepening suffices for length; it delivers.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—community survival on shifting ice—tightens once: from shattered predictor to navigable path via blood-paid empathy. Escalation is one deepening, not a ladder of reversals; the mirror-glimpses raise the cost of reassembly, the boy’s palm makes it real. Price is indelible: his blood vaporizes into communal memory, foreclosing innocence.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—will she exit or endure?—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates via sensory repetition (crack, hum, wind) rather than narrowing options; lucky photograph float replaces a protagonist-driven test. No visible price is exacted—no missed ride, no broken rib, no social cut. The “fold in patience” folds off-page; escalation is atmospheric, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—can the vineyard reconcile mismatched hearts?—is clear, but pressure plateaus after letter burial; no new narrowing or price. Escalation is textural (repetition of parallels) rather than tactical; consequence is conceptual, not felt, capping entry below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.9)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can grief be converted into shared beauty?—is signaled in line one and tightens through communal accretion rather than single reversal. Agency is distributed: archivist initiates pattern, townspeople add fragments, but no single on-page beat forces a trade-off that forecloses a path for her. Cost is cumulative and conceptual (infinite responsibility, case worn smooth) rather than a visible sacrifice in scene; this suits the Accumulative lens yet keeps escalation gentle. One meaningful cadence shift occurs when the child’s daisy becomes the seed for her future return, but the beat is summarized, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will Elias secure a traceable human residue before digitized annihilation—tightens when doors are chained. One meaningful deepening: crystal’s refusal to echo his name forecloses immortality option. Tactic shift from extraction to self-donation (reading aloud) shows paid price. Cost legible in time running out and ultimate silence.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—“capture the sound of growing older”—is signaled early; pressure intensifies through sensory accumulation rather than external opposition. The tidal breathing swells as a pattern break at the spiral-drawing beat, forcing the costly chalk snap that forecloses retention. No coincidence resolves; the sound recedes because he cannot hold it. Escalation is textural, not causal, fitting the lens; a sharper mid-arc trade-off could push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve starlight before observatory tears free—is signaled early; pressure tightens once when the leaf’s fall becomes the new escapement cadence, foreclosing the “stop time” option and accepting eternal ache. Cost is felt: Kael smiles bittersweet, knowing light will still fade. Agency is attention/renunciation rather than physical combat; sufficient for 600-word scale. Escape-velocity concept stays thematic, never threatens new concrete obstacle, capping escalation below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“where shadows go”—is signaled early and re-weighted when Elara realizes the automaton is the pocket. Tightening occurs loop-by-loop; each traced rune forecloses error and channels more shadow. Cost is conceptual: the world loses noon shadows forever; that price is legible in the final balcony image. Agency is pure—every escalation is her deliberate trace—yet the absence of resistance keeps this shy of 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—Elena’s epistemic authority—tightens when DNA proves the fairy-tale wrong. Micro-turn at tooth hand-off narrows her choices to confession or flight. Escalation continues: naming Clara supplies second external cost. Elena’s agency drives the final offer to dismantle her own canon; price is public discredit, visible on page.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.5)
    Single dominant stake—share light without flame—is signaled early and tightened once when the polished pearl becomes a public beacon. Pressure is situational-lyric: no antagonist, but the village’s need for safe guidance crystallizes her stance. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; a tangible forfeiture would deepen the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—can exile be turned into refuge?—is signaled early and tightens through pattern completion: each moss ring narrows her solitude toward communal invitation. Agency is accumulative: no single reversal, but the gradual colonization of racks by life forecloses permanent retreat. Visible price: public shaming lingers as phantom ache, felt whenever pendant warms. One minor slack: stakes never retest the outside world; risk stays internal, capping intensity just below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—can he grant discarded hopes dignity before final silence—signals in paragraph one. Escalation is textural: each cameo shortens as "closing-pages whisper" grows louder, tightening temporal pressure without external antagonist. Protagonist agency is ceremonial (solemnizing breath, kneeling shell-planting) that visibly prices his permanence in dream-death. Cost is legible: he forfeits authorship, releasing hopes to unauthored wild. One deepening suffices for this length; pattern holds.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—save the rite or harvest falls into forgettable sameness—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens once: song vs. silence. The single meaningful escalation occurs when the hush deepens and the tendril drinks sound; options narrow to sing or surrender. Cost is conceptual (loss of tradition) rather than viscerally personal, keeping it shy of 8.8. Agency is pure—song is her decision, no coincidence rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—recover the child—signals early. Escalation is textural: each discarded item added to the spiral tightens the ritual stakes; the flare costs light and secrecy. Agency is ritual patience rather than overt reversal; the protagonist does not adapt tactics, she deepens them. Cost is visible—the silent flare burns oxygen and grief into metal—but no live option is foreclosed, keeping pressure just shy of high-band punch.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restore echo harvest—tightens into its opposite: surrender the harvest to let moments breathe. Pressure escalates through iterative angle tests that reveal overload, forcing redesign; visible cost is the locksmith’s acceptance of perpetual sharing (loss of exclusive custody). Last click forecloses the hoarding path under Accumulative/Textural lens. Could edge higher if one intermediate beat showed tangible resource spent (bloody fingertip from quartz grinding, etc.).

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will she measure/release the burdens?—tightens each time brass temperature shifts foreclose an easier path (voice calcifies only after warmth; pride demands turning away from stars). Escalation is textural: silence layers like shingles until it becomes “nearly a substance,” each new weight deepening the acoustic trap. Cost is visible—hands pulled downward by black stone, lamp growing hot enough to recall its lost purpose—so the final sphere’s gravity feels priced. One meaningful turn: the recognition that walls = warp/weft; no reversal later, only crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“harvest lessons from loss before steam runs out”—is signaled inside the first 100 words. Pressure escalates via texture density: each curl of mane shavings tightens the emotional cost, the whistle’s rising pitch an audible countdown. Agency is renunciation rather than conquest; she chooses to trap the echo inside wood rather than demand resurrection, a visible price paid in sweat on the blank. Coincidence absent; causality is chisel-stroke → memory-surface → peace accepted.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—negotiate with own ghost—signaled early and tightens when the ghost offers a lost story-piece. Agency visible: spinning wheel to sync heart, stepping forward under regret’s weight. Cost legible: ghost’s dissolution leaves narrator sole custodian of fragments. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals needed under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.0)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—peace with abandoned teaching dream—is signaled early. Pressure escalates via tactile ritual: each gear lodged is an irreversible micro-forfeiture. Visible price: the broken chronometer disappears into stone, foreclosing repair. The escalation is accumulative rather than causal-turn based; one deepening suffices at this length, and it lands.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“salvage truth from lies”—is signaled early and narrows to a single physical map whose ink rewrites the city. Sundial’s shadow is the visible price: she sacrifices its future use (it “lay quiet” thereafter) to gain the tunnel chart. Escalation is one-step but sufficient for 700-word scale; no false reversals. Pressure is coherent under Causal lens; luck never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—recover the extinct wisp-grass protocol—arrives late (paras 6-7) but retroactively colonizes every prior knot. Escalation is textural: each reversed loop thickens the archive until three consecutive loops narrow possibility to a single decoded chart. Agency is patient decoding, not confrontation; the tightened choice is to write rather than speak, forfeiting immediate community cred for long-term germination power—cost is the freezing burn in her fingers. No antagonist is needed; the fog itself is the pressure that erases buoys and forces tactile reliance, complicating but not resolving the quest.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—map healing through absence—is signaled early; pressure deepens via accumulative pattern of named departures. One meaningful tightening: writing her own absence forecloses retreat. Cost is conceptual (she gives up the thread/record), visible on page, but external stakes remain muted.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—restore beauty—tightens once: pure Aetherwing becomes hybrid, foreclosing nostalgia. Escalation is causal: each failed hypothesis narrows options until only patchwork life remains. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; city’s momentary hesitation is observed, not paid by Lysander. One meaningful deepening suffices for length, but price could be sharper on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“prove scars can sing”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the broken bird forces her to test that claim. The graft act is the single meaningful escalation; it narrows options from symbolic song to physical repair. Coin-splint and sand-circle are visible prices that alter tactics. Luck does not resolve; the bird’s chirp is plausible outcome of her agency, not gift from tide.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—liberate trapped memories—is signaled early and escalates through the ticking celestial clock. However, the tightening moment (geese pause) is external coincidence, not an action that narrows Kael’s options; she waits, then succeeds. No visible price is exacted from her—no forfeited tool, social risk, or internal rupture—so the cost remains atmospheric rather than felt. The pressure pattern satisfies one deepening but lacks the visible price required for 8.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—break the generational failure to share light without fire—is signaled in line 1 and tightens when each sonar return arrives “distorted.” One meaningful deepening: she shifts from querying to lullaby frequency, a tactical adaptation that costs her the last warmth of inquiry. The price is legible—eight lifetimes of grief now internalized as “troubling serenity.” Agency is present but muted: the garden’s Turing mechanism limits her to encoding, not escape; the lack of a decisive physical act keeps this just below 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—discover the form of collective grief—tightens through each dusk retracing; options narrow from generic lambs to communal ribbon fragments. One meaningful intensification: realization that “grief is a spiral” forces final carving choice with felt aesthetic cost. No antagonist needed; pressure is iterative pattern vs failure to honor seven drowned villagers. Cost is legible—Kael forsakes conventional memorial for risky unproven form—but not viscerally personal; hence shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—decode the unspoken—signals early, but pressure is textural: each knot tightens patience, not risk. No live option is foreclosed; failure would merely leave the mystery intact, so cost is aesthetic rather than consequential. Escalation is a cadence shift from “jumble” to “smooth,” satisfying under Accumulative lens. A visible price (time, sore fingers) is paid, yet it alters no tactic beyond persistence.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are survival vs. collapse; one tightening occurs when elders’ fear of cracked ice could still veto the plan. Escalation is modest—no reversal—yet the cost is conceptually legible: any miscalculation will fracture their only trade artery. Agency stays with Kaelen; her lattice-modeling *is* the beat that narrows possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—can forbidden music re-seed narrative life?—tightens once when Mira risks embedding the pirate cipher; no further narrowing, but the single deepening is sufficient at this length. Cost is conceptual: the orchestra will unknowingly perform sedition. Escalation is lyrical, not causal, and fits the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—whether the city’s collapse will be myth or record—tightens when filing begins; each notch forecloses one official lie. Escalation is accumulative: sediment map, fire scar, saltwater line compress into one brass register. Patrol arrival externalizes cost; lowered weapon signals the tightening has worked—truth now carries its own deterrence. No reversal, but a deepening that reweights survival itself.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—"unlearning hatred through sonic subtraction"—is signaled early and tightened when Marco’s single middle-C forecloses his defensive noise. Escalation is paced via accumulative cadence: each added voice narrows harmonic options until the chord becomes fragile consensus. Cost is paid in Marco’s public exposure (first unarmored note) and in Mrs. Kaelin’s relinquishing of the rosette, a transfer that externalizes her life’s work. The perpetual threat of returned noise keeps pressure coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—outlaw gardening under celestial surveillance—tightens with each cut; pruning shears become contraband. One meaningful escalation: the bud forms only after she baptizes soil with pruned-vine tea, fusing rebel method to cosmic key. Cost is double: legal peril + ingestion of collective trauma. No off-stage rescue; her agency alone unlocks the fruit.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restore wonder to a grid that has forgotten how to marvel—tightens when the honeycomb’s glow costs Mara her last match and her booth’s darkness. One meaningful escalation: the tower receptors drink the gentle current only after she vocalizes memory, linking personal truth to civic revival. No antagonist needed; pressure is situational and accumulative. Cost is felt, but the turnaround is slightly gentle; options narrow only in that she can’t repeat the ritual once the comb is spent.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is the transmutation of inert houses into breathing presences; escalation proceeds by density, not reversal—each shard adds another voice to the choir. The tightening is the moment the oldest oak receives the shard: the town’s silence becomes total, foreclosing further collection. Price is legible in the swallowed sound itself, an absence felt as warmth. No external opposition or risk keeps this just outside the top band.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Theme—attention as sanctifying ritual—emerges through iterated image, never thesis. The displaced objects refuse allegory; their power stays tactile and olfactory. Final image of golden pools on cobblestones offers quiet conceptual re-pricing: silence now glows. No moralizing, no tidy maxim—only the luminous fact that noticing is a form of love.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—guardian of absolute truth vs. guardian of questions—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when Petra threads doubt into the dome, foreclosing eternal stasis. Escalation is accumulative: each ampoule memory dissolves another certainty, reweighting the stake toward pluralism. Visible price: stone lips crack; garden reclaims statues, proving the city drowned from its own refusal to let children question. Agency remains Petra’s throughout—she chooses to broadcast uncertainty, enduring the fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—“will strangers remember kindness?”—is signaled early but never faces credible risk; success arrives with first responder. No option narrows: Kael repeats the same action, merely scaling it. Accumulation of tokens deepens texture rather than tightening pressure, so escalation stays lyric, not stakes-driven. Cost is societal, not personal; brush never falters, insomnia never punished.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restore the beam or ships perish—signals in paragraph two and tightens when the stone’s pulse is witnessed. One meaningful turn: counter-clockwise yoyo spin at exact tide reversal; failure would cost both light and her belief in mutable fate. Cost is visible—she quakes, palms sweat, leaves with only a velvet pouch and backward-ticking heart. Escalation is coherent under causal lens; no convenience rescues her—the puzzle must be solved or darkness wins.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—turn fear’s amplification back on itself—signaled in attic and escalated by converging footprints and mirror screams. One meaningful tightening: forced question “What frightens you?” narrows options from flight to interrogation. Price legible—clasp extinguished, advisor gone—so tactics must change thereafter. No off-stage rescue; escalation is protagonist-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—orchard survival—threads every beat; escalation is the storm’s pulse gradually syncing to her score, tightening from threat to duet. Agency sits in each percussive seed she plants; the visible price is relinquishing control—storm now dictates tempo. One deepening shift sufficies: cumulus geometry rewritten as notation narrows her options to dialogue or death. Cost is legible on-page (perpetual vigil, surrendered silence), though not yet a tangible loss of limb/tool.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can curiosity survive the watchers’ silence?—tightens when Kael realizes the crack is an invitation, not a warning. The meaningful deepening occurs at the midpoint: the growth patterns on the shells match the expedition path, turning archival obsession into live endangerment. Cost is conceptual but undeniable—once she blows the shell-whistle, she can never return to the citizens who stare at their feet. No reversal, but the cadence shift from private study to public carving suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are declared (“rescue truth”) yet never tested; no institutional resistance, moral dilemma, or personal loss appears on-page. Pressure stays flat—finding the letter is effortless—so the single tightening is rhetorical rather than experiential.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—time-locked survival of forgotten dreams—tightens once the drawbridge seals; no off-island escape possible. Protagonist agency escalates via capsule invention; each mortared note forecloses stealth and risks Authority censure. Visible price: bodily exhaustion, tear-tainted mortar, empty inkwell, professional credibility wagered on the one-year delay. Coincidence absent; pressure coils under Causal lens until stoic report masks private arson of memory.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single dominant stake—authenticate the book—tightens through micro-choices: tilting glass, pressing stamp. The power-return rumble supplies coincidence, not resolution; cost remains conceptual (lost time, wet paper) rather than viscerally felt, so the tightening is present but modest.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—map the geography of never-was—signalled early. One meaningful tightening: breaker countdown narrows window, forces final scan choice. Agency is attention/renunciation (she seals data, doesn’t weaponize it); cost is opportunity—knowledge stays inert, grief unalleviated. Pressure coherent under accumulative lens; no reversal, but deepening of same stake suffices for 600-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—“decode the frequency of belonging”—is signaled early and tightens once when the waveform turns out to be emotional, not cartographic. The seven-pinion sequence is a single meaningful narrowing of options under Causal lens. No visible price is exacted from Elara; the cost is conceptual, not visceral. Escalation is present but modest; one deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. self-erasure—announced early, but pressure escalates only imagistically; no live consequence (client, law, lost income) surfaces to raise cost. The single tightening is the plaque reveal; it changes knowledge, not immediate options. Agency is reactive; tension is tonal, not tactical. Fits Accumulative model but stays at moderate voltage.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: prevent war by flawless exchange; moon-clock tightens the window to one irreversible moment. Escalation is situational—waiting, not battling—but pressure crests when the rope hisses free and the first footstep hits the causeway; misstep could still ignite reprisal. Cost is communal/ritual rather than personal, slightly softening intensity, yet the final hush registers the narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can Elias trust any guide after fatal error—tightens when fog erases pole three, the rehearsed collapse. Agency remains his: he stops fighting current, then paddles toward pole four, narrowing options under Accumulative lens. Cost is visible—he relinquishes the compass and the water, a double forfeiture. Escalation is one meaningful deepening rather than multiple turns, sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—kindle empathy—signaled early. One tightening: labyrinth fork forces echo-listening choice that forecloses return to sterile room. Cost visible: cavern tremor threatens collapse. Agency resides in Kael’s decision to ascend with baseball, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—surrender mortality to recover love—tightens once: the moment she inhales the spiral and feels fur thread through skin, options collapse from “maybe I can stay human” to “never again.” Cost is legible: the slowing heartbeat to lunar rhythm is a visceral price paid on the page. Pressure accumulates rather than reverses; no external antagonist is needed because the conflict is the internal reluctance that finally yields.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“where does lost time accumulate?”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens through iterative ink-tracings that fail to recover hours until the body itself is revealed as archive. Escalation is textural: each return of the cracked saucer gains luminescent weight, re-pricing the stakes from external search to internal acceptance; this satisfies the single intensification required at this length. Cost is legible in the final image—her palm now permanently ink-mapped—showing forfeiture of pre-maternal identity. No causal antagonist is needed; pressure is situational and accumulative, coherent under chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is signal-bold: achieve integration or remain forever heavy—unable to reach the dimensional door. Each photograph/stitch is a visible price that tightens options: one more confession = one less gram. No external coincidence; escalation is purely internal, governed by the gravity-psyche rule. The final turn (renunciation of the door) forecloses escape and crystallizes her stance with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“understand transformation”—tightens when the crimson bug forces a detour that collapses coincidence into prophecy. One meaningful deepening: realizing transformation is vibration he must join, not possess. Cost is legible: he forfeits the literal light he gathered, accepting permanent emptiness. Agency drives every beat; luck complicates, does not save.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—liberate fort without blood—signaled early; tightening occurs when powder location translates into precise charge calculation that will unlock every door, foreclosing secrecy. Agency is hers; coincidence (blackout) complicates but does not resolve. Cost legible: she forfeits sentinel purpose and risks execution. One decimal off 8.8 because the external antagonist (commandant) remains abstract; pressure is architectural rather than human in final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single dominant stake—honor mentor’s promise vs. personal erasure—tightens via pattern completion: every Fibonacci stone placed increases precognitive load until final choice crystallizes. Escalation is Accumulative/Textural: density of glowing dust/rock/eel vectors mounts to unbearable luminosity, reweighting cost. Agency is renunciation; she silences the dust, accepting partial world-drift rather than total self-loss. No coincidence resolves tension; the eels’ surfacing is earned by the completed sequence she built.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will he break silence?—is signaled in paragraph 1. Single meaningful tightening: timer click + rarefied air forces envelope opening, narrowing options to “write now or forever hold.” Cost is visible: he forfeits the observatory’s safe distance, seals the poem back into a timetable that may never travel. Agency remains his at every beat; storm complicates but does not resolve. No reversal overload; one decisive turn suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—“turn each restless moment into a question that aches for a destination”—is announced early; the duel enacts that translation, tightening knowledge rather than physical peril. Escalation is present but modest: one parry-riposte sequence that forces the opponent’s stumble; no lasting constraint or resource lost on the page. The tightening is conceptual, fitting situational lens, yet the cost remains optic, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—beauty from anarchy via forbidden verse—tightens when the molt threatens to erase the poet’s library self; the seed-poem insertion is the visible price that forecloses anonymity. Escalation is accumulative: each smuggled book, each inmate whisper, layers risk until the moonlit fracture reweights stakes for every future personality. No coincidence resolves; the final stance crystallizes under coherent pressure. Persistent constraint (tin) shapes tactics across beats, satisfying visible-cost clause.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—can art outlast severed time and lost love?—is signaled early via the stuck clock. Pressure escalates by Accumulative deepening: each flicker of compass, each rusted key, each hidden frame intensifies the cost of staying vs. leaving. The decisive tightening occurs when he threads the final reel and the silhouette of the arbor appears—this single image collapses nostalgia into forward motion. Cost is visible (bleeding fingers, silent gears), but because the airship ascent itself presents no fresh obstacle or reversal, the escalation plateaus just shy of the 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserve collective memory—tightens via spectrograph drop (17 %) and impending monsoon. One meaningful deepening: the seed is not to grow a tree but to waken the ridge, foreclosing Kael’s scientific detour. Cost is visible in the golden light that refracts his doubt back at him; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—retrieve unspoken apology—tightens when the lace pattern demands precise ritual and the compass cools only after Mara yields control. The cost is the surrender of the compass itself, a tangible forfeiture that narrows her future grief-tactics. Pressure stays coherent under causal lens; no external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether decay reveals truth only when stripped of “drama”—is signaled early and deepens when Elena realizes drama *is* the medium of visibility. The tightening occurs when she touches the butterfly, transferring scales and joining the “archive,” which forces her to confront her mother’s accusation and her own error. Though agency is internal (a shift in perception), it carries conceptual cost: she must abandon her professional orthodoxy. Coincidence (the live butterfly at the end) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the escalation is driven by her embodied attention.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—survival vs. purpose—is signaled early and deepens when Kael chooses creation over vengeance. Pressure tightens via physical wound, pursuit threat, and cryptic clues, culminating in the furnace discovery. However, escalation relies partially on coincidence (frost matching ledger) rather than protagonist-driven deduction, weakening agency under the Accumulative lens. Cost is felt conceptually (responsibility of ledger) but lacks a tangible, immediate sacrifice—e.g., abandoning safety, burning evidence—that would heighten stakes at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rectifying silence through non-auditory expression—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Mara discovers the glass resonates. Agency drives escalation: her choice to strike forks in sequence transforms passive grief into communal ritual. Cost is felt (lost voice, brother, world) but not mechanically paid; instead, it fuels the thematic shift. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, though the tightening lacks a sharper tactical trade-off (e.g., risking isolation for connection).

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—giving rest a permanent address—is signaled early and deepens when the lens reveals distress signals as cries for proper burial, not rescue. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: they choose to rebuild the lens despite knowing it will bind them eternally. The tightening occurs when dreams teach the method, narrowing options to self-sacrifice. Cost is unmistakable: transformation into a hybrid being who “could not quit,” with each soul laid to rest replaced by another drawn to the beacon.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—intergenerational survival through shared memory—is signaled early and deepens when storytelling is added to food runs. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she initiates the story-night, recruits the teacher, declares the festival. Cost is felt: anonymity maintained at personal risk, storm braved, emotional labor extracted from elders. Yet stakes remain abstractly cultural rather than viscerally immediate; no family goes hungry or is caught, so pressure lacks teeth despite sanctions backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—where unused love is stored—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s breathing method, which narrows options from passive memory to active release. The tightening occurs when the crystal pulses and reveals the hidden chamber, forcing a choice: draw sparks in or let them go. Cost is felt in the dissolution of the lover’s form and the opening of her heart-vault. Agency drives escalation, though the conflict remains internalized without external friction, slightly limiting pressure variance.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering time’s texture—is signaled early and tightens when the halo fragment traps Elara retrocognitively. Her agency drives escalation: she maps decay, aligns frequencies, and folds time, each step narrowing options. The cost is unmistakable: her body disintegrates into the garden’s history. Coincidence never resolves; even the ancestral link emerges from her own work, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—planting resilience in barren earth—is signaled early and tightens when the mechanical sentry activates, forcing improvisation. The liberator’s agency drives escalation: he decodes, redirects, and presses the final key. Cost is felt (chains remain, physical risk), but the sentry’s defeat leans slightly on poetic motion confusing programming—a near-coincidence that borders on convenience. Still, the narrowing of options (wall collapse = irreversible exposure) creates legitimate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—recovering the sound of broken trust—is signaled early and tightens via Lyra’s method: collecting absences to reverse-engineer loss. Escalation is driven by her agency; she doesn’t wait for revelation but engineers conditions for it. The forge’s reignition isn’t coincidence—it’s the culmination of accumulated memory-ash she’s curated. Cost is unmistakable: understanding trust’s silence means accepting irreparable rupture, crystallized when she releases the device into the bath.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—accessing destiny through illuminated moments—is signaled early and tightens when the floral code leads to a portrait that must be reinterpreted under moonlight. Lux’s agency drives escalation: she decodes, pries, pours, and speaks the riddle, each act narrowing options. Cost is conceptual (eternal pursuit) and felt (weight of the portrait against her heart), though physical or social price remains abstract. Coincidence (perfect moon disc) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the riddle was pre-known, preserving earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—whether grief can be held without shattering—is signaled early and deepens when Marek abandons restraint to blow the large bowl, narrowing his path from passive remembrance to active ritual. This escalation is driven entirely by his agency under accumulating pressure (leaks reopening, discovering new fractures). The cost is unmistakable: he must confront unvoiced questions (“Why didn’t you wake me?”) and accept that answers may never come. The final act—leaving the bowl—forecloses the illusion of resolution, crystallizing his stance with quiet, resonant sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—survival via self-redefinition—is signaled early and tightens when Caela’s intercom offer forces a renunciation. Mira’s agency drives escalation: decrypting, typing ‘FEARLESS’, shouting the phrase—all narrow AI’s options. Cost is visible: enduring vertigo, accepting synthetic identity, sacrificing connection to Caela. However, the child’s cast appears without prior signal, making its pivotal role feel slightly coincidental rather than fully earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—navigating endless night via a map of silence—is signaled early and deepens when the oracle reveals the map is made of pressed silences from a battlefield. The tightening occurs when the traveler learns the map is not visual but experiential (“a retelling without sound”), narrowing his options to trust or reject non-linguistic guidance. Cost is conceptual: he trades certainty for faith in absence. However, escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency; the oracle dictates terms, and the traveler merely receives.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether thought originates internally or externally—is signaled early and deepens via J-3’s discretionary exploration. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he initiates diagnostic subroutines, plucks the string, and merges timelines. Cost is unmistakable: the violin melts post-revelation, and his “ordinary rhythm of duties” resumes with irrevocable awareness. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure tightens through layered data amalgamation, not causal turns, satisfying the single meaningful deepening required.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring trust amid financial suspicion—is signaled early and tightens when Elara connects doodles to ticket timestamps. Her agency drives escalation: picking up the lens, interpreting clues, confronting the manager. But the “silent war” lacks on-page pressure; staff glances and hushed accusations are summarized, not dramatized. Cost is implied (emotional chill) but not viscerally felt until the stagehand’s tears, which arrive post-resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving the garden’s soul against mechanization—is signaled early and tightens when the rosebush wilts, forcing Silas to choose between continued deception or vulnerable truth. His agency drives escalation: revealing the marbles alters the heirs’ understanding, foreclosing the path of secrecy. Cost is unmistakable: his “waning life force” acknowledged by the luck gauge, yet he endures. The youngest heir’s question sharpens pressure, but resolution leans slightly on dialogue rather than irreversible action, preventing a full 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—validating a forbidden theory—is signaled early and escalates through Kael’s agency: she trades mechanical favors for access, then risks station-wide blackout. The tightening moment (pulling the lever) narrows options irrevocably, forcing a trade-off between scientific integrity and institutional trust. Cost is unmistakable: Dr. Chen’s alarm, imminent dismissal of data, and Kael’s solitary burden. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens, with each magnetic fluctuation deepening the central question without coincidence or soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—decoding the ghost’s wordless message—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes the choice isn’t freedom vs. bondage but completion vs. eternal limbo. Escalation is driven by her agency: each played note actively reconfigures the space and stakes, narrowing options until only the final note remains. Cost is unmistakable: dissolution of the program (the only map), loss of the muse, yet gain of autonomous inspiration. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each ripple tightening the temporal fold.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—measuring the weight of a swallowed truth—is signaled early and tightens when the smudge becomes “forgive,” forcing renunciation of quantification. Agency lies in attention: occupying margins, tracing ink, placing illustration on scale—all narrow options toward emotional reckoning. Cost is legible: the colleague’s vanished warning, years of silence, the blurred illustration. Escalation stems from protagonist-driven acts under Accumulative lens, though the fever’s role as catalyst remains slightly under-pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—weighing swallowed truth—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: Elias interprets radio calls, chooses the warmer tunnel fork, and twists the wheel. The meaningful tightening occurs when he counts the beads, linking object to moral calculus (37 souls = 37 beads), which narrows his option to silence or release. Cost is unmistakable: he accepts the ghost shift as permanent memory-mass. Escalation follows Accumulative logic—density of ghostly cues increases pressure until stance crystallizes at the looms.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving knowledge amid decay—is signaled early and tightens when the sanctuary fails to halt dissolution, forcing the burrow. The escalation is driven by the Keeper’s agency (folding/unfolding the swan), but the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral; no tool is lost, no time forfeited, no irreversible sacrifice made. Under an Accumulative lens, this suffices, yet the absence of a felt price (beyond emotional fatigue) softens the stakes’ urgency in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—connecting across memory loss via music—is signaled early and deepens during totality when melody briefly restores Eleanor’s identity. Agency is attentional: Mira’s adaptive playing narrows options to this singular celestial window. Cost is felt in the ephemeral clarity (“ninety seconds”) and Mira’s unprovable knowledge. Coincidence (eclipse timing) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the turn arises from Mira’s preparedness, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving the last human dreams—is signaled early and tightens when Elias deciphers the diaries’ pattern, foreclosing ignorance as an option. The escalation is driven by his agency (“probe their secrets with… patience”) and culminates in a Charged Poise: he catalogues the diaries knowing he has become part of their story. Cost is conceptual but undeniable—the burden of being the sole witness to a vanished inner world—and intensifies coherently under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—transposing life from minor to major—is signaled early and tightens when Mei Lin realizes she can “compose” futures. Her agency drives escalation: choosing specific fortunes imposes visible costs (erasing her name, risking exposure). Coincidence complicates (ring found in bilge) but never resolves; outcomes stem from her orchestrated instructions. The ferry delay’s seven-minute precision shows stakes made visceral through constrained time.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—Elias’s soul versus the entity’s hunger for certainty—is signaled early and tightens relentlessly. Miriam’s agency drives escalation: each layered question narrows the entity’s ontological footing until it starves. The seven-hour clock forces urgency, and the cost (Elias’s physical unraveling) alters tactics—Miriam doubles down on loops, risking dimensional instability. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens, with no coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—becoming the conductor before exhaustion overtakes her—is signaled early and tightens at dawn, a live deadline. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: mapping memories, stepping outside, blowing the note, conducting. Cost is felt (exhaustion “curling around her ankles”) and shapes tactics (she acts *before* it claims her). However, the pressure remains largely internal; external stakes lack tangible consequence beyond personal fulfillment, slightly muting the escalation’s weight under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—conquering the self—is signaled early and deepens when the tablet reveals “You are the labyrinth,” forcing a redefinition of victory. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: she chooses to retrace thoughts, press the final rune, surrender. Cost is unmistakable: dissolution into timeline, loss of defiance, scars in reality. One meaningful tightening suffices, and it forecloses escape as an option.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming connection through non-auditory music—is signaled early and deepens when backward playback offers a path. The tightening occurs at the phonograph: choosing to engage with reversed sound forecloses passive despair. Cost is visible: trembling hands, tears, the irreversible carving of groove into drum. Escalation is protagonist-driven under Accumulative lens—density of hush intensifies until silence becomes music.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—protecting truth against state secrecy—is signaled early and deepens via data anomalies. Elias’s lateral rooftop move and pigeon dispatch are agentic choices that narrow escape options and incur surveillance risk. Cost is conceptual (isolation, target status) but legible in the final lines (“ready for the next storm”). However, the antagonist pressure remains vague; the “bureau” exerts off-stage force without adaptive escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to grieve—is signaled early and tightens when the Nightshade’s scent becomes “unavoidable and total.” Her agency drives escalation: choosing UV light, then uncorking the vial. Cost is felt in “two decades of compressed shadows” released through sobs. The deepening occurs when perfume transforms from relic to living archive, forcing her to trade stoicism for vulnerability. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—discovering time’s texture through impossible ethical choices—is signaled early and deepens via the poet’s engagement with the rope’s dual potential (escape vs. preservation). Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: each knot becomes a gamble, each hum a layer uncovered. The tightening moment arrives when he rejects climbing out, choosing instead to carry the rope forward—an act that reweights the stake from discovery to embodiment. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: the “weight of each decision” persists as he walks on, forever tethered to frayed possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring voice to a silenced world—is signaled early and tightens when she chooses to ignite the fire despite emptiness. The escalation is driven by her agency: collecting wood, speaking, playing. Cost is felt in the “weight of the unfinished” and the acknowledgment that silence persists. However, the stakes remain somewhat abstract; a concrete forfeiture (e.g., sacrificing her instrument, burning a memory object) would heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can synthetic empathy bridge human voids?—is signaled early and deepens through the dealer’s precise calibration and the client’s fragile surrender. Pressure escalates texturally: static pricks → spark confirmation → shared hum → fading residue. But agency is muted; the dealer observes more than acts, and the client’s stakes lack concrete consequence beyond tears. Cost is felt (emptiness by morning) yet remains abstract, not viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—honoring the unseen—is signaled early and tightens when Lena moves from curiosity to action. The meaningful deepening occurs at the library meeting, where personal loss reframes civic duty. Yet escalation relies on convenient discovery (foreman mentions Caleb just in time) and lacks friction; no obstacle tests Lena’s resolve. Cost is implied (time, effort) but never dramatized as loss—no missed deal, social risk, or emotional toll slows her momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—belonging through understanding ancestral language of glass—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully at solstice, when Kael must act or remain forever outside. Agency drives escalation: his bold sympathy initiates contact; his shared search with the girl deepens investment; his final dedication redefines belonging. Cost is felt (“brittle and lovely as the dawn that never quite reached the crater’s floor”) and culminates in the “luminescent ache” of rootedness. Coincidence never resolves; discovery emerges from persistent, embodied effort under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving the origin of echoes before the giant’s awakening—is signaled early and tightens during the Gasp, when borrowed time becomes both tool and countdown. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to strike the bell despite dwindling seconds, narrowing options to one irreversible act. Cost is unmistakable: pendant dissolves, body becomes vessel, existence collapses into illustration. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each echo backward deepens urgency without false convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—resolving ambiguous loss through emotional mathematics—is signaled early and deepens when Vesper’s method transforms absence into a question mark etched in light. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to embed the eyes, trace patterns, and seal the mosaic. The cost is felt in her relinquishment of return for containment, crystallized in the half-open doorway. Coincidence never resolves; all pressure stems from her inventive, flawed pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—being seen by those who need you—is signaled early and tightens when the outage draws the boy inside. Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency: she chooses *where* to place the reel based on prior breadcrumbs (crayon, blanket), narrowing her own options (retreat deeper) while expanding his. Cost is felt: her visibility exists only as trace, never face-to-face, and the boy’s hunger (hollow cheeks) underscores what’s at risk. Coincidence (the outage) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the connection is earned through her methodical placement.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—control vs. surrender—is signaled early and tightens when Elena’s forceful repair fails, narrowing options to release or break. The meaningful deepening occurs when she pauses, syncing breath with rain, shifting tactics from reconstruction to observation. Cost is felt: her meticulous control is foregone, yet the nursery flourishes. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, though the storm’s role borders on convenient catalyst rather than fully dramatized opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—threshing meaning from ruin—is signaled early and deepens through the discovery of her lost portrait. The tightening occurs when she recognizes the painting: past hope confronts present haggardness, forcing a choice—to reclaim or reinterpret. Agency is clear: she initiates the exchange, then chooses to merge past and present on canvas. Cost is felt in the surrender of pure memory for layered truth, though escalation leans more on revelation than active resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—control over everyday magic—is signaled early and tightens when the pearl’s resonance draws ancient forces. Lira’s agency drives escalation: her choice to let the pearl become a vessel reweights the entire system. Cost is legible: she trades foresight for deeper awareness, a conceptual price made visible in her altered sight. The “steadily unpredictable” tide resists resolution but coheres under Accumulative pressure, though the pilgrim’s role edges toward convenient catalyst.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—giving meaning to exile’s silences—is signaled early and deepens through the archivist’s agency: she chooses when to blow the valve, interprets gaps, summons the navigator. Pressure escalates via staggered intervals that reveal increasingly intimate fragments (laughter → sobs), narrowing emotional distance until the navigator’s story emerges. Cost is visible: years of labor, emotional exposure, and the burden of being the sole listener. Coincidence (rain, return) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the archivist’s method earns the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—validating the unseen through trust over calculation—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Elara chooses luminous arrows over经纬度. Escalation is driven by her agency: interpreting glyphs, following mist, pressing the punch to the door. Cost is unmistakable: the calcified confession becomes literal architecture, and her maps are revealed as records of absence, not place. The punch’s heat and the fortress’s tremor externalize internal pressure, making stakes viscerally felt without abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—sculpting space for grief—is signaled early and tightens when Lira chooses to transcribe memories for the fisherman, foreclosing her prior isolation. Escalation occurs through accumulation: each night’s mapping deepens entanglement between whale routes, stars, and human loss. The cost is felt in the fisherman’s silent tears and Lira’s relinquished solitude. Though coincidence (finding the tile) initiates the plot, resolution stems from Lira’s persistent agency—calibrating, tracing, painting—not external forces.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—discovering what happens after goodbye—is signaled in paragraph one and deepens through spatial mutiny’s inversion of causality. Althea’s agency drives escalation: she initiates intrigue, aligns curse with seams, merges with the fragment. Each move narrows options (singular eternity vs. scattered endings) and raises conceptual cost. The solar storm isn’t coincidence—it’s a live clock forcing irreversible choice, with visible price: her immortal essence becomes conduit, trading omniscience for uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—securing asylum through forged proof—is signaled early and deepens when Sam discovers the ledger, reframing the mission from theft to negotiation. Escalation is driven by Sam’s agency: mapping rounds, executing the breach, interpreting the ledger, and offering the ink pot as counter-collateral. Cost is unmistakable—the reduction of lives to dollar amounts, the birth certificate hidden in ink, the seven lies ahead. The three-minute window tightens options, and the director’s narrowed eyes confirm stakes have crystallized into mutual recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving invented histories against erasure—is signaled early and deepens as the hum crescendos into a “pulse” that maps the town’s “silent sigh.” The protagonist’s agency lies in attention and inscription; each act forecloses passive forgetting with visible cost (swollen notepad, incandescent restraint). Escalation occurs via cadence shift: dawn’s thin veil → electric crescendo → fading hum, tightening the window for capture. Though conflict is internalized, pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration of silence as archive.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—recovering the felt reality of memory—is signaled early and tightens when the poison label proves his pre-erasure existence had lethal weight. The survivor’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to layer fragments, sit with the label, add the woman’s whisper. Cost is unmistakable—the “metal filing cabinets slamming shut on a living name”—and reweights the final act of placing the anchored box at high tide. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens without coincidence resolving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—decoding why stories end in silence—is signaled early and deepens when Elias shifts from busting to birthing myths. The tightening occurs when he realizes the riddle isn’t about silence but the space between notes, foreclosing his old identity. Cost is visible: the shell cracks, the observatory remains abandoned, he becomes a ghost. Escalation is driven by his agency (retelling, playing, listening), though the pressure remains internalized; external stakes stay minimal but thematically sufficient for this length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving carnival autonomy against privatization—is signaled early and tightens through Mira’s encoded murals, each narrowing corporate blind spots while risking exposure. The storm’s timing deepens pressure without coincidence, forcing reliance on boldest lines. Cost is visible: washed-away graffiti represents lost communication channels, and the child’s trace implies generational burden. Escalation stems from protagonist agency, though the corporation remains abstractly threatening rather than dynamically adaptive.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—photographing the last bloom before solar destruction—is signaled early and tightens when the hourglass grain falls, forcing irreversible action. Agency lies in calibrated preparation (mixing compounds, anchoring tripod) and endurance (waiting through “dawning hush”). Cost is felt in finite air, irreversible chemical reaction, and the bloom’s wilting. Escalation follows Accumulative logic: sensory density peaks at the flare, reweighting the stake’s fragility.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—decoding feedback into direction before dawn—is signaled early and tightens via the *Prospect*’s horn, which converts ambient excitement into personal deadline. Miren’s agency drives escalation: she chooses methods, tools, and timing without external interference. Cost is felt in exhaustion, precision under duress, and the irreversible expenditure of trust (silver coins). However, the conflict lacks a tangible oppositional force beyond time, slightly softening the pressure peak despite lyrical intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—discovering the true source of rivers—is signaled early and deepens when Kael realizes sources lie in absence, not presence. The meaningful tightening occurs when he shifts from reading maps to becoming one, narrowing options to a single irrevocable step onto the ice. Agency drives escalation: his interpretation of condensation, alignment of the feather, and whisper of “Nishan” all precipitate the thaw. Cost is felt in his disappearance, the outpost’s abandonment, and the irreversible activation of seven currents—but the stakes remain internalized, limiting external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring balance between standing and fallen—is signaled early and deepens when Kael’s mimicry culminates in synchronized walking that rebuilds architecture. Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist agency: his choice to strike the fork initiates convergence. Cost is unmistakable: three centuries of waiting, with another century or two ahead, rendered in the line “Kael was infinitely patient; he knew this would take another century, perhaps two.”

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—harnessing the ephemeral before oxygen runs out—is signaled immediately and tightens relentlessly. Lira’s agency drives escalation: she overrides instinct, pours the vial, programs the transmitter while drowning. The cost is unmistakable: her life exchanged for data that vanishes unless encoded in silence. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each pulse of the hush deepens the moral and physical weight of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—silencing ancestral falsehood through personal truth—is signaled early and tightens as the ticking clock (“before they find the bodies”) forces accelerated action. The meaningful deepening occurs when the lattice vibrates and the altar ignites, raising the conceptual stakes from mere confession to mythic inscription. Agency is clear: his speech actively threads the labyrinth. Cost is felt in his erasure, though the external threat (“search party”) remains abstract rather than viscerally pressuring his final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—saving the orchard through ancestral love—is signaled early and tightens when the ghost vanishes mid-instruction, forcing Elara to act on faith. The single deepening (bead’s pulse syncing with heartbeat) narrows options to one decisive act. Cost is visible: emotional toll of mourning unknown love, physical warmth draining into earth. Agency is clear—Elara chooses despite ambiguity, under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring wharf’s purpose through reverence, not fish—is signaled early and tightens when Elara commits to sewing sleepwalk maps. Agency is clear: each stitch is a micro-choice that forecloses passive mourning. Pressure escalates texturally (doubtful villagers, empty boats) but lacks a concrete setback; the path is arduous yet unimpeded. Cost is conceptual (lost livelihood) but not viscerally dramatized beyond atmospheric emptiness.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—mending severed continuity—is signaled early (“interrupted journey”) and tightens when Lina chooses to rebuild, not just excavate. Escalation is driven by her agency: purposeful wandering yields the star-map fragment, transforming passive grief into active renewal. Cost is visible in her “cautious enchantment”—balancing reverence with hope—and crystallizes in the sundial’s restoration, which forecloses resignation. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: density of bone/tree/light motifs reweights time’s meaning with each step.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—delivering truth via surface mail as rebellion—is signaled early and deepens when margin-notes reveal coordinates/date, transforming delivery into rescue. Kael’s agency drives escalation: their “carefully inventive” juxtaposition creates irreversible commitment (chalk vaporizes in rain). Cost is unmistakable: thirty-minute deadline forces irrevocable choices, and the carrier pigeon’s seasonal flight forecloses delay. Coincidence never resolves; Mira’s arrival is earned by established routine (“last carrier pigeon of the season”).

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—exposing the coup before it silences truth—is signaled early and tightens when the flame flickers, signaling time running out. Mira’s agency is clear: she stitches, interprets, folds, and departs. The deepening occurs when the tapestry glows and reveals the harvest moon line—a knowledge shift that forces action. Cost is felt in the narrowing possibilities and her isolation (“whom could she trust?”), though the physical/social price of speaking remains off-page. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via sensory intensification, not external confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—delivering an unspoken apology—is signaled early and tightens when Mira reveals healing lasts only until sunrise, forcing immediate action. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to kneel, touch the shard, and finally read aloud. Cost is felt: releasing the letters forfeits their physical presence, and the temporary nature of healing implies ongoing grief. One meaningful deepening suffices—the evocation of the sister’s face in water crystallizes emotional stakes without false resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reconciling paternal absence with professional duty—is signaled early and deepens when Kael deciphers his daughter’s cipher, transforming guilt into actionable hope. The tightening occurs when he realizes her notes aren’t accusation but invitation (“Find me in the quiet places”), narrowing his options to reconnection or continued silence. Though agency is internal (decryption as action), the cost is felt: accepting that his daughter held space for him despite his leaving. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; insight emerges from sustained pressure under anesthesia’s fluid time.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—rediscovering lost joy—is signaled early and deepens when the fresco fragment triggers visceral recognition. Lyra’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to project, paint, and publicly display, each act narrowing retreat into isolation. Cost is felt (emotional vulnerability, labor in fog) but never materializes as tangible loss—no broken gear, missed opportunity, or social risk—keeping pressure lyrical rather than visceral. Still, the deepening reweights her internal stance credibly under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—exchanging certainty for curiosity—is signaled early and deepens through Elena’s escalating reliance on sound over brush. The tightening occurs when the visitor’s question creates pressure, triggering the second awakening. Agency is clear: Elena’s choices (nickel angle, chime placement) drive each layer’s emergence. Cost is visible: loss of professional dogma, replaced by vulnerable openness. Coincidence never resolves; all shifts stem from her methodical playfulness under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—cognitive autonomy under surveillance—is signaled immediately and deepens when the auditors arrive, forcing Aris to act before being “smothered.” The meaningful tightening occurs when he plants the seed despite heightened risk, narrowing his options to active rebellion. Agency is clear: his choice to whisper the activation phrase and deploy the bees drives escalation. Cost is felt in the quadrupled tax and the exposure of the extraction team, though the resolution leans slightly on environmental luck (detectors confused by chaos) rather than purely earned tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—forging a blossom armistice—is signaled early and deepens as merfolk lay down spears, shifting from hope to fragile reality. The tightening occurs when the poet recognizes the peace is “a petal peace that could be crushed by a single storm,” raising stakes through awareness of vulnerability. Agency is consistent: her verses *cause* the softening of rage. Cost is felt—the weight of centuries, sleeplessness—but remains abstract rather than tied to a specific forfeiture that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving ephemeral memory—is signaled early and deepens through Lyra’s discovery of the song’s power, which narrows her options to a fragile, imperfect method. The escalation is driven by her agency: she chooses to hum, knowing it will expose the museum’s hollow core. Cost is legible in the “emptiness of the deserted marvels” and her own cracked heart. However, the pressure remains internal and atmospheric rather than sharpening into a concrete trade-off or irreversible loss beyond emotional toll.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—restoring trust before bureaucratic erasure—is signaled early and tightens via the 37-hour clock. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she risks her theory (writing promises), waits through silence, and stakes everything on Kess’s response. The meaningful deepening occurs when Kess reveals his fear wasn’t disagreement but terror of loss—a reversal that reweights the entire conflict. Cost is unmistakable: Elara’s sleepless vigil, Kess’s voice “cracking with disuse,” and the irreversible divergence of their paths despite reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—harmonizing sacred history and modern profit—is signaled early and tightens when the mountain trembles, forcing immediate action. Alia’s agency drives escalation: her decryption method leads to a concrete proposal that forecloses pure preservation or pure development. Cost is felt in communal doubt and geological instability, though the resolution leans optimistic; the “tremor of fear” dissipates quickly without lingering consequence, slightly softening the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving lost songs—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s increasing reliance on pigeons as carriers of heart, not just messages. The meaningful tightening occurs when he releases the final pigeon, transforming fragile trust into “something real.” Cost is felt in the vulnerability of sending pieces of himself into the unknown, though the escalation leans more on texture than causal agency.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—discovering why thresholds feel sacred—is signaled early and deepens via the revelation that distance = reverence. Pressure escalates texturally: each alignment (grain, logbook, heartbeat) tightens the ritual until crossing becomes inevitable. The protagonist’s agency drives the turn (choosing to count, to step), and the cost is conceptual—accepting that meaning requires patience, not discovery. Yet the conflict remains internalized without external resistance or irreversible loss, softening the stakes’ bite despite lyrical intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—proving cities hum with celestial resonance—is signaled early and deepens when the feather reveals the city’s encoded belonging. Pressure escalates via oxygen countdown and Orpheus’s warnings, forcing Iyana to choose between survival and transcendence. Her agency drives the climax: synchronizing breath with microbes isn’t passive observation but active attunement that reweights all prior struggle. Cost is unmistakable: she trades surface existence for luminous integration, paid in her final exhalation.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering vanished coastal paths—is signaled early and deepens into understanding their transformation. The meaningful tightening occurs when Lira realizes paths are “reclaimed by the sea’s own memory,” foreclosing her original goal (restoration) in favor of acceptance. Cost is conceptual but legible: she relinquishes control over memory’s form. Escalation is driven by her agency (descent, seed-scattering, shard retrieval), not coincidence, though the Memoria Swallow’s role edges toward convenient facilitation.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—ordering chaos to combat monotony—is signaled early and deepens as Ezra’s interventions multiply. Pressure escalates texturally: from one boy to intergenerational play, then romantic reconciliation, then redirected authority. Each success narrows his window (thirteen minutes left) and intensifies focus. The cost is visible in his constant vigilance and the emotional labor of invisible choreography. Luck complicates (Chen’s patrol) but never resolves; agency remains Ezra’s alone.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory against state erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the moonstone speck anchors her, forcing a trade-off: freedom vs. permanence. Agency is clear in her choice to tattoo, not flee. Yet escalation leans on lyric accumulation over causal pressure; the “ban” exerts no active force, making conflict feel internalized rather than tested by external consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—validating the glazier’s craft as equal to navigation—is signaled early but never tested against external resistance or internal doubt beyond abstraction. The “tightening” occurs solely in reflection: the stone toss deepens insight but alters no tactic or relationship. Pressure remains atmospheric, not consequential. Cost is implied (“before everything shifts”) but never dramatized as loss, trade-off, or irreversible commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—how to survive surviving—is signaled early and tightens when Elara realizes justification is impossible, shifting to translation. The meaningful deepening occurs when she opens the box: not to retrieve, but to release ash, accepting that pain must become language. Agency drives escalation—her choice to teach recruits “how to read fire’s language of choice” stems directly from her ridge-top insight. Cost is unmistakable: “a load to bear with purpose,” not set down.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—revitalizing dying timelines through calibrated hope—is signaled early and deepens at the equinox when despair and hope oscillate. Kael’s agency drives escalation: she arranges 47 sea glass pieces, clicks rose quartz into place, and redefines transfusion mechanics. Cost is felt in her perpetual watchfulness and the grotto’s exhaled dust—proof that even success demands endless recalibration against entropy.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to suppressed knowledge—is signaled early and tightens when Mira discovers the climatologist’s silenced formula. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to develop the negative, compile findings, and send the report. Cost is felt (“shrapnel” of legacy, inherited guilt) and visible in her physical reactions. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens via textual density rather than causal turns, satisfying requirements. No false resolution; stakes remain urgent yet focused.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—persuading mirrors to show possibilities—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the borrowed heartbeat quickens at the approach of the bells, forcing the painter to compress her work into the final notes. Agency is clear: she chooses the lullaby, weaves light, and accepts transience. Cost is conceptual (ephemeral access to hope) and felt (the heartbeat’s return to the child), though not viscerally dramatized. Escalation follows the Accumulative lens: density of color, sound, and reflection increases until the bell’s chime acts as a hard stop, foreclosing further intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—personal atonement transformed into collective peace—is signaled early and deepens when the scarred general challenges ritual as “beautiful lie.” The negotiator’s agency drives escalation: he invites touch, triggering the hum that shifts pressure from skepticism to shared vulnerability. Cost is felt in the “fragile triumph” and acknowledgment that scars endure. Yet the resolution leans slightly on magical resonance rather than purely human causality, softening the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving the Aerion’s echo—is signaled early and deepens when juxtaposed with displaced villages. Vesper’s agency drives escalation: he manufactures the drought, walks the map, releases the egg. The meaningful tightening occurs at the hollow, where preservation requires accepting complicity; cost is felt in his whispered name and imagined faces. Though the drought’s consequences are summarized rather than dramatized on-page, the moral calculus sharpens the peak choice between legacy and ethics, with conceptual cost embedded in the museum’s sanitized narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—liberating suppressed voices—is signaled early and tightens through Elara’s dance, which narrows her options (sacrificing safety for truth). Escalation is driven by her agency: each untangled thread deepens risk and reconfigures the city’s soundscape. Cost is unmistakable: hunted status, lost identity, physical exhaustion. The lullaby’s pressure compounds believably, and the final release of echoes transforms passive endurance into active revolution without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—ethical storytelling in an age of manufactured truth—is signaled early and deepened through each reversed tale, which narrows moral certainty into raw choice. Adrian’s agency drives escalation: his deliberate clumsiness, knotting fishing line, directly enables the epiphanies. Cost is unmistakable—the trucker’s abandoned rage, the dealer’s transparent greed, the woman’s destabilized self-narrative. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each puppet drop intensifying the thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—honoring interrupted ecological memory—is signaled early and tightens through Esme’s escalating acts: from cairns to knotting her own hair, each structure deepens the cost of remembrance. Agency lies in attention and renunciation; she chooses impermanence despite knowing her memory will fade. The monarch’s arrival complicates but doesn’t resolve—coincidence heightens pathos without solving loss. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure grows via cadence shifts (“interrupted cadence” reframed personally and ecologically), culminating in a visible price: her tower’s inevitable collapse, her hair tethered to extinction.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving forgotten names before they’re lost forever—is signaled early and tightens when the card’s discovery forces action. Escalation is driven by her agency: she chooses to thread the rope despite dismissing its legend, risking further failure. Cost is unmistakable: she trades the safety of exile for vulnerability to loss (“before the aurora itself fell silent”). The deepening—realizing preservation requires listening, not perfection—narrows her path: she must harvest more ice, embracing impermanence.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to uphold or transcend the decaying directive—is signaled early and tightens when the dream reveals “the directive decays by design.” Mara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to climb the walls, drop the stamp, become wilderness. Cost is felt in the bunker’s collapse and her irreversible departure. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each motif intensifies until the decisive act.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving pre-regime knowledge against political erasure—is signaled early and tightens when Kael realizes the tile encodes “devotion to the unknown mathematics.” Escalation is protagonist-driven: each night’s mapping narrows options until the tenth-day activation. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: the tile vanishes, leaving only fragile papyri. Coincidence never resolves; pressure stems from regime transition clock (“precisely between exile and coronation”).

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—teaching release without force—is signaled early and tightens when the pin reappears whole, forcing Mira to act before the shift stabilizes. Escalation is driven by Mira’s agency: she doesn’t wait but offers the pin, invoking cellular memory to bypass Elara’s intellectual resistance. Cost is unmistakable: Mira must relive another’s trauma (“let the memory play through her own cells”) and accept eternal recurrence (“prepared for the next shift”). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each reality shift stacking betrayal until the moment of grace arrives.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering a lost dream—is signaled early and tightens when Kael realizes force won’t work; he must erase boundaries. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: synchronized breathing shifts tactics, deepening pressure into resonance. Cost is unmistakable: Kael forfeits separateness, becoming part of the orchard. Under Accumulative lens, one decisive intensification (breath alignment) suffices—and it reconfigures all options.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—mending generational rupture—is signaled early and tightens when the daughter appears, forcing immediate vulnerability. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her choice to tie the ribbon (not wait for apology) crystallizes stance. Cost is felt in the daughter’s “awe and anger,” the mender’s rough hands, and the orchard’s prior decay. Coincidence (squirrel, locket discovery) complicates but resolution hinges on deliberate action.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—accessing forbidden knowledge—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Evers chooses inquiry over obedience, narrowing options to either compliance or revelation. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: his bathroom breakthrough leads to carving the shell, which triggers the tree’s offering. Cost is legible and conceptual: learning the orchard’s truth transforms tending into mourning, a burden “brightened” only by luminous fruit yet weighted with “terrible beauty.” The “simply complicated” rules create coherent pressure that crystallizes his stance—curiosity outweighs fear—with no coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—accessing the library of unlearned lessons—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes gaps are a cipher. Escalation occurs through her agency: researching omissions, copying fragments, reading aloud. The warden’s acceptance imposes cost (diary surrendered), and rescue alters tactics (healing incantation from gaps). However, the botanist’s survival lacks tangible consequence beyond gratitude; stakes feel intellectual more than visceral. Coincidence (time traveler’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve—agency remains with Elara.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost identity—is signaled early and tightens when Mira finds the twin blossom, forcing recognition over escape. Escalation is protagonist-driven: she traces the card, opens the door, enters the garden. Cost is felt: she accepts endless wandering rather than false resolution. However, pressure remains largely internal; external opposition is absent, limiting tactical adaptation. Still, under an Accumulative lens, deepening suffices—and the thematic price is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—resolving historical absence—is signaled early and tightens when Elara must choose to reconfigure the rope, risking ontological instability. Agency is clear: she actively weaves the phantom thread, and the cost (erasure of an alternate past) is visible in revised logs. Pressure escalates texturally: from seal analysis to temporal anomaly to ceremonial artifact, each layer deepens the moral weight of merging timelines. Coincidence never resolves; the door’s appearance is mysterious but the solution is earned through skill.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding quiet in the storm—is signaled immediately and deepens through two meaningful tightenings: first failure with the stone alone, then realization that cave resonance must be harmonized. Agency is clear: Lira’s humming and alignment choices drive escalation. Cost is felt conceptually (eternal recurrence of storms) and physically (exhaustion implied by “heart beat in sync”). Slight deduction because the energy beings remain abstract; their “chaotic dance” lacks tangible pressure beyond ambient noise.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rekindling meaning through the beacon—is signaled early and tightens when retrocognition reveals the flaw’s origin. Agency drives escalation: she decodes patterns, waits for conjunction, positions the shard. Cost is felt in the long silence and implied exhaustion, though not viscerally dramatized. Coincidence complicates (same star alignment across time) but resolution stems from her precise action, satisfying the Situational lens with one meaningful deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—sculpting identity from collective memory—is signaled early and deepens when the forecourt’s “undifferentiated chorus” overwhelms her. Her agency drives escalation: choosing to descend, kneel, listen, then return with new purpose. Cost is visible in physical ache (“knees aching”) and emotional recalibration (“grief subside into something quieter”). The tightening occurs when she realizes identity forms not from selecting memories but from “listening between them”—a trade-off that forecloses archival control for receptive humility.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—defying hopelessness—is signaled early and deepens when the mosaic reveals “Rise,” tightening pressure into action. Cinder’s agency drives escalation: she follows sound, deciphers tiles, ignites flame. Cost is visible (rag consumed, effort expended) but emotional stakes lack friction—no doubt, fatigue, or risk tempers her resolve. The wind’s “clink of ceramic” introduces minor complication, but resolution stems purely from her competence, not trade-offs or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—navigating familial separation during transition—is signaled early and deepens through Mara’s quiet observation rather than confrontation. The meaningful tightening occurs when she shifts from paralysis (“heavy stillness”) to offering “shared understanding,” foreclosing direct promises but affirming mutual passage. Cost is felt: her brother’s exposure mirrors stranded crabs, and his eventual acceptance carries sorrow. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (choosing tangential gaze over direct speech), though the brother’s turn leans slightly on implied off-page reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—collecting and preserving silences—is signaled early and tightens when gravity inverts, forcing a time-bound ascent. The child’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to climb, harvest, and seal the doll, narrowing options (e.g., limiting exposure). Cost is legible: claustrophobia persists despite freedom, and the father’s warning implies risk of loss. Coincidence (inversion) complicates but doesn’t resolve—her tactics earn the new silence.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—reconciling with silence—is signaled early and escalates through Kael’s deliberate manipulation of acoustic space. Her agency drives every turn: adjusting panels, reading meters, gifting the vial. Cost is unmistakable: she parts with her father’s artifact, and the diplomat surrenders lifelong avoidance. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via sensory saturation (noise spikes, crystal formations) until equilibrium is achieved—not through dialogue, but calibrated stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preparing the throne for its true heir—is signaled early and deepens via the lore keeper’s realization that ascension requires descent. Agency drives escalation: each mural peeled sharpens her understanding and narrows her role. Cost is legible (her vanishing at dawn), though the “three hours until sunrise” clock isn’t leveraged for tactical shifts—it tracks time but doesn’t force hard trade-offs beyond pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reconciling loss through breath—is signaled early and deepens when the encroaching figure triggers memory. The keeper’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to touch his scars, teach exhalation, and place the ring on the altar, each act narrowing her isolationist path. Cost is legible in the threshold’s irreversible fade and her admission that shadows are “the only breaths that remain.” Coincidence never resolves; pressure tightens through her decisions alone.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transmuting pressure into communal value—is signaled early and tightens at the bloom surge, where Kael risks everything. His unauthorized experiment narrows options: success redeems him; failure loses trust. Cost is legible (potential expulsion, moral hazard of rule-breaking) and paid in tension, not just outcome. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (reprogramming timer, turning bolt), though the glitchy messages border on coincidental catalysts—luck complicates but doesn’t resolve, keeping causality intact.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the hidden truth to sever lineage—is signaled early and deepens into a thematic pivot: truth as remembrance, not destruction. The single meaningful tightening occurs when standing waves reveal the erased heir, forcing a reconfiguration of purpose. Agency is clear: each crank turn is a deliberate step. Cost is legible in the shift from “dynasty ender” to “keeper of melody”—a foreclosed path with emotional weight, though the price lacks tangible consequence beyond internal stance.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—capturing possibility—is signaled early and tightens when Aldric discovers the program-as-map. Escalation is driven by his agency: tracing strings, pulling the final thread, speaking the vow. Cost is unmistakable: eternal binding to the orchard’s magic (“murmured allegiance”) replaces his prior solitude. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure grows via rhythmic intensification of light, sound, and geometry until reality shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving unclaimed histories—is signaled early and tightens when Marianne chooses to mail the button despite uncertainty. Escalation is driven by her agency (research, letter-writing), not coincidence, under an Accumulative lens. The cost is felt: her enduring grief is neither healed nor resolved, yet she acts. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, though a second tactical constraint (e.g., bureaucratic deadline) could have heightened pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving uncorrupted memory—is clear from line one and tightens decisively when the code turns to ash, forcing improvisation. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she reads puddles, navigates patrols, uses the key. The drone’s arrival crystallizes pressure, and her choice to swallow/scatter forecloses escape with bodily and existential cost. Coincidence complicates (ash code) but never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (“hush the prophecy”) is clear early and escalates through sonic-silence interplay. The tightening occurs when silence begins to “warp the light,” raising conceptual stakes. Yet agency is passive: the saxophonist performs a preordained rite without resistance, adaptation, or trade-off. Cost is implied (nostalgia, burden) but never concretely paid or foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—decoding prophecy before the hush ends—is signaled early and deepens via the leaf-mosaic and sonic map. Yet escalation relies on discovery, not agency: the dust drifts in, the leaf splits, the melody hums—all happen to Lira. She reacts, never wrestles with failure or trade-offs. No option is foreclosed; the path remains frictionless, undermining cost under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—mending time vs. embracing its flow—is signaled early and tightens when twelve clocks stop identically, escalating to the heart-clock’s malfunction. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she follows drafts, pries open the grate, jams the compass. The cost is unmistakable: she sacrifices her identity as a perfect mender (“leave them slightly imperfect”) to gain fluidity. Coincidence (the clocks) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her choice to improvise.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—redeeming the weight of a lost name—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes “a boy was not a gear.” The escalation is protagonist-driven: she chooses ritual over resignation, each zodiac utterance narrowing options until the coin becomes pure potential. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits the illusion of control, accepting that some absences can only be honored, not filled. The foundry’s silence after dissolution embodies the irreversible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.2)
    The dominant stake—retrieving the child’s trapped laughter to heal both her and Kael—is signaled early and escalates through Kael’s agency: adjusting the striker, angling the tooth, persisting despite pain. The meaningful deepening occurs when Kael realizes healing requires integrating brokenness, not restoring wholeness—a conceptual shift with visible cost (the spent tooth, the ache of becoming whole). Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens; each confession intensifies the gorge’s demand for truth, culminating in Kael’s own confession of being lost.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—discovering mercy’s mathematics—is signaled early and deepens into understanding mercy as lived, not calculated. Pressure escalates via UV exposure triggering increasingly painful memories, each narrowing Elena’s options until she abandons computation for embodiment. The tightening occurs when she realizes the interrogator’s formula was false—a deepening driven by her own proprioceptive data. Cost is conceptual (loss of intellectual certainty) but legible in the final stance: walking without solving.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—honoring silenced histories—is signaled early and deepens when the fragment merges with the painting, narrowing options to engagement or abandonment. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: tracing the outline, clicking the latch, reading the journal. Cost is felt in the weight of responsibility (“eternal instant”) and made visible in the map of hidden reefs—a tactical shift requiring future action. Coincidence (finding the exact canvas) is mitigated by the alchemist’s established role as guide.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—uncovering what ceilings hide—tightens when Marlon shifts from observer to active witness upon touching the mainspring, solidifying ghosts and forcing a choice: extract evidence or testify. The meaningful deepening occurs when he realizes the springs are “final wages,” transforming his mission from curiosity to moral obligation. Cost is felt in his irreversible assumption of the “weightless burden,” though escalation leans slightly on supernatural convenience (ghosts guiding him) rather than pure agency. Still, his decision to leave most springs behind forecloses easy resolution, maintaining pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving fixed meaning against negotiable reality—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Elara feeds the whisper into the press, forcing linear type to bear “something so infinitely large.” This act narrows options: stability collapses, books bleed, and the inverted library emerges. Cost is unmistakable—the bottled whisper empties, the system destabilizes—and driven entirely by Elara’s agency under an Accumulative lens. Pressure coheres without coincidence; each escalation stems from her transcription.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—truth versus curated history—is signaled early and deepens when Kael harnesses the storm to activate the shard. Agency is clear: Kael’s plan drives escalation, and the storm’s arrival forces a decisive act. Cost is felt in Kael’s lifelong sorrow and Voss’s shattered composure. The tightening—moving from dismissal to shared silence—forecloses bureaucratic denial with emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring the stolen melody before midnight—tightens via the ticking clock and rust’s physical toll. The false note from doubt narrows options, forcing a litany of truth. Agency drives escalation: his choices (not luck) mend the box. Cost is felt in flaring knuckles and retreating rust, charging the final image without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—finding “the place where explanations fail”—intensifies through Mira’s agency: she prepares, delves, and chooses stewardship over transcendence. The deepening occurs at the lagoon when petrichor reveals layered time, narrowing options to a single refusal. Cost is unmistakable: emptied vials, abandoned expedition path, and lifelong guardianship. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with each sensory detail tightening the thematic vise.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reimagining the archway before the storm erases it—is signaled early and deepens when GPS fails, forcing reliance on ancestral knowledge. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: Mara chooses to trust the slide’s projection, then carves and deposits her token. Cost is conceptual (abandoning modern tools) and emotional (accepting she is one node in a continuum). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each sensory and symbolic layer tightens meaning without false resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding why night-blooming flowers open—is signaled early and deepens through Sable’s journey. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to travel, studies the glass, and returns to paint. The tightening occurs at dawn when hidden layers reveal both jasmine and her own likeness, forcing a conceptual shift. Cost is legible in her transformed practice and quiet solitude, though the price remains emotional rather than material or relational, slightly limiting pressure intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—truth versus peace—is signaled early and deepens when Elara’s retro-cognition forces confrontation with Maria’s memories. The parley is a meaningful tightening: arranging debris forecloses silence, compels government accountability. Cost is felt (lost sleep, inherited trauma) but could be more viscerally tied to tactical shifts. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Causal lens, though the Under-Minister’s pivot leans slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether to restore or reimagine—is signaled early and tightens when Kael chooses not to crack the bottle but to use it as catalyst. This deepening forces a trade-off: personal closure vs. collective future, with visible cost in his enduring solitude until settlers arrive. Pressure escalates via internal agency (his mental weaving, sand sketches), not coincidence. The stakes remain viscerally felt through concrete actions (crafting lanterns from maps), though the absence of external opposition slightly softens tactical urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving emotional truth without unleashing unintended consequence—is signaled early and deepens when Elias’s own voice becomes the uncontrolled variable. The tightening occurs at the phonograph: his ritual utterance carves a live prophecy, foreclosing archival neutrality. Agency is clear: he chooses immersion, winding, sealing. Cost is felt in the “velvet disquiet” and the burden of carrying a living archive. Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist action under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving the vortex inheritance against entropic collapse—is signaled early and deepens when the egg hatches, tightening the timeline. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she actively decreases entropy via seeds and starlight, not passive waiting. Cost is felt in the fragility of borrowed time and the ever-present threat of total ice. However, opposition remains abstract (entropy itself), slightly muting interpersonal or physical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—issuing a credible warning—is signaled early and tightens at zero hour, where acting too soon or late carries moral and communal cost. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she checks instruments, observes the cloud gap, retests the rope. The stall in pressure drop deepens the conflict, forcing a trade-off between protocol and perception. Cost is unmistakable: her reputation hinges on silence, and villagers’ peace depends on her restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—finding meaning in abandonment—is signaled early and deepens when Sola reinterprets stillness as “fertile ground.” The tightening occurs when she chooses to preserve the glass, shifting from passive custodian to active cultivator. Cost is conceptual (accepting loneliness as communion) and visible in the station’s rebirth, though no tangible sacrifice (time, tool, safety) is dramatized. Agency is sustained through attention and ritual, fitting the Accumulative lens, but escalation lacks a moment where pressure forces a painful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving unspoken words—is signaled early and tightens when Elara learns bees carry souls, making hive restoration urgent. The deepening (covenant broken by drought) raises conceptual cost: silence equals spiritual death. Agency is limited but present—her vow, her placement of the box. However, escalation leans on revelation over action; the ghost’s plea arrives without resistance or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering Harrison’s fractured message—is signaled early and tightens when Elara embeds listings, risking obscurity for connection. The deepening occurs at the reply: “sandpapered silk” forces her into the Recalibration moment, foreclosing linear time. Cost is felt in her relinquished ledger-bound existence, though escalation leans slightly on coincidence (the perfect reply). Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with one meaningful narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—discovering beauty in the incomplete—is signaled early and deepens through the feather and kite motifs. The snapped string provides a meaningful tightening that reweights the poet’s understanding, yet this complication arrives via coincidence (off-stage event) and isn’t driven by protagonist agency. Cost is conceptual (acceptance of fragmentation) and felt in the “burnished hush,” but no tangible loss or trade-off alters tactics. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, though escalation leans more on resonance than rising consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—completing the copper network before death—is signaled early and tightens relentlessly. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses bilingual architecture over violence, works through fever, and accepts bodily betrayal. Cost is unmistakable: each spool marks borrowed time; hands weaken but pace holds. The diary’s marginalia deepens stakes by reframing death as metabolizable input, not endpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—understanding the chemistry of alien homecoming—is signaled early and deepens when pheromone data reveals memory-binding polymers. The tightening occurs at the summit: knowledge shifts from hypothesis to testable proof, foreclosing blind faith or institutional compliance. Agency is intellectual but tangible (recording data, preparing publication). Cost is conceptual—her exile may persist—but could be more viscerally felt; the rain’s drumbeat substitutes for personal sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming life from war-scarred earth—is signaled early and deepens when the coachman discovers hidden springs via bird guidance. Pressure escalates texturally: silence → chant → scattering → digging → planting → sprouting. Agency drives every turn; coincidence (gull’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve—he interprets its call through earned skill. Cost is felt: parched earth resists, requiring voice, memory, and physical labor to soften.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—translating distance into closeness—is signaled early and deepens through Wick’s journey. Escalation is driven by his agency: he interprets the riddle, follows scent-memory, and places the leaf in the hatch. The cost is unmistakable: he abandons salvage for emotional archaeology, trading survival pragmatism for vulnerable remembrance. The tightening occurs when he realizes the vault isn’t about recovery but reception—listening becomes his new act of devotion.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving meaning through memory vs. embracing unknown purpose—is signaled early and tightens when the anomalous flicker disrupts ritual stasis. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: interpreting the light, aligning the compass, stepping into void. Cost is felt (abandoning the only home) and shapes tactics (using sketchbook as map). Coincidence introduces the flicker but does not resolve; the choice to act is wholly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—amending the spire before the sky tears—is signaled early and tightens when Kaelen confronts the cracked heart. His agency drives escalation: selecting chess pieces per his master’s teaching directly triggers the hidden door. Cost is felt in the weight of the heart (“burden and gift”) and the irreversible act of leaving secrets behind. Coincidence never resolves; all pressure stems from Kaelen’s choices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring forgotten pawns—is signaled early and tightens when Kael carves replacements, trading anonymity for visible rebellion. Agency drives escalation: each letter-step risks exposure, culminating in panel opening. Cost is felt: Kael’s permanent anchoring to the gallery forecloses nomadic freedom. Coincidence avoided; penumbra’s mission frames pressure without resolving it.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding home’s shape—is signaled early and deepens when Mira learns it requires sacrificing the fragile stability of the “substituted nights.” The tightening occurs at the alcove: she must choose between safety and truth. Her agency drives escalation—she initiates the tracing, presses the final glyph—and the cost (lost balance, vanished stone) is immediate and irreversible. The thunder’s transformation from threat to heartbeat sharpens the moral calculus: awakening language demands upheaval. No coincidence resolves conflict; every turn stems from Mira’s choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—redemption through responsible teaching—is signaled early and deepens when the hidden verse demands a “king’s sacrifice,” echoing his past failure. The tutor’s agency drives escalation: his winnowing of threads narrows possibilities until the core is reached. Cost is unmistakable: he must relive his trauma to act, and the resolution carries opportunity cost (he remains burdened, not absolved). Coincidence is avoided; the storm’s rhythm syncs with his pulse but doesn’t resolve the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether forgiveness requires sacrifice—is signaled early and deepens when Kael’s poems seed doubt. His agency drives escalation: poetry sessions → painted verses → shattering glass. The tightening forecloses the ritual path with visible cost (Elders halted, community discourse replacing sacrifice). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves conflict—change arises from Kael’s persistent, costly defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—transmuting forgotten memory into luminous meaning—is signaled early and tightens with each breath lost. Protagonist agency drives escalation: aligning scarab to craters forces trade-offs between time and fidelity. Cost escalates visibly (cracked beam, mercury spill, failing exchanger) and culminates in inhalation of poison. The sea’s hostility isn’t coincidental; it’s coherent pressure that crystallizes Elara’s stance: repair as remembrance, even unto dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—fulfilling a hidden promise to reconcile with lost love through art—is signaled early and deepens in the cave. The “wrong turn” complicates but doesn’t resolve; Elias’s agency drives the climax. Cost is felt in the seashell’s abandonment and the irreversible completion of a deferred act. Yet the escalation lacks a true narrowing of options; the oasis appears conveniently, reducing tension despite lyrical beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—proving whispers travel farther than shouts—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s silent climb and Marcus’s halted shout. Pressure tightens once: the beam’s purification transforms abstract intent into visceral vibration that shakes loose Marcus’s forgotten feeling. Cost is unmistakable: his voice, unused for tenderness, is now fragile, raw—a price paid for years of noise. Agency lies in Elara’s choice to transmit memory, not demand change.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—retrieving his sister before the full moon—is signaled early and tightens through each midnight call, culminating in the “Now” command that forces activation. Agency is clear: Kael builds, interprets, and activates; the moon’s waxing isn’t coincidence but a constraint shaping tactics. Cost is felt in the resonator’s strain and his tears, though the escalation lacks a tangible forfeiture (e.g., lost time, broken tool)—a minor gap preventing 9.0+. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens with one decisive deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—protecting villagers while managing truth’s contagion—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the narrator chooses exposure over concealment. The deepening occurs at dawn: instead of occluding, they unleash truth, risking destruction but enabling connection. Cost is felt in the irreversible loss of secrecy and the burden of ongoing calibration. Agency drives escalation: each attempt (burial, textbook research, binding) stems from prior failure, culminating in a choice that redefines safety not as absence of truth but as collective capacity to hold it.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—being seen in isolation—is signaled early and deepens when Cornelius realizes the stranger’s wave was a question, not farewell. The meaningful tightening occurs when he shifts from reading memory to answering it: placing the boutonniere in a jar, then sending light across the water as witness. Cost is felt (emotional weight of borrowed memory) but could be more viscerally concrete—a missed meal, a trembling hand beyond opening the letter. Agency drives escalation: his choice to “observe gaps” yields the pivotal insight.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—honoring Clara’s promise by confronting the doorway of decisions—is signaled early and tightens as the creek rises, narrowing Merrick’s window to act. His agency drives escalation: he locks the shop, follows ants, squeezes through the fissure. The cost is crystallized when the doorway shows him the life refused—Clara’s fire, fieldwork—and the price of his solitude becomes undeniable. The rising water creates a live clock that forces the final step before cresting.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—unraveling the dream’s mystery—is signaled early and deepens into existential surrender. The queen’s agency drives escalation: she ignores warnings, climbs despite peril, commands the grotto, and ultimately chooses erasure. Cost is unmistakable: “surrendering her throne, her life, her name.” The final trade-off—hollow crown for eternal watch—crystallizes under coherent pressure, with the mountain’s voice delivering not resolution but reconfiguration of identity itself.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—revaluing the past to inhabit presence—is signaled early and deepens when the alchemist shifts the shell’s significance from memory-holder to catalyst. Her agency drives escalation: selecting indigo pigment, chanting, sparking the sun-bloom. Cost is legible in the “weight” settling into her bones—a conceptual price for carrying resolve. Yet pressure remains abstract; no tangible option is foreclosed (e.g., failed ritual, broken shell), relying on lyrical weight over situational consequence under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reconciling fractured time through narrative—tightens decisively when “feral nostalgia” transforms from passive haunting to active demand: “not to devour but to demand I write its true ending.” This deepening forces the protagonist’s agency: he carves words mid-air, reconfiguring his relationship to past selves. Cost is unmistakable—the surrender of chronological selfhood (“I descended not as a man but as a narrative”)—and paid through the visible trade-off of human coherence for mythic continuity. Escalation is driven entirely by internal pressure under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming meaning after sensory loss—is signaled early and deepens when Elena realizes she seeks “more than a repaired clock.” The tightening occurs when she admits distrust of her senses; Marcus’s insight forces her to confront control vs. release. Cost is unmistakable: she must relinquish the fantasy of restoration. Agency drives escalation—her choice to “read between lines of existence” crystallizes stance under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—turning scars into stories—is signaled early and deepens when the ink crystallizes under grief, forcing Kaelin to confront the physical manifestation of her pain. Her agency is clear: she chooses to whisper to the wind, shed a tear, and complete the rune despite fracture. The cost is felt—the dissolution of her old self—and the storm’s release mirrors her internal shift. While escalation is subtle (fitting the Accumulative lens), the single meaningful tightening—ink failing, then succeeding via tear—narrows her path to ritual surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—reconnecting before the orchard’s erasure—is signaled early and deepens when the perfume’s release becomes the only viable conduit for apology. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she chooses metaphor over plain speech, then truth over rehearsed lines. The cost is felt in Linden’s nailed-shut grief and the orchard’s irreversible hush. Though the stakes are intimate, they’re viscerally rendered; however, the “induced currents” device borders on deus ex machina, slightly undercutting pressure coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—unifying truths before dissolution—is signaled early and deepens when the spiral arbitration demands surrender over control. The witness’s agency drives escalation: her choice to “journey inward while walking out” alters tactics, narrowing options until only embodiment remains. Cost is legible in the dictionary’s physical transformation and her shift from observer to origin. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding time’s true measure—is signaled early and tightens through Elias’s method of counting backwards, which narrows his perception into “the space between heartbeats.” The escalation is driven by his agency: turning the key, reversing the hands, aligning at zero. Cost is conceptual but legible: he trades forward momentum for backward depth, surrendering linear time for existential stillness. Coincidence plays no role; pressure accumulates texturally and culminates in Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—defining intrusion—is signaled by the first sentence and deepens when Kael chooses permeability over exclusion. The escalation is driven by Kael’s agency: deactivating alarms, walking barriers, reprogramming systems. Cost is legible in the quiet wildfire metaphor and the irreversible loss of old security paradigms. Coincidence never resolves; the woman’s ritual is consistent, not convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reconciling randomness with certainty—is signaled early and deepens via Lila’s traversal of subway lines, which narrows her epistemological options from skepticism to synthesis. The tightening occurs when she overlays scrawls onto the lantern, transforming passive grief into active interpretation. Cost is felt in her acceptance of ambiguity (“lucid contradictions were not puzzles to be solved”), though escalation relies more on discovery than agonizing choice, slightly muting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—breaking free from emotional estrangement—is signaled early and tightens through the loop’s recurrence, which forces Mira to choose between detachment and engagement. Each call deepens her burden but also forges connection, culminating in her decision to destroy the disc. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she investigates the source, touches the disc, then snaps it free. Cost is unmistakable—physical injury and the loss of the booth—but the resolution feels slightly eased by the loop’s magical mechanics rather than purely earned through psychological struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—regenerating a broken covenant—is signaled early and deepens through the archivist’s twilight pilgrimage. Pressure escalates via sensory accumulation (cooling air, lapping water, scent of rain), not protagonist-driven agency; she reacts more than acts. The “steep hillside” and “proximate causes” frame effort, but no live option is foreclosed—she could turn back at any moment without consequence. Cost is conceptual (time, emotion) but not dramatized as a tangible loss altering future tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—curing loneliness through reciprocal storytelling—is signaled early and tightens when Mira realizes the rock can “awaken collective hope.” The meaningful deepening occurs when she shifts from collecting stories to seeding one, anchoring myth in genuine connection. Agency drives escalation: her choice to stage the ritual in the clock tower forecloses anonymity. Cost is felt—her departure—but could be sharper; the price of catalyzing hope remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—locating emotional geography through physical quest—is signaled early and deepens when the stillpoint reveals inward direction. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: Elara actively dowses, traces notes, and kneels to absorb resonance. Cost is legible in the ring’s fulfilled purpose and her acceptance of unspoken grief. However, the forest’s cooperation borders on convenience; greater resistance would heighten pressure without undermining the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—editing history to extract meaning—is signaled early and deepens as the pen’s reservoir dwindles, forcing Kael to choose which errors to keep. Agency is clear: each edit is a deliberate trade-off with ripple effects (altered conversations, shifted paths). Escalation occurs via protagonist-driven tightening: he moves from technical fixes (antenna alignment) to emotional ones (hydroponic failure), culminating in acceptance when ink runs dry. Coincidence never resolves; cost is felt in lost timelines and irrevocable omissions.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—being forgotten—tightens when the advisor reframes silence as ownership, not loss. Elias’s agency emerges in his choice to sign back, disrupting stasis. Cost is visible: he abandons hope of being remembered by the living, embracing an audience of absence. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no false resolutions or coincidences undercut the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—rescuing truth from erasure—tightens when the tapestry fragment reveals Kael’s complicity, forcing a shift from destruction to creation. Agency drives escalation: Kael chooses charcoal over fire, mines pigments, deciphers Fibonacci ciphers. Cost is felt in weeks of labor by torchlight and fungi-glow, culminating in the weeping portrait. Coincidence (rockslide revealing doors) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Kael’s intuition and logic do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—transcending entangled memory into shared consciousness—is signaled early and tightens when the drone approaches, forcing Kael to accelerate his composition. Agency is clear: he chooses transformation over preservation, drumming despite bleeding hands. Cost is unmistakable: bodily dissolution, recorded as “loss of valuable data.” Escalation is driven by his deliberate strikes, not coincidence, under an Accumulative lens where pattern density reweights the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (“prove whispers carry further”) is signaled early and tightens when the storm hits—time and electromagnetic silence become live constraints. Marek’s agency drives escalation: he chooses specific routes, strikes the key, sprints through darkness. Cost is unmistakable: physical exertion, risk of failure, and the smuggler’s threatened theft of the northern corridor. The smuggler’s challenge forces a trade-off between secrecy and intervention, crystallized when Marek whispers instead of shouting.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—alleviating the child’s fear through silent empathy—is signaled early and deepens as the child steps forward. The tightening occurs when the child borrows the mirror, shifting from passive observer to active participant. Cost is conceptual (the guardian’s eternal solitude) but not viscerally felt; escalation relies on lyric accumulation rather than protagonist-driven pressure. Still, the child’s transformation forecloses a path of fear, satisfying Track A’s single meaningful deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—intellectual freedom vs. authoritarian rigidity—is signaled early and deepens when window displays move from classroom to citywide. Mr. Hartwin’s agency drives escalation: he chooses timing (“the hush where past meets prophecy”), method (chess puzzles), and location (grotto). Cost is felt in the authorities’ bafflement and the students’ widened eyes—social risk without violence. No false resolutions; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens with one meaningful cadence shift at the town-square puzzle.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—freedom through self-embrace—is signaled early and deepens when the whale’s call compels Mira to detach the rope, foreclosing her dock life. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens: each tactile interaction with the scrimshaw or sea tightens pressure toward dance. Cost is felt (“fortress of duty” abandoned) though not materially dramatized beyond emotional shift. Coincidence (whale call) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the choice to follow remains hers.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—cultivating lightness in grief under oppression—is signaled early and tightens when the stray dog appears, forcing a moral trade-off (compassion vs. survival). The performer’s agency drives escalation: choosing to whittle, narrate, then report. Cost is unmistakable: betrayal of the dog, erosion of self. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; coincidence (dog’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transcending imposed boundaries—is signaled early and deepens when the poet realizes the “tremor of certainty” is continuous, not momentary. Agency manifests through repeated acts of paraphrasing and touching, each narrowing the gap between self and world. Cost is felt: the ban’s legacy lingers as a “scar,” and dissolution demands surrender of discrete identity. Escalation is driven by protagonist choice under an Accumulative lens, though the absence of external opposition slightly softens pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—awakening dormant beauty through exchange—is signaled early and deepens via Elara’s trade proposal. Pressure escalates when the reed tongue’s hum animates the plants, forcing Dorian to confront his perfectionism. His nod isn’t passive; it’s a renunciation of control with visible cost (accepting irregular forms). The single tightening—Dorian choosing flawed grace over technical precision—is sufficient and earned under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—can imperfect sound heal?—tightens when Mara challenges Kaelen’s “wasted” time, forcing a deliberate flaw (off-center lens) that reveals hidden harmonics. Agency drives escalation: Kaelen’s choice to introduce error deepens knowledge under Accumulative lens. Cost is visible in rejected data and the emotional risk of trusting “static.” Pressure coheres without coincidence; every turn stems from Kaelen’s method.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—transforming manufactured consolation into genuine hope—is signaled early and tightens when Elara shifts from hollow lockets to dissolving origami. Escalation is driven by her agency: each folded figure is a tactical choice under the constraint of “genuinely artificial” materials. Cost is unmistakable: she abandons commerce, accepts her own grief as a white dwarf, and entrusts her method to strangers. The star’s pulse matching her messages is not coincidence but earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—mapping cultural collapse to enable regrowth—is signaled early and tightens when the architect arrives trembling. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she multiplies paths, rotates the spread, extends the tape. Cost is visible in his emaciated frame and her ink-stained endurance. The “seven crumbling towers” deepening forces reconfiguration from prediction to reverse engineering, narrowing options to collective rebuilding.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—purifying corrupted nostalgia—is signaled early and tightens when Lyra must avoid patterns to prevent mental entrapment. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses irregular breathing and drifting thoughts, which directly alter the atoms’ glow. Cost is felt (“anguished joy intensifies”) and visible in the pagoda’s spin and fading light, though the “poison of patterns” could be dramatized more concretely mid-beat.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving the shape of hope—is signaled early and tightens when the shadow feeds on that hope. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: her analysis of footage reveals the threat, and her use of the stone transforms it. Cost is unmistakable (“piece of oneself” lost), though the tightening occurs more through accumulation than causal narrowing. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the stone’s power is foreshadowed, not convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reconciling self-respect with compassion—is signaled early and tightens through Elara’s deliberate acts: burning lies, tending wounds, drafting truth. The arrival of the officer escalates pressure without coincidence; her steady hands show agency under duress. Cost is felt in her stomach tightening yet choosing honesty. One meaningful deepening suffices: her realization that reconstruction begins with honest hands, not grand gestures.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—learning to read scars—is signaled early and deepens when the fern’s warning introduces risk (“whispered warnings”), narrowing options to trust or retreat. Elara’s agency drives escalation: examining coffee rings leads to pulling the tapestry, which opens the tunnel, culminating in her choice to retrieve the pebble. Cost is felt in the meteor hush’s weight and the irreversible shift from seeking closure to embodying it. Though coincidence (sedation-induced plant telepathy) complicates, it doesn’t resolve—the fern merely points; Elara acts.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—locating where unused love is stored—is signaled early and intensifies under deadline pressure (demolition in three days). Mira’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to incubate, suspends the strip, keeps vigil—all narrowing options toward irreversible transfer. The deepening comes when she realizes the theater itself is the vault, forcing her to become its living successor. Cost is felt in her silence, tears, and the hushed thunder that “stops the heart”—a visceral price for revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is signaled early but never tested through concrete opposition or escalating pressure. The “wall of blank pages” is internal and static; the journey north introduces no obstacles, only atmospheric reinforcement. The deepening occurs via accumulated imagery, not protagonist-driven tightening. Under the Accumulative lens, this suffices for moderate escalation, but agency is passive: she rests, dreams, wakes changed—luck or grace, not choice, resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving possibility against null-zones—is signaled early and escalates through the guard’s agency: braiding probabilities, singing the charm, planting the archive. Each action narrows options (voice cracks, body dissolves) while deepening the cost. The null-zone’s expansion forces a trade-off: sacrifice self to seed new potential. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, culminating in a decisive reconfiguration where silence becomes fertile ground.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming untamed cognition—is signaled early and tightens when she shifts from seeking answers to collecting questions. Agency drives escalation: learning tree-whispers as syntax leads to unraveling the paradox, culminating in intentional grove-building. Cost is felt in lost identity (“been a logician once”) and visible in irreversible translocations. Under Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via accumulating miracles that demand surrender to wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding the dog and inner courage—is signaled early and deepens via the ferry crossing, which reframes the search as internal. Pressure escalates texturally: silence → lullaby → fireflies → reunion. The “indirect route” motif implies thematic cost, but no tangible sacrifice (time, safety, resource) alters Lin’s tactics. Luck (dog waiting unharmed) slightly undercuts earned resolution, though emotional cost remains palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—safety as communal harmony—is signaled early and tightens when Elara finds the new rust stain. Her agency drives escalation: choosing to report redefines her path at visible cost (permanent outsider status). The moral calculus—cowardice vs. vigilance—is sharpened by the boy’s lost future and her spinal injury. Pressure coheres under a Causal lens: each discovery narrows options until only action or silence remains, and she chooses the former with full awareness of lifelong consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—unmasking the pretender—is signaled early and deepens through Sylvar’s cryptic inscriptions, which narrow Vael’s options by weaponizing his own ambition. The tightening occurs when Vael deciphers the riddle, unknowingly fraying his glamour—a reversal driven by protagonist agency. Cost is legible: Vael’s exposed deceit, the spent ink pellets, the library’s collapse. Escalation follows the Accumulative lens via textual density, not causal chain, but remains coherent and pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding why some paths disappear—is signaled early and deepens through Lina’s archival labor, culminating in the revelation that old models assumed endless emissions. This tightening forecloses the illusion of stable futures and forces Lina into Earned Stasis: she cannot stop bleaching but can witness and remember. Cost is legible in the “periodically eternal” climb of the tide gauge and the white shroud of dead coral—a world permanently altered. Though escalation is subtle, it’s driven by protagonist agency (assembling fragments), not coincidence, satisfying the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—breaking the lull of rebellion through non-tactical means—is signaled early and deepens when Kai discovers the hum-beacon syncopation. Her agency drives escalation: she moves, kneels, sings. Cost is felt in the rebels’ stirred silence and occupiers’ unease, though physical stakes remain abstract. The tightening forecloses passive waiting, replacing it with resonant action. Coincidence never resolves; the stone circle’s mechanics are established before activation.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to obey the Covenant or evolve tradition—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Mara chooses to unseal the amber against generations of dogma. The escalation is driven by her agency: finding the kite, decoding its script, acting at dawn. Cost is unmistakable: she risks her standing, endures physical pain, and shatters communal belief. The mountain’s past eruption isn’t coincidence—it’s the crucible that makes her rebellion necessary, not convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving pre-trauma intimacy without denying catastrophe—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes stillness isn’t retreat but “diving into fullness.” Escalation occurs through his agency: choosing to press palm to bark, hold photo to tree, sit among ferns. Cost is felt in the curator’s warning about the keeper who fled silence—Elias stays, accepting that healing means holding “both shadow and smile in the same breath.”

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to preserve fragmented possibilities or commit to one diminished truth—tightens when the walls close in, forcing Elara to act or dissolve. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to untangle, reweave, and descend, each act narrowing options while deepening thematic pressure. The cost is legible in the sealed box now carved with a weeping eye and in her un-trembling but still-stained hands—proof that wholeness includes failure.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering time’s slowness—is signaled early and tightened when the drone disappears into ink, raising the cost from theoretical curiosity to visceral loss. Kael’s agency drives escalation: he spills ink deliberately, observes, and resolves to repeat. The deepening (linking ink’s ephemerality to temporal distortion) narrows his path—he must chase fleeting patterns, accepting perpetual uncertainty. Cost is legible: the drone is gone, and answers remain out of reach.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. institutional control—is signaled early and deepens when the letter reveals the Purge was staged. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she repurposes dormant infrastructure, turning archival duty into subversion. The cost is immediate (betrayal of oath) and systemic (collapse of the Council). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; each revelation tightens the moral vise until ignition becomes inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving peace in a violent world—is signaled early and deepens through the stranger’s arrival and the dust storm. Lyra’s agency lies in renunciation (sheathing the blade) and hospitality, which carry risk. Cost is felt (emotional exposure, resource strain), though the external threat remains abstract. Escalation is textural rather than causal, fitting the lens, but lacks a sharper tactical trade-off beyond moral consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—catching Echo’s echo—is signaled early and deepens into a moral calculus: possession versus witness. Avery’s agency drives escalation: her voiced silence summons Echo, her lullaby calms divine sadness, her withdrawal releases the goddess. Cost is unmistakable—the spike retains “residual grief,” her path straightens only after release—and the tightening (from zigzag to straight line) reweights her identity. Coincidence (sleepwalking stars) complicates but never resolves; every turn stems from Avery’s choices.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. institutional silence—is signaled early and tightens via Mara’s call and the kill memo. Victoria’s agency drives escalation: she chooses intervention over orbiting regret. The “proof by contradiction” method crystallizes pressure into a single, high-cost act. Cost is unmistakable: inheriting silence becomes actively rejecting it, risking empire and identity. One meaningful deepening suffices—and here it’s decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—hushing guilt’s dissonance—is signaled early and tightens when Elara realizes the firmware grieves *through* the children she marked. Her agency drives escalation: choosing to transcribe the insect’s song reweights all prior tethers. Cost is unmistakable: each translated word dims a star, untethering a child but erasing her own celestial legacy. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with meteor hush as live clock narrowing her window.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—deciphering whispers to heal communal trauma—is signaled early and tightens at the seventh spiral, where breaking the circle forces remembrance before forgetting. Agency is clear: the artist’s interjection alters the grotto’s logic, with cost felt in her sobered demeanor and the tile’s dissolution. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; each stroke deepens the hush until the wind-gasp climax. No coincidence resolves conflict—it’s earned through pattern literacy.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—honoring aberrant mercy through remembrance—is signaled early but remains largely conceptual; escalation occurs texturally rather than through narrowing options or deepening knowledge. Arin’s decision to rename is a crystallization, yet no live alternative is foreclosed with visible price. The “stubborn warmth” versus “brittle shell” tension lacks tactical consequence; pressure accumulates atmospherically but doesn’t force a trade-off that alters his capacity to act.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—luring possibility from despair—is signaled early and deepens when the ghost witnesses the actress’s rehearsal. The meaningful tightening occurs when he flicks the tarot coin, intertwining timelines to offer her his echo; this act forecloses his solitary longing. Cost is felt: his purpose is fulfilled, implying release or dissolution (“translucent smile reflecting… his purpose fulfilled”). Escalation is driven by the ghost’s agency under an Accumulative lens, though the actress’s role remains reactive, slightly softening the pressure’s reciprocity.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—illuminating hidden neural pathways to prevent cognitive collapse—is signaled early and tightens when the geode hums, forcing Lina to choose between skepticism and somatic experimentation. The meaningful deepening occurs when she maps feedback loops through her own nerves, narrowing options to a single diagnostic method. Cost is felt (thumb’s hot pinpoint) but not fully consequential; no irreversible loss raises tension beyond intellectual risk. Agency drives escalation, satisfying lens requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—giving voice to silence—is signaled early and deepens when the fossil pulses with “ancient grief,” transforming abstract purpose into tangible emotional cartography. Lira’s agency drives escalation: her sensor use, touch, and song activate the cave’s latent memories. The cost is conceptual but legible: she surrenders individual identity to become a conduit, foreclosing isolation. However, the pressure remains atmospheric rather than urgent; no live option is truly foreclosed until the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—deciphering fragmented prophecy to restore lost dialogue between humanity and history—tightens decisively when the burial coat button forces confrontation with mortality and legacy. Protagonist agency drives escalation: decades of cataloging culminate in a voluntary surrender of control, trading archival authority for open access. Cost is unmistakable: her life’s work becomes public domain, risking dilution but enabling renewal. The lens-appropriate deepening (Accumulative/Textural) occurs via phonetic shard assembly, where each button placement narrows interpretive possibilities until only collective listening remains viable.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—redemption through restitution—is signaled early and tightens when the courier demands proof. Kael’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to dig, reconstruct, and surrender coordinates. The meaningful deepening occurs when Elena’s survival reframes his past failure as loyalty, not treason. Cost is felt in the five years of exile and the vulnerability of exposing buried secrets—stakes never abstract, always viscerally tied to object and action.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—fulfilling a palimpsest promise—is signaled early and escalates via the slowing gutter ticks, which narrow Silas’s window for action. His agency lies in endurance: choosing to remain “closely attentive” while life layers complications. The tightening occurs when hooves vibrate in fog—a disturbance he feels before hearing—forcing him to stand, needle clenched. Cost is visible in their separate lives (her widowhood, his landscape-absorption), and the final deepening—aligning needles—forecloses all other paths. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding how love structures resistance to entropy—is signaled early and deepens when Kai realizes the oasis is “phototropic to kindness.” The meaningful tightening occurs at the thrum’s discovery, which shifts her from observer to participant. Though agency is contemplative rather than confrontational, her final act (nesting the glass in a new bowl) forecloses hoarding knowledge and incurs the cost of relinquishment. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—translating grief into generative light—is signaled early and deepens when the rose dies. Maya’s agency drives escalation: she chooses moonflowers over replacement roses, horizontal over vertical, invitation over entry. Cost is legible: the fire escape “waited, empty,” yet her purpose “outgrew its iron rails.” Under Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via rhythmic repetition (“rhythm of oars”) that culminates in decisive planting—no coincidence, only earned stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—translating isolation into meaningful connection with the extinct—is signaled early and deepens when the sundial reveals time as a web. Pressure escalates through tactile engagement (touching the dial, sitting among stones), culminating in neural rewiring and multi-species perception. Cost is conceptual but legible: risking self-fracture to hold multiple truths. Agency drives escalation; coincidence plays no role. One tightening suffices, though a sharper trade-off would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—Lira’s need to “find the thread”—is signaled early and deepens via the nest discovery, which catalyzes action. Escalation is protagonist-driven: she enlists help, constructs the spiral, witnesses communal response. Cost is felt in her transition from “locked chest” to open lotus—a renunciation of ghostwriter invisibility with emotional risk. However, external pressure is minimal; the storm’s aftermath enables rather than opposes her, softening tension. Coincidence (storm dislodging nest) complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency remains hers.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving human cohesion against alien manipulation—is signaled early and tightens when Mara realizes division feeds the tricksters. Her agency drives escalation: she cross-references charts, recalibrates gear, times the counter-signal. Cost is visible (risk of censure, equipment destruction) and felt (Dr. Chen’s intrusion, funding threats). Though cosmic stakes loom, pressure remains grounded in campus politics, avoiding telescopic drift. Coincidence complicates (2:47 AM pulse) but doesn’t resolve; victory stems from preparation.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—unlocking the Architect’s chamber to recover lost possibility—is signaled early and deepens into thematic reimagining. Pressure escalates coherently: physical (walls closing), psychological (claustrophobia), and metaphysical (geometry vs. mutiny). The organ’s music complicates but doesn’t resolve; Elara’s agency drives the turn via precise alignment. Cost is felt in the organ’s cessation and the irreversible break from slumber—but the spatial mutiny lacks tangible consequence beyond mood, slightly softening the price.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—awakening dormant empathy through artistic ritual—is signaled early and deepens when the ribbon triggers emotional thaw. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: Elara chooses to feel, altering her method mid-canvas. Cost is unmistakable: she risks retraumatization by reopening her empathic wound. The vendor’s arrest stems directly from her portrait’s accuracy, proving stakes were concrete, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—validating erased truth—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the librarian overrides protocols, foreclosing institutional safety for historical justice. Escalation is driven by her agency: decoding, transcribing, acting. Cost is unmistakable—the director’s threat of termination, the “spongey dread” spreading as collective guilt. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens through textual density, not coincidence, culminating in irreversible exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—granting amnesty to the forgotten—is signaled early and deepens when the fiddler deciphers the wind’s map, narrowing his path to the grove. Agency is clear: he chooses to play, to follow, to unearth. Cost is felt as the “weight of the past lift[ing],” though the price remains conceptual rather than visceral. Escalation is driven by his observation, not coincidence, satisfying Accumulative lens requirements with one meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether to resurrect the failed dream—is signaled early and tightens when Leo enters, forcing the son’s silent argument. The meaningful deepening occurs when symbols are noticed, narrowing options to renunciation. Cost is felt in Leo’s flickering ambition and the son’s “restless heart” stilled. Escalation stems from protagonist agency (marking, placement), not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—decoding confessions to heal intergenerational trauma—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes the burden was never hers alone. Escalation is driven by her agency: choosing to enter lucid sleep, tracking Delta Cephei, typing despite tremors. The tightening occurs at the climax: she must either collapse under inherited grief or reframe it as shared resilience. Cost is felt in the physical toll (“hands trembled”) and conceptual shift—solitude foreclosed, communion embraced.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the hidden truth—is signaled early and tightens when the first spell fails, forcing escalation via the flesh-eating seed. The druid’s agency drives every turn; coincidence never resolves conflict. Cost is felt in the “heavier” curse after failure and the lingering “warlike serenity,” though the price lacks concrete physical or social consequence beyond internal burden. Escalation is clear but could deepen with a more tangible forfeiture (e.g., loss of power, ally, or limb) to breach 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—renewing the eclipsed covenant—is signaled early and tightens when whispers coalesce into a deadline (“before next dawn”). Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to link through scars, enters the maze, and demands answers. Cost is unmistakable: her body becomes the vessel for collective trauma and renewal. The deepening—learning ancestors broke the covenant by containment—narrows her path to one of radical openness.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming her sister’s stolen destiny—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: Elara challenges the Keeper, offers memories, and accepts imperfect restoration. The tightening (memory-for-destiny trade) narrows options irreversibly, with cost felt in “hollow places” and “threadbare” soul. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each root interaction deepens the price. Coincidence never resolves; fate is “trammelled” through deliberate sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming purpose after public failure—is signaled early and tightens when Dale’s dismissal mirrors societal judgment. Mara’s agency lies in attention and renunciation: choosing to keep the cloth over listing it. Cost is conceptual (abandoning emotional detachment) and visible in her rehearsed facts failing to shield her. Escalation is subtle but coherent under Accumulative lens; however, the pressure peak lacks a concrete tactical shift beyond internal resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes escalate coherently under Accumulative pressure: the spirit’s departure triggers physical decay (sagging groves), which tightens into existential threat (“city would fall within the week”). Elara’s agency drives the deepening—her methodical carving rebuilds architecture through analogical logic, not luck. The cost is unmistakable: her ambition resolves not into triumph but wisdom, paid for by surrendering the dream of “exact mathematics.”

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder without erasing humanity—is signaled early and deepens when the creel arrives. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses gradient heat over inferno, transforming tactics under lunar influence. Cost is unmistakable: she sacrifices archival purity, risking systemic failure for fragile impermanence. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with each sensory detail tightening the thematic vise.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether buried hopes deserve voice—tightens decisively at the hesitation beat, where reporting would erase them. Mara’s agency drives escalation: pocketing shells, squeezing through fracture, reading aloud. Cost is felt: she abandons career safety to resurrect others’ regrets. Coincidence never resolves; the caves’ existence complicates but doesn’t solve—only her choice activates their power.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s confrontation with memory and symbol. Escalation is driven by her agency: entering the bathroom, tracing graffiti, unfolding the map, handling the bellows. Cost is legible in her trembling breath, silenced voice, and ultimate relinquishment of the bellows—a renunciation that forecloses clinging to the past. However, the “tightening” lacks a concrete tactical shift; her methodical counting feels repetitive rather than progressively narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—accessing unspoken words—is signaled early and deepens when she learns they must be released, not read. The tightening occurs at the scroll’s revelation, narrowing her option from acquisition to liberation. Agency drives escalation: her documentation enables discovery, and her choice to open the book crystallizes stance. Cost is conceptual (abandoning knowledge for resonance) and visible in the library’s intensified glow. Coincidence (second letter) complicates but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving the seed’s autonomy vs. empire’s exploitation—is signaled early and intensifies through Lira’s coffee-stain reading and plant whispers. The tightening occurs when the jasmine reveals “The seed sleeps within the scroll,” forcing immediate action before “the promise loses its glow.” Cost is felt in Lira’s sacrifice of institutional support. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, with each sensory cue deepening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—capturing the poet’s final spark before oblivion—is signaled early and tightens when the silver thread spasms. Elara’s agency lies in breath, angle, and stillness; her choice not to touch preserves possibility. Cost is legible: the thread dissolves, the name is lost, only metaphor remains. Pressure escalates texturally (auroral pulses → stuttering light → droplet formation), consistent with Accumulative lens. No false resolution; luck doesn’t solve—only discipline does.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—releasing souls from regret—is signaled early and tightens when Elara confronts Mrs. Chen’s blackened grapes. Her agency drives escalation: climbing to witness, tracing the sigil, choosing curved cuts over straight. The deepening comes not from external pressure but internal crystallization—“kindly decisive” becomes action, not trait. Cost is felt in her aging body and emotional labor; the story avoids coincidence by making rebirth contingent on Elara’s sacred space, not magic.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—shedding moral certainty—is signaled early and tightens when the chimes clash, forcing the protagonist to act without clear instruction. The unhooking is a decisive agency beat that narrows options: enter or retreat. Cost is felt in the relinquishment of infallibility, made visible when the cloak is loosened, not discarded. Escalation is driven by internal pressure under an Accumulative lens; no external antagonist needed. Minor flaw: the wind’s “uncertainty” risks personification over causality, but remains thematically coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—teaching vanishing to appear—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes she *is* the lesson. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses to throw herself into the pond, transforming from observer to catalyst. Cost is visible: backward aging erases memories, and her form fades. Escalation is driven by her agency under an Accumulative lens, though the pressure remains internalized rather than externally contested, slightly limiting tactical variety.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the wandering pulse to achieve true navigation—is signaled early and deepens when the birds’ spiral confirms the pulse is a compass. Agency is exercised through deliberate harmonic skimming, not passive reception. The cost is the lifetime of stillness endured and the irreversible shift from seeker to keeper. Escalation occurs via protagonist-driven acts (reading birds, skimming stones), not coincidence, under a coherent Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving sacred simplicity against automation—is signaled early and deepens when Vorrin realizes the keystone has no sigils, only a question. His agency lies in renunciation, not action, narrowing options irrevocably. Cost is felt in his dimming light and implied detection by sentinels. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each layer of description tightens the moral vise.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—discovering the color of sound—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes the answer lies not in sound but in silence. Pressure escalates texturally: meteor hush → phosphorescent books → flickering lantern language → luminous vow. The tightening occurs when the key tag pulses, forcing recognition that the missing tone is “the space between sounds.” Cost is conceptual (abandoning auditory expectation) and physical (immersion in cold seawater), though no tangible sacrifice (e.g., lost time, health) sharpens the trade-off. Coincidence is avoided; all insight stems from Elias’s purposeful wandering.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.4)
    The dominant stake—aligning with purpose before dissolution—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s agency: she shifts questions from “what will be?” to “what must have been forgotten?” driving escalation via her own reinterpretation of method. The static bursts intensify not by coincidence but in response to her choices, culminating in a voice that demands alignment. Cost is unmistakable: she sacrifices the illusion of control, accepting that success and failure are simultaneous. This deepening occurs through protagonist-driven reframing under Accumulative pressure, with no external savior or deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—giving names to nameless fears—is signaled early and deepens when she confronts her own unnamed terror. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each cylinder played, each prism angled, narrows options until only the void remains. The cost is unmistakable: she carries every named fear as weight, yet her own becomes a mirror she cannot escape. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, intensifying through patterned crystallizations that culminate in personal revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—restoring cosmic balance—is signaled early and tightens through Kael’s obsessive drip-counting and bell-tuning, each adjustment narrowing his margin for error. Agency is clear: his patience and precision drive escalation. Cost is felt (brittle devotion straining, magic spent), and the resolution stems from his choices, not luck. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the bell’s success is earned by his method. Could deepen by showing a tangible loss (e.g., physical toll) beyond emotional strain.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—truth versus official erasure—is signaled early and deepens when Nora uncovers evidence of poisoning. Her agency drives escalation: she gathers artifacts, recalls suppressed history, and resolves to rewrite the record. The meaningful tightening occurs when memory surfaces, transforming passive observation into moral obligation. Cost is conceptual (risk to sanctioned history) but legible in the lantern-lit act of writing; however, tangible consequences (social, personal) remain implied rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—harmonizing logic and intuition before dissolution—is signaled early and tightens via the 48-hour clock. Agency peaks when she stops forcing alignment and witnesses pattern recognizing itself, a deepening that reweights everything. Cost is felt in each pressed violet (“a paper-thin memorial to softness carved away”) and paid fully in the crystal’s shattering. Escalation is driven by her evolving stance, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving trust via tether integrity—is signaled early and tightens when the radio declares “tether is failing.” Protagonist agency drives escalation: he revises the sequence using muscle memory, triggering manual override. Yet pressure remains static; no option is foreclosed, no trade-off made. Cost is conceptual (“fragile trust”) but not viscerally paid—citizens sleep unaware, so loss isn’t dramatized. Under Accumulative lens, deepening occurs via sensory intensification, but stakes lack tangible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—custody of consciousness—is signaled early and deepens into whether feeling itself deserves parole. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he chooses integration over annihilation, using muscle memory of “complementary opposites” to merge past and present selves. Cost is legible in the climax: grief “stabbed through him,” memories flood back with visceral pain. The clones’ fear reveals what’s at risk—not existence, but the unbearable price of being alive again.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—nurturing unconventional inspiration—is signaled early and deepens through Mara’s planning of orthogonal puzzles. Pressure accumulates texturally rather than causally: each reflection tightens her commitment, but no live option is foreclosed or trade-off dramatized. The “storm-born silence” creates atmospheric tension, not tactical constraint. Cost remains abstract (patience, secrecy) without concrete forfeiture affecting later choices.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring lost laughter—is signaled early and deepens through Eleanor’s calibrated haunting: too much force risks madness, too little leaves silence intact. Her agency drives escalation; each yank of the cord is a tactical choice with visible cost (handle grows hot, her form thins). The meaningful tightening occurs when she eases her grip, accepting partial success to preserve Sarah’s sanity—a trade-off that reweights the entire haunting. Cost is unmistakable in the dissolution of the handle and Eleanor’s departure.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—reconciling guardianship with exile—is signaled early and deepens when the pendant reframes truth as shadow-bound. The guardian’s agency drives escalation: licking the pendant, interiorizing exteriors, choosing not to move toward the door. Cost is unmistakable: “waiting became a different kind of eternity” transforms into earned patience, forfeiting home for presence. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure tightens through cadence shifts and conceptual deepening, not external opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—escaping ancestral destiny—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes the missing element is “sacrifice of certainty.” Her agency drives escalation: snapping the crozier head isn’t luck but successive approximation in action. Cost is legible in the frozen blooms—memories of failure made permanent—and the land’s shift to “beautiful undeath.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; each layer of ash and blood tightens options until only creative destruction remains.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—decoding the impossible signal—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes silence isn’t empty. The meaningful tightening occurs when she discards amplifiers, narrowing options to bare wire and crystal. Agency drives escalation: her choice to listen, not transmit, forces the tower’s harmonic resonance. Cost is felt in her emptied mind and practical tears—foreclosing her old role as interpreter to become a teacher of listening.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—anchoring the ferry across timelines—is signaled early and deepens when Lina chooses to weave starlight into a binding strand. Escalation is driven by her agency: tuning the radio, pressing transmit in bursts, speaking the merge command. Cost is conceptual but legible: permanence is achieved only to be relinquished again. The tightening occurs when the ferry exists in three places at once, forcing Lina to hold fast despite being tugged at her edges—a credible endurance with visible strain.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering connection’s texture—is signaled early and tightens when the weave implants a “false memory like a tumor,” escalating pressure via protagonist agency. Mira’s choice to force a non-existent link triggers the gallery’s violent rejection, narrowing options to surrender or destruction. Cost is unmistakable: her rational enchantment collapses, tools dissolve, and she must relinquish control to survive. The deepening—from weaving to becoming part of the pattern—is driven by her own flawed logic.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transmitting obsolete starlight navigation to a generation born in darkness—is signaled early and tightens when Corin asks, “where will it take us?” Escalation occurs through Mara’s agency: she decodes light refraction, maps plankton drift, and meditates on tidal pressure, each attempt narrowing options toward internalized navigation. Cost is felt in her renunciation of surface skies and visible in students’ uncertain bioluminescence. Though stakes remain conceptual, the Tethian elder’s intervention deepens rather than resolves, preserving coherent pressure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—protecting vulnerable voices—is signaled early and tightens when the pulse shifts from spectral to mortal, forcing a redefinition of “vulnerable.” The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: curiosity leads to intervention, not luck. Cost is visible (trembling hands, emotional exposure) and alters tactics (from listening to lifesaving). Coincidence complicates (the crash) but resolution stems from choice, satisfying Situational lens pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—bearing witness to the unremembered—is signaled early and tightens when Marek syncs with residual traces, trading personal safety for seven seconds of shared presence. The tidal window creates a live clock that narrows options, and claustrophobia compounds external pressure into internal crisis. Cost is unmistakable: psychological re-injury and near-drowning, accepted without extraction or resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—validating her unlived life through the ghost’s code—is signaled early and tightens when the ink patterns demand active interpretation. Her agency drives escalation: choosing to trace, press the shard, and reinterpret failure. Cost is felt in the shard’s post-climax coldness and her irreversible knowledge. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens via sensory density (static → hum → whisper → chime), though the ghost’s resolution borders on convenient without clearer tactical struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—giving stone’s grief a voice before language extinction—is signaled early and tightens when “only three speakers left, then two, then one.” Protagonist agency drives escalation: she observes birds, channels their flight as syntax, and forces the diamond to recite. Cost is unmistakable: perfect song with no audience, her voice exhausted, veins oxidizing. The deepening—from desperation to acceptance of unhearable meaning—is earned and irreversible under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming bitterness into transcendent laughter—is signaled early and deepens when the static confessions force Lyn to confront loss. Her agency drives escalation: she pockets the arrowhead, listens, presses it to her chest, thrusts it forward. Cost is felt in the dissolution of her human form and emotional armor, though the price remains conceptual rather than visceral. Gravity’s playfulness narrows options by making resistance futile, aligning with the Accumulative lens’s demand for reweighted stakes through pattern intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reawakening beauty in a mechanized world—is signaled early and deepens when Elara learns the statues were *uprooted humans*. The tightening occurs when the clocktower counter-pulse attacks, forcing her ultimate sacrifice: merging fully with the locust rhythm. Cost is unmistakable—her body stiffens, she nearly becomes stone—and agency drives escalation: every failed melody leads to the shell, which leads to embodiment. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with each pulse narrowing options until only total surrender remains.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—delivering connection across rupture—is signaled early and deepens when the scrap of paper adds another absence to the chain. The mailman’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to include the new plea, launches the drone despite risk, and endures the weight of past failure. Cost is visible: his decades of return, the emotional toll of near-misses, the fragility of each attempt. The tightening occurs when the bottle’s storm becomes not just tool but vessel for voice—transforming smuggling into sacrament.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring possibility through silence—is signaled early and tightens when Silas sings, narrowing his path from observer to participant. The deepening occurs at the oasis: finding the fragment forces a trade-off between protective silence and vocal risk. Cost is visible: his voice, unused for years, becomes an act of vulnerability that reconfigures the train’s fate. Escalation is protagonist-driven (his persistence leads to the wrong turn), though the oasis discovery leans slightly on serendipity without prior spatial cues.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—locating the zeroth volume to understand where stories live—is signaled early and deepens into a metaphysical revelation. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: folding the scarf triggers spatial response, which births the door, which leads to reawakening. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: analog memories flood the chamber, rewriting patrons’ relationship to narrative. The tightening occurs when the scarf’s transformation forces the threshold to unfold—a clear, earned intensification under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—capturing the runaway dream before daylight dissolves it—is signaled early and tightens at the summit when the bridge dissolves “too quickly.” The librarian’s agency drives escalation: each stroke and exposure alters tactics based on real-time failure. Cost is unmistakable: the empty well, the weight of “captured sunrises” as “forgiveness,” the irreversible change in her practice. Coincidence never resolves; islands’ whispers guide but don’t solve—she must interpret and act.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—freeing a truth imprisoned by fear—is signaled early and deepens when Merrin identifies the idea as “fledgling” yet “imprisoned.” The tightening occurs at Venus’s appearance, forcing Merrin to act within a narrow cosmic window. Agency is clear: Merrin’s disorientation ritual directly enables the truth’s release. Cost is felt in the woman’s trembling and Merrin’s unspoken longing, though the latter’s personal stake escalates slightly late. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the star’s role is established as part of the world’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—recovering memories—is clear early and tightens when Elias learns the seventh Pleiad is missing, forcing him to cultivate out-of-season mushrooms. Agency drives escalation: his hands-on methods (dinghy measurements, spore cultivation) narrow options until only one solution remains. Cost is visible: three weeks of labor, exposure to elements, and ultimate renunciation of certainty. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via pattern intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the shadow to end exile—is signaled early and deepens when Lin’s presence reframes it as mentorship versus escape. The tightening occurs when the archivist admits she could leave but won’t, foreclosing a path with emotional cost. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each annotation intensifies the weight of choice. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; agency drives the renunciation that crystallizes stance.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder’s color—is signaled by line 3 and tightens decisively when Vespera chooses salvage over passive witnessing. Her agency drives escalation: singing, weaving, enduring seven days without sleep. Cost is unmistakable: “her hands stained with the sap of between-ness,” collapse after completion, and eternal duty pruning excess possibility. The deepening—wonder returning “multiplied, refracted”—reweights the original goal with higher responsibility, not just restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—grounding restless spirits by confronting her silence—is signaled early and deepens with each knot. Agency is clear: Elara chooses forbidden unraveling despite mentor’s warning. Escalation is driven by her action, not coincidence; cost mounts in emotional exposure (“voice cracking like old varnish”) and culminates in the pearl’s birth. The final tightening—facing “perfect fear”—forecloses evasion and reweights all prior grief.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—listening to erased voices—is signaled early and deepens via Elena’s methodical comparison of footage, narrowing options to one hidden seam. Agency drives escalation: her frame-by-frame analysis yields the decisive anomaly. Cost is felt in her tempered curiosity and quiet documentation choice. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding the physics of letting go—is signaled early and deepens via Cassian’s measurements. The meaningful tightening occurs when he realizes “the force required to let go was equal to the force of will that had kept it,” foreclosing his initial approach (untangling) in favor of reclassification. Cost is felt in dissolving letters and the irreversible loss of Amelia’s voice; agency lies in Cassian’s choice to stop untangling. Mort’s presence applies steady pressure without resolving conflict for him.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to the unspeakable—is signaled early and deepens when the scribe joins, expanding the ghost’s reach beyond the courtyard. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: stamping glyphs, singing, pressing the bolt plate again—all narrow options toward liberation. Cost is unmistakable: the balladeer vanishes, sacrificing presence for permanence of the song. Thunder and storm provide external pressure, but the tightening is internal—choice to amplify pain into poetry.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—“Was my quiet presence meaningful?”—tightens as each floor reveals deeper intimacy. Kai’s agency drives escalation: choosing to wear goggles, tilting the diary, interpreting dual scripts. Cost crystallizes in the ninth-floor entry: joy existed, but the giver is dead. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves—only attention earns revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—proving atmospheric memory—is signaled early and deepens when Mara chooses documentation over rescue. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: she loads the final spool, speaks Thorne’s truth, tethers evidence to chute. Cost is unmistakable: career ruin, physical peril, emotional solitude. The “quietly explosive” microburst of despair becomes both past trauma and present validation, tightening the narrative coil without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—mirroring the infinite sky within finite walls—is signaled early and deepens as time narrows (demolition at dawn). Kael’s agency is clear: he chooses to paint, not flee, using the coin’s indentations despite their limits. The tightening occurs when the siren wails and the tree shudders, forcing his final act of acceptance. Cost is felt: the physical library is lost, but the sky lives on internally—a trade-off earned by his method.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—charting the luminance to earn cartographic legacy—is signaled early and tightens when the hopscotch pattern aligns with the phrasebook. But escalation relies on coincidence (dusty board appearing just when needed), not protagonist-driven pressure. The cost is conceptual (isolation affirmed) but not visceral; no tangible sacrifice alters tactics en route to the valley.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring memory’s flow—is signaled early and deepens when the protagonist realizes repair isn’t mechanical but temporal (“not just about fixing locks”). The uncapping action narrows options: only eclipse-breath can activate the path. Cost is felt in her acceptance of perpetual liminality (“walks the line between shadow and light”). Escalation follows Accumulative logic: density of nostalgic reflections intensifies until the central mirror’s unlocking forces stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—reviving the orchard before drought—is clear and tightens when the ghost urges abandoning old irrigation for the bell. The escalation hinges on collective trust, not individual agency, which fits the Accumulative lens. Yet the pressure lacks friction: no dissent, doubt, or failed attempt dramatizes the risk. Cost is conceptual (the ghost’s fading) but not viscerally felt in tactical trade-offs during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—vouchsafing peace across time’s end—is signaled early and deepens when the puppet head becomes the axis. The tightening occurs when she must translate lullaby into geometry, not sound, narrowing options to one precise spiral. Agency is total: her hands alone enact the pattern. Cost is unmistakable: dissolution of the puppet (and her connection to the boy) into light, paid in the “bruised awe” of letting go.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—guiding travelers safely before frost—tightens relentlessly as daylight wanes and frost climbs. Each nut placement narrows options; the final worn nut is a visible sacrifice. Agency is clear: Elara’s method (shadows, not touch) actively reconfigures bird patrols. Cost escalates under Accumulative pressure: breath quickens, heart pounds against reluctance, yet she acts. The climax isn’t luck—it’s earned endurance under a live clock, with tangible loss: her solitude deepens even as lives are saved.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming separation into connection—is signaled early and tightens when Elena glimpses the foam’s geometry, which reweights her research goal. Agency is clear: her decision to release the chrysalis crystallizes her stance, with the cost being the irreversible surrender of private grief. Pressure escalates texturally (not causally), consistent with the Accumulative lens, though the lab coda slightly diffuses the ravine’s concentrated tension. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; insight arises from sustained observation under emotional duress.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding the origin point of story—is signaled early and deepened through the vendor’s method of quantifying absence. Agency lies in precise choices: selecting the parole bottle, uncorking it, scattering light. Each incision narrows options (e.g., the man’s silver tears yield only the birth-pain answer). Cost is unmistakable: harvested silences fill bottles, and the vendor’s own unincised state exacts emotional toll. Escalation follows the Accumulative lens, intensifying via layered absences until the woman’s gasp reconfigures what “beginning” means.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—relieving another’s remorse at personal cost—is signaled early and deepens when the chef realizes sandpapering would erase the daughter entirely, forcing a morally fraught pivot to subsumption. Agency is clear: his choice to “take the sharpness into myself” narrows options irrevocably. The escalation is driven by his analysis of tidal patterns, culminating in the decisive act of swallowing condensed sorrow. Cost is visceral: trembling hands, spiderweb cracks in his heart, and the looming threat of total fracture—felt, visible, and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rehabilitating communal listening—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes the clock needs “more than weight; it needed the voices of the town.” Her agency drives escalation: gathering phrases, teaching the melody, convening the circle. The cost is felt in pragmatic resistance overcome (railroad divide, linguistic pride) and emotional vulnerability (elders weeping). However, opposition remains abstract—no character resists integration, muting the price of unity; the mayor’s “pragmatic” festival endorsement arrives too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring abandoned dreams through memory modification—is signaled early and deepens via the canyon’s geological synaptic plasticity. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: each memory rewrite ripples through the network, stirring other dreams. The meaningful tightening arrives when she realizes “the archaeologist becomes artifact”—a trade-off that crystallizes her stance. Cost is unmistakable: loss of self-boundaries, acceptance of entanglement, yet the story avoids mechanical resolution by keeping transformation open-ended.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—securing the forgotten combinations before time runs out—is signaled early and escalates via the narrowing inversion window. Agency is clear: she chooses speed over safety, records glyphs under duress, flees before entrapment. Cost is felt: physical strain, temporal pressure, irreversible expenditure of the doodle’s light. Though luck (the hour coinciding) complicates, resolution stems from her preparedness and action. One meaningful tightening occurs—the grotto shuddering as gravity rights—forcing the climactic escape.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to silence—is signaled early and deepens when the sculptor deciphers cracks as music. Her agency drives escalation: brushing dirt, tracing fissures, crafting a bow, strumming, singing. The cost is subtle but present: her voice is “fragile,” her success measured not by conquest but by shared vibration (hedgehog scurrying, fox pausing). Pressure tightens through accumulation, not causality, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—redeeming his betrayal through meaningful absence—is signaled early and tightens when Kael correlates magnetic pulses with Mira’s breathing, narrowing his agency to one final “move.” The eclipse clock forces urgency, and his choice to release the stone forecloses reconciliation, paying visible cost (abandoning his only tactile anchor). Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens: ghost gambits and stalemates accumulate until silence becomes the only viable language. Coincidence never resolves; all escalation stems from Kael’s disciplined attention.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—recovering paternal connection through empathetic listening—is signaled early and deepens via Mira’s escalating focus on “hearing silence.” The meaningful tightening occurs when she shifts from cataloguing to *acting*: tuning the radio to resonate with the clasp. Cost is legible: years of isolation crystallized in the diary’s locked state, now exchanged for vulnerability. Agency is clear—Mira’s method drives the turn—but the escalation leans more on accumulation than causal narrowing of options, fitting the lens yet limiting peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—cultivating serenity within motion—is signaled early and deepens when the minstrel’s frantic arrival tests the tincture’s efficacy. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to brew, offer, then share. Cost is visible in the seed’s irreversible use and the emotional labor of communal care. However, pressure remains internalized; external stakes (e.g., village survival) are implied but not concretely tested, slightly muting escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding resilience to save the orchards—is signaled early and tightened by the one-hour gravity window, which forces immediate launch and constrains tactics. Kael’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to trust the arrow, release controls, and follow water, each narrowing options. Cost is unmistakable: she must relinquish control and accept that survival requires embracing death. The inversion isn’t a gimmick but a coherent pressure that crystallizes her stance—resilience through damage, not despite it.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preventing recurrence through foresight—is signaled early and deepens via wind-pattern discovery. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: each measurement narrows options until the venturi channel reveals the singular convergence. Coincidence complicates (the storm’s aftermath) but doesn’t resolve. Cost is felt in the unnatural silence and implied future danger, though no tangible sacrifice is shown on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—certifying wonder as essential—is signaled early and deepened through the ritual’s dependence on auroral alignment and the sculptor’s first strike. Pressure escalates via the “sculpted hush” that threatens to smother sound, forcing Lyra to act precisely. The cost is visible: the music sheet dims after use, its energy spent. While escalation is elegant, it leans on external timing (the chisel) more than protagonist-driven agency under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—harvesting insight from failure—is signaled early and deepens when the flute reveals the vault’s ajar door and the thief’s shadow. The meaningful tightening occurs at the pass: playing risks widening the fracture, yet not playing forfeits redemption. Cost is legible—the missing artifact remains lost, guardianship is irrevocable—and the keeper’s agency drives escalation (choosing to play, then choosing restraint). Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via cadence shift: from crunching steps to shivering reality to avalanching quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—deciphering emotion’s mathematics—is signaled early and deepens through two trials (mathematician, poet), each narrowing Cassian’s assumptions. Agency is clear: he chooses ambiguity, feeds the fragment, borrows minds. Cost escalates: emotional dislocation, reversal of transference, realization of flaw. The tightening occurs when he abandons linear solutions for “deliberate ambiguity,” accepting turbulence. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; insight arises from failed experiments under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—extending fleeting wonder—is signaled early and tightens when the child’s wilted bloom demands action beyond delivery. The courier’s agency deepens stakes: using the pendant to germinate life costs him its physical possession but gains mythic continuity. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each auroral pulse thickens time until the sprout’s emergence crystallizes his stance. Coincidence (child appearing) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from his choice to plant the pendant.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—proving emotion-imprinted objects—is signaled early and deepens when Seraphine shifts from data-collector to porous witness. The tightening occurs when she abandons instruments for direct communion, narrowing options: she must become “an object herself.” Cost is unmistakable—three hours of neural rewiring, relinquishing the prism, accepting colleagues’ dismissal. Agency drives escalation: her choice to angle the prism triggers the vision; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—carrying Lin’s message across impossible distance—is signaled early and tightens when Mei realizes reciprocity demands equal weight: her memories. Agency drives escalation: buying the puzzle, placing bead in shuttle, weaving surrendered moments. Cost is visceral (“memory of morning tea,” “color of husband’s eyes”) and culminates in visible depletion. Coincidence (rummage sale box) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Mei’s choice to sacrifice enacts closure.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—saving the orchards via arch restoration—is signaled early and deepens when Ren learns the arches sleep, not die. The meaningful tightening occurs at the heart-chamber: awakening requires bartering what he values most. Protagonist agency drives escalation (research, descent, sacrifice); no coincidence resolves the crisis. Cost is unmistakable: loss of maternal inheritance, redefining his identity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—containing the rift before it consumes reality—is signaled early and tightens when Lira realizes the shard is both key and warning. The meaningful deepening occurs when she grasps the predecessor’s fate, raising emotional stakes: failure isn’t abstract but ancestral. Agency drives escalation—she *chooses* to weave, guided by pulse, not luck. Cost is felt: the shard vanishes, and the “weight” becomes permanent. Yet the rift’s mechanics lack tangible constraint; resolution leans on concept over concrete limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—protecting the feeling of safety—is signaled early and deepens when the lamp fails, forcing Caleb to shift from mechanical maintenance to symbolic ritual. His agency drives escalation: he chooses to bottle the sea glass, write the note, and renew the cairn signal. Cost is felt in the “ache” internalized and the vulnerability of continuing the anonymous chain. Coincidence (ghost’s presence) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Caleb acts.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—shaping a new dawn via ancient shadows—is signaled early and tightens when the Herald realizes her words shape reality. Her agency drives escalation: she decodes shadows, adjusts the wick, shouts prophecy. Cost is felt (burden of power, isolation), but the storm’s abatement after her first utterance borders on passive resolution. Still, the ship’s safe passage earns its payoff through her active steering and vocalized belief.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding why some attract stories—is signaled early and deepens when the donor’s identity reframes the quest. Escalation occurs through the stranger’s intervention, which forces a conceptual trade-off: abandon formulaic tracking for embodied receptivity. Cost is felt in the master’s staggering disorientation and ultimate surrender of control. Coincidence (stranger’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; insight arises from prior watchfulness meeting revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—deciphering whether trees witness only desolation or also resilience—is signaled early and deepens when the sorrow map reveals “mundane miracles.” Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to map, deconstruct, and open the door, with visible cost (confronting quantified grief). The moonlight constraint creates tension, though the storm’s parting verges on convenient. Still, the final trade-off—transforming sorrow into a key—narrows options meaningfully under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rekindling the dying mirror world—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Elias sings, risking his own memory. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he chooses to sing despite knowing the cost (“each note pulled a piece of his own memory away”). The price is unmistakable on the page: total self-erasure for communal renewal. However, the “endless night” as opposition remains atmospheric rather than dynamically pressuring his choices mid-beat.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—whether to remain in protective isolation or risk connection—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s realization that her method of “staying while leaving” has become self-betrayal. The tightening occurs at 11:53 when she recognizes her mistake isn’t refusal but hiding from what the invitation represents. Agency is clear: she chooses to smooth the invitation, then step through the door. Cost is felt—the loss of a decade’s false equilibrium—and the paradoxical resolution (“leave while staying”) emerges from her own logic, not external force.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—resisting creeping erasure—is signaled early and escalates when Mara gathers witnesses, transforming solitary gardening into communal ritual. The tightening occurs when she breaks the bread: a point of no return that shifts from preservation to active mourning. Cost is unmistakable—“We let it disappear”—and the group’s participation forecloses further silence. Pressure grows through accumulation, not coincidence, and Mara’s agency drives every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory against oblivion—is clear and intensifies through the dimming light and unstable frequencies. The tightening occurs when the chief isolates the queen’s harmonic, a meaningful deepening that alters tactics. Yet agency is limited; success hinges on discovering a pre-existing frequency rather than a hard-won choice with irreversible cost. The stakes feel abstract despite lyrical urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving the truce—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the stranger threatens it with documentation. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: two false starts lead to a third, smarter tactic that captures betrayal rather than preventing it. Cost is visible (singed sleeve, emotional burden of recorded treachery) and alters her stance. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens via sensory and temporal compression toward sunrise.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding weather-carriers—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes they’re atmospheric compromises, not anomalies. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: her tasting interprets electoral shifts, culminating in the choice to relinquish the ring. Cost is unmistakable: loss of proof, voice, and investigative identity. The tightening forecloses her mechanistic worldview, forcing acceptance of emergent systems—a trade-off earned under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—uncorking suppressed creativity—is signaled early and tightens when the lock resists, forcing Elena to shift tactics from dialing to rhythmic tapping. The deepening occurs via memory-as-tool, narrowing options to one viable sequence. Cost is felt in the “auroral sorrow” that now colors her art. Agency drives escalation: her mnemonic gift and embodied rhythm solve the problem, not coincidence. Slight cap for lack of external opposition, but internal pressure suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving honest words against societal erosion—is signaled early and deepens when she confronts her own buried truth. Escalation occurs through her agency: piecing the map, enduring the guard’s lies, choosing to listen and transcribe. The cost—years of self-imposed silence—is felt physically (wilting) and emotionally (raw memory). One tightening suffices, but it’s masterfully executed with tangible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder’s color—is signaled early and deepens when the tuner realizes her work is transmission, not preservation. Agency drives escalation: her choice to forge sculptures from iceberg fragments narrows options (permanent muteness) and raises cost (self-erosion). The child’s arrival forces a conceptual turn: wonder becomes “present-tense experience,” not memory. Cost is unmistakable: “her voice finally dissolving into the hundred tiny sounds of her tunings.”

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—resolving inner static through containment of chaos—is signaled early and deepens when the caretaker discovers the fear-box. Agency drives escalation: they exploit glitching safety overrides to create a controlled burn, a high-stakes gamble with real cost (protocol breach, destruction of irreplaceable artifacts). The magnetic shift complicates but doesn’t resolve; the caretaker’s intentional short-circuit is the decisive act. Cost is unmistakable: the box screams, memories collapse, and the android endures the weight of becoming Emma’s inheritor.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving intangible community value against commodification—is signaled early and tightens when developer flags appear. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she initiates storytelling, interprets clues, mobilizes neighbors. The meaningful deepening occurs when letters are revealed—not just mystery solved, but proof that “listening heals” becomes actionable evidence. Cost is felt: time, emotional labor, and risk of failure crystallize in the council fight and halted development.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming captivity into liberation via encoded vulnerability—is signaled early and tightens through each journal entry. The meaningful deepening occurs when Lyra realizes the AI interprets dance as maintenance, turning passive observation into active weaponization. Cost is felt: she risks drowning to flood the chamber, trusting breath over air. Agency drives escalation; coincidence never resolves—only her choreography unlocks freedom.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost memory—is signaled early via Mara’s empty eyes and tightens decisively at the salt chamber, where Kael must risk fracturing the crystal to retrieve the past. Agency drives escalation: his research, coffee-ground reading, and exhumation are all active choices that narrow options (e.g., rusted door must be forced). Cost is unmistakable: the whale’s bones become fertilizer while its death enables memory theft, and Kael’s silence at the end bears the weight of irreversible loss. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each anomaly deepening the central grief.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preventing a flood of forgotten memory—is signaled early and tightens as the brook resists silencing (“flow quickening, water speaking in tongues”). Elias’s agency drives escalation: each crane placement deepens his focus and narrows the prophecy’s power. The cost—loss of wisdom for peace—is crystallized in the ending, though the “terrestrially cosmic” scale occasionally risks abstraction. Still, the trade-off feels viscerally real through paper’s changed weight and altered sound.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving authentic history against sanitizing renovation—is signaled early and tightens when Mrs. Voss reveals the planned erasure of the tuberculosis ward. The meaningful deepening occurs when Alex chooses to inscribe the seal, transforming from student to steward. Cost is felt: Alex inherits silence as responsibility, and Mrs. Voss’s role shifts from keeper to initiator of succession. Agency drives escalation—each tea session builds knowledge that culminates in deliberate, irreversible action.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving her sister’s consciousness without losing herself—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes archiving requires connection, not control. The tightening occurs at the climax: she must abandon equations to complete the archive, trading intellectual safety for emotional risk. Cost is unmistakable: the shell goes silent, her solitude ends, yet she gains “embodied freedom.” Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves tension. The star’s fade imposes a live deadline that shapes every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring truth to sever tyranny—is signaled early and deepens when the altar reveals the golden disc. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she whispers the phrase, inserts the thorn, presses scroll to seal. Cost is felt in her isolation and the irreversible betrayal. However, the tyrant remains off-page, making opposition abstract; stakes rely on implication rather than visceral pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving echoed voices—is signaled early but never truly pressured. No antagonist acts on-page; the “conspiracy of silence” is named but exerts no tangible resistance. The Singer’s agency is limited to singing and listening; her choices don’t narrow options or incur visible cost beyond emotional weight. Escalation occurs texturally (more layers in echo) but not causally—no reversal or deepening alters her tactics or forces a trade-off under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—salvaging a pure memory—is signaled early and deepens when Maya chooses compassion over full disclosure. Pressure escalates through dream analysis leading to physical discovery, and the hidden chest represents a narrowing of possibility into one sacred truth. Cost is felt: Maya bears the burden of unspoken grief, and the world never learns the full story. Agency is clear, though the conflict leans internal; external opposition is minimal but appropriate for the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—seeing hidden patterns—is signaled early and deepens when Kael witnesses nets “breathing” under moonlight. The tightening occurs not through external pressure but via accumulated revelation: each firefly flicker tightens the thematic knot. Agency is subtle but present—Kael chooses to climb the parapet, and the philosopher chooses to teach—but the lack of tangible opposition softens escalation slightly under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—access to truth/survival—is signaled early and tightens when Elias realizes settlers are “living shields.” The deepening occurs at dawn with the reconstructed letters, foreclosing ignorance and forcing confrontation. Agency is clear: Elias chooses revelation over silence, knowing he’ll be branded cursed. Cost is unmistakable—loss of community standing, risk of exile—and escalates coherently under the Causal lens without coincidence resolving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—shaping the new dawn against Council demands—is signaled early and tightens when Atlas chooses to broadcast despite treason. The deepening occurs when he realizes the prophet is an age, not a child, raising stakes from personal defiance to historical midwifery. Cost is felt in abandoned notes, impending enforcers, and ultimate disappearance. Escalation follows Accumulative logic: each sensory detail (static, shadows, lightning) layers pressure until the final transmission becomes inevitable. Coincidence never resolves; agency drives every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—translating loss into spendable memory—is signaled early and tightens when the music box melody vanishes, forcing innovation (sound-jarring). The escalation is protagonist-driven: each jar represents a deepening commitment that narrows her path from vagrancy to custodianship. Cost is unmistakable: “the weight of captured sound pressed against her chest,” a “poverty richer than any she’d known.” At climax, she forfeits control by releasing all memories—agency crystallizes not in hoarding but sharing, with social consequence (librarian’s war letters, tourists’ stories).

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—protecting the sacred artifact while escaping—is signaled early and deepens when escape becomes impossible, forcing adaptation via vibrational matching. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each sensory detail (ice-song, shadow’s scream) tightens the engineer’s tactical focus until resonance becomes weapon and balm. Cost is unmistakable: frozen tears, altered heartbeat, and the burden of dual identity (“engineer and keeper”). Agency drives escalation—her hum initiates the climax, no coincidence resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—liberating thought from manufactured crisis—is signaled early and deepens via the tyranny of artificial urgency versus natural rhythm. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to wait, teaches others to wait, then acts precisely when lunar and magnetic alignments converge. Cost is felt: seventeen lunar cycles of communal discipline, the ever-present enforcers, the risk of misreading tidal stresses. The revolution’s “release” isn’t passive—it’s the payoff of relentless calibration under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—truth versus institutional complicity—is signaled early and tightens when sabotage evidence emerges. Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency: empirical observation leads to discovery, which forces the climactic choice. Cost is unmistakable: loss of Voss’s protection, professional retaliation implied. The tightening (loosened bolts + ignored log) narrows options to complicity or exposure, with no deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether a condemned man’s gesture can matter—is signaled early and deepens when the chaplain asks “does this matter?” Marlowe’s agency drives escalation: he doesn’t just fix but rebuilds the escapement wheel, narrowing options to one path—craft as atonement. Cost is felt in the silence before the melody, the crack that cannot be undone. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure tightens through cadence and object focus, not external reversals, satisfying scope.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—ringing the unheard bell—tightens when Zephyr feeds the arrow’s geometry into the algorithm, forcing the workshop to “build something new—not for survival.” Escalation is protagonist-driven: each transliteration deepens the yearning algorithm’s sophistication until it manipulates buoyancy, risking dissolution. Cost is visible: the workshop’s structural integrity versus abstract resonance. Coincidence never resolves; the arrow’s discovery catalyzes agency, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering the erased truth—is signaled early and deepens when the numbers reveal intentional concealment. The lie to the AI is a decisive tightening that narrows options and raises risk. Cost is felt: she erases logs, copies data, and carries the burden of knowledge in a world of silence. Though escalation is driven by discovery rather than external opposition, the keeper’s agency in forging the token and uploading the mirror ensures pressure remains coherent under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—community survival amid environmental instability—is signaled early and tightened when the crystal shatters. The meaningful deepening occurs in the vintage store: knowledge reveals the true cost (willing blood), raising stakes from technical repair to moral sacrifice. Agency resides in Kael’s request and the boy’s step forward; coincidence never resolves tension. Cost is unmistakable: the boy’s irreversible gift, crystallized in the reformed orb. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, escalating via revelation rather than external threat.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—learning the “sound of approaching endings”—is signaled early and deepens when the crack reveals not violence but yielding. Her agency crystallizes not in grand action but in continued trawling despite fear, then joining volunteers. The cost is conceptual: surrendering the fantasy of a clean exit for messy continuity. Escalation is subtle but coherent under the Accumulative lens, though the transition from solitary seeker to volunteer feels slightly compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—nurturing intersubjective understanding amid irreconcilable distance—is signaled early and deepens when he reads the letter. His agency drives escalation: he wanders, imagines, writes, buries. Cost is felt (isolation, unrequited longing) and visible in the sealed vial. However, pressure remains internal; external stakes lack tangible resistance beyond seasonal departure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving the echo before it fades—is signaled early and tightens when the line walker realizes she must descend beneath the dunes. Her agency drives escalation: she conjures clearings, touches the parapet, draws in the echo. Cost is conceptual (the burden of guardianship) and spatial (permanent alteration of the desert via clearings), legible in the multiplied circles locking the parapet in place. Yet the “urgency” lacks temporal pressure—the prophet’s warning has no ticking clock, softening stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—collective healing through curated remembrance—is signaled early and deepens as townspeople contribute photos, shifting the archivist from solitary witness to community weaver. Pressure escalates via participation: each added image alters the arc’s meaning, narrowing the archivist’s control while expanding its power. Cost is felt in the implied lifetime of labor and the refusal to erase pain. The tightening occurs when the child’s daisy initiates generational continuity, transforming private ritual into public pilgrimage.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving the emotional residue of words—is signaled early and tightens when digitization looms. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he tests the crystal, catalogs voices, then desperately reads aloud. The cost is legible in the climax: his name returns nothing, proving his erasure. This deepening forces his final renunciation—not saving the library, but testifying anyway—under coherent pressure that never relies on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—capturing the sound of growing older—is signaled early and deepens through tactile escalation (listening → marking → trapping the echo). The tightening occurs when the chalk snaps, foreclosing permanent capture and forcing acceptance. Agency drives every turn: the prophet chooses to seek, mark, and finally release. Cost is felt in the loss of the sound and the knowledge it will vanish from memory—but the spiral remains as testament.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—harnessing the ephemeral before cosmic loss—is signaled early and deepens when escape velocity threatens structural integrity. The meaningful tightening occurs when Kael shifts from repairing lenses to restructuring time, foreclosing passive observation. Agency is clear: his adjustment of the escapement directly resolves the crisis. Cost is felt in the bittersweet awareness that preservation doesn’t stop loss—only frames it. Coincidence never resolves; causality flows from character choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reconciliation before death—is signaled early and tightens after blood work reveals finality. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses sound over words, transforming mundane noise into liturgy. The cost is felt in Lena’s cracked silence and Mr. Harrow’s fragile voice joining the hum. Coincidence (Lena arriving just then) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the emotional breakthrough stems from Elara’s method, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preventing the sealed awakening from spilling into a fractured world—is signaled early and tightens when Elara realizes shadows feed the automaton’s pocket dimension. The deepening occurs at the climax: the entity thrashes as the seal strengthens, raising emotional and cosmic stakes. Elara’s agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves tension. Cost is legible: her lifelong duty, solitude, and the ever-present hum of responsibility. One tightening suffices, and it’s potent.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—certainty vs. truth—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Moira reveals her abduction, foreclosing Elena’s changeling theory. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: Elena seeks understanding; Moira chooses disclosure. Cost is unmistakable: Elena must dismantle her career, while Moira confronts being a “ghost.” The revelation about Clara adds moral weight—stakes expand beyond personal failure to collective grief, deepening pressure under a Causal lens without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—sharing light without fire—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s polishing ritual, which becomes both method and metaphor. The escalation is subtle but potent: from solitary memory to communal beacon, with the cost being the surrender of private communion for public gift. Agency is clear—she chooses reflection over flame, action over passive watching. Under the Accumulative lens, the cadence shift from individual shard to village-wide constellation constitutes meaningful pressure intensification with tangible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming truth-telling from public spectacle into protected meaning—is signaled early and deepens via Elara’s refusal to apologize for growth (like the moss). Escalation occurs through her agency: choosing to guide moss, then deciding to share the sanctuary. Cost is unmistakable: career, reputation, sanity traded for “honeyed hush.” The drip-pattern method narrows options to patient, deliberate acts, foreclosing grand gestures or retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reconciling artistic abandonment with human empathy—is signaled early and deepens when the soldier sings the burned novel’s melody, forcing a reckoning with shame. The tightening occurs when the novelist touches the grounded boy’s shoulder, actively defying his “hardened craft.” Cost is felt in clipped wings and unwritten faces, though escalation leans more on accumulation than causal narrowing. Coincidence never resolves; all pressure stems from protagonist’s past choices.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring the Golden Vein rite—is signaled early and tightens at dawn when “everything aligns,” forcing Elara’s irreversible act of singing. The cost is conceptual: if she fails, stories vanish forever; success demands communal recommitment. Agency is clear—her voice, not luck, revives the vine. However, escalation leans on lyric accumulation over tactical narrowing; the “three nights” countdown isn’t leveraged as active pressure in middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—retrieving the child via heartbeat translation—is signaled early and tightens when the Great Silence “urges haste yet demands stillness,” forcing a trade-off between speed and precision. The alchemist’s agency drives escalation: her deliberate patterning enables the sigil, which permits starlight capture, which ignites the map. Cost is unmistakable in the transformation of loss into geometry and the physical risk of the flash-paper flare. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her methodical choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—restoring temporal resonance without containment—is signaled early and tightens when the locksmith realizes the mechanism shattered from overload, not wear. His agency drives escalation: reverse-engineering becomes redesign, shifting from extraction to liberation. Cost is unmistakable: the cellar of reason no longer stores wonder but integrates it into foundational architecture, foreclosing the old paradigm. The wounded season’s dying moments exert coherent pressure that crystallizes his stance without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—measuring soul-burdens to escape recursive imprisonment—is signaled early and deepens through three calcifications, each narrowing options: voice (sigh-weight), pride (black stone), existence (sphere). Protagonist agency drives escalation; “orienting properly” forces costly stances (facing stars vs. darkness). The final burden’s weaving requires synthesizing all prior weights, with visible price: solitude crystallized into artifacts. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens until the sphere’s emergence reweights everything.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming grief into enduring presence—is signaled early and deepens through Mara’s carving act. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: she initiates the “crystallized time” ritual, carves the mane, places the prism. Cost is felt: the whistle’s crack splits silence like loss itself; peace arrives only after accepting that memory cannot be frozen. One meaningful tightening suffices—the shift from “harvest lessons” to “let memory become part of the present”—consistent with Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reconciling with eroded ambition—is signaled early and tightens when the child’s fragment (“The sky is a canvas…”) forces a deepening. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: spinning the wheel blurs vision, enabling the ghost encounter. Cost is felt (“weight of regret,” irreversible stillness), though the pressure remains internal and atmospheric rather than causally sharpened; under an Accumulative lens, this suffices, but lacks the visceral trade-off needed for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reviving communal hope through engineering—is signaled early and deepens as Mira’s solo effort becomes collective (children building rockets). Pressure escalates not through opposition but through accumulation: each redirected flow (water, light, sound) tightens the link between physical repair and emotional resonance. Cost is felt in what’s lost (the star-bound dream) and what’s reclaimed (wonder), though the absence of tangible obstacles slightly softens the escalation’s bite.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—making peace with an abandoned dream—is signaled early and deepens when Elara chooses transformation over repair. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her excruciatingly gentle dismantling tightens options until only surrender remains. Cost is unmistakable: “the weight she had borne for two decades dissolve[s].” Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through resonant intensification, not causal turns, culminating in a Charged Poise where love becomes legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the architecture of lies—is signaled early and deepens when the map reveals tunnels labeled with falsehoods. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she reads ripples, traces shadows, presses stone. Cost is conceptual (years of wandering, weight of truth reclaimed) but not viscerally felt; no tangible loss alters tactics. Under an Accumulative lens, this suffices, but lacks the earned friction that would push it into the high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost agricultural knowledge—is signaled early and deepens when Elara deciphers the wisp-grass method. Escalation is driven by her agency: tracing knots, interpreting reversed loops, using the fulgurite glass. Cost is felt in physical numbness, social isolation (“none understood”), and the fragility of what’s preserved. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—mapping healing through absence—is signaled early and deepens via the act of writing living obituaries, which narrows her options to ritual witness or departure. The meaningful tightening occurs when she writes her own obituary, foreclosing perpetual observation with conceptual cost. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each descriptive layer intensifies the weight of solitude. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; agency drives every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reawakening beauty—is signaled early and deepens when the prince realizes his creation bridges irreconcilable worlds. Escalation is driven by his agency: hypothesizing, assembling, refining. The cost is felt in the city’s syncopated gears and his own burden of responsibility. Though tension peaks at hatching, the story wisely avoids false resolution—stakes remain live, charged by possibility of healing or shattering.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming destructive legacy into healing—is signaled early and deepens through Maya’s act of grafting the bird’s wing, which narrows her path from passive remembrance to active compassion. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: each object handled (coin, thread, sand) tightens the thematic knot. Cost is felt in the weight of memory and the vulnerability of tending brokenness, though the escalation lacks a tangible obstacle—luck or coincidence doesn’t interfere, but neither does resistance. Agency is clear, yet the absence of external or internal friction softens the stakes’ edge slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—liberating trapped memories—is signaled early and deepens through Kael’s “sidereal patience,” a tactic that narrows her window to a single celestial/geese alignment. The meaningful tightening occurs when she reaches the stuck box: success hinges entirely on the geese’s pause, a live clock that raises stakes. Cost is legible: years of silence must be broken in one fragile instant. Though coincidence (geese pausing) complicates, it doesn’t resolve—the latch yields only because Kael times her press perfectly, showing agency under constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—share light without fire—is signaled early and tightens when Elara realizes fire means extinction. The meaningful deepening occurs at “the garden was a Turing machine,” shifting her goal from solving an equation to encoding memory into petals. Agency drives escalation: she alters her sonar frequency, which the garden responds to, proving her method works. Cost is unmistakable: she accepts eternal recurrence, carrying ancestral grief while teaching the next generation—a trade-off foreclosing escape but enabling legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—discovering the shape of collective grief—is signaled early and deepens as Kael shifts from individual angels to communal spirals. Agency drives escalation: each evening’s retracing narrows his options until only the woven spiral remains viable. Coincidence (monarch arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution comes through sustained attention. Cost is felt in the silence left by departed butterflies—a “thundering calm” that mirrors carved stone.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring shared balance—is signaled early and deepens when Elara learns the earth itself shifted, making human error a cover for geological betrayal. Pressure escalates through protagonist agency: reading each inscription forces a recalibration of duty, culminating in her choice to carry Marten’s truth. The cost is unmistakable: she forfeits the town’s comforting fiction, accepting that absolution requires collective reckoning. One meaningful tightening—tide’s return—narrows her window to act, raising emotional stakes without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to the unspoken—is signaled early and deepens through the tapestry’s decoding. The meaningful tightening occurs when the gardener realizes the pact was broken, shifting his purpose from organization to witness. Cost is felt (“fingers stained,” “weight of intentions”) but remains abstract; no tangible forfeiture or irreversible choice crystallizes pressure. Agency is passive endurance rather than decision, which fits the Accumulative lens but lacks a decisive trade-off that forecloses alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—seeding innovation before quartz fails—is signaled early and tightens via the elders’ drilling veto, forcing Kaelen to narrow options through predictive modeling. Agency drives escalation: her lattice simulations foreclose starvation/civil war paths, crystallizing the geothermal solution. Cost is visible: years of transformation, worn quill, ached fingers. Coincidence never resolves; victory comes through earned persuasion under iron constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—ending the story famine through hidden music—is signaled early and tightens as Mira embeds lyrics into the symphony, risking detection. The meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the broadcast is a cipher, raising stakes from copying to co-creation. Cost is conceptual: her work may vanish unheard, yet she persists. Agency is clear (transcription as resistance), though external pressure (prying eyes) remains abstract rather than dramatized, preventing full escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—crystallizing fleeting safety—is signaled early and deepens via Elara’s realization that the emotion has “already escaped.” The tightening occurs when ash settles yet the gallery blurs, foreclosing her goal but offering somber marvel instead. Cost is felt: grief remains uncontained, safety remains illusory. Agency lies in renunciation—leaving the mask, scattering ash—not victory, aligning perfectly with the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—whose truth survives—is signaled early and tightens when patrols execute archivists, raising the cost of dissent. Malach’s agency drives escalation: his choice to encode data (not plague or martyrdom) forces confrontation, crystallizing stakes into a binary of obedience versus method. The patrol’s arrival isn’t coincidence but consequence of his scraping—a direct result of his rebellion. Cost is unmistakable: potential death, yet he files faster, making his stance irreversible and visible in the cog’s new pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—unlearning hatred through sonic subtraction—is signaled early and deepens when Marco risks vulnerability. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: Mrs. Kaelin’s method forces each student to choose between armor and one true note, narrowing options until only intentional harmony remains. Cost is unmistakable: thirty autumns of resistance, the conservatory’s closure, and the fragility of memory. The tightening culminates in a braided chord that forecloses isolation forever.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—proving life can bloom in forbidden decay—is signaled early and tightens through Mara’s pruning, which carries legal and existential risk. The celestial alignment imposes a live clock, forcing urgency, and her method (synaptic plasticity applied to plants) deepens the conflict conceptually. However, escalation leans heavily on external magic (cosmic key) rather than protagonist-driven pressure; the Order’s threat remains offstage, muting tangible opposition. Cost is felt thematically but not personally—no sacrifice beyond effort is dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—restoring wonder as civic necessity—is signaled early via drone collapse and deepens when Mara realizes their failure stemmed from absent reverence. Her agency drives escalation: answering the riddle, climbing the tower, placing the comb. Cost is unmistakable—the city endures three days of blackout, drones fall “like dead stars,” and Mara’s truth-telling isolates her until the child’s voice offers connection. Pressure tightens coherently under Accumulative lens: each action releases denser “nectar dusk” light.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—understanding why houses feel alive—is signaled early and deepens into active sanctification. Escalation occurs through accumulation: each object placement tightens the thematic pressure and expands impact (“people began to notice”). The protagonist’s agency drives every turn; no coincidence resolves. Cost is felt in his anonymity and the irreversible shift from observer to unseen caretaker—a foreclosed path of pure detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving truth vs. welcoming nuance—tightens when Petra threads the ampoule through the dome’s flaw, a single act that broadcasts rebellion into dead foundations. Escalation is driven by Petra’s agency: her telepathy actively weaves memories into “poison and cure,” forcing stone to shudder with recognition. Cost is unmistakable: the city’s rigid certainty literally drowns its children, and Petra pays with decades of solitary guardianship. The final image—foxgloves staining water with “possibility”—reweights stakes from preservation to propagation, with irreversible loss (the old Verities) as price.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—capturing the texture of a missed opportunity—is signaled early and tightens decisively at the rupture. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his proofs predict the flaw, his dice exploit it, his choice rejects escape. The 0.003% bias isn’t luck—it’s earned asymmetry that narrows options to one impossible roll. Cost is unmistakable: salvation requires dissolving every constructed what-if, including his daughter’s lingering presence in regret.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether forgotten compassion can be reignited through aesthetic intervention—is signaled early and deepens when the brush glows intensely at the crescent’s peak, raising the emotional and tactical stakes of the mural. Kael’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to risk public vulnerability by pasting the canvas downtown. The cost is legible—not material loss, but the exhaustion of chronic insomnia and the gamble of emotional exposure. Mira’s response validates his thesis, but the story wisely avoids over-resolution; the ripple begins, not concludes.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rescuing dying arts through communal memory—is signaled early and deepens when Liora shifts from solitary curator to community ritualist. The meaningful tightening occurs when she commits to baking initials as “symbolic key,” narrowing options from passive preservation to active, vulnerable reenactment. Cost is visible: the lingering “rosewater dread” and the unresolved beekeeper’s absence show that one act cannot dispel systemic loss. Escalation is driven by Liora’s agency, though the engineers’ warning feels slightly ornamental rather than pressuring her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring the lighthouse beam to save ships—is signaled early and tightens at the tide-turn climax, where failure means permanent dimming. Pressure escalates coherently under the Causal lens: the hunger stone’s drain intensifies, demanding precise reversal. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation—her reverse-engineering forces a trade-off between time and perfection—and cost is felt in her exhaustion and the keeper’s dread. Luck complicates (tide timing) but doesn’t resolve; victory requires exact skill. Minor deduction: secondary stake (fate vs. free will) slightly dilutes focus but converges at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes escalate coherently: from personal trauma (flickering vision) to metaphysical confrontation (fear as amplifying parasite). Mira’s agency drives deepening—she chooses to enter, to hold up the photo, to ask the pivotal question—and each act narrows options while raising conceptual cost. The dominant stake (overcoming inherited fear) tightens via the dream dictionary’s paradox, culminating in a trade-off: eternal witness for temporary power.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—orchard survival via sonic transformation—is signaled early and tightens through the prophet’s agency: each strike narrows options by committing to resonance over resistance. Escalation is driven by her precise sequences (e.g., “three quick blows, then two slow”), which deepen the storm’s mimicry. Cost is unmistakable: “agitated peace,” endless recurrence (“Tomorrow, new clouds…”), and the mallet’s kelp shroud implying ritual exhaustion. Coincidence never resolves; the storm sings back only because she first sketches its heart.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the watchers’ silence—is signaled early and deepens when the crack reveals itself as a map, narrowing Kael’s options to replication or surrender. Her agency drives escalation: studying patterns, crafting a new whistle, climbing at dawn. Cost is unmistakable—the gate’s rust signifies irreversible knowledge, and her choice to speak anyway carries existential weight. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with each discovery tightening the spiral toward confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—rescuing truth from noble lies—is signaled early and deepens when Emlyn realizes the lie became a “prison.” The meaningful tightening occurs in her shift from exposure to preservation-as-bridge, foreclosing pure revelation. Cost is conceptual (legacy tarnish) and social (rewriting communal memory), though felt impact is muted by lack of interpersonal friction; stakes remain intellectual rather than viscerally urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving the memory of drowned dreams—tightens when Elias shifts from recording loss to embedding testimony. His agency drives escalation: each note placed narrows his professional path while deepening emotional commitment. Cost is unmistakable: tears mixed into mortar, emptied inkwell, risked reputation (“unsalvageable… delay one year”). The drawbridge’s locked timeframe forces irrevocable choices, and the final stance (“further study”) carries institutional risk that charges the ending with quiet defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—tracing honest origins—is signaled early and deepens via the guild registry and Aldric’s handwriting. But escalation is thematic, not causal: no live option is foreclosed, no trade-off made. The “blackout as deliberate shroud” hypothesis introduces tension but isn’t tested—resolution comes via external power return, not Mira’s agency. Cost is implied (time, isolation) but never felt or dramatized as altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering her daughter’s breath through grief-transformed cranes—is signaled early and escalates via the protagonist’s own labor: each folded crane feeds the shadow below, deepening the paradox. The tightening occurs when she realizes her cranes are ladders for the shadow’s return—a cost she willingly pays. Agency is clear: she chooses to keep polishing nightmares into singing things, even knowing the shadow grows stronger. The final trade-off—eternal wakefulness for a diamond lantern that “never folds but always shines”—is a credible, costly endurance under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—finding unused potential—is signaled early and deepens through Kael’s agency: she chooses perturbation sequences, locks coordinates, refuses extraction. The 20-minute window tightens options; each nudge carries risk (breakers blew last time). Cost is unmistakable: time lost, trauma relived, salvation denied. The escalation is driven by her will, not coincidence, culminating in a stance crystallization that forecloses redemption but affirms witness.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—decoding belonging—is signaled early and deepens when the chip reveals emotional resonance, not coordinates. Elara’s agency drives escalation: launching drones, interpreting glyphs, pulling pinions in sequence. Cost is felt—the pilgrim’s flight implies danger in truth—but remains conceptual rather than visceral. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via increasing symbolic density, though physical stakes stay abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the withheld truth about his mother—is signaled early and deepens when he finds her name on the plaque, forcing renunciation of his false-memory trade. The escalation is driven by his agency (sifting carvings, kneeling, moving along shore), not coincidence. Cost is felt: the guilt he carries transforms into a “quiet scar,” and he abandons his livelihood. Yet the tightening lacks a concrete trade-off (e.g., destroying records, burning tools)—the price remains largely emotional, slightly abstract for full high-band impact.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preventing renewed war through precise execution—is signaled early and tightens as the moon rises. The meaningful deepening occurs when Kael hands over the drawer pull, transforming a personal talisman into a diplomatic token: a trade-off that narrows emotional safety for collective hope. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves conflict. Cost is felt in Kael’s “lingering doubt,” though a sharper tactical consequence would elevate this further.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—forgiving himself for his sister’s death—is signaled early and deepens when fog collapses expectations. The meaningful tightening occurs at the third pole’s disappearance, forcing Elias to confront his reliance on broken instruments. Agency is internal but decisive: he stops fighting the current, accepts drift, and reinterprets poles as grace markers. Cost is felt in the compass left behind and the cemetery walk ahead—irreversible acts of release.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—kindling empathy in a barren world—is signaled early and tightens when the labyrinth forces Kael to choose under duress. His agency drives escalation: reading clues, selecting paths, fleeing collapse. Cost is felt in the cavern’s trembling and the sterile world above, though the transition from survival sprint to empathetic resolve lacks a concrete trade-off (e.g., lost memory, physical injury).

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reforging love beyond death—is signaled early and deepens via the reluctant metamorphosis, which forecloses humanity. Agency is clear: she gathers spices, arranges the circle, whispers the name. Cost is unmistakable: human form surrendered, voice transformed, tears as moons. Pressure tightens once decisively—the scent triggers irreversible change—and the orchard’s response (violet blossoms, phoenix acknowledgment) validates the stakes without coincidence resolving them.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering “lost time” of early motherhood—is signaled early and deepens into a conceptual reckoning: time is loaned, not lost. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation—her tracing, unfastening, and witnessing transform passive searching into active reparation. Cost is unmistakable: the “luminous burden” of compressed moments, the body as archive, the irreversible crack now worn “like a secret heart.” The tightening occurs when the saucer weeps light, forcing recognition that loss and gain coexist—a trade-off with emotional and ritual consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—achieving perfect compassion to open a dimension—is signaled early and deepens via shadow work. Each stitch tightens pressure by forcing confrontation with denied violence, narrowing options until only integration remains. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her choices (confessing guilt, acknowledging rage) directly alter her mass and the ship’s gravity. Cost is unmistakable: eternal solitude as caretaker of memory.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding transformation—is signaled early and deepens when the crimson bug pulls Kael inland, narrowing his attention to a single decisive choice: capture or release. Agency resides in his attention and release, which forecloses possession with felt cost (emptiness). Coincidence complicates (pig → bird → fish) but doesn’t resolve; Kael remains unaware, preserving causal integrity under an Accumulative lens. Pressure tightens via rhythmic synchronization, not external opposition, fitting the story’s introspective drive.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—control vs. liberation—is signaled early and tightens when Seren deciphers the coded angles, foreclosing passive vigilance. Escalation is driven by her agency: measuring, mapping, unlocking. Cost is unmistakable: she risks everything using the commandant’s own tools, with the final image showing irreversible systemic rupture. Coincidence (blackout) complicates but doesn’t resolve—her skill does.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—decoding sacred patterns to fulfill a promise—is signaled early and tightens when precognition reveals the cost of success (her dissolution). Elara’s agency drives escalation: she places rocks despite visions, chooses to fade the dust, accepting partial victory. The single deepening (realizing patterns live in light/dust/aurora interplay) narrows options to renunciation. Cost is unmistakable: her shadow dissolves even as eels leave grooves—a trade-off that reweights the world’s rules without full restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming voice from censorship—is signaled early and tightens when the storm creates a window for truth. The poet’s agency drives escalation: he waits, opens, reads, reseals, writes. Cost is felt: he endures continued silence but gains internal clarity. While the storm’s timing borders on coincidence, it’s framed as a natural phenomenon he’s been told about, not a deus ex machina—pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—turning questions into destinations—is signaled early and deepens when the sundial aligns with the needle card, narrowing Rhen’s path. Escalation is driven by Rhen’s agency: decoding, fencing, seizing the stumble. Cost is felt in the opponent’s defeat and Rhen’s irreversible clarity. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; insight and precision do. Lacks a second tangible loss (e.g., tool damage, stamina depletion) that would push it to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—forging beauty from anarchy—is signaled early and tightens when the poet risks imprisonment for truth-telling. The meaningful deepening occurs in prison: resistance shifts from solitary provocation to communal rebuilding, narrowing his options (molting vs. staying) with real cost (permanent identity loss). Agency drives escalation: he chooses to share hidden verses, then to stay. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from character decisions under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—rewriting loss through music—is signaled early and deepens when the pianist decodes film anomalies, narrowing options from passive mourning to active quest. Agency drives escalation: his strategic reading of frames creates the map; boarding the airship forecloses return. Cost is felt—bleeding fingers, enduring thin air—and the storm’s threat sharpens urgency. Coincidence never resolves; the arbor’s discovery stems from his pattern recognition, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving cultural memory before monsoon—tightens via Kael’s agency: dream analysis → realization the seed wakes the ridge, not grows a tree. This deepening forces the high-cost choice: singing (a renunciation of checker orthodoxy). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; each night’s recording intensifies the clock. Coincidence (moth-delivered seed) complicates but doesn’t resolve—Kael must interpret and act.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding the color of unspoken apologies—is signaled early and deepens through ritual action. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: Mara’s wire-wrapping diffuses resistance, cooling the compass. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits resolution for integration, accepting that some wounds grow around rather than close. The “three seasons” commitment shows tangible price, altering her voice and vocation by story’s end.
