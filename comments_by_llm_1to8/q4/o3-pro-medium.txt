  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (salvaging vs. razing) established early and deepens through dust-reading discovery to drainage action. The escalation follows accumulative logic as patterns cohere into actionable insight, with Jonah's shift from resistance to participation marking the meaningful turn. Cost is visible in physical labor and Jonah's torn-up form.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from personal survival to exposing a weapons trafficking network, with the frost revelation deepening Yara's commitment despite danger. The pursuing hunters create immediate pressure that forces tactical choices about escape routes. The irony of her art being weaponized adds moral weight, though the final escape feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through the tuning fork sequence from discovery (colors responding) to risk (ocean cracking, pillars might shatter) to sacrifice (protagonist absorbing the resonance). The dominant stake—preserving the discovered music without destroying its vessel—tightens when "if motion returned too abruptly, the delicate pillars would shatter," forcing the bodily intervention with clear cost.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal curiosity through discovering the library's purpose ("every distress signal ever ignored") to the realization that balance requires sacrifice. The pressure coheres well under the accumulative lens as understanding deepens. The cost is unmistakable: Elias must remain to free the trapped signals.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: from "children ate boiled paper" to the grandmother's empty pot to the crumpled napkin with fresh bills. The dominant stake (sustaining community under sanctions) tightens when they're "short by three units" then immediately receives anonymous replenishment, showing cyclical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—deepens through the camera ritual's revelations about past lives and withheld expression. Pressure builds through breathing techniques and the projection's painful visions. The transformation from seeking a vault to understanding love as a dispersed field provides meaningful deepening, though physical stakes remain modest.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through the garden's recursive resistance and Quillon's deteriorating mental state ("edges of his thoughts blurred"). The hyperbolic maze creates genuine pressure by multiplying wrong choices into infinite corridors, forcing Quillon to apply his professional knowledge sideways—literally "walking off the page of normal geometry."

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal freedom to species survival as the wall falls. The puzzle creates genuine pressure ("A misstep, however, would jam the mechanism"). The timing constraint adds urgency, though the guards' convenient absence and the perfectly preserved vault reduce tension slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from seeking betrayal's sound to risking his synesthetic gift at the forge. The accumulation of absences (locket, compass, violin) builds pressure toward the price extraction. Cost is legible as colors fade during ascent, though the middle gathering could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation works through accumulative deepening: from waiting with the jar, to decoding the boy's sketch, to understanding the station as buyer, to opening the jar and witnessing collective transformation. The cost lands clearly when "the moments she'd hoarded for barter were now gone, and yet she felt lighter."

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (creating safe zones despite abandonment) maintains consistency but lacks significant escalation. The internal pressure of overcoming frozen silence provides the main conflict, yet the absence of external opposition or meaningful obstacles limits dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal fear through identity crisis to life-threatening conspiracy, with the murder-bonus discovery forcing the protagonist's hand. The final jump carries genuine mortal risk despite the safety cables since their discovery wasn't guaranteed. Cost is visible in the shattered identity and public exposure, though the crew's instant solidarity slightly softens consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation accumulates through textural deepening: from physical storm to "marbled hush," from gold flakes lifting like moths to Brekan feeling fortress walls extend into his mind, culminating in his acceptance of commanding "with measured stillness." The stakes—defending against endless night—tighten through the oracle's paradoxical method where noise creates fatal "cracks."

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from anomaly detection to consciousness merger with clear cost: "Failure would reset the loop; success would discharge them from the frozen courtyard at twilight forever." The protagonist's agency drives resolution through the choice to touch the violin string. The temporal loop creates genuine pressure, though the middle section could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to moral test when the vault's shelves "swung to face him like silent jury boxes," forcing Silas to choose transparency over possession. The lens-on-chest moment creates genuine pressure with "every shelf swung to face him." However, the resolution's ease (shelves simply "unlocked, releasing confiscations") and the swift community transformation dilute the earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal inheritance burden to systemic redistribution of luck through the garden's agency. The pressure builds through texture accumulation: polishing intensifies to maze transformation to sundial recalibration. Cost is visible in the crowd's gauges "dimming, then glowing" as Orlan's hoarded luck redistributes, though the personal price could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake (proving lateral time before funding expires) escalates through Maren's lever-pull, creating the temporal distortion that threatens the creatures' wellbeing. The reversal when she must "stitch the deck closed" creates genuine cost. Agency drives the escalation, though the resolution's speed slightly dampens the pressure's peak.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal obsession to physical risk (opening the trapdoor) to spiritual communion, with clear cost at each stage. The dominant stake—completing Silvestri's unfinished communication—drives every action. Minor deduction because the resolution feels slightly predetermined once the pattern becomes clear, reducing tension in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: from seeking answers to weighing truth to final release. The oracle's pronouncement "motion changes mass" forces Mara's decisive action. Stakes deepen as "thirteen grams of future grief" quantifies emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: from chasing voices to Caleb's confession about swallowing the logbook to the wheel's supernatural response spelling "SHIFT SETTLED." The dominant stake—measuring the weight of guilt—tightens as the wheel becomes a "ghost scale" that quantifies remorse. Cost is legible in Caleb's physical relief and the narrator's shift from skepticism to belief.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.6)
    Central tension between witnessing and intervention escalates through rising floodwater forcing a choice. The obsidian refuge sequence deepens stakes by showing the cost of neutrality ("watching the water gnaw the bank"). Agency manifests through renunciation—choosing to witness rather than warn—with visible cost in the "failing sky."

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake - fulfilling the promise to nurture wonder through "ordinary magic" - is signaled early but faces minimal pressure or complication. The eclipse proceeds as expected, the box opens "by some private shift of wood," but no genuine obstacle tests Arlen's commitment or forces a meaningful choice that would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from collecting stories → discovering Clemency's axis theory → understanding walls as memory-teeth → realizing her cosmic role. The tightening through "walls will turn the sky's lever" to Ursa's trembling comprehension shows clear progression, though the cosmic scale slightly abstracts the personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal debt (Vienna theft) to global transformation (broadcasting secrets). The protagonist's agency drives the choice to participate despite years of training against disclosure. Cost is legible in releasing classified material and abandoning former life. Some abstract phrasing ("transprose life into a new key") slightly dulls impact.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from initial possession threat through rhetorical combat to the demon's attempted physical attack, each move narrowing options under the accumulative lens. The loop pedal's replay mechanism forcing self-awareness creates meaningful deepening that changes the demon's knowledge. Cost is visible in both the demon's disgusted departure and the priest's perpetual burden.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: from listening to wind, to pressing shell against pane, to climbing the spire, to conducting the full symphony. The dominant stake (conducting unheard symphonies) tightens as "final echoes thinning" forces closure. Cost is legible in physical exhaustion and temporal limitation, though the piece could benefit from one sharper moment of trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through the procedural corridor choices and culminate in Ira composing "a life pattern that left power diffused and love concentrated." The cost of extinguishing alternate selves is visceral: "countless Iras howled as their corridors collapsed." One meaningful deepening through the droplet selection satisfies scope requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (defeating numbness to feel/make others feel) signals early and tightens through the discovery-attunement-sharing progression. The "filament of hush" measuring honesty creates genuine pressure. Cost appears in the community's physical/emotional release. Deduction for coincidence elements (drum maker conveniently gone, perfect setup waiting) and because the escalation relies more on accumulation than active choice, though this fits the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (preserving storm data integrity vs. institutional loyalty) established early and tightens when Hilara must choose between safety and action. The supercell creates genuine urgency with flood consequences. Cost is visible when she transmits codes knowing "the council suspected her drift." One meaningful escalation sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal quest to understand grief through the fern's transformation moment, forcing Lysander's choice to open or seal the vial. The cost manifests in confronting the buried memory and accepting grief's role, though pressure could tighten further in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from seeking to "listen" to the rope's memory to facing an "impossible choice" where pulling one strand might "charcoal into oblivion" the others. The deepening occurs when Jalen must choose between preserving hope or wisdom "and he could not hold both," with agency demonstrated through his drumming solution. Cost is legible in the rope's physical deterioration and time's rearrangement.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—finding/creating music in a silenced world—deepens through acoustic mapping, the discovery of the trapped sapling, and the sacrifice of violin strings. The escalation from listening to cutting to playing shows clear progression with visible cost. The final note from the sapling that "promised more" crystallizes the earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from professional transaction to existential need when Celine reveals wanting "insight without heartbreak." The transformation sequence builds pressure through color shifts (violet to honey) and physical manifestations. The dealer's unexpected contamination by Celine's patience creates genuine cost, though the middle section could tighten—the distraction patter feels slightly padded.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—honoring silent contributors—faces no meaningful opposition or escalating pressure. The search progresses smoothly through helpful connections without setbacks or trade-offs. The gathering succeeds without conflict, and Mara's return completes the cycle without visible cost or foreclosed alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal search to communal joining through the arbor's transformation. The dominant stake—grafting oneself to community—tightens when faces appear in vapor and new shoots record their presence. Cost manifests in offering materials and the simultaneous "heat and cold" sensation, though agency could be stronger in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through the borrowed-time mechanism: first disrupting the city's cadence (bells stopping mid-peal), then requiring more seconds to maintain the corridor, culminating in the stylus cracking as resources deplete. The giant turning "on his side" shows environmental consequence, though the middle section could tighten the cost of each borrowed moment.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.3)
    Pressure accumulates through pattern intensification: from passive observation to active kneeling, from scattered symbols to coherent sequence, from wound to "measurable curve." The stakes deepen when Eridian realizes emotion needs "continuing function" not resolution. Cost appears in his permanent sacrifice of the glass eyes and acceptance of limited sunrise.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.2)
    The blackout creates initial pressure, sense memory guides discovery, finding the trapped girl raises stakes, and the choice to reveal themselves after forty-one years carries weight. The escalation follows accumulative logic as memories and present danger converge. Cost is visible in breaking decades of invisibility, though the resolution feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake (resisting vs. accepting transformation) deepens through "reconstruct by releasing control," with visible cost in bark-traced palms and budding knuckles. However, the weeks-long summary section deflates urgency, and the final choice to "stand still" lacks the visceral pressure of earlier beats.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal quests to shared vulnerability as both must offer memories for the exchange. The fissure's opening and the building's trembling response create genuine pressure. Cost manifests in "resin smear that tingled like static" and the permanent transformation of both characters' practices.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from individual quest to metaphysical confrontation with doubled selves, forcing Arden's renunciation. The cost is visible when he sets the pearl down "for the next wanderer." Minor deduction for the shadow-doubles resolution feeling slightly abrupt after strong buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake - restoring communal memory after exile - is clear and maintains consistent pressure through the council's demand. The escalation from individual fragments to collective lattice-building shows meaningful deepening. However, the conflict lacks immediate opposition or resistance; the restoration proceeds too smoothly without dramatized obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through accumulative deepening: external dare→personal need→confronting routes never taken→forced truth exchange. The pressure coheres as Elara must "decide which missed journey she would finally ride." Clear cost in surrendering her protective belief about routes mattering more than destinations. One meaningful tightening that forecloses her ability to maintain her self-deception.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation works through accumulative deepening - from touching the tile to receiving visions to understanding her mentor's true motivation. The cost is legible (accepting responsibility for others' grief, carrying forward mentor's burden). One meaningful deepening that changes Soraya's knowledge and stance, appropriate for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.5)
    Escalation builds through accumulating intensity: shard's arrival → magnetic containment attempt → spatial mutiny eruption → vision of farewells → near-catastrophic temptation → successful re-tuning. The stakes crystallize around whether Callix can master the fragment without being consumed, with palpable cost in the "seams that bled candlelight" showing loved ones dying again.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from professional discretion to life-or-death through Corvus's threat ("the next bag will hold you"). The glass shard resolution arrives too easily despite setup. Cost registers through exile and Corvus's death, though protagonist agency in the killing feels accidental rather than fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: silence settling, lamp humming, pattern emerging, past/future refracting, culminating in absorbing the avalanche's cadence. The cost is legible in Calix's physical staggering and heartbeat transformation, though the stakes could tighten more dramatically between discovering the method and confronting future catastrophe.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through the discovery sequence: finding the poison label triggers memory, then footsteps force hiding, revealing others hunt this "ghost who steals evidence." The tide's rhythm creates temporal pressure. Cost appears in accepting erasure to continue collecting, though the physical danger could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as each interaction (cello→shell→logbook→telescope) deepens Maren's engagement with the observatory's mystery. The stakes crystallize when she must confront her dismissal of the sailor, paying emotional cost through confession. The dominant stake—understanding versus skepticism—tightens appropriately for this textural mode.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.5)
    Privatization threat establishes clear stakes early, with meaningful escalation through the heist, parade diversion, and legal maneuvering. The tightening occurs when "corporations do not yield to poetry" forces the shift from artistic resistance to legal briefs. Cost is visible in the weeks of careful negotiation and the final public trust compromise rather than full ownership.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—capturing the last natural eruption before permanent alteration—maintains coherent pressure through the chemical timing sequence. Escalation occurs through the accumulation of sensory detail ("dragon-scale shadows," "coral drifting in tide") that deepens the loss. The approaching construction drones create temporal pressure without requiring reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    Time pressure from the anchor lifting creates urgency ("we had minutes before the captain required guidance"), with escalation through three increasingly precise diagnostic stages. Cost manifests in the stakes of synchronized harbor/rail schedules that would "splinter like wet driftwood" without success, though the repair proceeds without significant reversal or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from cartographic curiosity through physical danger on cracking ice to the fundamental impossibility of Morrow's life's work—strong accumulative tightening. The moment when his pen "bled harmlessly into the humid air" forces genuine renunciation with clear cost. Deduction for somewhat passive agency in middle beats (following Yara's lead) and the falcon's role remaining ornamental rather than pressuring choices.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal quest ("maps that could be walked into existence") through the walking ritual to the choice between staying or charting ruins—with visible cost in Lira accepting the tuning fork's burden. The dominant stake of restoration coheres well, though the tension could tighten more dramatically in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through ticking oxygen clocks for both characters, though the resolution feels too neat—the tripwires conveniently retract after recognizing "authorized contact." The dominant stake (preserving the artifact versus saving lives) creates genuine tension. However, Mara's ability to execute "balletic precision" movements while oxygen-depleted strains believability.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake - escaping his father's legacy versus accepting truth - escalates through Silas's creation of the labyrinth, the approaching patrol, and his final choice to dismantle his escape. The cost is legible when he "shook out every corridor" and faced consequences. One meaningful tightening occurs when the patrol's approach forces his decision between fleeing into the labyrinth or facing reality.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from tending experimental trees to confronting centuries-old debt through past-life memory recovery, culminating in Seraphine's transformation and dissolution. The cost is visible: Elias gains understanding but loses Seraphine permanently ("reached for her hand, but she began to ghost again"). Minor deduction for the slightly convenient timing of "the moment ripens tonight."

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on transforming the labyrinth from exclusive to inclusive space, with Wren's blood serving as literal cost. The pressure builds through accumulative imagery rather than reversals, appropriate to the textural lens. The labyrinth's responsive shifting provides complication, though agency sometimes feels predetermined rather than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from documenting dig sites to confronting personal faith crisis through the sundial's discovery. The protagonist's agency drives the descent and restoration, with clear cost in recognizing his "unfinished return path" among the etchings. One meaningful deepening occurs when he discovers his own story carved incomplete, forcing action.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake - preserving meaning before forgetting - escalates through Palimpsest's "last letter" and culminates in Mirielle accepting the chalk/responsibility. The pressure builds through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate to the textural lens. Cost becomes legible when she must "shelter sentiments" using obsolete tools, though the immediate stakes could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: from solitary work to Voren's arrival to the discovered intelligence about the two-hour window. The dominant stake (preserving knowledge before the coup) tightens when Voren's inspection threatens exposure, then crystallizes into immediate action. Cost is visible in her choice to leave sanctuary, though the final confrontation remains ahead.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: from seeking to wading deeper, from reading one message to conflicting messages, from holding pain to letting the shard overflow. The dominant stake—deciding whether to break silence—tightens when she discovers her lover's equal paralysis, forcing crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal mission ("graft new meaning onto old wounds") through discovery of the acrostic to the shellfire interruption that tests resolve. The dominant stake—finding language that can heal rather than merely translate—tightens when the narrator realizes the task is mediating "between frightened hearts." Cost is visible in the "lotus-hearted ache" and the acceptance that words might fade while patterns hold.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: projected images → music → materialized children → recovered memory. The dominant stake (rediscovering lost joy) deepens when the orchard demands reciprocity. Cost is visible in the emotional toll and the gift of her journal, though the resolution arrives somewhat easily once the pattern clicks.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate through Ada's dialogue with the garden, from testing echoes to negotiating terms ("Loose the city's certainty") to executing the nested awakening sequence. The dominant stake—reviving dormant acoustics—deepens into exchanging certainty for curiosity citywide. Cost is visible in the final transformation where "certainty became impossible." Minor deduction for the somewhat convenient alignment between Ada's private motive and the garden's demand.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from delivery mission to active pursuit, with the auditor's arrival forcing improvisation. The protagonist's agency drives the escape through environmental manipulation. Cost becomes visible when they acknowledge abandoning "tenure, address, even preferred pronouns" for this cause.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—transforming pain into beauty versus remaining trapped in torment—intensifies through the journey from shell to garden. The blossom armistice represents a meaningful deepening where internal war must cease, with visible cost in releasing control ("poems would now dream on their own"). Escalation follows the accumulative pattern effectively, though lacks the sharp reversal a causal story might offer.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from routine inspection to chime repair to stairwell discovery to name restoration, each beat deepening the stakes. The cost registers in Orielle's ongoing commitment and the weight of unfinished work, though the pressure could tighten more sharply in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal mission to preventing irrevocable faction split, with time pressure ("before paths diverge") driving urgency. Ada's agency drives the resolution through her method of interconnected promises. The delegates' transformation feels slightly too smooth, lacking resistance that would heighten the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.5)
    Escalation builds through two distinct pressure surges—first requiring the gate opening that saves the orchid farms, then the deeper tremor that tests Mara's resolve and forces her whispered negotiation with the mountain. The cost manifests in "sweat mingling with ash" and her delayed trembling once danger subsides. Stakes remain coherent: prevent volcanic destruction while establishing sustainable harmony.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from self-preservation through accepting the meteorite to finally risking exposure by sending it out—each step narrows Marietta's options. The tension between safety and purpose deepens through "She hesitated until she remembered the graduate's trembling plea," with clear cost in potentially "repeating old tragedies."

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding absence as sacred distance—deepens through the chair reading and the fragment discovery. The pressure coheres as Mira moves from seeking reunion to accepting choreographed separation. However, the escalation relies more on revelation than active choice until the final beats, and Arin's role as pressure source remains gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (finding belonging) escalates through the sunrise deadline creating urgency, then the city's awakening raises emotional stakes. The choice to leave the feather represents genuine sacrifice with "sensing the feather might belong here more than with her." Agency drives the harmonics discovery and data harvest decision under time pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal curiosity about missing memories to discovering paths consumed by unspoken emotions, culminating in restoration. The pressure coheres through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate for the textural lens. The deepening from "why do paths vanish?" to "emotions consume them" to "restoring feelings restores ways" shows meaningful progression with implied cost in confronting suppressed emotions.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—proving that monotony can bloom through guided chance—accumulates through five demonstrations. Each volunteer's revelation deepens the pattern, though individual stakes remain low (receiving gifts rather than making costly choices). The teenager's challenge provides mild opposition but dissolves quickly without real pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—inscribing forbidden art despite the nostalgia ban—intensifies through the moonstone discovery and dissolution, which risks "drowning in recollection" but enables the cosmic verse. The escalation from finding the relic to absorbing it to successfully inscribing the world shows clear deepening under the accumulative lens. Cost is visible in exhaustion and the irreversible transformation of becoming "origin, not oubliette."

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate from personal (finishing mother's work) through technical (mending by nightfall) to communal (town forgetting how to look). The pond's third ring warning creates time pressure that tightens options. Cost manifests in Mira's precise labor and the deckhands' transformed perception.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.8)
    Pressure builds adequately through Juniper's arrival, forcing Rowan to externalize his private ritual. Her fury creates genuine tension against his practiced calm. However, escalation plateaus after the porcelain exchange; the resolution feels predetermined rather than hard-won, lacking a decisive test of Rowan's philosophy.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.6)
    While stakes are declared ("people stumbling in dusk, hungry for fresh coordinates of optimism"), they remain abstract and distant. The balloon experiment provides a single test moment but lacks genuine risk—if it fails, Ora simply continues. No meaningful tightening occurs; the "serene upheaval" paradox prevents actual pressure from building toward a choice with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through Liora's discoveries that deepen understanding: diaries reveal architect's intent → negative shows protest context → capsule contains living memory. The dominant stake (preserving acoustic heritage) tightens when she must choose between selling findings for comfort or accepting guardianship's burden. Cost is legible in the trade-off, though the middle section could apply more immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through the ticking clock ("before the bells announced noon"), the child's fading rhythm, and the increasing intensity of the painting process where colors "spilled along the balustrade." The pressure coheres around completing the circuit before time expires. The bells' eventual delay and transformation into "gentle bells...of possibility" shows earned resolution through the protagonist's participation.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through ritual stages: water pouring→drinking→negotiating standard terms→Petra's risky addition of orphan provinces. Each delegate's different response to drinking (spit vs. benediction) reveals stakes. The final joint stewardship clause genuinely risks the fragile peace, with visible cost in their protests before signing.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—preserving the echo to enable the bird's revival—escalates through Serafina's decision to dismantle her drought project, accepting concrete costs: "investors cursed," reputation drowning. The internal conflict between philanthropist and sentimentalist creates authentic tension. The bird's emergence and Serafina's laugh she "barely recognized" show meaningful transformation with visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—breaking conformity's hold on the city—escalates from personal quest to societal transformation with clear cost. Mirelle's agency drives every turn through concrete actions (cutting threads, speaking her true name, freeing the sanctuary). The pressure tightens as she descends deeper, with the final transformation showing visible price: "Conformity's lullaby faltered, for it required dull silence."

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes center on ethical storytelling versus manipulative entertainment, deepening through each bar performance. The miner parable creates genuine audience complicity—"felt the sting of complicity graze their throats." However, the conflict lacks visceral urgency; Silas operates without significant opposition or risk to himself.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from Pearl sensing the interrupted cadence as "a plea" through discovering the knotted story, to the ritual that releases it. The dominant stake—giving voice to overlooked history—tightens when the cadence "faltered harder" after naming alone fails, forcing Pearl to create the mnemonic knot. Cost appears in the temporary nature of her solution.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving "the sound of forgotten names"—faces escalating technical and emotional obstacles. The ritual deepens through Elien's self-forgiveness unlocking the rope's power, then the physical transformation of sound into bronze grooves. Cost accumulates visibly: the exhaustion, the tears, leaving the bronze behind for others while he departs empty-handed.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation works through accumulating pressure - storm approaching, seal humming, vines responding, culminating in the dance that "knits the directive anew." The protagonist's agency drives the resolution through choosing to dance despite absurdity. Cost is visible in accepting temporary purpose. Could strengthen with more concrete obstacles between finding seal and exit.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulating sensory and symbolic intensification: warming tiles, spiraling dust, appearing murals, pulsing numbers. The astrolabe sacrifice represents genuine cost that forecloses return. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens, though the stakes could be more viscerally felt in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through textural accumulation: from Maro's general mission to Tyra's specific wound ("homeland...cut from the map by her own brother") to the cellular breakthrough. The broken music box creates meaningful constraint forcing alternative tactics. Cost manifests in Tyra's tears becoming "seeds from which tiny sparks of pale music floated upward."

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through synchronized breathing that progressively dissolves boundaries, from wood/mirror/sky to past/present. The dream's attempted escape creates genuine tension. Cost is visible in accepting "every fracture as essential contour" rather than traditional repair.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes cohere around the orchard's survival against Guild demolition, with meaningful escalation through the healing sequence using copper twine and glass shards. The tension between preservation and destruction remains active. Deduction for relatively low immediate pressure - the demolition threat stays abstract rather than imminent.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as the curator moves from passive observation to active participation, with clear cost in becoming "footnotes in someone else's first chapter." The dominant stake (accessing forbidden knowledge) tightens when he realizes knowledge demands irreversible participation. Minor deduction for some abstract passages that slightly dilute the pressure mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate effectively from finding the library to navigating the register's demands to the final vault opening. The memory payment creates genuine cost. Pressure coheres well under the accumulative lens as obstacles compound. Slightly weakened by Marrow's late addition which dilutes focus on Ora's central conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from finding the brother to choosing between escape and abandonment, with the "third line" solution emerging from protagonist agency. The ink lily pads requiring spoken story to solidify creates tangible pressure. Cost manifests in accepting shared burden of memory ("memory is lighter in two bodies") and ongoing "trapped freedom."

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal archival curiosity to university-wide reality fractures, with Maris's agency driving the resolution through deliberate rope manipulation. The tightening occurs when wax merges with rope, foreclosing the path of confusion with visible cost (lost absences, filled gaps). Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as rope patterns build toward the illuminating transformation. Slightly limited by lack of opposing force or complication during the merging process.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (finding refuge from noise) established immediately and tightens through failed attempts with the echo stone before the crucial realization about "two silences pollinating." The cost manifests when the mapkeeper must leave the depleted echo stone behind and continue alone. Escalation follows the accumulative lens as pressure builds through "hours passed" and multiple failed techniques.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: 73 nights of failed attempts, then the pattern match, the risky insertion of the hush shard, the vision flood, and finally the beacon's ignition affecting distant rafts. The cost manifests in the prism cracking further and the hush consuming "half the resonance." Stakes remain coherent around proving meaning exists in apparent randomness.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from measuring shadows to discovering the broken sundial to the flood of faces demanding selection. The stake—what fragments to carry forward—tightens when Lira realizes "If she misjudged, some era might vanish." Cost lands clearly when she excises her yearning, though the middle section could apply more pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake of overcoming "the gravity of hopelessness" escalates from personal defiance to collective uprising. Pressure builds through Cyril's infiltration, the guard's discovery, and the spreading rebellion. The transformation from "starless hush" to "temporary galaxies" marks meaningful deepening. Cost remains somewhat abstract—the rebellion succeeds without visible sacrifice or trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to island preservation as Marella's vision reveals the council confrontation's dual paths. The tightening occurs when she sees both her failure through anger and success through restraint, forcing a genuine choice. Cost is visible in her need to suppress justified rage for strategic gain.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake of reconciling opposing philosophies escalates through Father's dangerous climb during gravity inversion, creating immediate physical danger. The narrator's choice to use collected silence to save Father shows agency with clear trade-off (using precious collection for rescue). Cost is visible but the resolution feels slightly smooth given the philosophical divide established.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—teaching silence to comfort—escalates through Gerard's calibrated interventions: from monitoring noise levels to sharing the monastery story to offering the storm glass. The cost appears in the "vaulting hush" that presses "every other sound to the horizon's margin," showing the weight of achieved stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from personal quest to collective legacy as Kestrel confronts the choice between individual power and democratized access. The stairway freezing "half finished" creates genuine pressure requiring decisive action. Cost is visible in her renunciation of the throne, though the resolution feels slightly convenient with the ruby's perfect divisibility.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through breath-teaching sequence: Declin's phantom attempts "fracture," then hold as "small sphere," finally enabling passage. Pressure builds through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate to the textural lens. Cost manifests in Mara's acceptance of perpetual wound-tending: "walked toward the next wound begging for a tutor."

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation works through textural intensification: mushroom glow → glitchy messages → wall liquefaction → corridor pressure → diamond transformation. The "quantum promise" that "whatever she became would echo across every dimension" establishes clear stakes. Cost manifests in "shards of failed timelines" spinning away, though the ease of final success slightly undermines tension.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from finding evidence to confronting its implications—the fraudulent charter that would "evaporate" the dynasty. The moral calculus between truth and chaos provides genuine pressure, though the conflict remains largely internal without external opposition testing Iria's resolve in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulating theatrical pressure—from finding the program to reciting scenes to the scarecrows becoming marionettes to the cosmos-writing climax. The missing final page creates genuine tension, and Caron's choice to "surrender fear" and name the place carries felt cost, though the apple's convenient revelation slightly weakens agency.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: from routine archival work to discovering the button, to recognizing its century-spanning significance, to the risk of bureaucratic resistance, culminating in personal delivery. The dominant stake—whether kindness can magnify across generations—tightens when Mara must convince Director Fulton. Cost becomes legible as Jordan shifts from self-protection to considering service that honors his ancestor's survival.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal rebellion to carrying an entire city's erased history, with the security pursuit forcing immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation reads through textural intensification as the prophecy approaches and Kieran steers it via saxophone into the prism's scrambling effect. The dominant stake—preventing panic through musical silencing—tightens as "stone vowels crawled up the walls, seeking throats to borrow." Cost is legible in his "chest aching from the effort."

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from cataloging leaves to discovering the arbor's hidden purpose to accepting cosmic guardianship, with each revelation narrowing Briony's options toward inevitable transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: failed search → confession etched on tin → striking the reforged coin → following light footprints to Jory.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation as more spirits join the lattice of light, building from single confessions to "hundreds passing through." The dominant stake—healing lost souls through genuine laughter—faces meaningful pressure when the crocodile tooth "rattled, reminding Eluan of the price of half-measures." Cost is visible in Eluan's tears and the transformation of both harp and gorge.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from physical survival (evading drones) to metaphysical quest (solving mercy's equation) with the forest clearing providing sanctuary that enables the mathematical experiment. The protagonist's agency drives the conductivity test that transforms "one divided by zero" into its reciprocal, though the resolution's abstraction ("willingness to invert power") slightly dulls the visceral cost of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal acquisition to cosmic responsibility as Irida realizes "every overlooked history she had yet to carry" waits at "dawn's border." The deepening occurs through accumulation: fragment→painting→sky projection→dissolution, with each stage narrowing options. Cost manifests physically ("bent her knees") and conceptually (the fragment must be surrendered to complete the work).

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from routine service call to supernatural encounter to historical mystery, with Marlen's investigation driving each deepening. The mainspring discovery forces a choice between keeping the valuable artifact or releasing the ghosts. Cost is visible when "ghosts lined the passage, bowing with gratitude" - he loses his spectral companions by solving their imprisonment.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation builds through textural accumulation: whisper release → letters gathering → press activation → reality rupture, with each stage narrowing Ellis's commitment to destabilization. The cost is legible in the library's systemic collapse and transformation, though agency feels slightly predetermined rather than conflicted at the choice point.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.2)
    The archaeological dispute establishes clear stakes early, with Velen's interpretation mattering "less for prestige than for possibility." The chronostorm provides meaningful escalation as time becomes weaponized for discovery, and the revealed inscription "We failed to free ourselves, so we freed the future" forces Velen to confront his own defeats. Cost is visible in the "bronze smoke" taste of victory and acceptance of permanent sorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal summons to world-level threat ("midnight will never end") to Clay's permanent transformation. The guardians' challenge creates meaningful pressure requiring Clay's specific skills. However, the resolution feels slightly predetermined given Clay's established nature.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate through textural accumulation: from surface petrichor collection to psychometric visions to the lagoon's "mirrored curation" to the final impossible scent. The protagonist's agency drives each deepening—following compass tremors, paddling across, stepping onto the platform—though the abstract nature of the final stakes ("answers are impossible souvenirs") reduces visceral pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation works through accumulative deepening: from disorientation to discovery to understanding to creation, with each layer adding complexity ("timewoven alliances," "compacts that allowed different eras to share resources"). The stakes crystallize when Iona accepts her role as emissary and commits to creating the gate. Cost is legible in the extended labor and transformation of purpose, though the middle section could use more immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—solving the grandfather's riddle before winter's end—creates coherent pressure that deepens through discovery rather than reversal. The tightening occurs when Maris deciphers the "botanical instructions" and realizes her grandfather "died before winter fully lifted," forcing her to complete his quest. The cost manifests in her tears of continuation and the ephemeral nature of her creation that "would fade with the coming dawn."

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from cataloging documents to personal retrocognitive seizures to direct temporal communication. The cost is visible in Mara's physical and emotional experience. The tension between "archiving remotely" versus personal investigation creates genuine pressure that narrows options toward the beach encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as each fragment fed to the bottle increases its warmth and radiance, narrowing Silas's path toward the final choice. The child's invitation "Your turn" crystallizes the ultimate stake—complete the revival by sacrificing autonomy. Cost is legible when Silas "let the bottle pull him into its amber dawn," though the middle lacks a sharper tightening moment that would elevate to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether to archive or release the orchard's emotional patterns—escalates from discovering the shaving through the cistern's liquid memory to the apple's instruction. Pressure tightens when Loranth realizes archiving means releasing, forcing him to choose between duty and the city's need. The cost lands visibly as strangers feel "unaccountably lighter" after his choice.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.9)

The tightening occurs when mirrors crack and leak seasons, forcing immediate action with permanent personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds effectively through accumulating pressure: from "horizon bruised purple" through "trembling note" to "first hailstones spattered." The stakes—"If her devices stayed mute, valley towns would be caught unready"—create genuine tension. The deepening occurs when pressure data contradicts the "safe margin for commerce," forcing Mara's choice between protocol and intuition, with merchants' safety as the visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes escalate from routine cleaning to cosmic healing through Janus's agency, with the dominant stake (finding strength in vulnerability) tested when he chooses empathic choreography over protocol. The cost is legible in his transformed relationship to his work and self. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as each discovery deepens meaning rather than reversing direction.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate from seeking the rumored box to accepting eternal stewardship, with the ghosts' pressure and the box's "iron vines [that] would snap if approached with haste" creating genuine obstacles. The cost manifests as Orin's permanent binding: "he would tend this covenant." One meaningful deepening occurs when understanding the settlers' history transforms his choice.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from individual understanding to collective reconfiguration, with the dominant stake (comprehending time before Basil's supply expires) tightening through the urn fragment's discovery. The cost manifests as Basil's "borrowed allotment slipping away" while achieving communion. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens through density increases and pattern breaks, though the middle section's garage sale strategy dilutes urgency slightly before recovering in the descent sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake - proving beauty exists in incompleteness - faces genuine test through the boy's broken kite. Escalation occurs through the repair sequence where failure would invalidate Edda's philosophy. However, the resolution feels somewhat predetermined; the kite's successful flight was never truly in doubt, limiting genuine tension.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal (six months to live) through systematic wire installation to communal revelation, with each stage narrowing Mara's time while expanding the network's reach. The priest's touch of the wire marks a key tightening. Cost is visible in Mara's declining energy ("Sleep now came in translucent slivers") paid against the completed circuit.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.5)
    Escalation works through accumulative density: meteorite contact → path discovery → chemical reaction → portal formation → transformation. The dominant stake (understanding "chemistry of return") tightens through each discovery, with visible cost in the final dissolution. The coincidence of Athan's amber arrival slightly weakens causality.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from passive seed transport to active bird-translation to orchestrating an "aviary parliament" that transforms the battlefield. The dominant stake—healing war-damaged land—deepens as each bird species contributes specific ecological functions (sandpiper's bacteria, heron's silt migration). Cost accumulates in the broken coral accord, the artillery-pitted meadow, and the coachman's solitary mission, though agency remains primarily observational rather than decisional.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes escalate from personal purposelessness to communal reconnection through accumulative pressure. The dominant stake—whether other settlements survived—tightens when the coordinates lead beyond "fractured maps." Cost is visible in leaving the known settlement for uncertain promise, with the "wild hush" shifting from fearful to simply wild.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (maintaining family connection across temporal barrier) deepens through accumulating pressures: darkness, isolation, mysterious intercom voice. The shield's autonomous opening represents meaningful escalation that forces the protagonist to confront real stars versus memory. Cost is legible in the temporal stretch preventing reunion and the acceptance of "blessed pariah" status.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from physical climb to confrontation to world-changing ceremony, with the dominant stake of replacing certainty with uncertainty maintained throughout. The cost appears in bleeding hands, risk of discovery, and the fundamental alteration of prophecy. Slight weakness in the Curator's rapid shift from suspicion to cooperation.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through walking-pattern communication, chess moves, positioning of followers as "living chess problem," to the final "CHECKMATE" reversal. Stakes crystallize around control of historical memory with genuine cost when Ezra risks sharing power. The interregnum deadline provides consistent pressure throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from seeking distraction to risking being "sealed inside a chapter forever," with the bookstore's reorganization creating time pressure that forces rapid action. The protagonist's agency drives the resolution through actively planting talents and speaking the lost word. Cost is visible in accepting home as perpetual journey rather than return. One meaningful deepening occurs when discovering buried talents shifts from pain to possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal guilt through village restoration with clear deepening as Rhaun realizes "the last piece missing was neither tapestry nor maze but the self he had entombed in remorse." The cost manifests in his acceptance of the irreversible past. However, the village's stake feels somewhat disconnected from Rhaun's personal journey until late.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from Vera seeking forgiveness to discovering its unacceptable price (memory loss), then pivoting to create alternative redemption through collaborative art. The Marshal's pursuit transforms into participation, showing meaningful deepening. Cost is visible but the middle section could tighten—some poetry descriptions feel ornamental rather than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through three narrated stories (Glass Rebellion, Clockwork Peninsula, her village) with increasing personal stakes, culminating in self-mending. Each story costs more—from gold trickling to rivulets to internal surging. The workshop's destabilization raises physical stakes while Brielle discovers the final seam lies within herself.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure accumulates through the cave journey's disorientation, culminating in the pool discovery that forces Elias to act on his promise. The dominant stake (keeping a promise to oneself about capturing impossible union) tightens when he must choose to paint the broken mirror. Cost is visible but could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—proving whispers travel farther—escalates through methodical preparation, the synchronized release of both signals, and the waiting for confirmation. The bell's response before the horn's echo provides decisive resolution with implied philosophical cost about the nature of communication.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: first cryptic lessons, then scavenging and building, finally the choice between departure and stewardship. The cost manifests in Marrow's physical transformation and isolation: "Night after night, under moons waxing and waning, her sense of self fluctuates."

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal survival through empathy overload to communal healing strategy, with the glass eye discovery creating genuine risk (council persecution). The tightening occurs when Ilya must speak his feared memory as payment, though middle pressure could intensify further. Cost is visible in the sister confession and risk of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from curiosity about the gesture to discovering the ampoule to accepting responsibility for another's most intimate memory. The investigation deepens through Oswald's method of "observing gaps" which yields two borrowed visions that narrow his understanding toward the truth. Cost becomes visible when Oswald recognizes why the stranger chose him—their shared "witnessed isolation"—though the personal price of bearing this memory could be more dramatically tested.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal guilt to immediate danger as the creek rises, creating time pressure ("choice could not wait for full flood"). The movable-type door requiring his specific chip piece tightens options. The permanent sealing behind them with the flood outside makes the cost visceral, though the sister's rescue feels somewhat convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal nightmares to sovereignty to moral reckoning, with the orb revelation forcing a clear trade-off between power and integrity. The cost is legible ("shredded her name from history"), though the middle section could tighten the pressure between discovery and decision.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake - capturing "density of presence" - evolves from technical challenge to ethical choice when Cressida sees the dual paths of healing/weaponization. The tightening occurs when colors shatter under "old arithmetic," forcing the revaluation. However, the resolution comes too easily; Cressida's renunciation lacks sufficient internal resistance, and Roan's burn feels convenient rather than consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: discovering grave → finding paradoxical scroll → soaring to witness dual timelines → intervening to change fate. The jealousy-as-solvent revelation deepens stakes meaningfully, with clear cost in accepting temporal instability ("neither dead nor alive but adequately footnoted").

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake of restoring purpose after sensory loss escalates through the birthing clamp crisis, forcing Amira to sacrifice the water clock and discover new forms of perception. The cost is visible (cannibalized clock) but the escalation feels somewhat predetermined rather than genuinely pressured. The midwife's urgency creates external pressure but Amira's internal conflict doesn't sufficiently tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: from unfurling parchment to dipping quill in tea, then pressing quill to palm for blood-ink, each gesture raises commitment and cost. The storm's return ("pause between tempests was nearly spent") creates genuine time pressure that forces Seren's final choice, though the middle section could tighten slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from professional column deadline through ghost-hunting to personal culpability when Dulio reveals "I had printed the first rumor," forcing Marisol from exorcist to penitent. The orchard's noon deadline creates external pressure while her choice to channel Dulio's music through her body shows agency accepting physical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulating trials: crossing threshold, climbing spiral stairs, facing the librarian's test, then spiral arbitration itself. Each stage deepens the paradox of "journeying inward while walking out." The final cost—releasing individual separation—emerges from protagonist's testimony that exhausts all human experience.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding time's true nature—escalates from morning hesitation through physical investigation to metaphysical revelation. The discovered billet creates genuine complication, forcing Trond to risk using the mantle clock key. Cost becomes legible in his recognition of centuries of accumulated damage, though the resolution lacks immediate physical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from security breach to existential choice about surrender versus safety. The barrier crossing represents meaningful deepening that forecloses her old path. Cost appears in abandoning her protective role, though the duplicate's arrival lacks sufficient pressure buildup for higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes center on Celeste's need to "forgive chaos" after her father's heart attack, with the subway data-gathering intensifying toward the lantern discovery. The glass-breaking creates visible cost and forecloses her pattern-seeking path. Missing stronger mid-story tightening—the subway observations accumulate without significantly narrowing options until the library arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation works through accumulative deepening—from orchestrating others' connections to confronting personal loss when "the payphone is ringing itself." The cost lands clearly in the recognition scene with the childhood self. The pattern break of the self-call effectively tightens pressure, though additional middle development could strengthen the build.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from professional documentation to moral responsibility when the photograph reveals the undelivered letter. The narrator's proxy delivery ("I slid my note over the photograph") demonstrates agency with immediate consequence ("the pocket flattened"). Cost is legible in accepting perpetual duty: "Carry it only when context changes."

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (curing loneliness) accumulates pressure through gathering strangers, sharing manifests, and the moon rock ritual. Agency manifests as participation rather than traditional conflict. The cost is legible: accepting reciprocal obligation. Escalation could be sharper—the middle section drifts slightly before the ritual tightens focus.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—finding a way to guide lost pilgrims home—intensifies as Oriole must sacrifice her inherited compass and accept a fundamental redefinition of what "mapping" means. The forest's resistance ("knotted chord that refused to resolve") creates genuine pressure. Cost is visible when the compass needle dissolves, though the middle section could tighten slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal failure ("planting wrong seeds") through attempted corrections to the ethical question of intervention itself. The anomaly's surge and self-confrontation image force the narrator to choose between accepting past mistakes or remaining barren, with clear cost in retiring agency.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: twelve captured silences build to the harbor's "low resonant pulse" and finally the burst of visible music. Dawn threatens erasure, creating time pressure. The cost—Harlan's dissolution—is felt but could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through accumulated artistic clues requiring analytical interpretation, narrowing toward the single necessary act of returning the ember. The "stolen match coated in luminous resin" creates specific pressure tied to arrest fear. Cost lands clearly in the seven-year exile and emotional reckoning, though the resolution feels slightly convenient with the archive's immediate forgiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from individual therapy to collective memory-sharing to rebellion against institutional control. Ira's tapping introduces "little syncopations" that cascade into system-wide disruption. The cost lands clearly: memories become "wild vines" escaping protocol, with the director's pale realization confirming the price of lost control.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from exploration to discovery to evasion as security approaches, with Marlin's whisper network providing the solution. The dominant stake—proving whispers travel farther than shouts—gets tested through actual risk when guards pursue. Cost appears in the forced closure of their discovery ("ladder retracted with a clang") and need to hide evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—releasing a suppressed secret about the brother's death—faces coherent pressure through the guardian's silent coaxing and the shutter-pattern ritual. The cost manifests as "warm tears cooled instantly" and the secret loosening into light. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist understands the memory-for-starlight exchange. The "possibility" constellation provides earned transformation rather than resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.5)
    Escalation builds through accumulative density: from solitary chess coach to grotto seeker to town-wide orchestrator, with the magnetic puzzle completing the "blank square" as the decisive intensification. The town's collective pause and children "requesting boards, chalk, explanations" shows meaningful deepening. Stakes cohere around transforming "brittle" first thoughts into contemplative pause.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.0)

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake of authentic grief versus mandated happiness escalates through Marrow's narrated whittling ("carving a corridor where sorrow may walk") to the inspector confrontation. The lamp's glow enabling "perfect compliance" while maintaining the "remade hush" shows meaningful deepening, though physical stakes could intensify.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: breath-poems → stone's pulse → three-day journey → columns rising → collective transformation. The dominant stake of testing whether authentic expression can survive censorship tightens as the columns respond only to truth, forcing the city to confront its post-ban tremor. Cost manifests in the dissolution of old boundaries and the vulnerability of newfound resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—proving beauty exists in imperfection—escalates through collaborative creation where "they breathed together through the concertina reed tongue." The cost manifests in Goran's visible surrender of mastery ("stern shoulders dropped like cooling slag"). One meaningful deepening occurs as both men discover shared truth through flawed glass.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation occurs through deepening - from single note to imperfect humming to full chorus, with the cost visible in Lio's vulnerability ("letting breaths crack and tremble"). The laboratory's forced questioning of its "assumption that purity preserves meaning" represents genuine stakes, though the resolution arrives somewhat smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—transforming grief into generative force—deepens through accumulative pressure as Lenore's crafts evolve from static mourning brooches to dynamic compass lockets. The cost is visible when "She finally cried, not out of ache, but out of space made for tomorrow," showing what was surrendered (raw grief) for what was gained (capacity to heal others). The escalation from personal to communal healing tracks clearly through the origami coordinate system.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through Jonas's gasping recognition when "conversations, festivals, and riots bloom between measures" - his intellectual project transforms into emotional understanding of communal survival. The dominant stake (mapping meaning from collapse) tightens as cards reveal "Trust pools survive even when wallets evaporate." Cost registers in Jonas's "steadiness cracking" and final offering of the coinless wallet.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: from waiting alone, to following intuition, to circling the pagoda, to descending where "twilight could not follow," culminating in knowledge that "threatened to erase me." The cost is legible in accepting both "beauty and the ruin," though the middle section could tighten slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from archival comparison to active quest when the shadow appears, then heighten with Eira's revelation about her grandmother. The charter restriction creates genuine cost when Eira must descend alone. The final acceptance that "preserving hope sometimes means allowing unanswered frames" shows earned transformation under accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reconstructing self-respect versus maintaining deception—escalates through physical acts of destruction and reconstruction. The ritual deepens from cutting words to burning fabric to rewriting truth. However, the conflict lacks external pressure during the workshop scene; all resistance is internal, missing opportunity for complication.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal wound exploration to saving a dying child, with the hourglass timer adding pressure. The plants' revelations ("The miracle is displaced") create the central reversal that reframes Odelia's self-surgery from pathological to altruistic. Cost accumulates through pain and blood loss, though the instant healing undercuts lasting consequence. The protagonist's agency drives all key turns—choosing to cut, following plant guidance, transferring the miracle.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake (finding/releasing unused love) is clear from line 6. Escalation occurs through deepening discovery - from touching film to projecting images to releasing love into circulation. However, lacks genuine opposition or meaningful obstacles; Mira's journey proceeds without significant resistance or personal cost beyond "trembling hands."

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through Ilya's progressive sacrifice, from physical exhaustion to surrendering his imaginative core. The "seventh ghost month" marks meaningful deepening, and the cost is legible when he becomes "both lighter and emptied." However, the middle sections could tighten - the seasonal passage feels somewhat static before the comet's arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from preserving the archive to actively cultivating it, with Lira's arrival forcing Silas to choose between passive transport and active tending. The cost manifests as Silas becoming "a hinge between what was lost and what might arise" - a permanent transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from passive translocation to active choice ("for the first time he chose a destination"), with the gear serving as the pivotal object that transforms the observatory and enables Jonas's agency. The tension between surrender and control provides coherent pressure. Minor limitation: the philosophical stakes, while consistent, lack visceral urgency that would elevate to higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from harbor departure through "detours curved like question marks" to the ridge's forking paths where "every choice a whisper." The dominant stake—finding courage after breaking free—intensifies at the clearing where Lis must wait in stillness. Cost appears in the image of abandoned restraints, though Lis's personal sacrifice beyond time and uncertainty could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake of safety versus expression escalates from Ellis's internal questioning through Mara's arrival to the pivotal bolt removal, with visible cost in risking "avalanches or marauders." The tightening occurs when Ellis must choose between fortress law and human need, though middle development could deepen further.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from coded warnings to direct confrontation with clear tightening when "doubt crept like ivy toward the gilded throne." The rune of drift's effect on the proclamation narrows the pretender's options. Cost is visible in the court's "collective vertigo" and the pretender "stared at his own vanishing."

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative discovery: torn atlas → hidden labyrinth → matching patterns → negative elevations → underground cavity → the stone door. Each revelation deepens pressure toward the final descent. Cost manifests in Mara's note acknowledging potential non-return.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through textural accumulation: from surface searching to descent, from individual hum to "choir buried alive," culminating in the satellite's answering thruster-flick.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: from retrieving the kite to decoding its script to navigating scalding waters to making the pledge.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: from solitary dawn walks to leading thirteen strangers through embodied calm while thunder triggers her own freeze response.

Cost is visible when Malik's touch guides her "back into cadence," showing vulnerability's price.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake of redemption/understanding his mother's fate escalates through the library's shifting reality, mirror fragments showing bleeding portraits, and water forcing him downward. The final surrender to darkness shows agency through renunciation with clear cost. Could benefit from more concrete intermediate pressures between discovery beats.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from missing persons to discovering a time-harvesting mechanism that could "power weapons, empires, or even immortality," with Sulin's anger transforming from frustration to clarity. His final descent into the glyph well represents agency through calculated risk, accepting unknown temporal consequences to pursue justice.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal risk through technical challenge to shared conspiracy, with Ila's agency driving each turn.

Cost is visible in both characters' acceptance of danger, though the final reply arrives somewhat easily.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation works through mounting pressure: dome damage → father's warning → council arrival → negotiation. The shift from "barbed certainty" to accepting soil samples shows meaningful de-escalation earned through Amber's method. Stakes remain somewhat abstract—"requisition the glass" lacks visceral immediacy of what failure means for Amber personally.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from catching an echo to confronting divine warning ("release or be unmade") with Arlen's agency driving the resolution. The cost lands clearly in his choice to free what he caught, though the middle section could tighten the pressure between capture and release.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from curiosity to moral reckoning, with the floodgate revelation forcing a choice between family loyalty and justice.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—Lin's need to quiet his guilt—escalates through discovery of the ritual letters to the decisive tethering act.

The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as meteor whispers thicken to culminate in the transfer.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes center on discovering meaning through the mandala, with tension building as participants gather and contribute. The revelation of the kitchen table image provides a meaningful deepening that reweights expectations. However, the resolution lacks visceral cost—everyone departs "strangely lighter" without dramatized struggle or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal burden (feeling the plaza's pain) through collaborative ritual (arranging tesserae) to collective transformation (renaming Solaryn).

Cost is visible in Aarik's physical channeling of voices and the sky's silver-veined scarring.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.9)
    Escalation builds through sensory accumulation toward the time-braiding moment, with the protagonist actively choosing to throw the "rope of sound." The cost—abandoning punctual routine for possibility—lands but feels slightly lightweight given the story's metaphysical stakes. The conflict resolves through the protagonist's agency, though the mechanics of "breathing echoes" remain somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes escalate from scientific curiosity to validated discovery to corporate threat requiring protective action. The intrusion ("metallic and cold") forces immediate tactical shift to "protocol two." Cost is visible but could be sharper - we see disconnection but the full price of abandoning the experiment lacks visceral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.6)

The tension builds through environmental pressures (lowering ceiling, floating water, fissure opening) that force increasingly committed choices, culminating in his acceptance of permanent isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: from tangled prophecy to button arrangement to the risky unsealing of the canyon echo, each action deepens pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: glyphs written, figure emerging, gear revealed, collaborative repair. The dominant stake (whether trust can be rebuilt) tightens when they work "side by side" with visible cost in their matched burns. Minor limitation: the resolution feels slightly predetermined once Elias appears.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes build from waiting for an uncertain passenger to the woman's need to unknot family history, culminating in mutual release. The cost manifests in "former questions he had never dared relinquish" and the woman's transformation from "unblinking" to "luminous."

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding why places resist change—escalates through the timeline fractures revealing "virgin green, prosperous hive-song, and charred desolation" simultaneously. Pressure coheres when Rua realizes he must offer vessels for the oasis's oldest promise, with visible cost in accepting temporal instability. The deepening from observation to participation drives the closure effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate from personal (sister's hope) to communal (city's light) through Milo's discovery. The prism's widening fissure creates time pressure and forces the choice to bring Nara. Cost is visible when they commit to permanent guardianship, though the transformation of stakes from individual to collective feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal isolation through reincarnation memory to responsibility for "civilizations brewing below." The library's tilting "suggesting I choose quickly" creates time pressure. Cost is visible in leaving the familiar library for uncertain "thunderheads," though the middle section could tighten—the stone circle sequence feels slightly prolonged before the decisive migration.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes deepen from seeking "the thread that connects all things" to confronting her role as secret-keeper when the filament offers redistribution without memory. The water's directive to "follow" creates causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preventing cosmic exploitation of human division—escalates from signal detection through Calvin's betrayal to Mina's counter-broadcast, with each beat narrowing options.

The tricksters' retreat confirms the stakes were real.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    Central stake (retrieving the key to prevent starvation) drives consistent pressure through architectural obstacles. The spatial mutiny creates escalating challenges requiring negotiation rather than force. However, the resolution feels slightly too neat—the architecture's compliance with geometric diplomacy lacks sufficient cost or trade-off to fully earn the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes escalate from missing evidence to exposing a decade-old conspiracy through Samara's unique ability to see "emotional geometry" without faces.

Yet the resolution feels too neat with immediate confessions and promised leniency diluting the earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure: archive discovery → phrase emergence → storm breach → channel opening → exchange requirement. The "exile requires exchange, not rescue" revelation forces a genuine trade-off. Cost is legible in the final loan metaphor and Havel's continued waiting.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from witnessing dissolution to active participation in possibility-creation, with the scaffold corridor serving as the tightening mechanism. Avery's agency manifests through music—"every bar he played, the lens brightened"—with visible cost in foreclosing return to his previous passive observation. The transformation from "luminous disbelief" to active bridge-building demonstrates earned escalation under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.5)
    Escalation operates through accumulative deepening: from placing bills as territorial markers to recognizing the truckers' memorial loop as "a living territorial marker" that crashed their algorithm. The cost is legible—their company collapsed against this human resistance, and they must now "walk listening" rather than optimizing.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal quest to communal healing as Mira realizes Ariston's fatal flaw—denying shared burdens. The pressure deepens when she overlays star patterns onto inscriptions, forcing the choice between hoarding or sharing knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from seeking a memory to confronting her deepest shame about abandoning her sister. The mirror trap forces genuine trade-off between self-punishment and unbending.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal communion to covenant restoration to maze-wide transformation. The protagonist's agency drives each escalation through deliberate self-wounding. Cost accumulates visibly: opened scars, blood mingling with sap, permanent white lines mapping the spiral.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate clearly: from offering the card, to surrendering her dreamed futures, to accepting the hollow ballast. The dominant stake (saving Mira) faces genuine cost when Liora sees "herself, older, scarred, wandering empty wards." Agency drives the resolution through Liora's choices. Minor deduction because the Keeper's role is somewhat passive—more facilitator than active opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from professional redemption to emotional reckoning as Gideon discovers not just recordings but Mara's "fearless ache" captured in them. The pressure tightens when he realizes the tapes offer "proof that failure is not finale," though the discovery itself arrives without significant obstacle or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes center on understanding "the physics of transition" between life and death, with clear escalation through the seed's discovery, translation, and activation. The pressure builds through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate to the textural lens. Cost is visible in Aram's acceptance that "understanding never captures a spirit; it only offers it safer passage."

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: from finding the creel to releasing identities to their transformation via paradox. The cost manifests as "tomorrow disappears" and identities risk "rotting into sameness." The pressure builds appropriately for the textural lens, though the abstract nature of the conflict limits visceral tension.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation works through accumulative deepening: discovery→reading→understanding→confession→mission. The dominant stake (Roan's emotional barricades) intensifies through forced vulnerability. Cost is visible in his tears and the price of his confession, though the resolution arrives somewhat smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes clearly established (seeking self-forgiveness through chronicling) with escalation through discovery sequence: maps → graffiti wisdom → culvert → Mara → collaborative redemption. The pressure builds accumulatively rather than causally, appropriate to the lens. Cost is visible in the dawn labor and emotional vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (finding and accessing the library) escalates through pattern recognition and the silence requirement. The third letter's threat creates time pressure, and the discovery that time runs backward inside the library meaningfully reweights options. However, the resolution lacks a sharp trade-off - gaining the library's wisdom comes at minimal dramatized cost beyond releasing her own words.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to empire-wide revelation as the violin's music spreads through botanical networks, forcing the empire to confront its theft. The cost manifests physically ("Empire banners wilted") and conceptually as amnesia lifts, though the middle lacks a sharp tightening moment.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as Lysandra navigates the "threshold of stillness," with stakes tightening when she must balance between fracturing the spark and alerting oblivion.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—finding contentment after forgiveness—is signaled early and deepens through Simeon's climb and reflection. The internal pressure tightens as he confronts whether he truly released resentment, culminating in the decisive act of releasing the hairpin with clear cost. While escalation is present, the middle section could strengthen the pressure between doubt and discovery rather than relying on contemplation.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from seeking external validation ("conscience for hire") to internal transformation through the lighthouse's wind chime teachings. The protagonist's agency drives the ascent and decoding work, with visible cost in releasing both the mirror shard and certainty. The "fee" structure creates genuine pressure—pay with the conclusion reached.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake of learning to vanish progresses through clear escalation: stone-throwing lesson, chalk circle paradox, then dissolution. Rowan's agency drives the transformation when he steps into the circle "without desire," triggering the grotto's response. Cost appears in his terror and the permanent change implied by Mira not calling him back, though the stakes could sharpen further.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from seeking knowledge to testing devotion ("the canyon testing his devotion") to wielding reality-altering power, with the critical turn at "to navigate without moving was to persuade the world to move instead." The renunciation to share rather than rule shows clear agency with cost, though middle escalation could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal inadequacy through confronting automated creativity to achieving a new form of mastery that "accommodates impossibility." The keystone's increasing luminance and the architecture's responsiveness to belief create pressure that culminates in Felius's spell warming the entire spire. Cost is clear: the automated systems fail while he succeeds through embracing limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (discovering sound's color) escalates from internal longing through physical quest to public transformation. The tightening occurs when Emil must overcome his pattern of "hiding behind truth" to speak his vow aloud. Cost becomes visible as his declaration transforms the festival night, though middle pressure could intensify.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—whether to follow the backwards prophecy—escalates from personal doubt through the coin-casting ritual to the colony-wide decision, with the "starlight dimmed another shade" providing temporal pressure. The cost is legible in the potential for "annihilation" and the mixed reactions, though the conflict lacks a meaningful middle complication or reversal beyond the coin standing upright.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from hearing echoes to naming monsters to confronting "silence with teeth" that threatens to consume light itself. The progression from passive reception to active naming to collaborative weaving shows clear intensification. Cost becomes visible when naming requires "crystallizing horrors into words through scattered light."

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal ritual to cosmic rebalancing when "fish rose out of the sea" and gravity fails. The reversal when water threatens to "drown its newfound levity" forces Orin's decisive sacrifice of his own sweat.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes build through accumulative pressure as each photograph deepens Mara's commitment, from pocketing a shard to actively disobeying regulations. The ticking clock of "buying herself hours" before "rains return" creates genuine urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—balancing transcendence against remaining human—escalates through the crystal's internal flame and the tree's memory exchange, with clear cost in Sera's choice to remain flesh.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes crystallize around preventing the convoy's breach of the ceasefire. Escalation occurs through the pattern recognition, command's doubt, and Mara's tactical revision. The one-hour window creates genuine pressure. However, the conflict lacks visceral immediacy - the danger remains distant and theoretical rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes center on reclaiming feeling through confronting identity fragmentation. The complementary breathing sequence meaningfully deepens pressure through synchronization. Cost is visible in the clones' dissolution and Mara's tears. The accumulative build works but lacks a sharper tightening moment.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.6)
    The seed's unexpectedly rapid germination ("minutes earlier it had been intact") creates escalating pressure that forces Maren from contemplation to immediate action—adjusting vents, planning ducts, documenting growth. Her agency drives every response, with visible cost in accepting the professional risk of incorporating "a stench that stopped thought" into her business.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes establish early (restoring laughter to a grief-frozen household) and escalate through accumulating sensory pressure as sound moves upward through the house, forcing emotional confrontation. The cost manifests in the parents' physical reactions and the risk of disturbing the child's memory, though the resolution feels slightly predetermined rather than truly contested.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative density from solitary waiting → pendant discovery → dimensional stretching → entity encounter → transformation, with clear cost in becoming "an annex open to weather." The stakes deepen from simple guardian duty to existential choice about certainty versus potential, though the middle cultist section slightly diffuses focus.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ritual's escalation through "successive approximation" creates coherent pressure - each element (obsidian spiral, mercury, rose ash, tear) deepens the stakes until the final confession forces the decisive change. The cost is legible in Everard stripping away his "mask of hopelessness" and speaking his humiliations, with the crozier's restoration directly tied to this vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from receiving a signal to physical descent into the gorge to sacrificing her receiver—each choice narrows options. The dominant stake (finding beginnings in endings to combat homeland silence) coheres through meaningful deepening as Mara must "let go of gravity, of language, of failure." Cost is visible: the fragment becomes "only warm glass" and she must "crank back upward."

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from missing ferry to existential threading of timelines, with Milo's agency driving resolution through the hourglass. The dominant stake—reuniting fractured possibilities—tightens when passengers flicker between decades. Cost appears in solidifying choices that foreclose other versions.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: threads tighten progressively, doorways multiply "like rings on water," until the structure threatens "to collapse into a single luminous knot."

The stake—whether connection can be woven without destroying all involved—faces direct test with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from teaching navigation without sky to discovering the aliens are guides, forcing a complete reconception of knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure builds through accumulating sensory signals - from whisper to ticks to giggle to coordinates. The dominant stake (protecting vulnerable voices) tightens when Mira discovers the trapped recordings. Cost is visible when she sacrifices her lantern's power. One meaningful deepening occurs when the boy's true nature is revealed.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulating sensory pressure and narrowing time constraints as Lira descends, activates the gate despite alarms, then races the returning tide. The cost is legible in her physical struggle and the risk of drowning, though the vapor-souls' appearance could create stronger immediate opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (exchanging memory for wisdom) escalates from radio contact through ink patterns to the final sacrifice. The ghost's demand "you must decide what to sacrifice" creates genuine pressure that forces Mara's choice. Cost is visible in the irreversible loss of the tape, though the middle section could tighten slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate effectively under the accumulative lens through density increase: from distant echoes to "arguing" overlaps to the language "dying in real time." The siphon glyph warning creates genuine urgency. The diamond's crack releasing a "final chord that sealed the passage" provides clear cost. Slight deduction as the physical danger could have been more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from professional investigation to personal confrontation when Milo recognizes Devon's laughter in the mulch vibrations. The dominant stake—recovering or understanding Devon's fate—tightens when Milo must offer his own bitterness as "seeds" to coax out the creature, with clear cost in exposing childhood resentments.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation builds through accumulating pressures: drones scanning, the girl's request testing his values, the storm's increasing volatility. The dominant stake - whether to deliver, hide, or release the storm - tightens as each beat narrows options. Cost manifests in the irreversible transformation of the postal system itself.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—reviving possibility from abandonment—escalates through Marlo's singing that "wakes sleeping paint" and his forging of copper chimes to align with the halo. The cost manifests in his relinquishing solitary custodianship. Slight deduction for the angel's arrival feeling somewhat unearned despite the magical realism frame.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (finding where stories live before embodiment) signals early and tightens when the unwritten corridor opens but denies immediate fulfillment. The patron interruption creates genuine obstacle to his work. Cost becomes legible when stories refuse to come until he learns to "shelve silence" - foreclosing immediate success while opening future possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: dream circling "like a wary seabird," then emerging but shredding its outline, then recoiling from the palette's "smell of conclusion," forcing Callix's tactical shift from pigment to pure light. The cost manifests in Callix's renunciation of full capture, choosing stewardship over ownership with visible consequence in keeping only a negative.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—freeing an idea trapped by fear—escalates through discovery (the box's nature), action (using starlight and breath), and resolution (the syllable's release affecting the entire city). Cost is visible in the woman's original sacrifice (cutting her hair) and the city's disorientation. The conflict deepens as Orin must navigate both physical locks and psychological barriers.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds from discovery to mapping to the pivotal decision to break protocol, with clear cost in abandoning "every careful protocol she'd ever practiced." The stake (recovering memories before complete erosion) tightens through the mushroom's demand for reciprocation, though middle pressure could intensify further.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulating pressure: teaching resilience, Harl's arrival, the opened crate releasing weaponized shadows. The geometric circle Rafe traces redirects violence, showing agency. Cost is visible in the torn warrant, though the stakes could press harder on personal sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on preserving wonder in a graying village, with escalation through the seed's cracking, ribbon weaving, and tree transformation. The cost appears in Orien and Liora's exhaustion and their lifelong commitment to pruning fear, though the village-wide impact arrives too easily without sufficient resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure as each knot releases more memory and the spirits grow more agitated. The revelation about the actor versus fishermen provides meaningful deepening. Cost appears in the transformation required and the "vast, quiet sea" Neris carries afterward, though the resolution feels slightly neat.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes build through accumulative pressure as each discovery deepens the mystery—from torn map to hidden coastline to bronze cylinder—with Levin's pressing on algae-darkened plaster representing agency despite hesitation. The dominant stake of completing his mentor's work achieves meaningful deepening when he realizes the practice requires listening rather than naming, though the final renunciation could carry more visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from external discovery (Earhart) to personal quest (Jonah) to the wire's revelation about productive failure, with each layer deepening the cost of holding on. The final model of "tensions and releases" shows agency through attention rather than action. Stakes remain somewhat abstract in places, particularly Death's presence which doesn't create concrete pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—articulating unspoken digital needs before "servers rotted"—escalates through the ghost's revelation of "unsent apologies that still pulsed like open circuits." Pressure coheres as storm timing creates urgency. The trade-off is clear: anonymous service over recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake of connection-through-understanding escalates cleanly from rehearsed conversations through diary discovery to the whispered line exchange. The elevator's ascent provides natural time pressure. Cost is visible in the risk taken and the "cautious step" of anguish retreating, though the resolution feels slightly too neat.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation follows accumulative logic as Eira moves from observation to experimentation to embodied proof, with each action raising stakes—releasing ballast creates "audible hush," transmitting data as tonal pips, finally stepping into absence herself. The cost is unmistakable in her fall, though middle pressure could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal limitation through the observatory deadline to the arrival of demolition crews, with Liora's blindfolded painting as the decisive risk. The pressure coheres well under the accumulative lens as density increases toward the climax. Minor weakness in the somewhat passive resolution where others (crews, city) react rather than Liora facing a final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to risking the ship's navigation on Aleksei's theory. The captain's trust becomes the crucible that forces commitment. Cost is visible when they "stoke engines" and change course based on chalk marks, though the resolution arrives somewhat easily once the decision is made.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: climbing frost-stung stairs, discovering mirrors instead of books, assembling prophecy fragments, confronting painful reflections. The dominant stake (learning repair's true rhythm) tightens when Selene must apologize to her most painful mirror to receive the crystal heart, foreclosing her path as mere fixer.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate from personal tending to planetary survival, with the bell-ringing creating a meaningful pivot that transforms individual to collective action. The tension between doubt ("who would believe metal ringing") and necessity drives the middle turn. Cost is visible in the exhaustion and risk, though agency sometimes diffuses into collective action rather than staying with the narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from abstract duty to personal sacrifice as Mara moves from listening to the gears' "eight more revolutions" to inserting the dangerous key that risks "jammed cogs and her own unspooled existence." The cost manifests concretely when she relinquishes her heartbeat. One meaningful deepening occurs as the puppet head transforms the mechanism, forcing her ultimate choice.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from orchard duty to discovering the blueprint to racing the frost deadline. The mechanical birds shift from obstacle to redirected guardians through Liora's amber-light manipulation. Cost is visible in sweat, risk of falling, and the foreclosed possibility of failure once frost forms.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake - reconciliation with Mara while atoning for the dolphins - establishes early and deepens through the river insight. Talitha's agency drives the resolution through creating the restorative polymer. Cost accumulates visibly (resignation, isolation, guilt), though the conflict could tighten further through more immediate obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulating imagery—from selling slates to ascending ladders to reaching the "nucleus of the orchard." The parole's time limit creates genuine pressure ("time unspooled faster inside inspiration's canopy"), and Kes's choice costs him his inherited moonlight.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from professional commission to existential threat as the pavilion "would unfreeze completely and drown the fortress." The contagion mechanism creates genuine cost when "sorrow ricocheted back." The dominant stake of removing vs redistributing remorse tightens effectively, though the pavilion's sudden ultimatum feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from hearing the elevator's plea to sacrificing the clock's functionality for a "greater voice." The dominant stake—healing isolation through connection—tightens when Lysandra must choose between preserving the clock's precision and enabling communication. Cost is legible: "Unity outweighed precision, and both structures understood the trade."

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.6)
    The central tension between excavating/possessing versus cataloging/releasing builds through Rhea's interaction with the mirror, with "fear brushed her thoughts, but curiosity pushed harder" marking the pivot. The cost materializes when she must accept custodianship over possession, though the escalation could be sharper—the transformation happens smoothly without significant resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.0)
    The sixty-minute countdown creates urgency, and gravity inversion raises physical stakes while enabling vault access. The escalation from descent to threshold crossing to cabinet unlocking follows clear pressure points. However, the resolution lacks a sharper trade-off—Quillon succeeds without paying a visible price beyond implied future responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on completing a generations-old artistic failure through a new method. Pressure builds through the careful assembly of the instrument and the waiting for the right moment. The final performance delivers on this stake with the grove's transformation, though the cost could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as each chess move correlates to moral weight via magnetic pulls, with the queen sacrifice representing peak agency. The dominant stake—redeeming exile through discovering beauty in difficulty—tightens as the game reopens his banishment wound while promising closure. Cost is legible in his final state: peaceful but still exiled, teaching what he learned rather than returning.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—recovering the diary without destroying it—escalates through layered obstacles: physical (corroded clasp), emotional (unresolved quarrel), and spiritual (psychic latch of regret). Each sonic intervention deepens the challenge, from mapping stress fractures to dissolving rust to reconciling grief. The cost manifests in Lysander's choice to remain alone cataloging rather than joining the communal celebration, though the conflict could benefit from more active resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (cultivating portable peace) faces meaningful opposition from the elders' fear. The tension tightens when Liora must germinate outside the village, forcing a trade-off between proximity and purpose. Cost is visible in the transformation of both Liora and the village, though escalation could intensify further.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (finding the source of resilience to save dying orchards) is clear early and tightens through the one-hour time constraint. Escalation works through accumulation: following water → entering chamber → assembling spear → racing gravity's return. The cost is legible (sanctum crushing, limited time) though agency could be stronger in the chamber sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from investigation to discovery of the null spot to active intervention. Mara's agency drives the resolution through analyzing patterns and implementing countermeasures. Cost is legible in the risk of the thunderclap and the thousand-hour margin earned. The tightening from passive observation to active prevention works well under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through deepening revelation—from unfettering hush to preventing hollow echo across generations ("If she failed now, the first impact would echo hollow"). Each bell strike risks more: first warming, then revealing darkness, finally transforming marble, with the amber sheet's fragility as persistent constraint throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure from the physical climb to the metaphysical corridor opening, with Kalen's agency driving each step. The cost appears in "each failure mirrored a different choice" and the revelation that his obsession creates the very failure he seeks to understand. The final transformation where "the corridor rewove" carries visible consequence in the changed markers.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal commission to cosmic restoration as stars vanish completely. The pressure coheres around Dreya's choice to embrace ambiguity over precision, with visible cost in the "bruised ribs" and retained personality fragments. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes "the universe was waiting to be reassured."

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes deepen from routine delivery to understanding relics "refuse delivery" and choose their homes. The tavern scene creates meaningful pressure through the farmer's amazement, building to Tren's renunciation. Cost is visible in abandoning his courier mission, though escalation could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: first the sailor's shame, then lovers' joy, creating an "emotional tide swing" that tests Ilara's grounding. The dominant stake (proving objects absorb emotions) tightens when she realizes the peril of inherited storms. Cost is legible but could be more visceral in the moment of realization.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (delivering the message despite impossible barriers) escalates through the revelation that "every thread carrying memory must pay toll to distance" - Ira aging with each shuttle pass. The cost accumulates visibly, though the middle section could tighten the pressure more before the sacrifice reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate from personal forge repair to communal reconstruction through the memory-sacrifice system. The dominant stake (rebuilding after disaster) tightens when villagers must trade painful memories for structural strength. Cost accumulates visibly as each surrendered memory brightens the silk and strengthens structures, though individual agency sometimes dissolves into collective action.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal quest to protecting reality from weaponization, with Kael's agency driving the tunnel navigation and final choice. The sister's revelation reframes everything, forcing him to choose between discovery and concealment with clear cost. Minor deduction because the antagonistic "employers" remain abstract rather than embodied pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—protecting against encroaching darkness—escalates from physical (extinguished lamp) through supernatural (haunted presence) to existential (chain letter tradition). Ellis's agency drives the resolution through his stone-stacking reply and naming of the glass. The cost is legible: accepting permanent guardianship. Minor deduction for the supernatural threat remaining somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from listening to riddles→accepting the wick→rotating it→feeling the world pivot. The dominant stake (steering tomorrow's narrative) tightens when "the prism fed on yesterday in order to mint tomorrow." Cost is visible in Mora's dual state and the herald's warning about perpetual stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake (understanding story magnetism) tightens through progressive revelations: the boy's tale tugging at her sternum, the elder's warning about gravity crushing, and the final pigment creation. However, the middle section lacks a decisive pressure point where Liora must choose between competing options. The cost becomes visible only in the final transformation to offering rather than seeking.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation works through accumulation: from maintenance duty to dismantling intention to actual transformation. The "pin drop" moment effectively crystallizes agency. Cost is visible in the sorrow's conversion and Eron abandoning his role ("locked the maze's service gate"). Could strengthen the middle stakes around what Eron risks by abandoning duty.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from maintaining order to save dying lamps toward understanding that separation itself causes the realm's death. The narrator's tearing of the logbook represents meaningful agency with clear cost—abandoning their life's work. However, the swaddled guide's appearance feels slightly convenient rather than earned through protagonist pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from finding invitation to descending stairs to receiving the ledger to choosing departure over hoarding. The dominant stake—whether to remain hidden or share wisdom—crystallizes when Lowell must choose between clutching the book underground or carrying it to daylight. The "one lunar cycle" constraint adds temporal pressure to his stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen appropriately for accumulative mode as Elias moves from cataloguing loss to active intervention, with the tea ceremony crystallizing his guilt about passive observation. The cost of his choice—committing to "heuristically gentle insurgency" despite no guarantee of success—is visible. Missing higher bands because escalation relies more on revelation than active pressure, though this fits the contemplative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake - completing the inventory/filling the void - escalates from routine measurement to confronting buried trauma. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as silence frequencies lead to the projection. However, Quillan faces limited external opposition; the conflict is primarily internal discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate causally from Clara's need → market navigation → Cinder's intrusion breaking the truce → imminent destruction. The sunrise deadline creates persistent pressure. Clara's agency drives resolution through her single word "Truce" that resets the market's wrath, though Cinder's quick capitulation slightly weakens the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation occurs through taste-based discovery leading to alliance proposal and joint persuasion of the cedar council. The sanctuary verdict with "contingent" conditions creates meaningful stakes, though the resolution feels slightly convenient without showing opposition or genuine risk to the weather-carriers.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from creative paralysis to confronting sister's death to sacrificing perfect memory, with each deepening forcing harder choices. The cost is legible as Elara must speak aloud and release each remembered portrait to unlock creativity. Deduction because the middle section relies somewhat on discovery rather than active pressure, though the final sacrifice lands with clear agency.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal (Cressida's need for honesty) through discovery (the map and Archive) to communal transformation as citizens join in planting truth-seeds. The dominant stake—whether honesty can restore a poisoned world—tightens when they realize conversations must return to their soil, though the resolution relies somewhat on magical thinking about how truth cleanses toxins.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (preserving wonder through the sculpture) escalates through council's structural concerns, then the discovered hairline crack threatening the iceberg. Arlen's agency manifests through kinetic design, silent demonstration, and preventive repair "measured by heartbeats rather than hammers." Cost is visible in accepting cyclic muteness while ensuring continuity. Could strengthen with more immediate physical risk during the repair sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds clearly from internal static to magnetic storm threat to the realization that amplified fears will shatter the dome, forcing the containment choice. The controlled burn represents genuine agency with visible cost in the scorched perimeter, though the middle section could tighten the causal link between recognizing the threat and choosing fire.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake (proving listening heals through solving the mailbox mystery) escalates through accumulation of stories that tighten toward revelation. Mr. Cardoza's confession about locking the box himself creates a meaningful reversal with visible cost in his shame and trembling hands. The pressure coheres under the textural lens as each neighbor's contribution builds toward the emotional payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from infiltration to data liberation to laboratory destruction, with each phase narrowing Lira's options. The dice's dual function (authorization then trap) creates meaningful reversal. The confrontation with Vane forces a choice between revenge and mercy that lands with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal memory loss to town-wide amnesia, with tangible pressure (dawn deadline, gravity pockets pulling her down). The dominant stake—recovering deleted memories—tightens when Kerrin discovers her own infant self is the key. Cost is clear: years of foggy half-life, though the final resolution of "steady hands and steady past" arrives somewhat easily.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from general threat ("unmake borders and children") through specific discovery of the hidden vowel to the sky's temptation to scream the forbidden sound. The summoner's agency drives each step, with visible cost in the erasure of violent memories. The tightening occurs when he must physically extract the dangerous vowel.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: from learning brick words to mastering the First Lie's glyphs, culminating in the weight of carrying lessons "somewhere the bricks could not reach."

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from Mara's personal quest to the revelation of her brother's sacrifice, with the shell's restoration serving as tangible proof of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal mission to empire-wide change through the act of forgery. The memory toll and blood sacrifice show clear cost. Agency drives every beat. Minor deduction for the automaton's transformation feeling slightly convenient despite setup.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.9)
    The countdown creates urgency that escalates from ten to zero, forcing Silva's journey and descent. The pact negotiation shows clear trade-offs: freedom from "involuntary resonance" for others versus Silva carrying chosen memories herself.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from monks' silence through dream-navigation to confronting denial, with Mara's exposure of truth as the decisive act.

Slightly abstract in places but pressure coheres under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake of understanding Cang-E's wandering moon path deepens through the net-on-water solution, with visible cost in the straining arms.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from investigating a hoax to protecting humanity's potential sanctuary. The dominant stake - truth versus protection - tightens when Mara discovers the stillpoint's vulnerability to exploitation. Cost is clear in her choosing secrecy over her identity as a truth-seeker. The conflict could use one more beat of active pressure before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—birthing a new dawn to end the warring kingdoms' "variant allegiance"—escalates from receiving prophecies to finding Elara to the final storm confrontation.

However, the resolution lacks visceral opposition; the transformation happens too smoothly without meaningful resistance to Elara's power.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake of preserving/transmitting memory escalates through the family's arrival and peaks when the grandmother's hum reconnects them.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from rumored raid to actual attack, with the sonic barricade forcing raiders to confront their own greed as physical revulsion. The dominant stake—protecting the relic that maintains coastal order—faces concrete test when the "black cutter slicing crimson water" arrives. Cost manifests as Callix's exhaustion and raiders' visceral shame, though the resolution feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.5)
    Under the Accumulative lens, escalation builds through density increase from abstract concept ("patient revolution") to concrete engineering (planting copper rods, measuring azimuths) to transformation (viaduct blazing). The deepening from theoretical to embodied change narrows the narrator's options with visible cost in their vow to "rechart every impatient road."

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from investigation to rescue to evidence discovery. The worker's trapped state creates immediate pressure; finding the ledgers transforms personal investigation into public accountability. Cost visible in the worker's injury and systemic corruption exposed. One meaningful tightening achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes deepen from technical repair to moral reckoning, with Maeve's realization that "apology etched in brass is weightier than ink" forcing her stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (creating an unheard bell) tightens through the arrow-ricochet discovery and culminates in the bell actually working but calling to things rather than people - a meaningful deepening. Cost is visible when the bell's success comes with isolation. Escalation is subtle but present under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: numbers appearing everywhere → coordinates → hidden voice memos → restoration attempt → system buckling → public broadcast.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake of finding/becoming the "courageous anomaly" drives escalation from patrol→mirror vision→sprint→descent→partnership. Pressure tightens as Mara moves from observer to active participant, with visible cost in abandoning safety.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulative density—from solitary pier arrival to trawling work to communal shelter during the blizzard, each phase deepening Mara's understanding of endings' "many dialects." The harmonica moment creates meaningful pressure that forces stance crystallization, though the cost could be more viscerally felt in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation works through accumulative deepening rather than reversals—from silence to conversation to metaphorical instruction to acceptance. The dominant stake (finding meaning after language work dried up) tightens as vineyard parallels reveal new purpose. Cost is visible but could be more visceral in the narrator's renunciation of conventional work.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving wisdom without corrupting it through speech—is established early and deepens through Lira's ritual preparation.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake of collective healing deepens through accumulation—from Lyra's solitary setup to townspeople discovering connections to shared song—but lacks a decisive tightening moment. Agency manifests through attention and arrangement rather than decision, with cost emerging in the recognition of shared grief. The escalation is gentle and textural rather than pressurized, appropriate for the lens but missing the sharp edge of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure builds through the hush tightening, the tribunal's invasion, and Orrin's forced demonstration. The stakes—whether language remains fixed or becomes organic—manifest through concrete actions with the crystal. The youngest publisher's transformation provides the decisive turn, though middle sections could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: failed recording attempt, chalk spiral's temporary success, then acceptance of recording in "marrow" rather than tape. The prophet's forgetting creates coherent pressure that forces the narrator's stance shift from technological capture to embodied acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from repairing cameras to preventing all instruments from forgetting "the sky" if the clock hand reaches escape velocity. The pressure coheres through Eloi's diagnostic process requiring perfect silence ("ducts dimmed, monitors muted").

Could be stronger if the consequences of failure were more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—Hector's desire for reunion before death—is signaled early through "blood work...measured hours, not days." Escalation occurs through Mara's transformation of hospital sounds into music, then her risky approach to the estranged son. The cost lands visibly as "decades of regret began to loosen," though the resolution could show more immediate price.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from scholarly discovery to survival when "temporal wind pinned her movements into recursive stutters" and the key "jittered dangerously, threatening permanent exile." The reversal—Orin closing the "wrong" loop to protect rather than exploit—narrows options to mutual trust or permanent exile. Cost is visible through blood sacrifice and the near-loss in the temporal corridor.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from skeptical investigation through tooth-testing to the revelation of the missing heart. Each discovery tightens options: the tooth alone fails, forcing descent to the heart chamber. The cost manifests in Liora's widening "cleft in certainty" and the physical transformation of the constellation completing only with both elements.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on creating "light without fire" - pressure builds through the polishing ritual's accumulation toward the pearl's emergence. The decisive moment when "tear met shard" creates the nucleus shows agency driving transformation. Cost appears in releasing the pearl rather than keeping it ("must be offered, not kept"), though escalation could intensify further.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from Mara's solitary healing work to shared transformation when Rowan's arrival forces her choice between maintaining distance or offering sanctuary.

Cost is legible in accepting another's "salt" into the garden's "slow circuitry."

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.0)
    Escalation builds through accumulative deepening as each visitor adds complexity to hope's definition, narrowing Declan's options from abstract cynicism to concrete acceptance. The dominant stake (finding authentic hope for the ending) coheres throughout. Cost appears in accepting perpetual struggle rather than resolution. Deduction for the visitors feeling somewhat predetermined rather than creating genuine surprise or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal (wilted tendril) through communal (villagers gathering) to cosmic (harvest moon alignment). The transformation moment when "rootlets stirring beneath their feet" shows meaningful deepening. Cost is visible in Orin's preparation and the decades of lost practice, though the resolution feels somewhat assured once the song begins.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation operates through accumulative density: each ritual step adds pressure until "the orchard's silence had changed pitch." The dominant stake—translating cosmic heartbeats into navigable maps—tightens as Arren must hold perfect stillness ("moving would smear the geometry"). The sickle moment provides the key pressure point where his own heartbeat seals the cosmic data, though more intermediate resistance would strengthen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation reads through density increase—from valley-wide silence to personal quest to cavern experiments to communal restoration. The stakes deepen when Silas realizes echoes can heal the season's wound. Cost becomes tangible when neighbors must accept unexplained wonder rather than demanding how it works.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulating burden-weights (three, seven, five, nine drams) until Olivine confronts her own at twelve drams—the heaviest. The "boundary-lessly trapped" sensation intensifies from welcome tool to paralyzing threat before resolution, with clear cost in her inability to be woven by another.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—transforming grief into art before memories scatter—tightens through the crystallized time sequence where Mara must face both husband and lion. Cost becomes legible when she accepts incompletion as part of the work: "deciding the sculpture would never be finished, only paused at stages of telling." The kettle's boiling provides temporal pressure that forces action.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—negotiating with one's ghost for direction—is signaled early and tightens through accumulating pressure as Marlo crosses memory-erasing lily pads and confronts his hollow double. The cost manifests visibly when he must surrender his stolen story fragments to fill the ghost's cavity. Agency drives the resolution through Marlo's choice to release the sounds rather than hoard them.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes crystallize around Milo's private goal to resurrect hope through redirected flows, with escalation building through discovery (blockage), problem-solving (rerouting), and physical implementation.

Cost registers in his solitary labor and the choice to leave his discoveries for others rather than claim credit.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation works through accumulative deepening as Elias moves from external silence to internal stillness, with the memory of his mother providing the key insight about intervals.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to moral imperative as the ledgers reveal human trafficking. The protagonist's choice to document rather than flee demonstrates clear agency with visible risk ("watchers behind shuttered windows"). The cost is legible in choosing exposure over safety.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes deepen from preserving methods to becoming guardian of a relay chain, with the rope's message and lightning strike providing meaningful tightening. The cost emerges in accepting indefinite patience - "tiny roots gripping my ribs" - though the weavers' instructions remain somewhat abstract, limiting full pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes center on being truly seen versus disappearing—"explained absences were considered worth more than unspoken grief." Pressure builds through Selene's request intensifying from obituary to "map the places inside her that might yet heal." The thread exchange creates tangible cost. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal yearning to systemic transformation as Oriven's actions risk the palace's stability—stalactite anchors crack, the palace lists and trembles. The dominant stake (beauty versus mechanical safety) tightens when the bird's hatching threatens the established order, forcing the choice to descend. Cost is visible in abandoning height/safety, though the workers' immediate compliance undermines some earned resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal quest to city-wide restoration with clear time pressure (winter deadline, geese migration). The dominant stake—liberating trapped memories—faces concrete obstacles requiring protagonist agency (finding Novara, solving the water problem, manipulating weather). Cost is visible when fountains awaken with "defiant hush," honoring what was lost. One meaningful tightening when rust has "soldered the box to iron."

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from initial serenity through touching the Line's "endless chorus folding back on itself" to the decisive misalignment that "bent" generational patterns. The cost appears in "change can bruise as well as mend" and the uncertainty of monitoring "sprouts of deviation."

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—rendering collective grief in stone—builds through accumulation rather than reversal. Len's weeks of retracing processions represent genuine effort with visible cost. The pressure coheres when Mira's "Listen to the ribbon" crystallizes his understanding. Slightly lower score as the escalation relies more on duration than intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—restoring balance through personal absolution—intensifies as Elias moves from general confessions to the specific lie about Clara Alden's son.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal curiosity about whispers to responsibility for resolving collective grief. The tapestry reveals increasing pressure as "every color he straightens releases a vision."

Some cost ambiguity in the middle sections prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.4)

Cost manifests as exhaustion and risk, though middle pressure could intensify.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation operates through accumulative density—from handling shards to powdering glaze to threading wires, each action deepens the emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds from solitary philosophizing to confrontation with Mara to joint descent through museum layers, with the cog-sextant revelation forcing both to reconfigure their positions.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from individual resistance ("each carrying the weapons of their trade") through collective harmony to civic transformation when councilors arrive "summoned by rumors of seditious gatherings." The cost manifests in surrendered arguments and Mara's departure. The councilors' conversion lacks sufficient resistance—their suspicion dissolves too quickly for maximum impact.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal (Moira's choice) to communal (village transformation) with the celestial alignment providing time pressure. The cost is visible in tears mingling with smiles and the processing of painful memories. One meaningful deepening occurs when the seed transforms into communal nourishment rather than individual enlightenment.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (restoring city power) signaled early and tested through riddle-solving sequence.

Cost is visible in the twelve-hour blackout's impact and the ritual's requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: silence→dust swirls→sawdust exhales→tremor→warmth seeps, with the wishbone arrival marking the decisive deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal questioning to collective reanimation, with the ampoule's dual nature (poison/revelation) creating genuine tension. The discovery of erased fellow guardians raises cost meaningfully. However, the resolution lacks a sharper trade-off—the reanimation succeeds without significant resistance or sacrifice beyond the historical cost already paid.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether perpetual motion can undo regret—deepens through the dice roll revealing "zero" and "trembling one," forcing Marlen to confront the texture of his loss rather than its reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on Ravi's desire to "paint silence loud enough to rouse exhausted hearts," with escalation through discovering the brush can write luminescent letters that affect strangers.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from personal fear through community paralysis to collective action, with the emerald lens revelation as the turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes escalate from personal hunger to confronting the hunger stone's seductive offer of "everything" with "absence of demand."

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal terror ("drowning in invisible ink") through physical manifestation (the luminous breastplate) to direct confrontation with embodied fear. The protagonist's agency drives each escalation, though the dreamlike progression sometimes softens the sense of immediate danger until the creature's masks fall "like rotten petals."

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from freeing the orchard to surviving storm-driven shoals through Mira's agency—she actively dubs chains, expands fractals, and conducts weather into counterpoint. The cost appears when "driftwood slabs...flexed, cracking but not breaking" and in choosing ephemeral transmission over permanent archive. One meaningful deepening occurs when the storm accepts "her dub as if the weather itself sought fresh remix credits."

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from mapping to rescue to accepting transformation. The watchers' test creates meaningful pressure through the heated whistle revealing Elyth's coordinates.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—transforming grief into healing light—escalates from personal need through basilica trial to communal healing, with each stage extracting cost (memories as payment, burned fingertips, accepting permanent sorrow).

However, the acolyte's warning about "untamed sorrow" lacks immediate consequence, slightly softening middle pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.0)

Cost is visible in the drowned deckhands' ghosts and Gideon's trembling arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal erasure through labyrinth navigation to the three-path choice at the lake, with the protagonist's agency driving each decision under accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (reuniting with Aric) progresses through clear accumulative beats: ritual preparation, beast summoning, transformation beginning, negotiated sharing of change.

The arbor sequence deepens options rather than narrowing them, fitting the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes clearly established—verifying island's stories before monsoon drowns them. Pressure accumulates through three waypoint tests, each deepening understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (survive with evidence to reach the council) is clear early and escalates with dawn and approaching hunters. The meaningful tightening arrives with hoofbeats and rising light, forcing a trade‑off between continued decoding or immediate movement; she pays with risk and irrevocable commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: revive motion/music without destroying the conservatory. Pressure coheres and escalates via accumulative signals (violets, saffron/teal, convergence to white) until the ocean fractures, demanding a trade-off.

Tension remains quiet but present at line and beat levels.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (locate/transform unused love) tightens through the breathing ratio choice that “opens” the doorway and the decision to release regrets. The meaningful price arrives in the renunciation of the treasured object and acceptance that healing him precedes photographing the vault. Escalation is a density increase consistent with the chosen lens; the doorway and flood of past life memory are decisive deepening beats. Resolution stems from his agency rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is legible and escalates: mastery of maze vs. loss of self. The tightening turn—recognizing and exploiting non‑Euclidean arcs—earns access to the nexus and a sharper price.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is declared early and tightens meaningfully when the forge exacts a price, forcing a trade-off. Agency drives the turns: choosing the forge’s method, selecting absences, accepting the loss, and embedding the tone. The cost is unmistakable and persists into the final beats. Tension escalates coherently without need for a second antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres around whether to trade with Miratone or obey the station’s demand; reinterpretation tightens options decisively. The price—relinquishing hoarded moments—is unmistakable and changes her status and future. While there’s no adversarial force, internal and situational pressures interlock convincingly. The step through the door reads as a committed choice, not a drift.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (complete a dome and reclaim inquiry from both weather and bureaucracy) is signaled early. We see one meaningful tightening: treacherous temperature gradients and measured cooling, culminating in the lift of the first dome and the choice to continue. Pressure stays coherent but gentle; no beat truly forecloses options beyond solitude’s ongoing cost. The coordinates offer deepening rather than a hard test.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (self‑reclamation vs. exploitation/death) is clear from the jump’s setup. Escalation tightens via the ledger revelation and on‑air denunciation, forcing a public, risky choice. The engineered save demonstrates agency while paying cost (burned bridges, exposed contract, physical peril). No extraneous reversals; one decisive deepening leads to a meaningful, costly reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear: defend the remnant of dawn by adopting a counterintuitive mode of war. Escalation tracks as density and pattern shift: storm pauses, gold dust spiral, one star, then the command to wield “cannons of quiet.” The price—foregoing noise as signal and risking night flooding any break—narrows options credibly. A concrete external test isn’t shown on‑page, but the reconfigured stance feels earned for this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—merge to escape the loop and learn the origin of thought—clarifies early and tightens once the schematic spiral reframes options. The meaningful turn is Janus‑9 choosing to touch the string; the loop reset risk adds pressure. Cost is present but understated; the internal conflict could deepen with a sharper trade‑off moment before contact. Still, escalation coheres under a causal lens and resolves via protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—whether to privatize or share truth—tightens at the “jury” shelves and is tested when he presses the lens to his chest. Escalation is primarily ethical and symbolic rather than combative, but the pressure coheres and deepens at the vault turn and again with Mara’s potential arrest/assist beat. The cost (self‑disclosure, covenant to bear the lens) is felt though understated. No coincidence resolves the conflict; resolution flows from his choice.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    One dominant stake—validation through the garden—tightens as the maze actively responds and funnels him to the sundial. The decisive act (pressing the polished marble into the root) narrows options and triggers a visible reweighting for the town. Pressure escalates coherently under the causal lens but remains relatively smooth, with limited jeopardy or failure risk on the page. The price (ceded luck/visibility) is felt conceptually more than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (proof vs. biosphere safety) is signaled early and tightens when the leviathans’ “subdued awakenings” become overlapping distress, forcing a reversal. Agency drives turns: the lever pull and its inversion both narrow options with a visible tradeoff (abort further testing to prevent harm). Ethical calculus is legible at the peak. Escalation is precise rather than harrowing, but wholly coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (unlock/realize the ghost’s code) is present early and coherently escalates through a brave physical disruption that forecloses preservation. The meaningful tightening occurs at the trapdoor: a point of no return that reweights options and sound. Prices—further flooding, personal risk, irreversible alteration—are visible though not harrowingly felt. The resolution is earned by Mira’s agency and commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is legible early; pressure tightens as the oracle requires a “scale” and she must alter method (occupy margins, smudge) to earn measurement. The 13‑gram valuation escalates internal conflict into a choice—release or plant—resolved by her agency. Cost is present but quiet; escalation is more deepening than reversal, fitting the lens. A slightly sharper external pressure could heighten the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—quantifying remorse—crystallizes early and deepens via the confession and experiment. The tightening arrives when the beads begin to spin and encode Morse, culminating in the reweighting “SHIFT SETTLED.” The cost is quiet but legible: doubt is “half‑flayed,” the wheel is withheld from the world, and they refuse the lure of further investigation. Slight softness: external pressure is low, but internal stakes carry the scene credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—witness versus intervention—is signaled early and tightens notably when floodwaters rise and the refuge digests the journals. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: entering the wall, relinquishing records, choosing the boat.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—making ordinary magic for Junie/children—intensifies with the eclipse’s approach, the box’s opening, and the seeds’ “instruction.” The meaningful tightening is the eclipse hush and the implicit demand to choose (close the box, make a pledge). Pressure is contemplative rather than adversarial; the price is a lifelong vow more than a sacrifice on the page. The escalation is clean but gentle, keeping the piece short of higher-band force.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are conceptual (can listening realign a world’s axis?), signaled early and tightened by the wall’s response. Ursa’s agency escalates via attention tactics: delicate extraction, interpretive leaps, and the direct appeal to the silo. The decisive deepening is her realization that collecting must become stitching; price is responsibility, not a dramatic loss. Tension is steady, not jagged, fitting the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—whether to expose the specs—tightens through preparation into an irreversible broadcast. The escalation is internal-ethical and procedural, culminating in the committed flip, with the cost of burning secrecy and identity. Lack of an active counterforce keeps pressure quieter than it might be, but the narrowing of options is clear. The time cue (“after last orders”) provides a subtle ticking cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is clear and escalates: rhetorical loops tighten, the demon’s sarcasm is neutralized, then it lunges and is arrested by the looped playback, forcing self-awareness. The mid-turn (failed mockery → slowed attack) narrows options toward surrender. Cost is conceptual rather than bodily—signal sent to other hungers, and the priest accepts ongoing duty. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (can he call and hold the unheard symphony before inspiration/exhaustion collapses?) is clear and tightens as echoes thin. Escalation is a density build—pane resonance to lake hum to aurora and snow—then a pressured renunciation. The cost is leaving while the auditorium of eras is alive, foregoing further risk to protect the hush. Pressure is coherent but remains lyrical rather than bruising.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is clear early and tightens when she enters Silence and later steps “between the drop and the ripple” with “no exit,” narrowing options. Agency drives escalation—speaking denials, selecting approving/vetoed droplets, refusing worship—and each choice carries visible or conceptual price. The editors’ room sequence is a decisive deepening that reweights all prior pressure. Stakes remain coherent and resolve through her renunciation rather than convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure tightens in a quiet, accumulative way: finding the record, the needle’s hush covenant, the realization of missing percussion, and the decision to share. The felt price—rejecting perfectionism/hoarding and relinquishing the needle—clarifies stakes. While conflict is gentle, the narrowing of options reads cleanly under the chosen lens. No coincidence resolves the core problem.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (truthful weather vs municipal erasure with imminent flood risk) tightens decisively when Coren asks for her codes. Her hesitation and subsequent transmission mark a clear escalation and trade‑off. The resolution arises from her agency, not luck, and the external stakes (flooding) merge with internal ones (integrity vs safety). The price is present though not punished on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—whether to face pain to understand scent‑grief—tightens as the transformation nears and the vapor overtakes him. The decisive deepening occurs in the memory confrontation and the choice to open the vial after acceptance. Cost is visible (tears, relinquishing a misbelief), and the agency at the end is his. Tension stays coherent; it’s a smooth swell rather than jagged turns, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: choose a thread and accept erasure; pressure spikes when the rope tightens and the crossroad vision demands a trade. The protagonist’s agency produces the turn (patterning the choice) and the price is paid on-page. Escalation is coherent for the chosen lens, though the compromise mutes the brutality of the binary. The lingering costs (rope diminished; time skewed) keep the resolution from feeling consequence-free.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reviving/locating hidden music within the hush—is signaled early and tightened via the discovery and unbinding of the sapling. The pivotal costed act (removing and repurposing strings) narrows options and earns the outcome. Pressure is quiet but coherent; reversal arrives when the freed tree whistles and the greenhouse becomes instrument. Slight softness in overt external jeopardy keeps it just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—deliver an untraceable blend while maintaining professional boundary—tightens through procedural risk (timing inhale to avoid “nerves might subsume the mixture,” dispersing residue to prevent colonization). Escalation is quiet but coherent for the accumulative lens. Costs are legible, if understated. A single more acute on‑page risk or micro-failure could sharpen the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes (deliver the message/recognize the unseen) are clear but softly pressured; escalation occurs (private search → public assembly → institutional commitment), yet friction is low and solutions arrive readily. The crowd’s ready consensus and swift sender identification diminish felt risk. Jonas’s pledge marks a tangible price, but no option is truly foreclosed. Tension stays gentle, befitting the tone but limiting charge.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—finding belonging—tightens as rumor → discovery → ritualized joining; the arbor’s hum and apparitions escalate texture and consequence. The decisive act (pressing palms; offerings recorded) reads as commitment, but opposing force is gentle and cost largely conceptual. One meaningful deepening occurs; a harder trade-off would raise stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is clear early (uncage vs. civic order); pressure tightens via the inhalation window, corridor formation, and the city’s hiccuping alarm. The decisive act (drawing the infinity line) forecloses retreat and triggers a visible price (emptied seconds, tool break, systemic jolt). A slightly sharper on‑page consequence to the city’s need for delayed voices would deepen the harm calculus. Still, escalation reads coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure deepens through density and pattern linkage rather than confrontation: the cipher coheres, the orchard answers, and the tactic shifts from solution to rhythm. The cost—the acceptance of ongoing absence—narrows options by foreclosing summoning or closure. Gentle escalation fits the lens, though overt reversal is minimal. The earned irrigation redesign serves as the concrete stake shift.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (becoming visible to help) tightens when the child appears and needs both calm and a literal glimpse. The key tactical turn—jury‑rigged induction using tape shard, wire, and phone coil—narrows options and risks exposure. The price is partial visibility and relinquishing notes to the cache as ongoing duty. Pressure is coherent and escalates once, appropriately for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (identity via surrender vs control) is signaled early and tightened by the bodily costs. The decisive intensification is her choice to press the leaf and let growth “decide angles and strength,” which narrows options toward metamorphosis. Later public acts deepen stakes, culminating in the understory choice with visible price. Tension is internal but persistent, operating sentence to sentence through sensory escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—securing meaning/knowledge—tightens through the exchange: placing the brooch, reciting losses, and painting under the island’s song. The decisive deepening is the demand for equal vulnerability, which narrows options and exacts a price. Time pressure from the tide and the relinquished artifact sharpen consequence. Stakes remain coherent and are resolved by deliberate acts rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—who/what the “pilgrim” and treasure truly are—tightens as reflections attempt to inhabit the pair. The decisive turn arises from character agency: Mara’s naming of Arden and Arden’s renunciation redirect pressure and dissolve doubles. The price is conceptual and relational more than perilous; escalation is elegant but not harrowing. One credible deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (returning meaning to a city) is pressured by the council’s demand and uncertainty. Escalation deepens through the silent demonstration that elicits communal fragments and the promise of “staggered intervals,” which narrows options to patience and process. Cost is present but soft (commitment to non‑calendar tides; ongoing work) rather than a sharp loss. Still, the vote hinge and method‑commitment produce a credible tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres through internal stakes: to reach truth she must hazard the punch, select among “routes never taken,” and pay with a confession. The meaningful tightening is the demand for a feared truth in exchange for an answer, foreclosing evasion. While there’s no antagonist, the situational pressure and time‑tinged urgency (“before the rail cooled”) keep decisions active. Cost is felt and alters her options going forward.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can she reconcile skepticism with wonder to serve grief work—tightens as visions intensify and the transcription maps memory into sound. Agency drives the turn: she chooses to write through doubt and to leave the journal accessible. The visible price is letting go of exclusivity and stance purity. The pressure remains internal, but it coheres and deepens.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (pursue forbidden knowledge vs. survive spatial mutiny) tightens when asymmetry causes seams and resurfaces dead loved ones, forcing a tradeoff. He pays a visible price by refusing the siren‑step and choosing the slower path (master the full amulet). Pressure coheres through one strong escalation and a controlled de‑escalation he earns by retuning. The resolution stems from his agency rather than luck.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (save the minister without forfeiting integrity) is signaled early and tightens via a decisive tactic (waiting to provoke the shard’s fall). The shard injury, concealment, and timed bag‑transfer mark a single, meaningful escalation path with visible price. Agency is Mara’s throughout; coincidence doesn’t resolve. Ethical calculus (one life for two) sharpens the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—capturing time’s texture at personal and communal cost—is signaled early and tightened when Calix invokes the avalanche year. The choice to endure and continue mapping under intensified pain reads as a meaningful narrowing with price. Pressure remains coherent and grows; the resolution is earned through his stance. Stakes stay intimate yet consequential, though a second micro-cost could have further sharpened the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are coherent: gather and protect erased histories without being “corrected.” Escalation tightens via the discovery of the poison label, the men searching, and the taped confessions; the decision to leave a calling card and withdraw narrows options. The cost is the renewed acceptance of ghosthood and deferred identity. Pressure grows consistently under the accumulative lens without false spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (decoding the riddle/compass) tightens via the decision to retell and to confess the sailor dismissal. The phenomenon intensifies, forcing a trade: certainty/arrogance for an impermanent, self‑held compass as the room’s music dies. Agency drives the turn; coincidence doesn’t resolve it. The visible price (snapped string, end of hum) underscores the irreversible stance shift.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are singular and clear (public vs. corporate ownership) with a meaningful tightening at Carnival Eve and another at the procedural delay that forces grassroots structuring. Agency drives turns; coincidence doesn’t rescue them. The cost reads as risk and stamina over weeks rather than a sharp loss, tempering peak pressure. Still, external and internal conflicts braid effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake: witness/document before the irreversible change. Escalation is a quiet tightening consistent with the lens—tremor → plume → timed flares → sun’s rim → drones’ chatter; the hush deepens, then breaks. The cost is clear (the end of natural mornings and her complicity by witnessing rather than resisting), though external jeopardy remains low. Agency is steady endurance and precise timing rather than a reversal, which fits but limits peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear early: restore telemetry in minutes or schedules “splinter.” Escalation tightens through failed first fix and a new constraint (gyro imbalance), with the anchor’s lift as a palpable clock. Agency drives turns—Mara’s calls and Rowan’s precise adjustments—and the risked release is a credible test of trust. Cost isn’t punishing, but the time squeeze and potential disruption keep pressure coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and tightens through a decisive ritual → physical risk → epistemic cost. Agency drives turns (choosing polyphony, crossing the ice, descending without artifacts), and the “paper forbids” beat forecloses a path. The price is more conceptual than peril‑driven; danger on the ice registers but never bites. Still, escalation remains coherent and satisfying under the hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are coherent (revive Varin vs. continue wandering), and escalation arrives through density: from silent fork to town-wide resonance to the transfer of the tool. The key tightening is Marek’s question, forcing Lira’s stance crystallization. Cost is present but gentle; resistance is largely atmospheric rather than oppositional. Still, the agency-driven turn lands.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear early (save the scholar and secure the artifact without triggering collapse). Escalation tightens at the laser lattice, forcing a values trade-off that risks both lives. The beacon sync softens the edge slightly after the precise maneuver, but the price—time, risk, restraint in ascent—remains legible. Resolution follows Mara’s agency and renunciation of safety-first procedure in favor of guardianship.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—escape into self‑myth vs. stay to face consequence—tightens with the patrol’s approach. The decisive turn (collapsing the labyrinth into one straight passage) forecloses a live option and carries cost. Internal and external pressures interweave coherently; tension rises at sentence and beat levels. Slight abstraction at mid‑labyrinth lyricism softens immediacy briefly but not materially.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is legible early (repay a debt; awaken the apple) and tightens at the bead‑insertion and the command to move outside. Agency is present but largely obedient—Elias follows rather than initiates—yet his compliance under pressure still reweights the ending. The visible price is her dissolution and his charged loneliness. Escalation is clean but not harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clear early and escalate through purposeful deepening (from entry to revelatory map, to a hall of “broken precedents,” to the blooded loom). However, resistance is largely sympathetic; the labyrinth often aids rather than pressures, so options seldom narrow under threat. The cost is felt but light; no live option is painfully foreclosed. The final act is earned and resonant but not hard‑won.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres around the need to face exile and risk taboo/descent to test belief. The meaningful tightening is the discovered stair and the choice to insert the peg, which forecloses passive observation. Costs are more spiritual and communal than physical but are legible (risk, trespass, committing to stay). Internal and external stakes braid effectively without overreach.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure rises through the archivist’s “last letter,” the impossible address, and the ritualized pause before mailing, culminating in Mirielle’s refusal and reframing. The dominant stake—will she glean a code to widen her margins-vocation—tightens via the chalk/UV method. Costs remain conceptual and quiet rather than acute, limiting peak intensity. Still, escalation is coherent and sufficient for the form.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes (preserve knowledge/expose conspiracies before a coup) are present early and tighten decisively when Voren arrives and confiscates the daybook. The consequent adaptation (using ink traces and adjacent possibilities) earns the final actionable intel and dawn clock. Prices—lost tools, heightened scrutiny, compressed time—are legible. Slight abstraction of danger keeps the pressure a notch shy of visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—speak or remain silent—tightens via the “Wait” message versus the spirits’ counterpoint, then deepens with the shard becoming a mouthpiece. Pain as price escalates until the overflow forces a choice, with a new knowledge turn when her lover’s unsent sentences appear. The resolution comes from her agency, not coincidence, and forecloses drifting. The cost and trade-off are legible and scaled to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (can language re-knit frightened hearts in a war-night) is signaled early and tightened by the acrostic discovery and the shellfire interruption. The protagonist’s agency produces the culminating sentence and the choice to return the coral in a charged moment. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional; external pressure doesn’t force a hard trade-off beyond time constraints and fear. Tension is steady if subtle rather than sharply escalatory.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (recovering joy) tightens through accumulative deepening: pale projections fail, the fresco match unlocks partial success, then a demanded offering triggers the true turn. The “gift before surrender” adds pressure and a concrete hurdle. The final touch (pear blossom) serves as the climactic beat. Costs are modest but legible in the required offering and vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake is clear early (revive acoustics; exchange certainty for curiosity) and tightens with the garden’s demand to “loose the city’s certainty.” Escalation proceeds via ritual deepening (paint → stone → silence) and culminates in a citywide transformation. The price is embraced rather than contested, so pressure reads more like a chosen risk than a squeezed alternative. One concrete loss or resistance in the moment would intensify the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres and tightens with one strong turn (betrayal → auditor/drones) and an earned tactical response (vines scrambling sensors; airflow fogging optics). Stakes are legible and escalate; the option set narrows in a credible sprint to the panel/roof. The cost reads more as ongoing risk and forfeiture than immediate loss, slightly softening the punch. Still, agency drives the resolution rather than luck.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (transform torment/find rest) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully at the planting choice. Pressure coheres through the lullaby’s guidance and the elder’s presence, culminating in a decisive act that forecloses the old pattern. The price is legible: surrendering the old refuge and singular reliance on anguish as fuel. No antagonist needed; internal vs external weave cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (preserving names/memories) is signaled early, and pressure coheres as a deepening from maintenance to transgressive descent. The meaningful tightening is the corridor opening and choosing to go down, with the repayment in awakened names. Cost is more conceptual/missionary than perilous; no strong resistance meets her in scene. Still, escalation reads as a decisive intensification under the lyric lens.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is explicit early and escalates via the archive’s sentience and the twilight deadline. The key tightening is devising the ribbon lattice, which makes betrayal audible and sets the terms of the climax. However, resistance from the delegates or the archive barely tests the method, so the price paid feels light. The outcome, while elegant, arrives with limited strain after the tactic is introduced.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (prevent catastrophic surge while reconciling values) and escalates coherently (first vent eases, then fissures intensify, second inhale forces a new tactic). The apology-to-mountain choice narrows options and reframes power-sharing as risk. Prices are felt (doubt stirred, stamina taxed) and the resolution derives from her agency, not luck. Stakes remain personal and communal (orchid farms, colonies) without telescoping beyond scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—risking trust again—is signaled early and tightens at the moment of sending the bird. The meteorite and past indictment sharpen the fear of interception, and the release forecloses the safety of secrecy. The price is legible (loss of control, burned records). Escalation is mostly internal and textural rather than adversarial, but it coheres and deepens.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (reframing absence/thresholds) escalates through a clear deepening: discovering the charred fragment reframes the earlier motifs and forces a stance. Pressure is primarily internal but coherent; the feared cost (closing the “cathedral”) sharpens her choice to delay closure. Quiet but credible stakes; no spurious reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (harvest what the city will share before sunrise) tightens with the alarm and power inversion, forcing a trade-off. Agency drives the escalation: the ritual breath, alignment, and the decision to leave the feather. The felt cost is clear and the options narrow under time pressure. Stakes remain intimate yet credible, with no luck-driven resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure coheres (the missing pieces persist; one glyph fails; time‑sensitivity of fading memory) and tightens once at the pool where she must risk a new hypothesis and act. The dominant stake—recover the paths—remains clear, and the shift from conjecture to application is the meaningful deepening. Still, resistance is low and the price of the attempt feels modest. The escalation reads more contemplative than fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres around proving “orchestrated serendipity” before the fireworks erase subtlety; the volunteers’ turns escalate texture and stakes (grief, art, ridicule) rather than conflict per se. Velasco’s agency is present in selection, timing, and the culminating refusal to intervene. The cost is conceptual and material (relinquishing the bishop) but relatively quiet. One meaningful tightening—interval ending—keeps the frame taut.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is explicit and escalates through one meaningful tightening: finding the shard forces a trade-off (risk drowning in memory vs. gaining power to write the world). The method-driven struggle (observing gaps to survive unsettlement) fuses internal and external conflict credibly. Costs are legible—bodily and societal—and the resolution derives from her agency, not luck. The officials’ looming reaction reinforces stakes without needing an on-page confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (complete the reweaving before alignments tilt) is signaled by the third ring and tightens tactics. Escalation is mainly density and deadline rather than antagonism; the “final pane snaps” is a clear peak beat. Cost is more conceptual (choosing to reveal wounds) than painful, and the deadline never bites hard. Still, the pressure coheres and deepens the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—translating pain—tightens when Juniper appears, shifting the ritual from private to shared and forcing a costly action (breaking the box, reconfiguring the bargain). The escalation is modest but clear under the accumulative lens. The final stance forecloses solitary custody of grief in favor of shared stewardship. Stakes stay personal and legible without dilation.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.9)
    Primary stake—proving and releasing a hope equation—tightens via the calibration and final balloon’s smooth ascent vs. “lurch” failure condition. Pressure is coherent and grows, but the price is conceptual rather than felt as a hard trade-off. The session’s end and Ora’s refusal to rush constitute a modest foreclosure of options. Effective deepening without a sharp reversal keeps this strong but not apex.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recovering and stewarding stored resonance—tightens through discoveries to the recorder’s choral release and the culminating vow. The key turn is Liora choosing guardianship over sale/escape, which forecloses a path. The pressure is coherent but remains gentle; fewer direct obstacles slightly soften escalation. Still, the anthem’s bloom and battery risk provide a concrete intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is legible early and tightens with the impending bells and the revelation of the borrowed heartbeat. Escalation tracks through synchronization, unveiling the risk, and the final anchoring gesture. The cost is present but softened by an unbroken success path; there’s no reversal beyond the time pressure and the hush “deepening.” Still, agency drives the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is clear and present: avert dawn annihilation by extracting enforceable commitments. Escalation tightens via the ritual drink (glacier loss), then the concrete terms, culminating in the contested stewardship clause that forces a tradeoff. Prices are visible in body (Rourke’s scars, balking signatures) and polity (resource control ceded). Tension operates at beat and sentence scales without coincidence saves.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve an echo versus the moral cost of the drought—tightens through the ceremonial hatching into the decisive phone orders. The price is explicit (loss of investor favor, brand damage) and embodied in relinquishment. Pressure coheres without needing an antagonist; the waiting-for-lull clock and Fyodor’s reminder keep the vise on. One clean deepening turn (from private rite to public unmaking) earns the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (liberate listening vs imposed conformity) is signaled early and tightened by the doors puzzle and the true‑name risk. Escalation is a steady deepening rather than combative, culminating in the choice to unsecret the sanctuary. The visible price is gentler than the rhetoric suggests, yet renunciation (of secrecy and tools) lands. Tension operates through poised decisions rather than reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (ethically cleansing stories) is present early, and pressure coheres, but external resistance is low. The meaningful tightening arrives when scholars demand justification and Silas chooses silence and tool‑offering over a didactic defense. Costs are implied (refusal of status, continued itinerancy) rather than viscerally felt on the page. One sharper on‑page consequence or near‑miss in a bar would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (mend the monarch cadence by restoring memory) is signaled early and tightens when the column keeps stuttering. A credible adaptation path—signals → moth wing divination → knot rite—shows escalation and agency. The reversal comes when the whisper of the name fails, forcing the more delicate, costlier rite. The cost is conceptual and temporal (ephemeral structures; chosen non‑monumentality), not visceral, but it’s legible.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: resurrect a melody of names with the personal price of confronting guilt. Pressure tightens when work is gated by self‑forgiveness and again when the rope pulses and the aurora “listens,” culminating in the risky pour and reveal. The conflict remains quiet but coherent; consequence lands in the earned stasis of leaving the memory for pilgrims. Slight softness in external resistance keeps it just below elite.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reviving/obeying a decaying directive—tightens when the storm besieges and the riddle demands dance over analysis. The dance functions as a decisive intensification that changes options and commits the narrator to action. Cost is present but conceptual rather than visceral; external opposition is atmospheric, not antagonistic. Still, the cadence shift is unmistakable and earned under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—seal the covenant—tightens through activation, the sigil doorway, and the costly choice to surrender the astrolabe. Pressure coheres: his method works, but the price escalates to a meaningful trade. Internal and external conflicts interweave without overcomplication. Minor note: the leap from deciphering to portal acceptance is swift but still earned.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure tightens via accumulative deepening: tactile failure of the box becomes the vector for memory, grace thickens, and Tyra confronts the true price of release. The key turn is internal but dramatized; the choice forecloses a path of grievance. Stakes stay coherent and scale appropriately (personal forgiveness ripples into world steadiness). Slight softness: Maro’s gentle facilitation avoids direct resistance, making the escalation quiet rather than sharply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (capture the dream) is clear, with one meaningful deepening when the mirror shows alternate times and the dream tries to flee. Escalation remains coherent but largely smooth; the opposition never truly bites, so options don’t narrow with visible price. Haleh’s agency drives each step, and the “completion” requirement provides structure. The cost reads as philosophical (relinquishing a repair mentality) rather than jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (save the orchard from the Guild) is established early and tightens with the reveal of sabotage scars and the time pressure of imminent demolition. The key turn is Seraphin’s decision to deploy forgotten tools in specific, escalating repairs, with Liora’s complicity raising risk. Costs are present (the ribbon relinquished, exposure, exhaustion), though direct antagonistic pressure remains offstage. Tension sustains at sentence and beat scales without needing reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (unlocking forbidden knowledge vs. self-cost) is signaled early and deepened at the bathroom breakthrough. Pressure coheres: conventional methods fail, he chooses a risk (participation) that triggers tangible consequence. The tightening forecloses a path (pure observerhood) and replaces it with stewardship under a rewired self. The cost is palpable even in a quiet ending.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (access the library) tightens meaningfully at the cashier blockade and the vault. The near‑sacrifice of Marrow’s Martian sunrise concretizes stakes before Ora’s reframe. Escalation is primarily one decisive turn rather than multiple reversals, which suits the length. The ingenious solution slightly softens felt price but preserves pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (free the brother without betraying the lost) tightens at the on‑stage decision point. The stitching of a third path forecloses staying or abandoning, and the lily‑pad rule adds ongoing pressure and cost. Escalation is coherent and driven by the protagonist’s agency. Minor softening comes from the ease of discovering an unnoticed thread loophole.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure deepens via cadence shift (gears falter, light fluoresces, bells speak paragraphs), and the single tightening is Maris committing to rebraid and press the seal. The cost is mostly conceptual and procedural, not painful, so tension remains refined rather than acute. Still, her agency decisively reconfigures the world’s options under the chosen lens. No coincidences resolve the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (securing hush) tightens via a meaningful turn when mapping proves insufficient and the narrator chooses a ritual of release. The spiral omen forces a directional choice and narrows options to the seam; the hush blooming is a concrete, earned result. The price is conceptual rather than severe—ceding control and surrendering the tool—but it’s legible and carries forward. Pressure remains coherent without false reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.9)
    Pressure tightens when the hush drinks half the resonance, forcing a pivot to the filament of song and the embedding of slivers by matching notes—an earned deepening under the chosen lens. The visible prices (cracking prism, risk of losing the last notes, fatigue) sharpen stakes. The resolution flows from Lioh’s agency rather than luck, even as coincidence is the thematic field. A slightly clearer foreclosing of an alternative path would be the only further gain.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—responsible curation of collective memory—is clear early and tightens when the sundial vision forces a consequential selection. The meaningful trade‑off is her own desire versus living memory; she pays by omitting herself. Escalation fits the lens: density deepens into a decisive curatorial act. No antagonist needed; agency drives resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (ignite rebellion/defy despair) is clear, and pressure tightens via the guard’s attention and the silent flare that catalyzes a public turn. Escalation is protagonist‑driven, but the path to victory feels relatively unopposed and fast, with limited on‑page cost. Still, the one decisive intensification (message broadcast → collective rise) lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to speak to save the reefs—is clear and tightens when the vision shows two branches, one catastrophic, one viable. The meaningful turn is Marella’s deliberate recalibration of tone, paying the price of tempering anger. External antagonists are offstage, slightly softening felt pressure, but the internal/external weave holds. Escalation is quiet yet definite under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are coherent and tightened by a single meaningful turn: Father climbs during inversion, forcing a trade‑off between keeping the harvested hush and using it to save him. The protagonist’s method (“by limiting exposure”) is an earned tactic echoing the father’s creed, adding moral texture to the cost. Tension sustains through the clock (doll’s descending chime) to the settling beat. A slightly cushioned risk—silence as soothing solution—keeps it just shy of peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can Gerard teach silence to comfort Liora—tightens through meter stabilization and vial clarification. The key turn is his deliberate cadence ladder and the relinquishment of the vial to Liora, narrowing options toward earned stillness. Stakes are intimate rather than high‑jeopardy, but the cost of letting go (her notes’ hum, his pocketed tool) reads. The accumulative pressure is coherent and culminates in a shared hush.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is focused and escalates: reach site → decode facade → partial stair with ultimatum → ethical renunciation. The sigil’s choice tightens the pressure meaningfully and the price is legible. External peril is low, so tension leans moral/philosophical; it works but lacks abrasion. The seed‑splitting solution arises from prior setup, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—teach breath/let him cross—is signaled early and coherently tightens via failed attempts (brittle mist) to the held sphere and threshold decision. The key pressure point is Mara’s restraint (not encroaching) followed by contact through scars that enables the turn. Cost is legible: she releases him and recommits to solitude. Opposition is gentle rather than combative, but escalation still registers.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—what she becomes under pressure—tightens when the corridor “tightened like an oath,” narrowing options to endurance/commitment. Escalation is protagonist‑driven: Cassia sets the bolt despite threads cracking; cost registers in the crushing, failed timelines, and a permanently altered world. No antagonist needed; conflict coheres internally and situationally. The price is unmistakable yet proportionate to length.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is legible early (dynasty-toppling proof before curfew), and pressure tightens from search to ethical decision. The decisive turn—lifting the needle and pocketing the cylinder—clearly forecloses a public path. The cost is present conceptually and ethically, though not dramatized through external consequence on the page. Internal and external stakes interlace effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (“finish the play/find a larger script”) escalates through a credible tightening: promise of protection → missing page setback → risky surrender. The mercury apple provides a turn but does not solve the problem without his choice; agency remains central. The cost—renouncing identity and fear—is on the page and alters options. Tension interweaves internal and external beats without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—getting the heirloom to Jordan before emancipation—tightens through the director’s gate and the literal delivery. The pressure is coherent and grows, though jeopardy remains humane rather than acute. Agency drives each turn; the small procedural bend carries credible stakes at this scope. The final exchange reconfigures options (Jordan’s “restoration corps” pivot) with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restoring erased histories—tightens through alarms and the agent’s arrival, forcing a stance crystallization. The key turn (apparitions flowing into Lina) raises risk and narrows options while granting power. Agency drives escalation at each step; coincidence complicates (drone/alarms) but does not resolve. Cost is legible: forfeiture of safety and singular identity in exchange for collective memory.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is sharp and early: contain the prophecy before it reaches human tongues at dawn. Escalation tightens as the echo “seeks throats,” Kieran answers by constructing sonic scaffolds, and the final whisper commits to the risked method. The cost is present but subdued (physical strain, ethical bet on silence). A single meaningful tightening (drawing it into the prism) suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—whether and how to read and act on the leaves’ message—tightens when the silver leaf introduces a rule-bending verse. The key escalation is her decision to place the leaf on the mound, trading caution for commitment and triggering irreversible transformation. Pressure remains coherent but in a hushed register; antagonism is atmospheric rather than oppositional. The cost is more duty than danger, tempering intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (control vs surrender to uncertainty) tightens credibly at the vault’s choice point. The escalation deepens knowledge (pattern-archive) and forces a trade-off: keep/record vs release/unknow. The cost is immediate—destroying the compass and abandoning the archive’s capture impulse. Pressure is consistent; one clean tightening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (redeem Jory) tightens decisively when the initial attempt fails and she must pay with confession (thirteenth symbol). Agency drives escalation; each solution raises cost or deepens commitment, culminating in pressing the coin to Jory and facing the mirror’s indictment. Prices are visible (self‑exposure, acceptance of fault) and alter outcomes, not just mood.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—freeing unattended spirits through authentic laughter—is signaled early and tightens when the tooth rattles, forcing a higher‑cost path. The decisive escalation is Eluan’s move from entertainment to guidance, with the lattice inviting pursuit under risk. Price shows via absorption of pain and the tooth’s spent state. Pressure is coherent if quiet; there’s no antagonist, but the moral/ritual demand supplies credible resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—evade capture and achieve a merciful “solution”—is active from the start and tightens in the clearing with drones at the threshold. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation (ritual with strap, refusal of despair, recalculation), and cost is legible in pain and risk. The key deepening reframes cruelty in the equation, narrowing options to vulnerability/inversion. Pressure stays coherent and culminates in a meaningful reweighting rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—translate and deliver the sea’s dialect before dawn—tightens through the discovery that the work won’t finish until return to water. The climb and river‑is‑too‑far beat coherently narrows options, pushing the moon gambit and the surrender of the shard. Cost is visible (relinquishment, exhaustion, future burden). The escalation is primarily deepening and cadence‑shift, but it convincingly reweights options.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure coheres and tightens through a single meaningful deepening: the dust‑pattern inference forces a more committed approach (crawl, retrieval). Stakes are personal and spiritual—laying ghosts to rest and fulfilling a compulsion—yet danger is low, so cost feels gentle. The mid‑scene choice (ladder vs. ceiling panel) is a real narrowing of options. Resolution is earned by action, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: achieve the perfect sentence before rupture destabilizes the library. Pressure tightens as the frost forecasts imminent rupture, culminating in the lever pull that forecloses safety for consequence. The cost manifests immediately in systemic collapse/rebirth, aligning internal desire with external upheaval. Slightly more on-page hesitation or risk calculus before the press could heighten the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—win the dispute to unlock emancipatory possibility—is signaled early and tightened by the storm window and the Institute’s demand for proof. The experiment is a decisive escalation driven by Velen’s agency; the reveal forecloses the Metron path. Cost surfaces in the victory’s ache and the acceptance of ongoing labor rather than catharsis. Slightly soft on direct antagonistic presence during the experiment, but pressure remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restore dawn—tightens through the guardians’ demand and the discovery that rust “remembers,” which forces a new tether solution. The escalations are coherent and come from Clay’s agency; the price (lifelong truth) is unmistakable. Slightly low physical jeopardy, but the ethical/ontological pressure carries the beat at this length. No coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure coheres as an interior/exterior braid: fear versus compulsion escalates with each irreversible move (entering, reading, crossing, opening). The meaningful tightening occurs at the platform where the doors open and the bottles shiver—forcing a trade: keep the curated past or surrender it to proceed. Cost is legible and not undone. Stakes remain personal yet high, culminating in a decisive step that forecloses return.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres and tightens once the lantern “demands more,” forcing Iona to choose participation and then to pay with time and craft—an escalation from being lost to bearing communal responsibility. The emissary acceptance forecloses a path (simple delivery/return), and the long build amplifies commitment. Stakes remain personal and conceptual (meaning/time), not survival-level, but they are felt at closure through villagers’ experience. The price is present but not punishing; it reads earned for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake (unlocking and embodying the night-bloom secret) is signaled and deepens through the cathedral discovery into the mural’s revelation. Escalation is primarily knowledge/intensity, not opposition; the tightening comes from the dawning deadline and the key+stair access to the chamber. The price is gentle and conceptual, yet the choice to paint with ephemeral glow forecloses permanence. One strong turn suffices at this length, though pressure remains low-conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (securing suppressed truth) escalates from seizures to field descent to a time‑limited parley as the lagoon trembles. Her agency drives turns: ignoring command, building the message, offering the cipher, posing the final question. The price—physical risk, breach of protocol, emotional toll—reads on the page, and knowledge gained (routes) reweights the world. One more on‑page obstruction en route to the lagoon might have further tightened pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reviving the town—tightens through discovery, partial success, the “ghost” risk, and a hard solution that costs selfhood. The micro‑reversal (illusion vs. real revival) forces a new tactic (sparks) and culminates in a true sacrifice. Pressure coheres and grows without an external antagonist. The cost is unmistakable at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres around whether to archive or to intervene, tightening when the discs remain blank and the field-trip memory reframes the prophecy. The decisive turn—planting the core at the foghorn—narrows options and stakes the city’s emotional tenor. The price is conceptual rather than visceral, but felt. Escalation is elegant rather than harrowing; no antagonist, yet the internal/external weave holds.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (reclaim and replant time) is signaled early and tightened when the cracked mirrors demand repair at a price. Escalation is protagonist-driven: she chooses to channel the vortex, convert the cap, and persist as aging exacts interest. The cost is visible and accumulates, sharpening commitment. No antagonist needed; pressure coheres around the ritual’s risks.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear and tight: warn early and risk commerce vs. stay silent and endanger towns. Escalation intensifies through conflicting signals (1400 green vs. plunging pressure) and the storm’s approach. The meaningful tightening is the moment she defies her own “safe margin,” paying a credibility risk. The external cost is validated quickly, tempering the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—mend the shard/sky and, by extension, the self—is signaled and tightens through alarm, protocol pressure, and the risky hatch ritual. The decisive turn is Janus choosing wonder-guided action over sealing procedure. Escalation is felt more as density and poise than as sharp reversals, appropriate to the lens but with limited concrete price. The earned resolution stems from his agency.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes (becoming steward of a covenant) are signaled and tighten through the patience trial and deciphering method, culminating in an acceptance that carries a palpable weight. Pressure coheres without an antagonist; the main turn is his endurance-driven unlocking and vow-taking. The price—surrendering solitary neutrality to carry others’ unspoken words—is legible at the peak. Slight softness: external jeopardy is low, so tension leans almost entirely on ritual gravity.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—grasping time’s texture before Basil’s runs out—is legible and escalates via discovery, alignment with Anika, and the choice to invite others. Tightening arrives at the ritual where Basil trades personal time/tool for communal knowledge. Stakes are primarily conceptual/emotional but the cost is on the page. Pressure is coherent, if quiet, under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around whether discord can be tended without perfectionism, tightened by the boy’s broken kite and his storm‑forged expectation. The meaningful narrowing is the feather’s sacrifice—an irreversible choice that forecloses keeping her talisman. Escalation is gentle but present through accumulating harmonies (village, lagoon, gulls) culminating in the launch. The stakes remain small‑scale but legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are singular and clear: achieve a cross‑species “listening” before death. Escalation is textural—density of signals and participants increases to the communal listening and revelation; the priest’s doubt and time pressure add modest friction. The cost is unmistakable (her dwindling time/energy and implied death). Pressure could tighten once more through a sharper on‑page obstacle, but the accumulative design still holds.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—whether to risk an irreversible “return” to pursue understanding—tightens from analysis to embodied choice. The pivotal cost arrives when the path vanishes and the catalysts are surrendered, leaving one forward option. Pressure is mostly tonal and accumulative rather than combative, but agency is unmistakable at the pour and the crossing. The internal reframing (“convergence within the traveler”) interlocks with the external threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming the battlefield in harmony with sea—tightens via the bird‑convened congress and his tactical stillness to avoid disruption. The avian clauses escalating to mist and seed‑kiss reads as a decisive deepening under the chosen lens. Cost is gentle but legible: he forgoes speed and certainty for ritual, patience, and the risk of failure. Resolution grows from his agency and renunciation rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—whether to break the trusted hush to pursue connection—is clear and tightens via puzzle → hidden archive → commitment to depart. The visible price is endurance and risk: walking through night, abandoning the settled stasis. Escalation is primarily deepening knowledge rather than hard opposition; no sharp reversal, but cadence shifts credibly toward the dawn signal. A bit more resistance at the hatch or during travel could heighten felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—ritual as lifeline and reorientation—intensifies with the unsanctioned reveal of the stars and the terse intercom command. The protagonist’s agency drives key turns (lights off, defying hold position by presenting the sketch, sending the ship). Escalation is subtle but coherent under the accumulative lens. The on‑page price is mostly emotional and procedural risk, not direct peril.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—restoring uncertainty to the chess set/time—remains coherent. The meaningful turn is the Curator’s acceptance and the joint ceremony, but opposition is light and costs are largely conceptual. Tension accrues accrual‑style rather than through hard reversals. The result is satisfying but not teeth‑bared.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—custody of truth during interregnum—tightens as Calypso demands UNBIND and arrays followers on alternating tiles. Ezra’s counter (bishop scrape, then CHECKMATE gait) credibly narrows options and forces a trade: share or risk seizure. The price is a principled compromise under threat; no soft reset follows. Escalation is quiet but unmistakable and rooted in agency rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is clear and pressured by the live clock of nightly reshuffle; the tremor converts “hidden thunder” into active threat. The protagonist’s seeding and final utterance are agentive turns that narrow options and resolve the risk. The price is primarily conceptual/emotional rather than materially taxing, which slightly softens the edge. Still, the escalation reads coherent and tightening under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is focused: restart the village’s pulse by confronting guilt. Escalation tightens effectively—tapestry correction yields a partial win (fountain trickle) but forces a deeper turn (internal confession) when villagers remain frozen. The final act forecloses an old self‑narrative at real cost, not a convenience. Tension persists across beats via the hush’s gradual lowering and the thunder‑lull cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stakes (freedom vs. the price of forgiveness) tighten when the spire states the memory-cost, foreclosing a path and forcing a trade-off. Vera’s agency drives escalation—poetry as pressure, color ritual, and the proposal—to convert an external arrest into a negotiated release. The cost is conceptual but felt: she refuses forgetting, accepts living with failures as palette, and risks naming the Marshal in a wandering poem. Tension modulates rather than spikes, but the deepening is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is legible and tight: survive the environment while repairing a wounded world, then accept personal rupture as the necessary cost. The live clock of breath and the workshop’s tilt create a meaningful tightening that forecloses hesitation. Reversals deepen via the personal constellation of perforations and the “final seam” realization. Resolution is protagonist-driven and paid for, with only a minor glossiness in how swiftly the external steadies.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—fulfilling a private, time‑bound promise—tightens via the wrong turn to the turquoise chamber and the confrontation with the mirror. Escalation deepens through the act of painting the shattered glass, which forecloses the path of clinging to self‑image and accepts a cost (transience, leaving the shell). Pressure coheres internally and culminates in a charged poise. Slightly soft external opposition, but the internal test is credible and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear and tested on the page; the meaningful tightening is the paired release (whisper first, then horn) and the breath‑held wait. The price is reputational/faith‑based rather than tangible, but it’s legible: Milo risks his claimed method in a public test. Tension peaks at the bell’s single note preceding their own echo. Stakes are intimate yet firm, with no easy outs.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres around one stake: follow the reverse currents or remain to guide others. Escalation comes via density—apparatus rises, the sky reconfigures, the voice clarifies—until the trade-off is explicit: departure collapses the system. The price is legible in her self-modifications and the station’s dependency on her. It’s a quiet turn, but the narrowing of options is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—finding a humane buffer against compulsive truth—tightens through the price demanded by the eye and the council risk. The decisive deepening is the forced confession that exacts emotional cost and changes tactics (from solitary fix to communal recipe). The Mara beat adds credible external pressure without resolving by coincidence. Stakes are intimate but decisive at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around decoding the gesture; the key tightening is the decision to trust the “gaps” method, which yields visions and the ampoule. Stakes remain intimate but tangible: whether he can find and keep what was entrusted—and what that costs him. The decision to keep and place the ampoule (not chase the stranger) forecloses an alternative path. Tension is quiet but sustained, appropriate for the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (find the doorway/sister before the creek overtops) tightens through rising water, the hourglass chamber, and the isthmus trembling. The decisive tightening is selecting one arch among many, foreclosing alternatives and sealing the door. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (ants) complicates but doesn’t resolve without his choices. The price is mostly conceptual/emotional, not bodily, but it’s legible and timely.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—heal the sky by confessing and relinquishing power—is signaled early and tightens at the orb’s reveal. The key deepening is the revelation that she herself wounded the starlight, which forces a higher‑cost choice. The price persists (public abdication, toppled palaces) and charges the descent. External friction is light, but the moral pressure and irreversible vow create credible escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether to capture presence and how to value “success”—tightens through the experiment’s failure and the injury, then spikes with the ethical visions. The decisive turn is Cressida’s renunciation: scattering the colors and sealing the shell. Cost is explicit (forgoing immediate world-healing power while averting weaponization), and agency drives the outcome. Tension layers internally and externally without needing an antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—wresting narrative control/time to prevent the foretold death—tightens through flight and the intervention with the younger self. The decisive choice forecloses a path (the rookie’s conquest) and alters the gravestone’s certainty. Pressure coheres from cabin -> platform -> sky -> desk, each narrowing options. The price is emotionally legible and threads directly into the ending’s revised authorship.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restore the clamp before the imminent birth—is clear and tightens when Amira chooses to sacrifice the water clock. The visible price (losing/maiming the clock’s integrity) is legible and ties to identity. Escalation is gentle; the repair path lacks a setback or reversal, relying on cadence rather than obstacle. Still, agency drives the turn and the test beat functions as a meaningful deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are focused on authorship of pain under temporal and environmental pressure. Escalation tightens from safe droplets to the unwritten jagged ridge, then the storm rock forces a bolder tactic (blood + tea). The price is felt and alters options; after the rune, fear is renegotiated rather than erased. No antagonist is needed; agency clearly drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—carry an apology before the orchard falls—tightens under a visible clock and a public test (workers, mayor). Marisol’s agency drives the escalation: bait, induction, possession, performance, and a final offering. The price is partial relief and the acknowledgment of limits, not a clean win. The tension is strong, though the opposition remains largely atmospheric rather than actively adversarial.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—freeing reality from its concealment—tightens through the librarian’s demand, the convened arbitration, and the plea’s tipping into verdict. Agency drives turns (the “Now” answer, initiating the testimony, weaponizing the dictionary, consenting to unity). Cost is an internal renunciation—letting go of needing to know—felt but abstract. Stakes avoid telescopic inflation by translating cosmic scope into a decisive courtroom cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (restore function/understand time) is signaled early and tightens with the discovery of the crack and blade‑billet. Agency drives escalation—he chooses investigation, unlocking, and repair—while danger (razor edges, sabotage memory) shades the attempt. The decisive deepening is the mirror revelation that reweights the external task. Costs are more thematic than bodily; a touch more on‑page jeopardy would raise pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—maintain secure boundaries or embrace permeability—tightens with the duplicate’s appearance, the barrier test, and the button press. Escalation is protagonist‑driven; each choice forecloses her prior path. Cost is conceptual but legible (risking job, dissolving her security identity). Lack of external pushback keeps the pressure modest rather than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—whether to tame or admit chance—tightens when the graffiti recurs and the lantern appears, forcing a trade‑off (break the talismanic pane). The cost is visible (destroying the heirloom) and reweights the quest. Pressure is quiet but coherent, escalating from data‑gathering to decisive act. Slight softness remains in external resistance, but internal tension carries the load.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (reconfigure endings) tightens when the system turns on him and the call loops to his twelve‑year‑old self. He chooses a costly stance—answers, reframes, and relinquishes control—foreclosing a path of curated distance. Pressure coheres without an antagonist; the cadence shift is decisive and earned. Slightly soft on explicit price beyond the emotional, but it registers.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (observer vs custodian) is established early and tightens when the pocket’s unsent letter appears, forcing a non‑neutral act. Escalation is coherent under a causal lens, culminating in a deliberate crossing of a line. The cost is subtle but present—accepting perpetual vigilance and responsibility. Tension operates at beat and image levels without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes (curing loneliness) are clear early and pressure coheres as strangers arrive on mismatched rumors, funneling into the listening experiment. The meaningful tightening is the shift from silence to shared thrumming that alters options (from isolation to cadence). Conflict remains low‑friction—no real resistance or trade‑off beyond vulnerability—so escalation is felt but not bracing. Resolution earns its quiet, but the price is soft.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is clear: locate and map the stillpoint; pressure coheres as the melody resists resolution until she risks inwardness. The meaningful tightening is the failed dowsing and the internal pivot, culminating in the relinquishment of the ring—a visible price. Stakes remain intimate yet consequential, with internal and external threads braided. Escalation is quiet but decisive within the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether to keep editing reality—tightens coherently as the pulses escalate and the basalt “disapproves,” pressing an ethical decision. The turn (“do not laugh, listen”) narrows options and forces a trade‑off. The price (foregoing corrective power) is legible and reweights the ending. Slightly abstracted stakes keep it just shy of maximal bite.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (revive music before sunrise) tightens under the live clock and the need to assemble a choir from silence. The mid‑scene tactic shift—collecting twelve hushes, then arranging them—narrows options and forces bolder signing. Cost is legible: Harlan’s vanishing and Mara’s erasure from memory against communal gain. Slight softness: opposition is atmospheric rather than actively resisting, but pressure still coheres and deepens.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (redeem the promise/seek forgiveness) is clear and tightens through the artistic trail to the archive. The meaningful turn is Ash choosing to unfasten the amulet and place the ember despite past punishment, a renunciation that can’t be undone. Pressure is mostly internal and textural rather than antagonistic, but it coheres and intensifies appropriately for the length. A single additional beat of friction or risk in the archive could have sharpened the perceived cost.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stakes—autonomy and the ethical ownership of shared memory—are signaled early and deepen as Ira disrupts synchronization. Pressure coheres as her micro‑choice (tapping) catalyzes others, forcing a trade‑off between control and communal authorship. The felt cost is the relinquishment of private grief to the collective and the risk of defying the Institute mid‑procedure. Escalation is cleanly protagonist‑driven under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear and escalates: secret corridor discovery → illicit “Whisper Network” → patrol pressure → tactic shift leveraging ducts. The tightening is driven by protagonist agency, with a credible reversal when patrols appear and options narrow. The price paid is mainly risk and deferred institutional confrontation, not an on‑page wound or loss. Stakes feel tense but could sharpen with a more concrete cost.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—will the narrator spend a private grief to light the water—tightens once the cost is revealed. The decisive deepening is the explicit exchange rule, which forces a trade. The resolution is paid for by the narrator’s agency rather than coincidence. Slight softness: the external pressure is benevolent, so escalation leans inward, but it remains coherent and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are coherent (can attention be slowed and contemplation seeded?) and escalate via the missing-square problem that requires the grotto. The reveal compresses social pressure into a communal pause, with Silas’s renunciation of recognition as the price. However, opposition remains gentle and abstract; there’s little risk of failure beyond concept not landing. A tangible obstacle would sharpen the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—freedom via surrender—tightens when the island flickers and requires him to stop rowing, a concrete narrowing of options. His choice forecloses return and is tested by the island’s conditional disappearance. Price is conceptual/emotional rather than bodily, but it reads on the page (policies shouted, piracy turned theater, land life abandoned). Escalation is coherent and protagonist-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—avoiding punitive enforcement while honoring grief—is present early and tightens decisively at sirens/entrance. Escalation is driven by Marrow’s agency (carving, lighting the lamp) rather than coincidence; the midnight grid lull complicates but does not resolve by itself. The price is compliance optics and reliance on ambiguity under surveillance. The resolution is earned without soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around whether language and truth can hum again in public after the ban, tightening when they take the act into the plaza and the ground itself responds. The risk of censors and social rupture is palpable in the crowd’s hush and merchants’ disruption. Escalation is accumulative rather than adversarial, but the public act under pressure functions as a test with stakes. The cost is felt, if not catastrophic.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—earning permission to trade flaw for fire and prove imperfect beauty—is signaled early and tightens as Lio moves from observer to maker. Key deepening beats: Lio’s first lopsided tear, Goran’s wince, the read message (“beauty hides where symmetry fails”), then joint breathing and seeding a shard. Costs are legible (Goran risks his standard of perfection; Lio risks failure in a sacred hour). Escalation is quiet but coherent under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—connection vs. purity—tightens at the surge-induced failure, forcing a tactical pivot. Lio’s choice to hum imperfectly forecloses performance-as-purity and risks exposure; this drives the breakthrough chorus and braided signature. Pressure grows coherently under the textural lens rather than via adversarial reversal. The price is felt, if more conceptual than physical.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—transmuting grief into communal navigation—tightens via a decisive self-wounding choice (tattoo), public risk (origami distribution), and a pointed self‑reckoning (dragon coordinates to herself). Costs are felt (blood, vulnerability, relinquishing old mourning tropes for riskier compasses). Pressure coheres without an antagonist, and the self‑directed turn narrows options meaningfully. Slight safety in outcomes (swift communal uptake) keeps it just shy of maximal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is legible: how to navigate/regrow culture from failed ledgers. Pressure deepens via the reading’s emergent pattern and tightens at the counsel: “follow the line alone, or let others mark their inches.” Cost centers on relinquishing solitary authorship; escalation is quiet but clear under the accumulative lens. No adversary needed; agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—gain and carry forbidden knowledge without self‑erasure—is clear and tightens through ritual constraints that demand a sacrifice. The decisive tightening is the chamber’s ask and her renunciation of the veil, followed by the painful syncopation to receive the glyphs. Internal and external pressures interweave, and the resolution flows from her altered stance. Stakes remain personal and legible, not inflated beyond the scene’s scale.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is legible early (“preserve the shape of hope”), and pressure tightens at the charter line; the narrator’s renunciation and Eira’s leap serve as the major turn. The resolution arises from their agency, not coincidence. However, escalation softens because the descent’s risks and obstacles are skipped, and consequences of breaking the rule aren’t dramatized. Tension otherwise hums at sentence level via the shadow and motes.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—integrity vs. banishment—tightens via ritual purges and the approaching dawn; the decision to return with honest demonstrations forecloses the path of deceit. Cost is legible: social risk and loss of comfort in applause. External pressure is mostly offstage but coherently present. The brazier sequences function as escalating tests of commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are focused: risk the self to restore a miracle to its rightful host. Escalation tightens via time (hourglass/anesthesia), physical self‑harm, discovery of the keyhole, and a committed sprint to the child. The price is legible (blood, pain, urgency), and the final act forecloses retreat. Tension could sharpen with a single complicating snag (e.g., a miscut or brief doubt) to push from strong to exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are singular—freeing unused love—and escalate via the corridor discovery to the projection choice and the music reveal. Pressure stays coherent under the accumulative lens, but opposition is soft and success is relatively unresisted. The key tightening is the decision to project the never‑shown film, narrowing options with responsibility for fragile artifacts. Cost remains more conceptual than visceral, tempering peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (“free trapped creativity”) is present from the outset and tightens at the surrender condition, which forecloses a personal path. The key pressure point is the demand to relinquish the final speck; fear vs. purpose forces a costly decision. The resolution emerges from his agency, not coincidence, and consequences ripple outward (village awakening) while leaving him altered. Tension accrues at sentence and beat scales without soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—deliver and germinate the archive—is signaled and tightened by the subsong deadline and descent. Escalation is coherent: discovery of the compass, path activation, and the commitment to go below before “dawnless cold.” Resolution is driven by Silas’s agency, but the on‑page price is muted rather than costly. Still, the single tightening suits the piece’s length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes escalate through density: from navigation by forest timbre to the observatory’s mind-maps to the frontier’s emergence and a chosen destination. The tightening moment is the gear completing the machine and the hum’s crescendo compelling a surrender. Cost is understated—overwhelm, fatigue, and relinquishing the gear—so pressure is more lyric than visceral. Resolution stems from Jonas’s agency without coincidence solving anything.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.7)
    Pressure coheres around the single stake (find unused courage) and tightens at the clearing where endurance is required without guarantees. The decisive tactic—stillness and waiting under uncertainty—forecloses retreat and pays a felt price. Escalation tracks under the accumulative lens: detours, forking paths, doctrine of obliqueness → vigil. Slight softness remains in external risk, but internal stakes carry.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—safety via enforced silence versus the human need to sound a note—tightens as they ascend to the sealed piano. The decisive turn (unscrewing the bolt) forecloses obedience to the law and tests the nurses’ warning. While no disaster strikes, the risk and reweighting of the law read as a cost borne in the moment. Pressure is coherent and grows toward that single, meaningful choice.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (unmask the pretender) is clear and escalates from sub-rosa marginalia to public destabilization to on‑stage rupture. Agency drives the turns (Lysar’s speech; Selestine’s pellet) and forecloses a path (the pretender’s legitimacy). The cost is social and symbolic rather than personal-wounding, but it’s legible and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are coherent and escalate from eerie anomalies to a life‑risking descent. The decisive tightening arrives when the cavity is confirmed and the door signals back, leaving Mara to choose whether to answer. Agency drives each turn; the on‑page cost is implicit in the descent and explicit in the note. A sharper on‑page hazard in the final approach could intensify the price even further.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (what to do with the lull) clarifies early, and pressure coheres via time narrowing (“margin of daylight,” “before generals awoke”) and the circle’s escalating hum. The turn arrives when the vision reframes tools of war, foreclosing a martial path in favor of a risky, time‑sensitive alternative. External pressure is light (one soldier’s bark), but internal/external threads braid sufficiently at closure. The cost is implied rather than confronted, keeping it short of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether and how to unseal “implanted destiny”—tightens through the pledge’s ethical constraint. The escalation hinges on Liora’s agency, with one strong pressure point: accepting the non-throne vow to proceed. The price is legible (renouncing royal claim, assuming custodial risk). Slight lack of resistance or setback keeps the pressure from peaking higher.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (hold steady under trauma while leading others) tightens at the thunder beat, forcing a test of her stance; the risk of freezing and losing the group’s regulation is a real price. The recovery via touch is a credible adaptation, and she chooses to lead onward, foreclosing retreat. Pressure is coherent and grows through the accumulative design rather than reversals. A slight cushion remains because external risk is low, but the internal cost reads.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether he can “redesign” his life by confronting the fractured Moon/mother—tightens through the storm, reality’s slippage, and the rising indoor tide. The decisive turn is the renunciation (letting the card drift), which exacts a price (relinquishing control/answer). Pressure escalates coherently, though one more concrete external impediment could have sharpened the cost. Still, the internal and external lines braid effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is focused and escalates: from mystery at the encampment to a metaphysical engine beneath the scene. The meaningful tightening arrives when the chamber’s purpose is revealed, forcing Sulin to choose between immediate aid and deeper pursuit. Cost is legible as delay and peril, with his promise to return sharpening the tension. A single on‑page reversal is sufficient at this length and lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—risking self and institution to free a truth—tightens as she moves from contemplation to illegal broadcast to discovery by authority. The confrontation with Malvek is a deepening, not an easy rescue, reshaping cost through his condition. The reply crystallizes consequence without deflating pressure. Prices (oath violation, exposure, complicity) are clear and alter available futures.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (preserve dome/continuity) is early and coherent, with escalation at the convoy’s arrival and a strategic pivot to demonstration. The sheathing beat credibly forecloses violent options and narrows tactics to the rose‑based plan. The outcome is earned by Amber’s stance rather than coincidence. Still, the resolution asks for only modest sacrifice in-scene, tempering peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (capture vs harm to a living echo) escalates coherently: setup desire → capture → constellations’ sky‑warning → release. The tightening is unmistakable, and the visible price (letting go) charges the end. Internal and external pressures interweave—his gift amplifies both temptation and empathy. Slightly low on secondary costs (no lost tool or injury), but unnecessary at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure coheres around a single dominant stake—publish the buried truth at personal and institutional cost—and tightens when Felix presents carbon copies. The act of scratching the orrery and the explicit vow foreclose the path of silence. The cost is legible (lawsuits/shareholders/reputation, sale of estate). Escalation is measured but purposeful, fitting the length.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clear (freeing children/parents from corrosive translations and confronting his guilt) and escalate through increasing hush, the precise ritual steps, and the blood-drop apex. The main tightening occurs as he commits to inscribing his own body and pricking his finger—foreclosing the path of living with the ghost. The price is legible in his felt diminishment and the irrevocable containment of the ghost. External pushback is light, so the tension resides primarily in the charged cadence and commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—finding meaning—tightens as observers gather and silence inhibits easy questions. Felicity’s agency drives the key turns (chalk ring, violet swirl), culminating in the anti‑prophecy table that forecloses the grand‑riddle path. The emotional price is subtle but legible: participants accept ordinary labor over oracular drama. Tension scales via accumulative density rather than reversals and stays taut.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure escalates texturally: shard → arrangement → wind’s chord → spoken echo → blue sparks → renaming. The dominant stake (rename to reforge destiny) is clear and tightens once meaningfully at the naming. Opposition is internal/ambient rather than antagonistic, so cost is more spiritual than tactical but still legible. Agency drives the turn; coincidence does not resolve it.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (mend the fractured timeline/secure Lazzaro’s encore) escalates through a clear tightening: breath as echoes → dual presents → loop revealed → rope thrown. Agency is protagonist-led at the decisive moment. The price is felt but relatively gentle; danger reads more conceptual than visceral, keeping tension high but not harrowing. Still, the cadence shift at the rope-throw is satisfying and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—advance discovery without exploitation—tightens from proof-of-concept awe to invasive threat. The major turn (foreign thought) forces a tactical renunciation (protocol two), foreclosing the option to continue. Cost and consequence are legible, and tension scales naturally from wonder to danger. Pressure is coherent under the chosen lens without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is legible: to become a conduit for the unknown rather than a bureaucratic measurer. Pressure coheres through the surge and invitation; his choices narrow options (accepting the corridor means being sealed in). The visible price (isolation, loss of instruments, fossil’s eventual crumbling) charges the ending. Escalation is driven by his agency in a lyric frame, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear: make the prophecy usable before dawn, tested when the sand’s chaos threatens failure. The decisive tightening is Lenra choosing “shared hearing,” which narrows options and resolves the tangle. Cost is present as exposure and surrender of solitary control, though it’s felt more as ethos than pain. Tension scales appropriately for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around whether trust can be repaired enough to move forward, escalating through the cipher test to the fine-motor risk of the repair. The hinge is the click—small but decisive—and the snow-line “go west, together” forecloses separation. Cost is primarily emotional and reputational; external resistance is gentle, so the escalation feels finely tuned rather than harrowing. Still, the tightening is clear and earned under the hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—simplifying the family’s burden and the coachman’s—tightens via the live clock and the ritual choice to thread a single silver hair. The key deepening is the ripple-reaching-far-bank beat where silence falls, foreclosing waiting and enabling departure. The cost is conceptual but legible: relinquished questions and ongoing service framed as price. Escalation remains quiet but focused, appropriate to the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure coheres around aligning fractured timelines and testing the oasis as a “kiln for the world.” The turning intensification is the brief alignment—“bees of light”—which reweights stakes and prompts the kiln plan. Cost is primarily patience and labor in a hostile place; no sharp external opposition limits peak tension. Still, the deepening is earned and options narrow toward waiting for the smoke’s hour.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (bringing light/hope for Nara) tightens from symbolic loss (rose) to mechanical trial (lock/prism) to ethical risk (move Nara). The key turn—his refusal to be sole savior and to involve Nara—narrows options and carries visible cost. Pressure coheres and rises without an antagonist, driven by his agency. The brief temporary stabilization only to face the widening fissure is an earned deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (alchemize isolation into independence) is active from the sundial’s message to the chosen verb and departure. Escalation is a measured tightening: internal directive → ancestral responsibility → verb‑wheel narrowing → committing to descent, with library “tilt” adding situational pressure. Cost is legible in leaving home/memory and accepting risk. Lack of a hard antagonist limits peak torque but coherence and agency stay strong.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes (find the thread; reconcile secrecy with sharing) tighten as Mara moves from observation to release, with a clear pressure point at the archiving question. The reversal is gentle but real: from guarding to redistributing secrets. Cost is present but soft; it’s ethical and identity-based rather than material. Escalation fits the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—thwart the tricksters by preventing division—is signaled early and tightened when Calvin threatens to amplify panic, foreclosing a path. Mina’s reroute and inversion create a meaningful narrowing and reveal trade‑offs (public acclaim/funding vs. communal protection). Pressure remains coherent and grows to a clean peak. A slightly clearer on‑page price for defying Calvin could heighten the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is clear (retrieve key vs. moral cost of war), and pressure tightens through the moving cage and constricting tunnels. A meaningful deepening occurs when she must negotiate space rather than force it, narrowing tactic options. The final moral calculus (starve vs. arm) crystallizes with a felt conceptual price. Stakes could read even sharper with one more concrete risk to her body on the retrieval beat.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—expose the truth/awaken empathy—is clear, with a meaningful tightening when she commits to bringing both suspects and asserts “together.” Escalation is steady but low‑resistance; the confession arrives quickly, minimizing felt price. The internal/external conflicts interweave, though the ethical calculus faces little pushback. Effective but not pressing hard enough for higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.1)
    One dominant stake—reversing exile—tightens through the storm’s escalation and the discovered rules. The decisive exchange forecloses Marla’s return with visible cost. Agency drives each turn; the “question” tactic is both conceptual and physical. The clipboard-grip from Havel adds immediate relational pressure without hijacking the core stake.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (can art reconfigure possibility for the vanished hitchhiker and Avery) is clear and tightens through music as tactic. Escalation is driven by agency—bowing opens the corridor; recounting brightens the lens; resultant bridge demands the letting‑go. Prices are felt though soft‑edged, with the emotional trade‑off of enabling her departure. No antagonist is needed; pressure coheres under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are coherent (orientation vs. exploitation), with a meaningful tightening when they interrogate algorithms and discover the union-preserved loop. Agency drives resolution: they forgo the old frame and choose a slower, listening posture. The price is implied (profit and certainty ceded) rather than dramatized in loss, keeping escalation strong but not searing. No antagonist is needed; the pressure remains consistent and deepens.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear and tightens via the decoding and the decision to broadcast, which forecloses isolation. Pressure accumulates texturally rather than through reversals, but the emotional price is legible. The revelation about Ariston reframes danger and responsibility, deepening stakes. A touch more hazard or competing demand could have sharpened the turn further.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is clear early and tightens at the ice mirror, where self‑punishment actively resists progress. The negotiation with the apples adds a credible external check that forces a values articulation. Escalation peaks with the naming of truths, a costed tactic that breaks the barrier. Slight limitation: external danger recedes quickly after that peak, keeping the conflict primarily internal.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—undo coercive labyrinths while preserving memory—is present early and tightens at the cut decision. The escalation is protagonist‑driven; the price is unmistakable (blood, scarring, surrender to unknown consequences). Internal and external conflicts interlock; the spiral redesign is both tactical and ethical. Pressure is coherent and crescendos cleanly without coincidence rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is clear early: trade destiny to restore Mira. Pressure tightens credibly when memory proves insufficient, forcing Liora to spend her lived future; the subsequent seed choice and ballast add immediate, felt prices. The reversal (saving Mira at the cost of her own guidance) arises from her agency, not coincidence. Consequences persist into the exit beat.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (recover reels to redeem/resolve grief) is clear and tightens through the notebook reveal and the physical hazard of the descent/lock. The act of wrestling the lock and confronting the Polaroid tests his coping tactic of facts. Cost is more emotional than physical, but it’s felt on the page. Escalation is steady if modest; no false shortcuts.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake—piercing the passage rule—and tightens when the arbor demands the right “linguistic voltage,” then when the presence gathers and he chooses not to look. The seed’s split and the street‑lattice introduce a deepening that narrows tactics (careful mapping, voice modulation). Costs are internal (acceptance over summoning), legible but quiet. No external adversary, yet agency clearly drives outcomes.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is legible: prevent homogenization by remaking identities. Escalation arrives as a cadence shift—opening the creel, unleashing names, then the paradox‑song that precipitates sparks and masks. The turn is earned but low‑friction; no credible alternative path is pressured or foreclosed beyond the serene duty. Cost remains primarily conceptual, tempering peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are internal—will he keep inspecting walls or risk vulnerability—and they tighten via the shell’s confessions and the imperative to crown. The decisive turn is his confession, which carries an unmistakable price and changes options (from inspector to bearer of hopes). Escalation is more deepening than reversal, fitting the lens. Slight softness comes from minimal external friction.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (forgiveness) tightens through discovery and descent, then crystallizes into a physical, risky, time‑bound task. The encounter with Mara deepens pressure, reframing the narrator’s goal into an actionable ethic. Price is evident (confronting guilt, physical labor, potential danger). Slight softness remains as the external success and internal relief dovetail neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (access and index the unspoken archive before time closes) is legible and tightens at the silence-command and the watch freezing at midnight. The choice to remain silent and later surrender the watch forecloses options. Pressure escalates through pattern-deepening rather than antagonism, fitting the chosen lens. Costs are felt, not merely declared.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (restoring Solon’s dream against empire’s appropriation) is signaled early and tightens once when Liora activates the violin, risking social upheaval. Pressure coheres as the plant network amplifies, banners wilt, and she fears collapse, yet proceeds. The cost isn’t deeply personal beyond fear and potential culpability, but the escalation is protagonist‑driven and consequential. Resolution is earned by her choice to propagate through the botanical network.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are singular and legible: can she preserve a meaningful spark. Pressure tightens via the tuned frequency and the razor’s‑edge timing at the “threshold of stillness.” The decisive act (infusion and sealing the circuit) entails a price: spent gem, vowed return, and inviting oblivion’s notice. Tension deepens rather than twists, appropriate to the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (can he truly let go to join the “river” of contentment) is signaled and coherently tightened. The key turn is protagonist-driven: he gifts the hairpin to the pool, paying a clear price. Internal pressure escalates credibly through memory surfacing and ritualized ascent; the tree’s seam opening functions as a pressure reveal, not a deus ex machina. Quiet, but the cost is unmistakable and endures beyond the page.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (how to decide without breaking) is pressured by the fee and the dawning clock; escalation arrives via ascent to the lantern room and the chimes’ ethic that asks for discomfort before comfort. A meaningful deepening occurs when the shard’s meaning reconfigures in light of the tower’s “instruction.” The price—renouncing a verdict, surrendering the shard, accepting doubt—is legible though quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—learning to vanish through earned patience—tightens via the paradoxical entry condition and Rowan’s surrender. The meaningful turn is his choice to step without desire, foreclosing the path of impatient grasping. Cost is legible: he dissolves and Mira withholds recall. Tension is quiet but persistent; one more outward consequence might have sharpened the felt danger.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure escalates via density: listening becomes a test, then a dangerous empowerment that requires balance. The meaningful tightening is the recognition that unbalanced use could “collapse” the canyon, leading to the grounding act. Stakes remain conceptually scaled rather than visceral, but they’re coherent and paid off. Agency drives the turns; coincidence never resolves them.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    One coherent stake (finding a living, human magic) escalates through a failed attempt (quills can’t deliver) to a deeper attempt (descent, brazier). The key tightening is the refusal of automation and the risked descent on belief‑made stairs. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, but it narrows his path and has external consequence (quills falter). Tension remains steady, if quiet, with no empty intensifiers.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are singular and clear: earn the answer to “the color of sound” by risking honesty. Pressure coheres and tightens once: discovery and reading of the ledger force a vow that forecloses hiding. The price is vulnerability and a public, irreversible manifestation. Tension is lyric rather than adversarial; one additional friction beat earlier could amplify squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (lead the colony into unknown peril) is crystal, and pressure coheres as the casting escalates from vibration to an impossible chord to the imperative clause. The colony’s held breaths and matched “birth cries” sharpen the hinge. Cost is present as risk and responsibility, though not paid on-page beyond the commitment. A single decisive tightening occurs; no antagonist is needed.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are legible early (contain/fathom the echo of sacrifice), escalate through the pattern break of the nameless void, and are answered by a committed act. Agency drives turns: taking the atlas, naming monsters, choosing to wield light, coining the final name. The price persists (lingering echo; vowed commission). Tension operates at sentence and scene scales without soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    One dominant stake (rebalance the cosmos) tightens through clear turns: initial attempt → universe listens → imbalance flips toward weightlessness → converging water threatens to drown the fix → personal sacrifice restores poise. The cost is legible (spent resources, risk of shattering, giving sweat, accepting “lukewarm” as calibrated devotion). Escalation is protagonist-driven rather than coincidental. Consequences modulate the final state (a “playful lightness” lingers), not a soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (preserving memory vs. institutional narrative) is signaled early and tightens when she raises the gate, a meaningful foreclosing choice. Pressure coheres as the lake recedes faster, enabling the curation sprint. The price is implied rather than enacted, but tension persists through dawn. Quiet, earned escalation suits the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transcendence vs. preserved humanity/balance—is signaled early and tightened by the omen of turbulence and the tree’s demanded price. The memory exchange raises cost and narrows options; the “wick, not conflagration” decision forecloses a path. Tension coheres at sentence and beat scales (birds’ warning, cold fire, older‑than‑language voice). Consequences persist as a pulse under her collarbone and an ongoing vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear early (prevent mutiny from breaking the ceasefire), with one meaningful tightening: Command’s doubt forces a reframed, risk‑bearing proposal. The reversal is internal/strategic rather than combative, fitting the lens. The felt price is endurance and responsibility, not a dramatic wound, but it charges the final image. Tension sustains at line and beat levels without gimmickry.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—custody of personhood versus numbness—is signaled early and escalates through the choice to “vivify” via opposites rather than duel. The synchronization scene is the key tightening that reconfigures options and extracts cost (loss of clones as forms). The external cosmic pressure amplifies but doesn’t resolve the conflict; agency does. A trace of ritual smoothness mutes peril in the middle, but the cost lands.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes (safeguarding innovation vs. the corpse flower’s disruptive odor) are legible and tighten when the seed fissures early, forcing immediate adaptation. The urgency of germination provides the key deepening; venting the lid and designing airflow are solid responses. However, the price is projected rather than felt in-scene, limiting peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is precise: restore laughter. Escalation is a controlled intensification (engines from cough to roar to whisper) culminating in upstairs micro‑turns (mother’s tears, father’s blade‑song) that make cost felt. While not a hard either/or choice, the cadence shift from wail to whisper is a committed renunciation that closes a path. Agency sits firmly with Orren’s method and modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—engage the threshold or remain with uncertainty—is signaled early and tightened by the pendant warming and door‑handle realization. The meaningful trade‑off is presence over passage; friendship with uncertainty requires refusal now. Escalation is quiet but coherent under the textural lens. Stakes remain internal yet consequential to the role and future pages guarded.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—interrupting destiny—tightens via the iterative ritual to the required sacrifice of hopelessness, foreclosing his prior identity. The meaningful deepening arrives when he realizes the mask itself must be surrendered, escalating cost. Resolution stems from his agency (confession) rather than coincidence. Stakes remain personal and visceral; no antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (harvesting a beginning to avert silence) is signaled early, with time pressure from perigee and dead lifts. The tightening occurs in the descent and the repurposing ritual, culminating in the artifact’s expenditure; a real price is paid. Conflict remains mostly frictionless—few setbacks beyond logistics and the clock—but agency drives every turn. The piece earns its resolution through action rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (return/merge timelines) is signaled early and tightens as the ferry slips into the grotto. The key escalation is Milo claiming agency by turning the hourglass and actively guiding alignment, not passively waiting. Prices are suggested (some identities foreclosed, Rowan altered) but not strongly cashed on the page. Still, pressure coheres and deepens in step with the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clear early (“math of wonder” must “stand upright”), and pressure coheres as guests’ released pain tightens threads toward catastrophic eruption. The pivotal tightening results from the very tactic meant to heal, forcing a costly trade: Mara sacrifices her own keystone memory. Tension scales sentence-to-scene without contrivance. The only slight limit is that external counterpressure (sirens) remains atmospheric rather than complicating tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—recover a means to navigate by starlight—is clear early. Escalation tightens from classroom experiment to high‑risk trench test, with the key deepening on the realization that the alien lights are lighthouses. The price is mostly conceptual/implicit; few visible losses or forced trade‑offs occur on the page. Still, agency drives the turn, and pressure coheres under the hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure escalates coherently under the chosen lens: faint ticks intensify to giggle/co‑ordinates to vault activation. The trade‑off of power and safety sharpens the final choice, even if the price remains modest. No antagonist is needed; the external puzzle entwines with Mira’s internal duty. Stakes remain intimate yet clear and tighten once in the vault.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—resurrecting the drowned archive within a shrinking tidal window—tightens once meaningfully when the gate ignites and the silhouettes urge retreat. The cost (foregoing further recovery, risk of entrapment) is felt as she exits while the facility sinks. Escalation is coherent and protagonist‑driven, though one additional on‑page complication during the return could have intensified pressure. Still, the clock and alarms supply credible squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is clear: what will she sacrifice to cohere the ghost for the wisdom she seeks. Escalation tightens when the ghost demands a price; the tape choice forecloses a path with visible loss. Internal and external threads braid, and the resolution arises from her agency. Cost remains legible through the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—salvage a dying language without succumbing to madness—tightens as echoes “argue” and vowels “collapse,” forcing accelerated tactics. The siphon glyph and constriction produce a meaningful pressure turn that narrows options. The price (sacrificing the diamond, sealing the passage) is legible and tied to his choice. Tension is more textural than adversarial but remains coherent and rising.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (contact/transform grief) tightens when the narrator chooses to risk exposure by activating the phone and then by confessing resentments. The power shifts subtly (Juniper sensing a chorus, the mulch answering with Devon’s laughter), and the price is legible (erased logs, surrendering bitterness). Escalation is more internal than antagonistic, but the cadence shift at the blackout and emergence is decisive. A bit more resistance could heighten cost, yet the earned deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring organic life versus enforced silence—is active from the outset and tightens through synchronized signaling and the chiseling turn. The locust shell’s release functions as a decisive intensification. The cost is legible (political/ethical treason), though physical jeopardy remains largely atmospheric as statues falter quickly. Escalation is agency‑driven and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear—what to do with the storm—tightened by patrol pressure and the single mail drop. Escalation is steady as he nears the mailbox; the girl beat deepens moral stakes rather than distracting. The final act is an earned renunciation, though the on‑page price is implicit rather than bite‑hard immediate. Tension coheres at sentence and beat levels without gimmick.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes focus on transforming silence into possibility by repairing/mending story and world; pressure tightens via the shard’s revelation and the requirement to craft precise chimes before the final song. Escalation is steady under a causal lens, though opposition remains mostly atmospheric and internal. The decisive act (singing with the tuned fragment) credibly resolves the drive. A slightly firmer price or live resistance could heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (accessing and retrieving story‑matter) escalates via density and a single decisive turn: the corridor’s invitation refines into refusal that forces a stance. Pressure remains coherent—library rules, the need for invisibility, the ethics of “seizing” stories—and culminates in a meaningful trade‑off (patience over capture). External risk is soft, but the conceptual price gives the ending weight. One tightening beat suffices at this length under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—capture vs. shepherding—tightens at the dream’s emergence and refusal, forcing a trade‑off: pigment (conclusion) versus light (becoming). The freeze‑sun moment is a strong escalation; the dream’s recoil forecloses one path and compels a new tactic. Cost is present but subtle: he sacrifices possession for possibility and yields his arrest of dawn. Tension is lyrical rather than combative, but pressure coheres and grows under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (liberate the trapped idea) is clear, with a meaningful tightening when he forgoes tools to wait for a precise celestial cue. Pressure escalates texturally—fear’s web, star’s map, the breath unlocking, then compassion as the required second move. The price is subtle and largely externalized to the city and the dreamer, not Orin. Still, the cadence shift from hush to citywide resonance reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is early and steady; escalation arrives via failed detection and the rule‑breaking touch with visible risk and a reciprocal price. Pressure coheres internally (protocol vs. need) and culminates in an earned reweighting. Slight softness in external counter‑pressure prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (exile’s reversal vs. harm/authority) tightens with Harl’s audit and crate breach. The protagonist and Rafe adapt under pressure; Rafe’s circle and the archivist’s backward lure manifest agency. Cost is legible: destruction of the warrant, risk to both, and the choice to remain bound by mentorship. Escalation is coherent and culminates cleanly without coincidence solves.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are singular: rekindling communal wonder. Escalation deepens via the realization that “wonder is motion,” forcing a second weave through roots—an adaptive tightening. Cost surfaces as exhaustion and the lifelong commitment to prune fear. Pressure remains gentle; no real chance of failure intrudes, keeping the band below the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure accrues through the growing hush, the spirit’s roaming disruptions, and the taboo method; unraveling knots escalates via released sea‑pockets that antagonize the spirit. The reveal about the actor reweights stakes and narrows options toward reassigning applause. Cost is present but subtle (ritual risk, taboo breach, surrendering applause), keeping the conflict lyrical rather than perilous. Still, the tightening is coherent and protagonist‑driven.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes cohere around completing the map without violating its silence; pressure tightens through the hidden panel and henge discovery to the renunciatory choice. The decisive act is restraint—foregoing playback and resealing the grate—creating a felt conceptual price. Tension is more contemplative than perilous, but it escalates credibly under the chosen lens. One added beat of external risk could have heightened the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—learning how to let go—tightens through the journal’s lament and the wire’s “articulation,” culminating in the decision to measure and then release. The deepening is clear and protagonist‑driven; the cost is the relinquishment of Jonah’s talisman and the embrace of failure as method. External pressure is low‑grade (time, depth) but coherent. The escalation is quiet rather than sharp, yet sufficient for this length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (encode before the gap closes) is legible early and tightens as lightning pulses and thunder approaches. The ghost’s passage through him escalates pressure, deepening intent rather than adding new threads. Cost is quiet but present: he forgoes audience/recognition, and the song’s access is constrained to the perilous interval. One decisive tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—bridge or preserve distance—tightens via the found diary and the imminent arrival clock. The narrator’s agency escalates from restraint to ethically fraught action (reading) to the risky, subtextual quotation. The cost is quiet but legible; what’s missing is a sharper external pinch beyond the clock to push toward a more perilous inflection.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—retain/prove memory of absence—tightens as she engineers an absence, receives proof, then chooses to surrender her survival to preserve it. The ground station adds light pressure but does not resolve anything; escalation is driven by her agency. The price is unmistakable. A slightly stronger external counterforce might have intensified the narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (complete the mural before demolition) is signaled and tightens when the crew arrives, shifting from meditative craft to charged poise. Agency drives the turn—her blindfolded method culminates in an immersive sky that stays the wreckers’ hand. The price is mainly risk and surrender of sight/time; escalation is coherent but gentle, with limited reversal beyond the crew’s hush. Still, one meaningful tightening lands.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—proving a discovery—tightens as observation becomes a navigational commitment when Mirelle asks, “Where… steer?” The decisive choice forecloses safer drift in favor of an uncharted corridor. Pressure is mostly epistemic; the price is risk and exhaustion rather than loss, which keeps the band below top tiers. Still, the escalation from noting to steering is clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (learn the rhythm) tightens at “they wanted assembling, but first they required a heart,” forcing her to confront failure to obtain it. Agency drives escalation: she seeks scraps, apologizes, extracts the pendulum, and assembles the clock; the mirrors’ refracted light powers the heart. The emotional price is legible, and options narrow meaningfully. Tension is quiet but coherent and cumulative.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is coherent and escalates with the fracture spread and the revelation that arches are conduits, raising ethical/causal stakes. The shift from command to promise narrows options and requires a different, riskier intent. Prices are primarily emotional and communal (time, stamina, credibility) rather than a tangible loss, but they register. The protagonist’s agency drives both turns (both bell strikes).

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: modulate the end’s cadence. Escalation tightens via “only eight more revolutions,” the hidden key, and the explicit price of offering her heartbeat. Agency drives the peak turn; mercy is tested against warned consequences and paid for materially. The resolution is earned, with the cost re‑appearing in the slower, “beautifully flawed” heartbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (open a safe path before frost) is signaled early and tightens with the birds’ hostility and the approaching freeze. The decisive turn—model insertion—reconfigures options with a clear on-page result. The pressure arc is steady, though hazards resolve smoothly with little personal loss. The frost deadline and courtyard access requirement sharpen choices.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (atonement/reconnection) tightens as Talitha moves from reflection to material intervention to risking contact. The decisive deepening is the insight from foam leading to the inventive tactic and the dual release (swans and text), which forecloses hiding. Pressure is mostly internal and atmospheric, not antagonistic, so escalation is felt as cadence shift rather than narrowing options. The price is modest but legible: surrender of control and acceptance that intent can’t guarantee outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (find origin) tightens under parole’s clock and the lure of making a mark. The central test—incise vs. abstain—forecloses a path and reweights value (subtraction over addition). Costs register without melodrama (spent inheritance, missed sales, acceptance of guardianship). Pressure is coherent if quiet; a single sharper loss mid‑ascent could further heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake is clear and tightens: smoothing Sel’s remorse without catastrophic spread, then containing the pavilion’s threat. The contagion and ricochet function as earned reversals, forcing a costly trade‑off. Kilor’s sacrifice resolves the external and internal pressures credibly. Stakes remain visceral rather than abstract through concrete sensory beats.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—heal and connect the silo before starlight expires—is clear and tightens when she chooses to cripple the bell to save the elevator. Time pressure escalates, and the borrowed weight forecloses an option. The cadence shift at dawn seals the earned trade (“Unity outweighed precision”). Conflict is gentle but real, fitting the mode.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (use and ethical handling of entangled memories) tightens when the device begins to rewrite her past options, forcing the vow and later acceptance of custodianship. Escalation is more deepening than narrowing, consistent with the lens, but lacks a sharp on‑page price beyond conceptual cost. The amphitheater projection reframes stakes effectively without a concrete antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is clear from the outset and escalates through coherent constraints (time window; cabinet’s last digit demand; sudden gravity return). The “last digit” beat is an earned tightening that forces adaptation and cost. The exit clock narrows options credibly; the risk of entrapment and loss of artifacts adds pressure. Moral calculus is lighter than logistical/ontological pressure, keeping the ceiling just below the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are coherent—make music without violating the valley’s hush—and pressure tightens at the first strum and modulation across cracks. The live clock of the hedgehog’s uncurl introduces a subtle deadline that gates action. Cost remains quiet (self‑restraint, humility), which fits the lens but keeps escalation modest. The earned cadence shift suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.8)
    One dominant stake—redemptive poise vs. old ambition—tightens when the apparition repeats the line that caused his banishment and the stakes react to intention. The meaningful turn is the queen sacrifice, a visible price that forecloses an old path. Pressure remains coherent and grows with the eclipse deepening and the nexus reading intention. Resolution arises from Tomas’s agency rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is clear early: recover the diary intact without violence; escalation deepens from physical rust to an emotional/psychic latch rooted in regret. The added inner price (unresolved quarrel) tightens pressure and forces a different tactic (a forgiving chord rather than further manipulation). Consequence is felt in the renunciation of the parade and the redefinition of his catalog. Slightly low external jeopardy keeps it just short of top band, but the internal cost is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is legible early—pursue serenity without endangering the village—and tightens when the elders require external germination. The principal deepening is Liora’s reframing of the scent from menace to medicine, which shifts communal risk perception. Escalation is gentle and mostly inward; the visible price is modest but real (social scrutiny, potential banishment, delayed goal). The resolution grows from her agency rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is legible early: retrieve resilience or lose the groves. Pressure tightens with the clock and spatial constraints; the assembly of the spear is a decisive deepening. Costs skew toward risk/time rather than sacrifice or loss, but the narrowing of options is clear and earned. The escape beat effectively tests commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (prevent another extraction) is signaled early and tightens with the body, the star‑collapse, and the beacons. The key turn is her decision to scramble winds, forcing a system‑level reversal (thunderclap). Cost reads as danger and the need to alter the environment quickly; the internal trade‑off is muted. Pressure remains coherent and grows to a single decisive intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are signaled early and escalate via density of the hush, the narrowing corridor, and the heart chamber’s “upcoming destiny.” The key tightening is the choice to risk braiding all bells atop the marble under the sculptor’s impending strike. Prices are implied (risk of fracturing memory; generational loss) rather than dramatized as a loss on the page, slightly softening pressure. Still, the cadence shift to the door-statue reads as an earned culmination.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—recovering/rewriting the loss through understanding—tightens when regret threatens to snap the corridor shut. The key turn is agency-driven: he chooses to witness, then modulates the melody to invite his shadow’s surrender. The price (admitting he engineered his own failure) is legible, and the reweave forecloses the path of obsession-as-theft. Pressure escalates coherently without coincidence saving him.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (render the astronomer’s feeling-math before the stars vanish) tightens with the “narrow hour” and the clocks stuttering. The reversal/deepening arrives when Dreya chooses deliberate ambiguity—then risks a second pull and throws it skyward, foreclosing clarity for effect. The cost is her refusal to complete the equation, keeping only feathers. World‑scale consequence is funneled credibly through the intimate act of printing.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake (deliver vs. seed wonder without being claimed by the relic) is clear and tightens with the cairn and Ilya’s note. Escalation is primarily internal and accumulative rather than combative; the price is renunciation of mission/reward. Absence of a direct antagonist keeps pressure quieter but coherent. The single meaningful deepening at the cave is earned and decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—proof through communion—tightens as shame turns to joy and resolves into reconciliation, forcing Ilara to choose duty with acknowledged peril. The meaningful deepening is the realization that absorption entails transfer risk, which reweights her mission. Pressure remains coherent and grows through ritual intensification rather than external threat. The cost is felt, if conceptual, at the decision to take the prism back.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and escalates via one clear tightening: monitored winds force an ingenious, costlier method. The devouring silence and season-per-shuttle aging heighten pressure toward an irreversible price. Resolution stems from her continued weaving despite depredation, not luck. Stakes are intimate but decisive, with material consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (stabilize Valagh/rebuild) escalates through concrete costs: Ellan’s memory trade precedes a communal widening of the price. The meaningful tightening arrives when villagers begin sacrificing memories—stakes deepen from personal to collective. Resolution stems from Ellan’s agency rather than luck. The cost is clear and ongoing.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is focused early and tightens at the sister’s revelation, forcing a trade‑off between truth and protection. Escalation is driven by Kael’s agency—redirecting collapsing paths prefigures the decisive global redirect. The cost is felt: renouncing the quest’s trajectory and assuming guardianship under cyclical compulsion. Pressure is coherent with the causal lens; no extraneous reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—keeping darkness from “slipping into heads” and restoring the light—tightens through the lamp’s failure, the cairn’s “protect,” and the oppressive unlit presence. Escalation is a meaningful deepening: Ellis chooses a ritual reply that risks belief and identity. Cost is quiet but legible (endurance in the haunted dark, surrendering his own hush to serve the chain, staying through dawn). Pressure coheres without over-reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—whether to steer futures and accept the price—is clear and escalates through mechanical engagement (inserting wick, rotation, palms to prism) to world‑level consequence. Pressure coheres via the cost revelation and Mora’s acceptance, foreclosing a more passive witness path. The conflict leans internal and metaphysical over adversarial, but it tightens once meaningfully. Stakes avoid inflation by rooting effect in a constrained method.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (learn and find a safe handling of stories) tightens as the elder warns of crushing gravity and the pigment threatens to “burst into color.” Liora’s decisions create the meaningful turn: offering the wing and performing the sun‑tracked painting that tests the new ethic. The price is mostly conceptual/emotional; minimal jeopardy keeps the escalation from cresting higher. Still, pressure coheres and deepens under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake: reach the trees and release sorrow. The “one brittle chance” clock is a strong tightening, and mapping dreams raises risk by actively deconstructing the labyrinth’s memory system. Resolution stems from Eron’s choices rather than luck, though the trees’ cooperation smooths resistance. The price is more thematic than visceral, keeping the escalation just shy of peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is established early (rekindle the realm) and tightens when the pane confronts her with stratified failures. The pivotal reversal stems from agency: she sacrifices order (logbook) and adds her voice, enabling the window to crack. The price is legible—abandoning her defining method and exiting the known greenhouse. Tension coheres without contrived antagonism.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—remain hidden versus engage—clarifies early and tightens through the ledger’s offer and caveat that wisdom must be shared. The key turn is Lowell’s renunciation of hiding; the price of vulnerability and leaving sanctuary is on the page. Pressure coheres without an antagonist, and internal/external threads interweave. Stakes are personal yet palpable and do not dissipate.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes—seeking sacredness amid erosion and guilt—are clear early and deepen at the pavilion and during his admission of complicity. The turn is the door’s opening and the ritual that reframes his work; pressure escalates through his voiced guilt and Ko’s answer. The visible price is acceptance of quiet, ongoing, recognition‑free labor and the refusal of sterile cataloging as an endpoint. It’s a quiet escalation, but coherent and sufficient for the form.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (preserve truth vs. risk volatile memory and self-implication) is signaled early and tightens decisively when the silhouettes reveal Lyra. The key turn is his choice to measure and record the vow despite the pain, foreclosing denial. The cost (acknowledged omission and guilt) is unmistakable in the inscription beat and the softened yet persistent weight. No false reversals; pressure coheres to the final sealing.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—securing the “sound of trust breaking” before sunrise without triggering violence—tightens when Cinder shatters the hush. Clara’s agency (invoking “Truce,” revealing the insignia) redirects the conflict and forces a trade: social credit for safety. The cost is subtle but present: she curbs confrontation and spends inherited capital. A single meaningful tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake (answers and sanctuary) is legible early and tightens when Zephra proposes addressing the council; the “converge” beat reorients their tactic. Escalation reads through density and display (rain + reason) rather than confrontation, culminating in conditional sanctuary. Prices are modest and mostly conceptual, with no real pushback on the page. The resolution is earned but a little easy for the scale implied.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure coheres around one stake (unlocking creativity) with a meaningful tightening when she renounces memory—foreclosing a previous strategy and accepting loss. The cadence intensifies via the waiting clock, descent, found journal, and the ritual of speaking faces into darkness. The price paid (emptying her mind; staying below) is clear. No antagonist is needed; agency drives the turns.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (reviving the city’s viability by restoring honest speech) is clear and tightens once: discovery → access → seeding. Escalation is protagonist-driven and coherent under the causal lens, but losses are relatively light; danger remains mostly atmospheric and social rather than sharply priced. The public planting forces a stance crystallization citywide. Pressure is steady, not wrenching.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving the color of wonder—arrives early and sharpens with the hairline crack threatening to drop the iceberg. Escalation is coherent under the Hybrid lens: a tangible mechanical failure forces precise, embodied action with the cost of potential total loss. The culminating choice to etch instructions narrows Arlen’s future options (no solitary guardianship) while securing the stake. The piece favors poised tension over hazard spectacle, but the pressure still tightens meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    One dominant stake coheres: protect dome/roses and contain the fears. Pressure tightens meaningfully when the holograms begin to shatter the dome and the protagonist must both miniaturize and ignite the perimeter burn. Visible costs register (risking fire; petals curl; acceptance that fears persist). Escalation is protagonist-driven and never resolves by coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stakes (unlock before bureaucratic cutters; risk of public shame) escalate through witness testimony to a decisive act. The key tightening is Mr. Cardoza’s confession and his choice to unlock before neighbors, paying a visible social/emotional price. Tension threads sentence to sentence without contrivance. Minor softness: no strong counterforce after confession, but cost remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (liberate the archives) is clear and the pressure tightens once meaningfully via defenses stirring and the sabotage‑driven flood clock. Agency drives every advance, and the Vane beat refracts the moral calculus. Costs land (destruction, risk, irrevocable exposure), though turrets and vault recognition yield quickly, softening resistance and trade‑off texture. Still, the escalation remains coherent and culminates in a charged choice set.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is legible early; pressure coheres and deepens as the vision mandates a pre‑dawn exhumation, narrowing options. The tightening beat is the descent under unstable gravity and the moral/physical risk of breaking the coffin. Cost lands emotionally and conceptually, though practical resistance is minimal (no true setback beyond atmosphere), tempering intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is legible early and tightens with the discovery of the “last shard” under the stone, a clear deepening. The pulse of the sky’s temptation introduces a credible brush with failure before his renunciation. While escalation is quiet, the narrowing to one potent vowel creates genuine pressure and cost. Resolution is earned by his agency in extraction and release.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: gaining/building-language and the ethical cost of that pursuit. Tightening arrives when the seal cracks—panic, accusation, and the murder reveal increase pressure, then Selin forces a charged choice. The narrator’s acceptance forecloses the prior arrangement of silence and tutelage. Stakes are felt through loss (teacher dissolves) and obligation.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is clear early (isolation vs independence) and tightens when the hedges seal and the brother’s choice reframes cost. The key deepening—the revelation that he quarantined despair to spare her—forces a trade: archive and abandon or carry and pay. Consequence is felt; the resolution arises from Mara’s agency, not convenience. Pressure is coherent and escalates without requiring an antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (rewrite an edict to pardon Loryn) is clear and tightens through concrete pressures: timed entry, precision writing, the sanctuary’s toll, and the branding threat. The key reversal—unlocking the automaton and converting it to mercy—narrows options and shows agency-driven escalation. Cost is felt but contained; obstacles resolve smoothly without a major setback. Still, the sequence coheres and deepens rather than merely listing steps.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (agency vs. involuntary resonance) is signaled early and tightens as the countdown forces a decision window. Escalation is driven by Silva’s agency: leaving safety, descending, then negotiating instead of submitting. The pact forecloses a path and imposes a clear price that charges the ending. Pressure remains coherent without needing an external antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—liberate the restless presence by telling a difficult truth—is signaled early and tightens through discovery to confrontation to communal act. The meaningful turn is Mara’s public exposure that forecloses the monks’ comfortable veneration, with a visible cost (recoil) and a charged payoff. Pressure coheres and grows under the causal lens without coincidence doing the work. The struggle is more moral/spiritual than contested, keeping the escalation slightly soft.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure escalates quietly from curiosity to collective experiment, with a single decisive deepening when the net translates the moon’s drift into “trembling calligraphy.” Stakes are primarily epistemic and thematic; visible cost is modest (discipline, strain of holding the net), limiting intensity. The resolution is earned by Hai‑rin’s initiative rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—expose truth vs. protect a fragile sanctuary—is signaled early and tightened by the discovery. The letters and diamond escalate pressure by narrowing options; the decision to keep the secret exacts a moral/identity cost. No antagonist is needed; the storm and potential scavengers supply ambient threat. The resolution is driven by her agency, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—birthing a unifying dawn—tightens via the arrival of Elara, the first broadcast’s societal effect, and the culminating storm that threatens to tear the tower away. Agency drives escalations: Orrin’s signal, Elara’s decision to sing despite not wanting to lead, their joint training, and facing the final storm. Costs are present but felt more conceptually than viscerally; still, the final stance crystallizes under pressure. The cadence shift at the end is clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—bridging generations—tightens with the arrival of the grieving family and culminates in the renunciation of the music box. Escalation is quiet but present: from solitary craft to public test to letting the artifact go. The cost is felt, though internal conflict is not sharply contested on the page. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is explicit from the start and tightens when the cutter arrives, forcing activation via the key. The reversal—raiders hitting an “invisible wall” and being turned by amplified greed—earns the outcome from prior setup. Cost is legible (Callix’s collapse; moral pain reflected back on the raiders). Slight softness: protagonists encounter limited counter‑pressure once the barricade initiates.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (kindling a “patient revolution”) tightens through the traversal choices and precise alignment, culminating in the controlled blaze. The felt price is internal—abandoning the drumbeat of haste—more than physical risk, keeping pressure quiet but cohesive. The meaningful turn is the hum modulating into a cadence that alters social options. A touch more material jeopardy or a sacrificed option on the page could heighten cost.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes (preventable deaths vs. institutional cover‑up) are signaled early and escalate through one meaningful tightening: aid the trapped worker and risk deeper pursuit to secure proof. Agency drives the critical turns; the surge/water loss of the lantern exacts price and alters tactics. Resolution is earned via exposure rather than convenient accident. The cost is more conceptual/emotional than bodily but registers.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restore and deliver a penitential melody with integrity—tightens through the risk of ruining Ellis’s etchings and the moral escalation to “action beyond music.” The meaningful turn is Maeve’s counsel that reframes success criteria, narrowing easy closure. The cost is the burden shifted onto Ellis and the chaplain, with Maeve accepting uncertainty. Stakes remain intimate but clear and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (ring the unheard bell) is clear from the outset. Escalation tightens via the algorithm’s prescription, the metallurgy gauntlet, and the arrow’s release; pressure is coherent though largely procedural. Cost is present but modestly felt; the risk of acid and history of losses carry the weight more than on‑page jeopardy. Resolution proceeds from Liora’s agency rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.0)
    One dominant stake escalates coherently: recover the missing at the price of policy, system stability, and personal risk. Key tightening beats—corporate warning and system buckling—foreclose safer paths and force Lyra’s public broadcast. Cost is legible (legal consequences, collapsing indices, unleashed suppressed content). The protagonist’s agency drives each turn.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure coheres and deepens (mystery figure, disappearance, unstable shed, hidden tunnels), culminating in the deliberate act of combining shards. Stakes (storm season, structural danger, isolated towns) are named and partly tested. The resolution is relatively easy—little is sacrificed beyond risk-taking—so the tightening lacks a hard trade-off. Still, agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether to proceed toward euthanasia—tightens via the enforced wait, the blizzard confinement, and the external chorus of ice aligning with her interior quest. The decisive deepening is her recognizing the marina’s “plural accents” and choosing delay, which forecloses a path for now with felt cost. Pressure is coherent and grows without needing an antagonist. A hair more on‑page jeopardy could have sharpened the squeeze further.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (meaning vs. money) is signaled and tightened via the sentinel’s test (name three mismatches) and the storm’s approach, leading to the apprenticeship choice. Escalation is primarily tonal/density‑based but coherent: silence → parable → test → offer → acceptance. The visible cost is more conceptual than visceral; the storm’s threat remains anticipatory rather than stress‑testing the decision on the page. Still, the narrowing of options (no bus, night, storm) credibly pressures the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear: safeguard the echo without leakage. Escalation is a soft but meaningful tightening—she must build stillness, then risk unsealing, then commit the echo to her body. The cost is internal and vocational, not combative; no antagonist, but pressure coheres under the chosen lens. A single deepening turn (consecration compressing history into her chest) narrows options credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes—communal ache vs. a viable practice of healing—are evident early and deepen as townsfolk engage, rearrange, and sing. Pressure escalates texturally rather than through direct opposition; “hands shook at first” is the only resistance. The decisive narrowing is the group’s consent to a shared mural, which forecloses solitary grief. Lack of sharper friction keeps the tension moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres: the needed hush tightens, snaps with the tribunal’s entry, and Orrin must answer under their demand to testify. He escalates by refusing prose and using the crystal, converting skepticism into unsettled recognition. Stakes remain largely conceptual/social, so the price feels more like poised risk than immediate harm. Still, the single tightening is meaningful and reweights options credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres: desire to record → ritual spiral-melody → prophet’s stumble breaks the music → recording yields only wind → choice to abandon tape logic and follow echoes. The price is explicit (lost recording, deeper, looping disorientation). Escalation is quiet but decisive under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and pressure coheres, with one meaningful tightening at the unscrewing/capture beat that could have gone catastrophic. Escalation is primarily textural (velocity rising, hum trembling) rather than confrontational; Eloi’s tactic shift to persuasion is elegant but low‑friction. The cost remains conceptual rather than felt as a loss or trade‑off. Effective, but not bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (a flawless goodbye via reunification) is signaled early and tightens once hours are confirmed. Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency: composing, testing with Hector, then risking entry to Mateo’s room, each step narrowing options under the ticking clock. The price—exposure of grief and the last chance to repair—reads on the page in Mateo’s breakdown and Hector’s spent vitality. The quiet form maintains pressure without deflation.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure coheres around whether to exploit the awakening or honor the shadows’ refuge; the tightening arrives with Vela’s blood demand and the corridor’s threat of exile. Orin’s counter‑move creates new complications (temporal wind, risk) that force an ethical trade‑off and a joint act. Stakes and cost are legible and scale appropriately to length. Resolution depends on protagonist agency rather than luck.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (restore the child/correct the lie) is legible early and tightens when the tooth only partially works, forcing a deeper descent and tactic change. Agency drives the turn: they choose to test, to descend, to free the heart, to risk being called liars. The visible price is moderate (fear, honey-spill, relinquishing certainty) but sufficient at this length. The escalation reads as because/therefore rather than and-then.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure is quiet but coherent: inability to see stars forces reliance on memory; the polishing ritual intensifies until the tear catalyzes the pearl. The decisive tightening is the emergence of stillness and the subsequent renunciation, which forecloses keeping it. Stakes remain internal/ethical rather than perilous, but the cost is legible and tied to her vow. No coincidence resolves the arc; agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes cohere around sanctuary vs. exposure and transforming harm into quiet repair. The pressure tightens when Rowan arrives and the plan to face cameras via proof-of-healing crystallizes. Costs are emotional and reputational more than physical; the escalation is intentionally gentle but cumulative. Agency (work instead of words; gifting the pendant) earns the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes (find a hope‑grounded ending) tighten from inert pen to cameo trials to the mirror’s direct question. The decisive escalation is his self‑posed cost: risk self‑belief against despair. Resolution arises from his choice, not coincidence; the light/ink surge is earned by stated commitment. The price is internal but legible and alters his subsequent action (he writes).

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes—reviving the Arbor Heart—are singular and legible, with escalation via density and cadence: speech to song to communal resonance. The main tightening arrives at the shift to song and the grove’s hum. Pressure is coherent but gentle, with little overt resistance or cost beyond risk of failure and long neglect acknowledged.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes focus on completing and sealing the map without disturbance; the tightening is tangible when he must not blink and times motions to heartbeats. The decisive sealing with the sickle narrows options and risks losing the geometry if mishandled. Cost is felt in spent starlight and endurance of stillness. Pressure remains coherent and deepens, though it’s intentionally quiet rather than combative.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (restore wonder/sound) is clear, and pressure escalates via the dawn/noon/dusk studies that tighten approach. The visible price is time and painstaking calibration, with a meaningful turn when the mechanism “ticks once” and the cavern answers. Stakes skew contemplative rather than jeopardy-driven, but under the accumulative lens, the deepening is sufficient and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—collecting and balancing burdens without being subsumed—tightens when the “darker seam” reveals her unmeasured cost. The reversal (“turned the burner upside down”) and the subsequent self-aimed light narrow options and force a trade-off. Price is felt in the threat of paralysis and the admission of emptiness. Escalation is clean and protagonist-driven under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure coheres around whether grief can be contained enough to live alongside it; it tightens when the husband dissolves and Mara must face the lion alone. She chooses to channel the roar into the wood, then accepts the cost of never finishing. The escalation is internal but punctuated by the supernatural confrontation, which credibly raises the stakes. It’s quiet but decisive, with no convenient rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is legible from the outset, with escalation via the lagoon’s acceleration and the ghost’s demand to “fill this.” The meaningful tightening comes when he must choose what to give, risking contaminating the cavity, under a live temporal threat (“before chronology tears completely”). The resolution proceeds from his agency, not luck. Cost is felt in relinquishing stolen voices to alter his mode of moving through time.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (reviving the atrium/building’s spirit) tightens when the clogged runoff threatens waste into salt flats, prompting the reroute. Escalation is quiet but coherent: shutting gates, cutting into corroded junctions, and committing to a new pathway with limited resources and light. The price is effort, risk, and relinquishing triumph for stewardship; still, jeopardy remains low, keeping pressure strong rather than fierce. The sextant‑guided orientation provides a meaningful late deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is narrow and clear, and the pressure coheres: listening, aligning, waiting, then refusing assembly in favor of silence. The deepening arrives with the reframed measure (intervals between feelings), which forces a tradeoff—abandon the perfect chronometer or remain stuck. The cost is felt through renunciation and the ledger of blank pages. It’s an internal conflict, but the physicalized click and condensation give it teeth.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    Pressure coheres and tightens: the salvage and discovery deepen stakes; the footsteps/charity man compress options, testing the narrator’s cover and resolve. The meaningful trade‑off—exposure vs. withdrawal—is confronted in scene via the copying and lie about weather data. Cost reads as social peril and loss of anonymity rather than immediate harm. One strong tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.3)
    The pressure is quiet but coherent: the decoding choice narrows options and the lightning discovery deepens stakes into stewardship. The visible price is patience and deferred action, scaled to length. Escalation is more deepening than reversal, limiting peak intensity but remaining earned.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes concentrate on preserving Selene’s self in memory before winter severs access; the handoff of the thread is the central tightening. Pressure escalates through time (midnight, frost) and the demand to “pull this through every line,” which forecloses distance between subject and writer. The conflict remains interior and relational, not combative, but the price of complicity and responsibility is clear. A sharper on‑page risk would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (reawaken beauty vs. mechanical order) tightens as the hatchling’s birth stalls turbines and threatens collapse, forcing a high‑cost decision. The meaningful turn is the choice to descend and “plant these gears in soil,” foreclosing the floating refuge. Pressure remains coherent and grows; solutions generate complications (new life destabilizes infrastructure). The cost is legible and ongoing, not tidily resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake: claiming an inheritance without replicating harm. It tightens when the pilgrim offers the coin and Maia exposes the scar, culminating in the deliberate vow and release. The price—relinquishing self-punishment while accepting lineage—is legible. It’s quiet escalation, but unmistakable and protagonist-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is early and coherent: liberate the memories before winter shuts the city. Escalation tightens via the rust‑soldered box and dry mains, forcing an inventive, character‑driven tactic (bell to lift geese and coax rain). The narrowing of options is legible; coincidence assists nothing crucial. The visible price is moderate (time pressure and effort more than loss), slightly tempering peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—tune the Line without enshrining harm—tightens when she realizes serenity can imprison, forcing a trade‑off. The reversal (misaligning the gear) narrows options and risks unintended consequences, and the chorus’s hesitation reads as a live cost. Pressure remains internal and conceptual, not adversarial, but it coheres and deepens under the chosen lens. The ending preserves risk (“change can bruise”), keeping consequences live.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around the stake of capturing collective grief; escalation is a density increase (stations, knots, voices into a chord) culminating in the design insight “porous.” The migration clock and Mira’s prompts tighten options; he trades time and anonymity to deliver a public monument. The main limitation is the lack of sharp opposition; tension is steady and inward rather than combative, but it still deepens credibly under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    One dominant stake—restoring shared balance—tightens as tide rises and the last inscription demands a choice. The key deepening is the painful confession to Clara’s truth; it forecloses a path (perpetual protective lie) and exacts moral cost. Pressure escalates coherently in the accumulative mode via pattern intensification and a deadline (stilled weights). Resolution arises from Elias’s agency, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—answering the echoes by finishing the map—tightens once through the decode sequence and dawn’s approach. The meaningful turn is Milo choosing to work the tapestry and then to dig, which narrows options toward an ethical delivery of regret. Pressure remains coherent but gentle; consequences are felt more as relief than loss. Still, agency, escalation, and payoff align.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is set early and deepens when the data chain forecasts unrest. The decisive tightening is the 30‑word constraint and the poised pen, forcing a trade‑off between control and flexibility. The external validation (caravan) arrives promptly, maintaining pressure. The legible price is mainly the acceptance of new ignorance rather than a concrete loss.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (smuggling story back into life under surveillance) is clear early and deepens as the signal falters. The key tightening comes when “the regime’s hounds of silence” force Mila to choose a new tactic, foreclosing the romantic central transmitter in favor of distributed life-noise. Prices include dispersion (loss of singularity) and exposure risk; escalation is coherent without manufactured reversals. A touch more tactile danger in the cloak moment could heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is tight and signaled early; escalation arrives in the hesitation and the near‑wearing of the mask followed by the renunciation to hang it. The mentor’s warning reframes risk, deepening pressure from art’s “mirage of safety.” The price—risk of re‑stitched grief and the relinquishment of self‑exposure—lands cleanly. Quiet, but the single decisive tightening is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (evidence vs myth) is established early and tightens via Mara’s counterclaim and the decision to test sedimentary proof. The descent is an escalation that risks safety and worldview; the price lands in Corvin’s tempered admission and shared custodianship. Stakes skew conceptual over visceral, but the scene still narrows options credibly. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; their agency does.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are focused—can song rehumanize a divided city—and escalation is clear: assemble exiles, teach via subtraction, sustain night practices, then face the council. The key tightening is the council’s arrival and the risk of suppression, met by a non‑argument chord. Resolution leans toward the lyrical and frictionless, slightly softening the felt price. Still, the method itself is a tested stance under pressure, not a deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—salvaging communal hope via a banquet—is clear and coheres under the ticking alignment. Escalation arrives through intensified pruning choices and the timed germination; the key tightening is her choice to share the fruit and “prune pain” for communal resilience. The price is primarily conceptual/emotional; a single beat of in‑scene temptation might have sharpened cost further. Nonetheless, agency drives the outcome rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear early (restore power by waking the swarm) with one effective tightening when alarms force the spoken reveal. Pressure coheres under the causal lens; the reveal is a meaningful hurdle tied to theme. Escalation is elegant but gentle; the puzzle resolves without a hard trade‑off beyond ritual compliance. Still, the narrowing of options is unmistakable at the intercom ultimatum.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure accrues via pattern intensification: initial non‑response to displacement, then the spoken sanctification triggers exhalation, scent, object animation, and the wishbone’s arrival. The meaningful tightening is the move from listening house to communicative house, which reweights the stake from diagnosis to translation. The price is primarily conceptual and risk‑of‑awakening, not visceral, keeping the tension refined rather than gripping. Still, agency drives the turn rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—can revelation be kind without annihilating self/others—tightens when Aios discovers the kneeling statues and the foxglove’s prior harm. That history forecloses the reckless option and forces the precise leak tactic. The risk of poison and potential self‑erasure adds felt pressure to the opening. Resolution stems from his chosen method, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—looping back vs accepting stillness—is signaled early and tightens via the compromise roll that reveals texture instead of reversal. The zero/one result deepens pressure, converting abstraction into felt memory, which forces the renunciation. The price (abandoning the perpetual pursuit and erasing work) is shown. Escalation is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—can he rouse kindness against urban fatigue—tightens when the brush reveals a rousing script and the city’s micro-turns register. The finite resource (brush dimming) provides a real constraint and price, prompting his stop and the pinned page. Escalation is textural rather than adversarial but coheres under the chosen lens. A clear narrowing of options occurs without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (preserving arts/morale) escalates as Iclea chooses to expose the lens and ignite collective action, narrowing the “caution” path. Meris’s scarcity objection introduces a material constraint; Iclea’s generosity counter is a deliberate trade‑off. Pressure builds steadily rather than via sharp reversals, appropriate to the chosen lens. The cost is gentler, but the risk/discipline around the lens and resources is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (agency versus fate) is signaled early and tightens through concrete turns: alignment work, the opened panel, and the engineered negotiation with the stone. The price is legible—the yoyo’s dissolution, lost grand futures, and the loneliness baked into liberty. Pressure is largely internal but coherent and escalating under the hybrid lens. A touch more resistance or risk at the resonance moment could further heighten cost.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure escalates coherently: each note triggers deeper commitment, culminating in a risky negotiation where the breastplate’s light hits fear’s masks. The narrowing choice—exchange glow for the name—forces a trade with visible cost. Stakes are focused (trap fear) and paced through meaningful turns (mirror confession, predictive photos, coffin reveal). A slight remove from personal jeopardy for the narrator keeps it just short of maximal intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (escape and survive to continue voyaging) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the storm “bootlegs” in. Escalation is protagonist-driven: she shifts tactics via fractal spirals, dub, and orchestrated swaying, with visible stress (cracks, loosened links). Prices are present but mostly aesthetic rather than grievous, slightly muting the peak. Resolution feels earned, not convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (to reach/understand the watchers and the lost) tightens via the note’s activation and the “neither alive nor dead” reframing. The relinquishing of the sextant and the unarmed approach are credible trade‑offs under pressure. The decisive beam‑triggered revelation escalates with a price implied for the chosen path. Tension remains lyrical rather than harried, but the deepening is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is legible early and tightens meaningfully with the caretaker’s arrival. The persuasive pivot (wolf/sheep parable) is a credible turn that narrows options and forces an ethical trade‑off. Consequences (sirens, illegality, betrayal of a promise) are felt. Slightly neat resolution, but agency drives the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving and witnessing before the tide—tightens via the lockbox discovery and the drawbridge’s descent. Escalation is primarily temporal and textural rather than adversarial, but the hinge’s refusal and the live clock demand adaptive tactics. The price paid is time/risk and relinquishing the artifacts to the sea, which the ending honors. Slight softness remains in the paucity of external resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (truth vs forgery under lethal conditions) escalates coherently, with one strong tightening: lifting the codex triggers the flood that forces her verdict. Agency defines the resolution; she stamps under duress rather than defer. The sealed passage and permanent loss of access register as price. Stakes stay focused; no extraneous reversals dilute the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transform grief into surrogate shadows—tightens through concrete risk: the searing spindle, the acolyte’s shatter warning, and the choice to crack the lantern over the kettle. Escalation is protagonist‑driven and culminates in a release that cannot be undone, foreclosing safer containment. Internal and external conflicts interweave: love for Jorin vs. civic risk, craft mastery vs. ethical danger. The price is borne publicly and privately, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake is clear early (locate and prevent catastrophic potential flip) with a decisive tightening at the node. The moral calculus—save a continent by surrendering the last tangible tie to his bride—clarifies cost and tests commitment. Pressure escalates coherently via readings, pings, and the impending “flip” deadline. Resolution hinges on Ashraf’s agency, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—decode “belonging”—is clear and tightens as the telescope aligns, the map collapses to absence, and the power drains. The decisive deepening occurs when the coordinates voice their names and they must speak them, risking contact with the unknown; sending the drone into the light is a committed action. Cost is present though quiet: drained power, surrender to an emptiness that calls “home,” and a reconfiguration of Nero’s solitude. Pressure grows coherently under the hybrid/accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (face the withheld truth) tightens through one meaningful deepening: the ledger reframes his life and narrows options to confession or further erasure. He makes agency decisions that carry price (entering the cave, speaking the brother’s name, renouncing his trade). Pressure coheres—internal and external motifs interlock—and the cost isn’t waved away. Slight reliance on discovered magic is tempered by his choices driving the end state.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres around conducting a humane exchange under ritual and neutrality constraints; the meaningful tightening is Mara’s choice to untether Ilren before the handoff. Stakes are ethical and relational rather than survivalist, but the risk and symbolic cost are legible. The cadence shift at “We are synchronized” and the pendant choice deepen rather than reverse. Escalation is quiet but earned under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reach Marina to test redemption—is active from launch, and pressure coheres around the storm and guilt. The pivotal tightening occurs when lightning stitches the very line he follows, forcing a recommitment under risk. Gideon’s agency drives the resolution; luck complicates (storm) but does not solve. Cost is legible in the risked crossing and the relinquishment of self‑punishment in favor of accountable forward motion.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully at the lake when visions force a trade‑off among identity paths. The protagonist’s agency drives the critical turn (choosing the third path and drinking), and the moral calculus is legible. Price is emotional and prospective rather than immediate pain, reading slightly light for maximum pressure. Still, the narrowing of options and foreclosed futures is clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake (bring Aric back) tightens when Liora’s own metamorph accelerates—success threatens identity. The urn cracking escalates to a hard trade: finish losing herself or split the power with partial costs; she chooses the latter. Consequences are lasting and dramatized (half-beast bodies, vow of stewardship). Pressure remains coherent and grows without coincidence solving the problem.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are focused—find and free the father’s lost minutes—and the pressure tightens when the hourglass demands she pour her own measured days. The visible price (memories relinquished) narrows options and drives the turn. Internal and external conflicts interweave without bloat. Only minor note: the path from barter to solution unfolds smoothly, with little complication beyond the central trade.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—opening the nonviolent dimension—tightens when the gate shivers “unwilling,” forcing the costlier choice of self‑forgiveness. The decision not to hoard liberation further clarifies values under pressure. The escalation is coherent under the accumulative lens and culminates in a decisive turn. Stakes stay intimate yet consequential without inflationary rhetoric.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure deepens via the volcano’s anticipation and Ione’s caution, forcing Gideon’s stance (“No… it is guiding us toward a safer detour”). The decisive act—freeing the last jar—carries a visible price and reweights the stake. Escalation is gentle but coherent for the chosen lens, with one meaningful tightening. The conflict remains intimate and credible rather than maximalist.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is legible early (free everyone by opening locks) and pressure coheres under a causal lens. The key tightening arrives when the blackout renders the locks “asleep,” forcing Serah’s geometric solution. Agency drives the turn and outcome; the price (spent sparks, heightened exposure) is present but underplayed on the page. Tension remains steady rather than jagged, which fits the “silent revolution” brief but slightly softens peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (translate storm-logic to restore balance) is signaled early, with a meaningful tightening when the dust outlines one precise missing number. The choice to place the final glyph-stone and accept the eels’ offer functions as the climactic act. The hinted catastrophic alternative (“future … snarling”) sharpens stakes, though the resolution arrives smoothly with limited visible loss. Pressure coheres and deepens appropriately for this length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—speaking unmuted truth—tightens via the timer’s ritual and the envelope’s unsettling mirror of his unpublished words. The discovery deepens risk and compels the choice to carry and to write regardless of censors. The cost is more conceptual than visceral on the page but present (choosing exposure over safety). Escalation is coherent under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—earning direction by fencing philosophies—tightens through the Questioning Thrust, Diplomat’s Feint, and the light-strike that transforms possibility into map. The culminating choice to share the overture forecloses solitary victory and reweights the conflict. Pressure is coherent and growing, though the consequences of failure remain mostly conceptual. A sharper on-page price mid-duel would strengthen escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—build a refuge of language under hostile oversight—is established early and tightens with sirens, rooftop broadcast, and the influx of banned texts. The choice to go public (“Bring your broken stories”) forecloses safety, an effective escalation under the lyric lens. Consequence is signaled but not cashed on-page, keeping cost slightly abstract. Nevertheless, pressure coheres and increases toward the charged dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres around defying timetables and fate; escalation proceeds via density and pattern shifts (underground exploration, arbor mastery, public coda). The main tightening is the decision to bring the arbor’s charge to the platform, foreclosing adherence to schedules. Opposition is mostly atmospheric; the lack of a concrete antagonist keeps the price slightly abstract, though trains delaying and public expectation provide credible stakes. The final held suspension functions as a high‑cost poise rather than a decisive reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (prove and protect collective memory before monsoon) is announced early and tightened through escalating proofs that feel increasingly costly to doubt. The decisive deepening—listening “without ears” to let the island choose—reconfigures options, then the eastbound petal‑boat forces a commitment to sail. The price (risk, departure, surrender of verification control) is clear without overstatement. A single antagonist is absent, but pressure coheres from clock and calling.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—finding the color and enduring its consequence—is signaled early and tightens through ritual thresholds (surface → stair → cavern → diffusion). Pressure deepens rather than reverses; the cost arrives when memories re‑enter with altered valence, foreclosing denial. Agency is quiet but present: Yun’s cuts, Mara’s tracing, Callix’s alignment each narrow options and commit them. Stakes remain intimate yet felt, scaled well to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.2)
    The central conflict between Mara’s observational patience and Jonah’s procedural urgency is clear, sustained, and compelling. The stake—whether to raze the greenhouse or attempt a slow restoration—is established early and tested throughout. The pressure deepens not through a sudden reversal, but through Mara's demonstration with the dust trail, an escalation perfectly suited to the story's accumulative lens. The cost of her victory is the forfeiture of an easy, official solution for a difficult, uncertain one.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake—survival—and masterfully deepens it into a stake of justice once the ledger is deciphered. The pressure escalates perfectly under a causal lens, moving from the quiet threat of the past to the immediate, active threat of the hunters. Yara's agency drives every key turn, and the final escape feels earned, with the cost—continued danger and "uncertain justice"—legibly carried forward into the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story masterfully escalates stakes from an internal, abstract goal to an immediate physical threat. The dominant stake—rectifying silence—is signaled early and tested. The critical tightening occurs when the protagonist’s success cracks the frozen ocean, transforming their tool of creation into a potential weapon of destruction. This forces a high-agency choice with an unmistakable on-page cost, earning the resolution completely.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story establishes a unique stake—the accumulated grief of the ignored dead—and escalates it effectively from a faint clicking to a cosmic duty. Protagonist agency is central to the resolution; Elias makes a series of active choices, culminating in the ultimate choice to stay. The cost of his action is absolute and rendered with poetic finality, giving the resolution immense weight.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story masterfully handles its central stake—communal survival under sanctions—by deepening it through a single, potent moral choice. Rhessa's decision to give away the last basket creates an immediate, tangible cost (a three-unit deficit), which tests the group's principles against its pragmatic plan. The resolution doesn't erase this pressure but transforms it, proving the stakes were not just about survival, but about fostering a self-sustaining cycle of grace.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.3)
    The dominant stake—healing an "ache of absence"—is established immediately and tested through a significant internal deepening. The escalation is driven entirely by Lysander's agency as he endures the painful visions and manipulates his own perception through breath. The cost of confronting his regrets is made explicit ("The vision hurt"), and the final resolution is undeniably earned through his ordeal.

    Dominant stake—preserve the fragile dawn-symphony—escalates through density and cadence shift rather than causal reversals. One meaningful tightening: the moment he “dared not linger” forecloses lingering and forces retreat. Cost is visible in the “final echoes thinning.”

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—defeat emotional numbness—is signaled early and tightened through each backward note that “bled warmth into stone walls.” The meaningful turn occurs when Maris chooses to share the silence rather than perfect technique; the cost is the surrender of private mastery. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens: density of vibration, memory, and communal resonance. No coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—preserve data integrity while preventing engineered catastrophe—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened when Hilara must choose between city clearance and exile. Agency is decision, not luck; the cost (permanent exile) is legible in the final image. One meaningful escalation suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: will Lysander confront or avoid the scent-triggered grief? Pressure tightens as the fern’s veins clear and vapor rises; agency is the deliberate inhalation and later the unstopping of the vial. Cost is felt in the tearful memory and the irreversible shift in how lanterns will be forged. No external antagonist needed; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve both hope and wisdom—is signaled early and tightened when the rope warns “witness carries cost.” The final drumming interlaces the two futures, foreclosing the either/or path with visible fraying of the rope and stolen hour. Escalation is one continuous deepening under the Accumulative lens; no false reversals. Cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—retrieve hidden music from silence—tightens when each acoustic test reveals the sapling’s imprisonment. Agency is continuous: whispering story, slicing net, retuning strings; each act narrows options and raises physical cost (ruined strings, rising tide). No external coincidence resolves; the final note is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.5)
    Single dominant stake: the client must absorb empathy without personal rupture. Pressure intensifies once, during the vapour change from violet to gold, forcing her to choose the decisive moment to inhale. Cost is concrete: memory fog, felt patience residue. No coincidence or external rescue appears.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—uplift silent contributors—signaled early. Pressure tightens when Jonas decides to search; cost escalates with public pledge of shipping fee. Coincidence (misaddress) complicates but does not resolve; final narrowing of options (maritime rehearsal hall) is communal, not individual.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—loneliness versus communal graft—is signaled in paragraph three and tightened when Alyss ties her final knot, foreclosing solitary artistry. Pressure escalates via accumulative imagery: rumor → sight → inscription → apparitions. The cost is the irreversible fusion of self into orchard memory. No external antagonist is needed; the conflict is internal and existential, resolved through stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—liberate the ur-echo vs preserve urban sonic commerce—is established early and tightened stroke by stroke: each borrowed second increases city-wide jeopardy until the cadence’s hiccup erupts. Escalation is accumulative/tactile under the chosen lens: more silence equals more rent to pay. Agency culminates in a decisive irreversible act with palpable toll expressed by cracked stylus and collapsed corridor.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—render ambiguous loss calculable—is signaled early and tightened once: the mosaic cipher forces a shift from seeking resolution to embracing rhythm. The cost is the acceptance of perpetual ache, visible in the orchard’s re-tuned irrigation. Agency drives the escalation; coincidence never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.3)
    Dominant stake—remaining unseen yet helpful—spikes once when the student sees the flicker-silhouette; cost is emotional (permanent partial exposure) but physical stakes never escalate beyond a charged phone screen; tightening is singular yet meaningful.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (belong to the linden collective vs retain human identity) intensifies through each vegetative invasion—new buds, footsteps sprouting clover. Final moment crystallizes cost: seed bobbing signals irreversible path chosen. Pressure coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“thresh meaning”—is tested by the island’s demand for memory-exchange. Pressure escalates through the brooch’s glow, chapel tremor, and final covenant; each step narrows options. Cost is visible: insomnia becomes covenant, archives become gardens. No coincidence resolves; agency drives the spiral inscription.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: who may carry wonder out. Pressure tightens when reflections attempt to inhabit flesh; the card compass reorients Mara from pearl to person. Cost is visible—Arden’s soaked sleeves, Mara’s shaken cards, the pearl’s dimmed glow. Agency drives the climax; coincidence only complicates. One escalation beat suffices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—restoring communal memory—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each recalled fragment tightens the lattice until the council’s vote forecloses exile’s silence. Cost is collective and conceptual rather than personal; a visible price (lost hours) is named but not dramatized for Karima. Agency is diffuse, slightly capping the score.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—finding the fortress—tightens when Elara must trade a feared truth for an answer. The cost is legible on the page (her brittle laugh), though the escalation is more atmospheric than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether to trust the tile and transcribe—tightens once when moonlight unlocks memories. Agency: she chooses transcription despite skepticism, paying with personal memories entangled and the journal left behind. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens via density of images and whale harmony. Cost is visible in the tile’s cooling and her tears.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will Callix glimpse what waits beyond goodbye?—tightens when spatial mutiny threatens to fold him unfinished. The asymmetry of the second coil escalates stakes under the Accumulative lens. Cost is visceral: shard stored in bone, farewells glimpsed but unreachable. One clear deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—“preserve two integrities”—tightens through each causal beat: forged confession → glass shard → body-bag escape. The visible price (Corvus’s death, Mara’s exile) is unmistakable on the page, and the final image crystallizes the trade-off under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—archiving tomorrow’s avalanche—tightens when Calix chooses to speak the fatal year, trading personal solvency for communal memory. The deepening is a single, decisive intensification: grief refracted into “frostbitten blues.” Cost is visible in the split trunks and his stagger; no reversal, only irrevocable witness.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving erased histories—tightens as each fragment risks exposure. Escalation is textural: density of overheard voices and the poison label’s return reweight the cost. Agency is present in the slip-under-door act. One tightening suffices; no reversals required.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—decode the universal riddle—tightens through each resonant beat: cello hum summons logbook letters, shell vibration forces confession, telescope demands self-interrogation. Agency remains Maren’s; each escalation is triggered by her decision to retell or listen. Cost is the snapped string and the irreversible loss of any fixed direction.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single dominant stake—stop privatization—escalates through each graffiti layer and drumbeat until the vote is postponed. Agency remains Mira’s: her choice to orchestrate the parade heist narrows options and exacts social risk. Cost is visible in nightly affidavits and clown-drone surveillance.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake announced early—“last ice plume freezing upward”—and the conflict escalates as sunrise and drones close, narrowing options. One middle turn: the vial cracks under the mountain’s seismic pulse, tightening Halina’s task to capturing the final phases before the engineered end. Cost is visible when ordinary steam replaces the plume and she walks downslope “carrying within her the silence” already lost forever.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restore drone before anchor lifts—tightens via ticking clock. One deepening: gyro imbalance forces tungsten micro-choice. Cost is visible in Vale’s departure and synchronized whistles, but external pressure outweighs internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—map the river’s origin—tightens when vapor pattern forecloses all but one route beneath the ice. Escalation is causal: each beat (falcon cry → buoy rocking → ice crack) narrows options. Cost is visible: Morrow’s pen fails, memory must carry the burden. No coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore shared balance—tightens via the walking cadence; each loop raises the cost of abandonment. The fork’s first audible hum marks the decisive intensification under Accumulative lens. Cost is felt when Lira realizes residents remember no collapse, locking her into perpetual map-making.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—save scholar vs. preserve vial—tightens once when Mara chooses to unsnarl lasers instead of abort. Escalation is causal: each override of instinct narrows options until the sunset’s inhalation buys minutes but steals memory. Cost is visible in the scholar’s cracked lungs and Mara’s sunset shard.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: redeem father’s name and avert warden’s bloodbath. Each beat escalates via lattice use narrowing options; final act crystallises earned static with felt cost when Silas hands over the lattice. Pressure tightens once.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—grow the apple of return—tightens once when the bead is set and the fruit swells. Agency is Elias’s: he prunes, cradles, carries, and finally releases. The price is the irreversible loss of Seraphine’s warm hand; escalation is coherent under the Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“carve a path from ruin to reverence”—signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when Wren bleeds onto the loom. One meaningful deepening: discarded precedents become raw material, foreclosing retreat. Cost visible in blood and irrevocable corridor. Agency drives escalation; labyrinth’s shift is response to her intention, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restoring interrupted faith—is signaled early and tightened when the groove of the unfinished return path mirrors the hollow in the chest. Escalation is causal: each discovery (crack, stairwell, etchings) raises the cost of leaving until the peg’s insertion forecloses departure. Price is felt in the sprouting seed of trust that forgives burial.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: will Mirielle keep collecting fragments or risk authorship? Tightening occurs when Palimpsest hands her the chalk—tool converts observation into potential publication, narrowing safe distance. Cost is loss of anonymity, shown in her public sketch at close. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; no off-stage resolution. Could use one more intermediate beat where she hesitates/erases to push tension past 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve forbidden knowledge before the coup—is signaled early and tightens when the candle reveals the palace’s two-hour vulnerability. One meaningful turn: Selis shifts from passive chart-maker to active conspirator. Cost is visible—loss of daybook, exile from sanctuary. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (Voren’s arrival) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will she voice the apology or let silence fester—is signaled early and tightened once when the shard overflows and the spirits replay the balcony memory. Agency drives the escalation; the cost is the reopened chest wound and the irrevocable sending of the final letter. No external coincidence resolves the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake = salvage human meaning amidst ruin; each textual smear tightens responsibility until Regrow acrostic turns raw canvas into public vow. Shellfire rumble pays visible cost that locks protagonist into role of carrier rather than mediator.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.9)
    A single, coherent escalation: Lina’s trade-off—risking heartbreak in exchange for reviving communal joy—progressively narrows until she relinquishes anonymity by gifting her light-journal to the fountain, a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—revive dormant acoustics—escalates through each awakening; cost is the city’s forfeiture of fixed meaning.

Felt price legible in citizens’ bewildered wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—smuggle and plant defiant seed—escalates when Velasquez sells the fog window, forcing a tighter escape. Cost is visible: forfeited identity, second seed doubles tomorrow’s danger. One decisive tightening beat: auditor freeze via paradox loop.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—ending the war inside her ribs—escalates via the postcard’s invitation and the garden’s demand for blossom armistice. One decisive tightening: planting the postcard forecloses endless insomnia and exacts the price of self-dissolution. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens without external antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—prevent memory extinction—intensifies when the corridor opens; descent forces trade-off between safety and reclamation. Pressure escalates via pattern break: silence → song → named voices. Cost legible in “trace of foxglove regret remained.” Agency drives every turn; coincidence only complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—restore trust before paths diverge—tightens via tempo: each translated line shortens the clock, each ribbon raises audible stakes. Agency drives escalation: Ada’s humming literally reconfigures the chamber. Cost is felt when the ribbons burn out in the ink well, sealing her private loss into public gain. No slack loops; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—prevent eruption while reconciling values—tightens through each gate-opening beat; the price (risk of shattering orchid farms, personal tremor) is legible, though escalation is single-arc rather than multi-reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can she risk trust again?—is signaled early and tightened when she straps the chip to the bird. One decisive turn: release despite interception risk. Cost is visible in the ash of her rewritten ledgers. Pressure escalates causally; no coincidence resolves it.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—threshold as sacred space—escalates through one decisive intensification: the prism rewrites the corn blueprint into echoing absences. Mira chooses to outlast the cathedral rather than reclaim it, paying visible relational cost in the closing walkaway.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“rhythm of belonging”—is signaled early and tested by the sunrise clock. One meaningful tightening: the alarm forces the choice to leave the feather. Cost is visible in the relinquished relic and the fading hum. Agency remains with Mara; coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.7)
    The dominant stake—why paths disappear—escalates through pattern accumulation rather than reversals. The tightening occurs when glyphs fuse with absence, forcing Mira to risk her harvested memories; the cost is the autumn-sigh of a dissolving glyph, felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—Velasco’s wager that monotony can be serenaded—tightens as each volunteer’s token returns transformed. Pressure escalates through a single deepening rather than reversals: the cumulative emotional weight of tailored miracles. The cost is conceptual (Velasco’s endless itinerancy) rather than visceral, but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—write the world without being silenced—tightens via moonstone ingestion and invisible ink diffusion, escalating from individual exile to planetary inscription. One decisive intensification suffices; cosmic verse completion forecloses solo wandering, cost scales beautifully to short frame.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“mend what lived behind the cracks”—is signaled early and tightens when the third ring warns repair must finish by nightfall. Escalation is one deepening: the fractures become apertures that refract wonder onto townspeople, costing Mira anonymity and effort. Agency is hers alone; coincidence complicates (storm damage) but does not resolve. Cost is visible in her exhaustion and the irreversible shift in communal perception.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: translating personal pain into bearable meaning. Escalation occurs when Juniper’s arrival forces Rowan to test his theory on a living witness; the shard transfer is the tightening beat that forecloses solitary mourning. Agency is Rowan’s—he chooses inclusion over isolation. Cost is the literal fracture of the last intact keepsake.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—deriving a hope equation—is signaled early and tightened through each balloon test. The final spiral balloon forces a decisive yes/no validation; its steady ascent narrows options and confirms the function. Cost is the spent fuel and the night’s end, but the abstract stakes keep the price slightly muted.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—return the child’s fading heartbeat richer—signaled early. Escalation is textural: each brushstroke tightens the cadence until the city’s clocks yield.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—break the cycle of futile treaties—is signaled early; pressure tightens when both leaders must drink from the same helmet, then spikes when Petra risks their wrath with the orphan clause. Cost is visible: Rourke’s spit, Laure’s whisper, Petra’s silent acceptance of perpetual vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve the echo at personal cost—signaled in paragraph 3. Escalation: drought she created now thwarts her goal; each step (reading cracks, cracking capsule, issuing orders) narrows options and raises price. Agency drives every turn; coincidence is absent. Cost is reputational ruin and direct financial loss, legible in the phone call.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—defying conformity’s lullaby—is signaled early and tightened through each untangled thread; the final sky forces citizens to hear their own heartbeats as dissent. Cost is visible in the palace’s shaken ministers and Mirelle’s relinquished shears.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can ethical storytelling reverse poisoned narratives without trespass—tightens through each puppet show; the final refusal to teach crystallizes stance with visible social cost (scholars’ chastened silence).

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore the monarchs’ route by mending the forgotten story—tightens once when the interrupted cadence stalls mid-flight. Pearl’s agency drives escalation: from weaving signals to slicing moonlight for the knot. Cost crystallizes in the grotto’s settling hush and the butterfly’s solitary farewell.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve forgotten names—is signaled early and tightened when the scrap’s holes threaten to fade forever. Escalation is one continuous deepening: each manipulation of the rope increases the stakes until the bronze bell either succeeds or silences them for good. Cost is Elien’s relinquishment of the bell and the spent rope, visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“will the directive outlive memory?”—tightens once: the dance converts passive inheritance into active motion, foreclosing the option of mere custodianship. Cost is legible in the seal’s impending shatter and the narrator’s acceptance of nameless erasure. Pressure escalates under causal lens; no reversal is needed, only the decisive stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—understanding vs surrender—is signaled early and deepens with each schematic overlay. Mid-scene tightening forces the astrolabe sacrifice that forecloses retreat. Escalation is cogent under causal lens; one minor weakness: palace restoration heartbeat feels glorious but not choice-constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—Tyra’s need to release resentment—tightens through tactile escalation: broken pin → vibration → memory → visible exhalation of grey. Agency remains hers; Maro midwifes. Cost is the irrevocable loss of the grudge that once defined her.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—capture the runaway dream—is signaled early and tightened through each mirrored flash of lost blossom; the final crystallization forecloses escape and exacts the cost of perpetual permeability between past and present.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—the orchard’s survival against impending demolition—drives every beat with visible escalation: sabotage cuts, graft repair, Liora’s apprenticeship risk, final re-rooting. Cost is daylight left to demolition date and personal safety.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—access forbidden knowledge—tightens when the curator realizes participation demands irreversible self-folding. One decisive intensification: pollen coats lungs, rewriting him. Cost is visceral and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (reach the forbidden library) tightens when the register demands payment; Ora’s pollen sacrifice forecloses future germination knowledge. Escalation is driven by her agency under causal lens; cost is visible in the diary’s blank leaf. Pressure plateaus slightly during rescue detours.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—rescue vs abandonment—tightens once the brother offers half the comet-yarn. Escalation is Accumulative: each remembered name sprouts a new labyrinth, raising the cost of staying. The third-option seam is agency-driven and forecloses both earlier choices with felt price: perpetual co-narration to keep the ink solid.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“translate confusion into clarity”—is signaled early and tightened through each braid adjustment. Agency is continuous; the rope’s reconfiguration narrows options until the clock’s paragraph-chimes foreclose the path of erasure. Cost is legible: the forbidden door seals forever, the seal permanently altered.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve pockets of hush after alien resonance—narrows with each beat; escalation comes from internal silence meeting imported silence, tightening options until renunciation emerges. Agency lies in orchestrating release, not escape.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single dominant stake: prove coincidences have meaning. Pressure tightens from salvaged lenses to threading slivers into corroded gears—each misstep risks losing “half the resonance”; escalation culminates in irrevocable crack spread and the world’s “lean” toward the beam, cost paid on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—what to keep and what to let evaporate—tightens once when the moon-pool vision forces the choice. The cost is the excision of her own voice; pressure escalates via accumulating memories that demand curation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single dominant stake: invert hopeless protocol via playful ignition. Escalation is steady—enter uninvited → mosaic revelation → guard echo → citizen surge—and is entirely driven by protagonist’s choices; roses lowered tally physical price.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to speak at dawn—tightens through the cicada’s song that reveals two futures. The meaningful deepening is the shift from storm-surge words to gentle tide, paid for by Marella’s renunciation of immediate catharsis. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens; no external coincidence resolves it.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—harvest silence without losing Father—tightens once when gravity flips and again when Father climbs. Protagonist’s agency (vial release) forecloses argument and risks spinal cost. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens via density of hush and ticking doll chime.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—Gerard’s mission to gift silence—tightens through rising meter pointer and clouding vial, forcing tactical shifts (story-told-in-pauses, vial hand-off). The deepening is one elegant arc rather than multiple reversals, but the felt cost (Liora’s notebooks still, Gerard’s solitude) is on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—claim or leave the throne—is signaled early and tightens at the sigil’s demand. Escalation is one deepening: the helix freezes until Kestrel’s renunciation completes it. Cost is explicit: she forfeits personal sovereignty and erases her own trail.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—teaching suffocation to breathe—tightens through each failed/achieved mist-sphere. One meaningful deepening: the sphere holds, then drifts to the threshold, forcing Mara’s renunciation. Cost is felt in her calm acceptance of the burned bridge.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—translate personal pressure into honest value—is signaled in the first paragraph and tightened when the corridor forces her to “volunteer her will.” Each escalation (glitch text → liquefying wall → diamond door) increases the cost of refusal. The final harvest is earned, not gifted; luck complicates but does not resolve. The felt price is the bolt’s hollowing and the irreversible crystal colonization of the farm.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: reveal kept vs broadcast. One decisive tightening: winding crank <em>then</em> silencing it narrows options. Agency drives escalation—silence is deliberate decision with visible consequence. Coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“capture the shape of possibility”—is signaled early and tightens when the missing page forces surrender of fear. Pressure grows via choreography with scarecrows, but external antagonism is abstract; cost is felt internally rather than through tangible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—deliver the button before Jordan ages out—is signaled early and tightened by the one-week review deadline. Escalation is causal: each beat (dust circle, note, director, ride) narrows Mara’s options until the hand-off forecloses her possession. Cost is legible in her relinquishment and Jordan’s murmured enlistment pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—recover erased histories—tightens when alarms flash and Lina must choose capture or embodiment. Escalation is causal: each step (key insertion, spool activation, ghost procession) raises the cost of continuation. The final fusion forecloses retreat; the city’s indifference is directly challenged. Cost is visceral—voices now live inside her breath.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—preventing mass panic by silencing the prophecy—is signaled early and tightened through each musical phrase. Agency is exercised via resonance steering; the final whisper forecloses the option of ever retrieving the prophecy. The cost is felt in the mother’s erased lullaby and Kieran’s physical exhaustion, satisfying the 8.8+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: decode the leaves’ message vs. accept the arbor’s invitation. Tightening occurs when the silver leaf’s verse forces her to choose between cataloguing and becoming the prophecy. Cost is legible: she loses the safety of scholarly detachment and gains the burden of seed-guardian. Agency drives every escalation; no coincidence resolves anything.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—redeem broken promise—tightens when Aurora admits her jealous dismissal sent Jory into danger. One decisive turn: etching her own name into tin, accepting alloy of guilt. Cost is the mirror forcing her to witness every crack. Pressure escalates causally; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—freeing unattended spirits—signaled early. Escalation is textural: each confession absorbed brightens the tooth and tightens the lattice until the final release.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prove mercy mathematically—tightens when every formula ends in division by zero, then reopens via reciprocal inversion. Escalation is accumulative: pain coefficients, drone sweeps, forest sanctuary, strap conductivity. Agency drives each beat; no coincidence resolves. Cost is felt in “pain translated into coefficients” and the strap’s final gleam.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake: translate forgotten sea-voices before dawn erases them. One decisive intensification: lens in paint refracts voices into city dreams—this tightens the option set to sky return. Cost accrues on page: Aven’s fatigue, Irida’s knees, shard’s dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—compress eternity before rules solidify—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the rupture threatens to shatter the orchard. The final cost is the library’s collapse into recursive footnotes, felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether the shard is ornament or manifesto—escalates through Velen’s agency; the chronostorm experiment is a decisive, costly tactic that narrows options and forces public vindication. The personal cost (reopened wound of defeat) is felt on the page. Slight abstraction in “postponed revolutions” softens the final punch.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reclaim stolen dawn—is signaled in paragraph three and tightened when Clay must trade lifelong honesty. Agency drives escalation: each whispered joy corrodes guardians, narrowing to the irreversible tether. Cost is visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)

No reversals needed; one decisive intensification suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: archive or release the orchard’s emotions. Pressure tightens once: the prophecy’s “rain of glass” forces Loranth from transcription to planting.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—harvesting borrowed time—tightens when Alma chooses to age herself to heal the mirrors.

    Dominant stake—false-alarm vs. missed storm—escalates via pressure graph plunges and skin-static countdown. One meaningful tightening: the green light margin collapses, forcing the switch. Cost is legible in the mellow chord that risks credibility.

    Dominant stake: preserve unspoken vows. Pressure escalates as Orin deciphers wax indentations and feels the covenant’s weight on his ribs; no external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (beauty in the incomplete) tightens when each broken fragment obliges craft and attention; protagonist agency drives middle beats, narrowing option down to communal flight. Price is quietly paid in the boy’s shame and the poet’s evening labor, not overstated but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—interspecies respect before death—tightens through each wiring beat; the six-month clock and failing body raise cost. One decisive intensification: the conch-tapped circuit that forces communal recognition. Agency remains with Mara; coincidence (drift-oak bones) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.8)
    Meteorite voice, amber chimes, and vanishing footprints ratchet pressure; dawn cliff confrontation forces stance crystalization with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—restore the lapsed stewardship—signaled early. Escalation is accretive: salt-dead soil → bird-mapped nutrients → tide-borne phosphorus → green spears.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—whether distance can be translated into closeness—tightens when the cylinder’s coordinates force the choice to leave the settlement. One meaningful deepening: the realization that “silence itself was a lie.” Cost is visible in the irreversible departure at dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—will ritual survive systemic abandonment—loses no ground to digression; each sensor activation and intercom crackle tightens available options. Agency is embodied in every stroke of charcoal and in the choice to walk out rather than await rescue.

    Dominant stake—restore play to prophecy—is signaled early and tightened when each swapped piece visibly warms the chamber. Agency drives escalation; the final sigh of the spire is earned cost under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—truth versus erasure—tightens when the spire demands memory as payment; Vera’s refusal escalates through each spiral of pigment and stanza.

    Dominant stake—keeping a hidden promise to himself—tightens when the mirror’s fracture pattern matches the studio’s, forcing the final act of revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“prove whispers travel farther”—escalates through sensory density, not reversals; the tightening is the hush that precedes the bell. Cost is conceptual: the horn’s brute force is publicly outrun by unshouting faith.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—keeping the channel open for others’ reversed grief—tightens once when Marrow realizes departure would destroy the tower; the cost is the permanent forfeiture of her own reverse migration.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—decode the gesture and safeguard the memory—tightens through each gap Oswald parses. The ampoule’s discovery is a deepening that reweights his role from watcher to keeper. Cost is the perpetual echo of another’s joy now lodged in his solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—fulfill promise to vanished sister—tightens as creek rises and doorway demands choice. One clear escalation: fitting the chip irrevocably opens the path and seals it behind them. Cost is the lost return route.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—bleeding sky from stolen hope—is signaled in first paragraph and narrows to singular test: bleed to heal. Escalation is single sustained turn: memory bleed→renounce→re-absorb, cost escalating from dream weight to literal crown surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“capture the density of presence”—tightens when colors destabilize, forcing the choice to relinquish mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent the mindscape avalanche—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when the scroll’s paradox forces the narrator to choose revision over surrender. The cost is the erasure of the rookie’s ascent and the narrator’s own temporal exile, visible in the dissolving grave date.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—turning lived pain into authored meaning—is signaled early and tightened once: the storm’s return demands completion.

Cost is visible in the reopened wound and the unsanctioned rune.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deliver Dulio’s apology before the orchard falls—is signaled early and tightened by the literal countdown of saws. The single decisive turn (offering her body as conduit) narrows options and exacts the price of possession; escalation is causal, not coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake is simple: can the lie be shattered before final silence? Each beat tightens it: librarian test, seed kernel, spiral arbitration—all cohere under Situational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—keep the communal dialogue whole—tightens when hesitation signals sabotage. One meaningful deepening: the billet’s mirror reframes the conflict from mechanical failure to existential threat to linkage itself.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—security vs. metamorphosis—is signaled in line 3 and tightens when motion sensors whisper.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—how to forgive chaos—tightens when the father’s handwritten note inside the lantern forces Celeste either to preserve or shatter the last intact relic.

The heel-strike pays the visible cost (loss of intact pane) and forecloses the path of magical thinking.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: can the operator keep harvesting estrangement without paying the cost of his own? Each call tightens the pattern until the phone rings itself—an undeniable escalation that forces the operator to become the next wrong number. Cost crystallizes when he relinquishes his post and leaves the prepaid quarter.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—cure for loneliness—tightens through each beat: arrival, manifest writing, communal rhythm. Cost is visible (each stranger must now reciprocate), but escalation is gentle rather than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—charting the stillpoint to guide lost pilgrims—tightens once when Oriole realizes it is an internal coordinate, foreclosing the external mapping project.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—rescuing the promise—tightens through each artistic clue until the ember’s return forecloses all other paths. Pressure deepens via pattern accumulation; cost is legible in the weeping release. No escalation slack.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—ownership of collective memory—tightens when Ira’s drumming hijacks the protocol.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—prove whispers outrun shouts—tightens when patrol footsteps threaten exposure; the protagonists must trade immediate safety for evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: how to bear grief under mandated cheer. Escalation: turbine shutdown → inspector threat → lamp glow diffuses threat while preserving authentic sorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—turn her own grief into a navigable map for others—is signaled early and escalates through the stencil, ivy returns, compasses, return swans.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—whether communal memory can be salvaged—tightens when the cards overwrite the tape, foreclosing solitary ownership.

Cost is legible in Jonas’s relinquished wallet and Mirelle’s acceptance of perpetual debt.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.2)
    Forbidden knowledge is the dominant stake; each spiral step tightens the “cost” with irreversible neuronal imprint. The pay-off—carrying ruin outward—forces an earned stance with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—preserve the shape of hope by proving the grandmother still walks—is signaled early and tightened when Eira must choose exile to gather the stone.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—restoration of self-respect versus exile—is signaled early; pressure tightens as Calder burns boasts and stitches pauses, culminating in the choice to face villagers with truth; cost is the gamble of public shame.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—locating and freeing unused love—is signaled early and tightened once: the discovery that love is paused, not stored, forces Mira to project the film. Agency drives escalation; coincidence merely complicates (thunder as atmosphere, not solver). Cost is visible in the kiss that “glistens like wet ink” and the letters’ dissolution. Slight reserve because the price feels more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is signaled early and tightened by the unwritten calendar’s sidereal fatigue. The final surrender of personal stardust is a visible price that reweights the village’s sudden awakening.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—keeping dream-seeds alive—tightens when the clock’s midnight stasis becomes the necessary soil; Silas’s choice to listen instead of sleep incurs the cost of perpetual wakefulness. Escalation is one deepening, not multiple reversals, fitting the length.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—rediscovering the mind’s frontier—is signaled early and tightened when the observatory demands he “redraw” it.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“where unused courage waits”—is signaled early and tightens when Lis confronts the clearing of snapped leashes; the lantern’s ignition crystallizes the cost, though escalation is single-note.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    A single dominant stake—whether to unseal or leave the destiny-is made explicit; protagonist agency and cost escalate to the pledge beat; the moral price (“child to no throne”) crystallizes without external rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether a contraband truth will thaw or remain frozen—tightens at each beat: incineration protocol vs. broadcast risk.

Cost is visible: shared vigil beneath pewter glow, awaiting unknown replies.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—save the dome—faces a concrete test when the convoy arrives. Escalation tightens once: Amber’s refusal to arm herself narrows options and forces a non-violent gambit.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—capture vs. release of a goddess’s silence—tightens once when the sky-sentence warns “release or be unmade.” Agency drives escalation: Arlen’s transliteration of Nethe’s ache forces the decisive release.

    Dominant stake—“discover meaning in the mess”—tightens when the mandala shifts from prophecy to table-clearing. The deepening is driven by Felicity’s chalk intervention, not coincidence. Cost is legible but diffuse; the collective lightness feels shared rather than personally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can aberrant mercy rename a burned city? Pressure tightens through each tessera placement that audibly alters wind, deepening the wager—failure would silence the chord. No antagonist needed; retrocognitive overload and civic grief supply coherent pressure. Final utterance forecloses retreat to old identity, cost felt in stone-sparks fusion. Escalation is single-curve, not multi-reversal, sufficient for 700-word lyric arc; Rima’s emotional stake could sharpen midpoint risk.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—mend the ghost’s stalled encore—is signaled early and tightened through the breathing-echo mechanic; the cost (being late for dawn shift) is visible but modest.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—transform solitary prophecy into shared possibility—tightens once: the sand’s chaos when sealed contrasts with its calm once moonlight and gull-cries enter.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“why places resist change”—is signaled early; pressure deepens through Rua’s iterative acts but lacks a narrowing trade-off on page. Cost is implied in the future’s abolished hives and Rua’s self-exile, yet a sharper tightening within the single scene would lift it above 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore light for Nara—tightens when the rose fails and the prism threatens collapse. Escalation is causal: each repair attempt increases the cost of stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—retrieve key or kingdom starves—tightens once when the cage corkscrews away and Aveline must negotiate with space itself. Agency drives escalation: her geometric diplomacy dilates the tunnel. Cost is visible: she pockets the burden she once considered destroying.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—missing evidence/solution—escalates via procedural pressure: each procedural micro-reveal narrows options until dual confession becomes inevitable. Visible costs accumulate: suspects lose control, Samara loses her emotional shield.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.4)
    Primary stake: transform impossibility into bridge of choices. Escalation accelerates as each melody turns a buried choice into present material; stakes tighten from personal fear of wasting talent to literal bridge-building for anonymous strangers at visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—why paths circle back—is signaled early and tightened when the memorial backroad is revealed as the algorithm’s invisible barrier. The tightening is driven by Eliot’s agency: placing bills, recognizing the loop, choosing to walk differently. Cost is felt in the renunciation of the startup’s promise and the open-ended future. One meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—decode before misuse—is signaled early and tightened when the star-pulse forces a public broadcast, foreclosing secrecy. Escalation is causal: each observation narrows options until the only path is shared disclosure. Cost is palpable—loss of private grief and exposure to rumor-oracles. No coincidence resolves; pressure is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“what mirrors refuse to show”—escalates through one core tightening: confronting frozen guilt within the vortex. Agency resides in the confession release; price is past abandonment surrendered to the lake. Pressure feels cumulative rather than multi-turn, appropriate to lyric scope.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—save Mira at cost of Liora’s future—signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is one sustained tightening: each confession lightens her silhouette, narrows options, until the second seed anchors the void. Price is visceral and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—understanding transition physics—tightens once: from abstract ache to embodied test when the seed splits and demands a choice. Escalation is Accumulative: each resonant tap, pollen map, and thread-fold increases density until the final ideogram forecloses retrieval. Cost is visible: the sister remains absent, transformed into echo. Agency drives every beat; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve wonder by re-forging lost identities—is signaled early and tightened when Silence begins the smelting song. The cost is visible: she exhausts the creel and accepts her own perpetual migration, but the beat could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—dissolving internal walls via external ritual—is signaled early and tightens when Roan must choose to add his own confession. The cost is visceral: tears and the irreversible inscription. Agency drives escalation; coincidence never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens when redirecting water becomes the concrete test; cost is the physical labor and exposure of grief. Escalation is one meaningful deepening under Accumulative/Textural lens: each leak mapped, each channel cut, pattern intensifies until dawn image reweights stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—finding the library—tightens when the second letter proves to be the missing temporal keystone. One meaningful deepening occurs as silence becomes the price of access; the cost is visible (loss of voice, then of the watch) and narrows options under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—restore Solon’s dream before the anthem erases it—is signaled in paragraph three and tightened when the ivy asks what to propagate. Escalation is Accumulative: each sensory layer (coffee, roses, ivy, banners) reweights the cost of silence. The final chord’s release is agency-driven, not coincidental. A crisper on-page price (personal risk to Liora) would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“capture one last spark before oblivion”—tightens through each beat: radio tuning, pigment stroke, emerald placement. The final infusion visibly forecloses further attempts tonight and extracts the price of future obligation to the void.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    Primary stake—whether buying certainty is better than owning doubt—rips upward across three beats: proffer coin, climb tower, renounce closure. Each chime deciphering tightens tactics and narrows safety; every new note changes the expected outcome and levies cost on conscience.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: learn to vanish so that appearing feels miraculous. Pressure tightens once—from stone cast to chalk circle to vanishing—under causal lens. Agency is Rowan’s surrender inside the circle; cost is his literal absence. No escalation beyond the single deepening, but it suffices for 600–800 words.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—mastering motionless navigation—is signaled early and tightened through each echo and bird wheel. The deepening occurs when Ithar realizes the world must move instead of him, a shift that narrows options and demands balance. Cost is visible in the arrowhead’s sacrifice and the vow of restraint. Escalation is coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: can the “brilliant dimness” survive automation? Escalation is textural: each beat deepens the gulf between mechanical brilliance and human imperfection until the final flare reweights the conflict. Cost is visible—quills drown in their own genius.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will Emil dare to voice his hidden vow—tightens once when gray footsteps reveal the cost of secrecy. Agency drives escalation: he rows, descends, reads, then speaks. The price is the surrender of lifelong concealment, visible in the aurora that escapes the hull. Meets 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to trust the prophecy—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightened when the coin stands upright, then topples. The five pulses matching birth cries crystallize the cost: the colony must abandon the known. Agency is Ikram’s throughout; coincidence complicates (prophecy’s magnetism) but does not resolve. Pressure escalates cleanly under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—naming the terror—sharpens through each beat: every title quiets recordings until the unnamed void appears; escalating silence raises the price. The final naming forecloses the option of retreat and costs the eternal burden.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—restoring cosmic balance—tightens through each counted drop; the reversal of tides marks the decisive pressure spike. Cost is legible: Orin’s sweat and the bell’s new open-ended silence foreclose the old prayer-swallowing function. Escalation is causal and single-cycle, fitting length.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whose memory survives the next flood—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when Mara lowers the sluice. One decisive intensification: the act buys “hours to gather” at the cost of inevitable refill. Agency is hers; coincidence (photos surfacing) complicates but does not resolve. The price—personal risk and temporary ecological strain—is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve mortal tenderness without destroying orchard equilibrium—is signaled early and tightened when the crystal’s inner flame threatens both. One meaningful deepening: Sera’s heartbeat tempers the flame, narrowing options to a wick, not blaze. Cost is felt in the orchard’s sigh and her new hush.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve trust by redirecting convoy—is signaled early and escalates through one decisive tightening: the revised mountain-pass vector that trades speed for sunrise diplomacy. Cost is visible in her forced vigil and the arbor’s endorsement, not merely declared.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—custody of personhood—tightens through the breathing ritual that forecloses violence; the cost is the dissolution of the clones. Pressure escalates via pattern intensification rather than causal turns, fitting the Accumulative lens. One tightening is sufficient, but the cosmic history-rewrite stays abstract, muting visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: safeguard creative space vs. risk of olfactory chaos. Pressure tightens when the seed germinates within minutes, forcing immediate tactical sketching. The cost is the irreversible commitment to a stench-driven room; escalation is single but sufficient under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“restore lost laughter before grief ossifies”—narrows each step: every blower-snarl escalates the risk of reopening wounds. Cost is the household’s muffles to tremors to audible tears; no coincidence resolves the laughter; Orren’s agency and sonic pressure generate it.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—friendship with uncertainty itself—escalates through concrete images of thresholds, blank margins, and the mist-shape’s silence. Pendant-activated elastic distance poses causal squeeze, but escalation glides on lyric accumulation more than tightening beat; felt cost is present yet slightly diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—interrupt destiny—signaled early and tightened through each ritual beat. Agency drives escalation: obsidian spiral, mercury pour, tear balance, shame confession. Final cost is the mask surrendered; no coincidence resolves. One meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“find the beginning in every ending”—is signaled early and tightened when Mara must choose between keeping the fragment or repurposing it to revive her homeland. The pressure escalates via Accumulative/Textural deepening: each surrender widens the circuit until the gorge itself reconfigures. Cost is visible: the fragment becomes “only warm glass,” spent. One minor slack: the Hollywood shard’s initial lure feels slightly external to Mara’s agency.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—restoring stranded passengers—tightens when Milo realizes each grain equals a life in suspension. One meaningful deepening: turning the hourglass forecloses the option to remain lost, exacting the cost of perpetual vigilance (“every journey from now on would honor the woven string”).

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—prevent catastrophic collapse of memory-lattice—signaled early. Escalation tightens when threads threaten to knot into “a single luminous knot.” Mara’s agency drives the resolution; luck does not intervene. Visible cost: she forfeits her first memory. One meaningful tightening is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“awaken memories into skill or permanent night”—is signaled early and tightened when the vectors bend toward the trench, foreclosing the option to stay in abstract study. Cost is visible: they risk drowning in barnacle-resin rebreathers; success rewrites the curriculum, eliminating the old safe path.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—protecting vulnerable voices—tightens when Mira must choose between extracting the boy and preserving the archive; the cost is her drained lantern and the irreversible decision to leave the voices playing, a visible price that reweights options.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    Tide-clock pressure narrows every move; false dawn window tightens stakes; restart decision triggers visible trade-off—invisible footprints drying to salt embody cost.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—wisdom from failure—tightens when the ghost demands a kernel of memory. The single deepening (ink → shard → tape) narrows options and exacts a visible price. Agency remains with Mara; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—“translate texture into sound” against a language dying in real time—tightens when echoes collapse into dust with each step. Agency is continuous: purchase diamond, read birds, recite textures, plant diamond, retreat. The decisive turn is the recitation that forces the tunnel to respond, costing the protagonist lifelong internal exile. Escalation is textural density: softer rebounds, collapsing vowels, final sealing chord.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reawaken beauty or accept mechanical silence—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightened when the statues’ joints lock. Agency is musical; each bow-stroke raises the cost of rebellion. The price—traitor branding and uprooted gearbox—lands on the page. No coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether to deliver, hide, or free the storm—tightens once when Lorin chooses “Returned to Sender.” Agency drives escalation; drones retreat because the storm’s weight breaks their protocol. Cost is the town’s sky already rumbling toward uncertain peace. No coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—can silence be transmuted into generative sound?—is signaled early and escalates via Marlo’s escalating sonic experiments. The shard’s discovery tightens the stake; each chime tests commitment. Cost is visible: he relinquishes lifelong muteness, a felt forfeiture that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—finding the unwritten annex—is signaled early and tightened when the prose refuses to leave until Hollis “learns to shelve silence.” The tightening forecloses seizure as an option, forcing renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—capture versus liberate the dream—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens through each beat. The decisive turn occurs when Callix renounces pigment for light, narrowing options and paying the cost of unreadability. Escalation is causal and driven by protagonist agency; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—freeing an idea from fear—tightens through the progressive unlocking of box and memory; the final diffusion of the syllable across the city is a visible, conceptual price. Pressure escalates by Accumulative intensification rather than causal reversal, sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—recover stolen memories—escalates when Mara’s mapped voids refuse to fill, forcing the ungloved touch. The single tightening beat (removing gloves) narrows options and exacts a felt price: she must trade fresh memories for old ones. Agency is hers; coincidence never solves.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stake—library’s pardon from reversible exile—is signaled early and tightens through Harl’s invasive audit; protagonist’s agency bends reflective dusk into a blade that slices seal-letter while sparing flesh; choice forecloses immediate freedom by keeping pact with Rafe—felt cost in perpetual curatorship.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restore wonder—is signaled early and tightened when the seed cracks and the ribbon must be grafted before color fades. One decisive intensification suffices; the cost is the lifelong guardianship vow. Agency remains joint but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—ground the roaming spirit—tightens through each unraveled knot; agency is Neris’s ritual labor. One deepening: realizing the spirit is an actor, not fisherman, reframes the debt. Cost is the sanctuary’s held breath and the net’s spent memory.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—completing the map by listening to silence—tightens when the coastline vanishes between reels. The final choice to share rather than steal the silence carries visible cost, though the escalation is more accumulative than sharply causal.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—understanding how to let go—tightens through escalating sensory density and the discovery of the journal. The final act of mapping the wire’s failure pattern crystallizes the cost. Agency remains with the protagonist; no external rescue dilutes pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—give voice to abandoned digital grief—escalates as each graffiti vector narrows the ghost’s options toward articulation. Pressure tightens when lightning reveals the split shadow, forcing the balladeer to complete the encoding before daylight scatters the corridor.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—deliver breakfast without violating trust—tightens when the diary appears. One meaningful turn: memorizing and gifting the line “Pain is a lantern…” narrows future options (risk of exile). Cost is legible: Auden’s anguish retreats one step, servant’s status now precarious.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—proving memory inheres in absence—is signaled early and escalates through each labeled cloud and the ballast drop. One decisive tightening: transmitting the notebook as tonal pips forecloses retrieval, making the cost irreversible. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake: create a sky-mural that prevents demolition. Escalation: dawn→day→crew arrival; each micro-choice adds density until the foreman’s “incoherent” radio call and the warden’s final click freeze the clock. Cost: the mural displaces familiar walls, a felt trade-off cemented in the ending hush.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—“before routine dulled his skies”—tightens decisively: the moment Aleksei aligns the hopscotch grid with wheeling birds and luminous threads, the option to fly ordinary trade routes forecloses. Cost crystallizes: the world they knew (named, charted continents) is left below as they commit to an unnamed cloud-isle. Coincidence merely discovers the isle; Aleksei’s agency pilots toward it.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“learn the rhythm of repair”—is signaled early and tightened when the prophecy demands a heart from her own failures. The cost is the extracted tear-pendulum and the public apology; these visibly alter her stance. Pressure escalates once, cleanly, under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—planet’s survival—tightens when arches crack and the nebula threatens. One decisive escalation: second bell-ring transforms command into promise, narrowing options to trust communal bond. Cost is the irreversible vigilance and the bruise the planet now carries.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—prevent another lost soul—tightens as frost crystals form; the amber model becomes the single tool to rewrite corridors. Escalation is accumulative: resin lines, twig arrows, nut-shell gears build pressure until the socket click. Cost is the irreversible exposure of her secret craft and the orchard’s silence. No reversals beyond the decisive reconfiguration, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—repairing rupture with Mara—intensifies via guilt and river lesson. One tightening beat: foam insight → polymer swans. Cost is forfeiture of remaining grant material and emotional exposure of the text to Mara.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—finding the unuttered syllable—tightens when parole time accelerates. The meaningful deepening occurs at the nucleus: Kes must choose inscription or renunciation. Cost is felt (lost coordinates, forfeited sales), though the price could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can Sel offload remorse—tightens because the coral exacts an unpayable toll, forcing Kilor to substitute himself. One deepening turn when attempt to sandpaper fails and “regret remained a feral taste.” Cost visible: Kilor walking into jaws while Sel tastes iron remains on tongue. Agency stays causal under Terraria only; coincidence absent; escalation to cataclysm narrowly averted.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is clear from first paragraph: bridge structures into symphonies before dawn repossesses the loaned light. One escalating loop—exercise, retune, harmonize—adds density until the final fifth locks valley-wide. Cost is visible on the page: missing bell compromises tower; Lysandra stands exhausted against elevator while birds carry the chord away (felt absence).

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—custodianship vs possession—tightens when the mirror’s corridor of light forces her deeper; the cost is the irrevocable entanglement of her own past. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—creating music in silence—is signaled early and tightened through each empathic micro-choice. The final harmonic forecloses further striving; cost is legible in the cooled, glowing insulator and Lark’s wordless bow. One meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can exile be redeemed through pattern and grace—escalates as each move correlates moral choice to physical pull. One decisive tightening: queen sacrifice narrows options to graceful victory or greedy stalemate. Cost is felt in permanent departure and the smoothed stone.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore mentor’s diary without violence—is signaled immediately and escalates one layer at a time: mechanical clasp, psychic latch of remorse, then emotional harmonics.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—portable peace versus village safety—tightens once: elders issue ultimatum → Liora stakes exile → silence settles cost. Agency is clear, escalation singular but earned.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake: prevent the convergence from returning. Pressure escalates from eerie silence to the null spot to the thunderclap that rolls outward. Mara’s agency is decisive: she scrambles the wind vectors, paying with the permanent alteration of the airflow and the town’s altered future. Cost is visible and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“certify wonder as essential”—is signaled early and tightened through each bell: citrus melts edges, blue wind liquefies cubes, yellow shatters emerald wave.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—redeeming guardianship by facing failure—is signaled early and escalates through literal world-tearing pressure and self-reconciliation with visible cost in the corridor vision. No easy resolution; choices foreclose options.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the withheld truth—tightens when revelation becomes a burden that could arm a fleet. Escalation is causal: each redirect narrows options until concealment is the only viable tactic. The cost is legible in Kael’s exile and the scrambled gates. One meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: keep the chain unbroken to hold the dark at bay. Pressure tightens once: the lamp dies, the cairn demands “protect,” the sea-glass must be named. Ellis’s agency—stacking stones, naming the shard—forecloses retreat; cost is the permanent ache he now carries.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—shape tomorrow via ancient shadows—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened when Mora rotates the wick three degrees, foreclosing her freedom. Pressure grows through accumulating reflections; cost is the eternal keeper bond. No coincidence resolves; agency drives escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—fill the catalog’s void—tightens once when the blank index becomes a “blade at his throat.” Agency is exercised in the decision to project, with the cost of confronting erased love.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—capture the sound before sunrise—is signaled early and tightened by each beat. The sunrise deadline and market’s dissolution create coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes—coexistence vs exile—tighten through Lior’s mist-canvassing and Zephra’s statistical light; the cost is legible in the creaking cedar verdict, yet the pressure feels more atmospheric than viscerally personal.

    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—guard the children’s fears while resolving inner static—is signaled early and tightened once: the magnetic storm forces the burn-or-breach choice. Agency is decision, not luck; the visible price is the roses’ dormancy and the permanent shrinking of the fears.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—healing via listening—tightens when bureaucratic bolt-cutters threaten at 9 a.m.; the circle’s communal reading forecloses that path with visible cost (Cardoza’s shame exposed).

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—carry vs abandon quarantined love—is signaled early and escalates via the revealed brother’s sacrifice. One tightening choice (“she spoke aloud… carrying him forward”) closes a live option, forging agency under visible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—rewrite Loryn’s fate—tightens when the marble demands a memory toll. Escalation is causal: each stroke of the thorn narrows escape routes until the automaton bars exit. The price is dramatized in blood and memory, not declared. No reversals beyond the single decisive turn, but that turn is irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—loss of self to communal memory—is signaled early and tightened by the pact. Escalation is causal: each countdown digit raises urgency; the chamber’s offer forces a trade-off. Cost is visible on-page (“every performance would now end with memories that were none of her own”). No coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—free the keeper or perpetuate denial—is signaled early and tightened once: Mara’s decision to expose the glacier. Escalation is causal and irreversible; the price is the monks’ shattered ideal. No reversals needed; one decisive tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can the hidden pattern be made visible without disturbing it? Escalation is one deepening: moon’s drift → need undisturbed mirror → collective stillness. Agency is shared yet centered on Hai-rin’s orchestration. Cost is the sailors’ muscle burn and Hai-rin’s relinquished refreshment. Coincidence (moon’s exact touch) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. protection—tightens once when Mara chooses secrecy after witnessing the stillpoint’s fragility. Pressure escalates causally: each decoded scrap narrows her options until silence becomes mercy. Cost is legible in the ash of the letters and her lonely watch.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: birth a horizon using old signals. Escalation is accumulative: each fragment tightens the tapestry, her first live song reframes allegiance into migration. Pressure peaks in the final lightning-split storm. Protagonist agency is continuous—broadcasting, rehearsing, guardianship—but external military stakes remain largely off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: can the poet translate loss into balm? Pressure tightens when the family arrives; the release of the hum narrows options to irrevocable gift. Cost is the poet’s own unsoothed ache. No coincidence resolves the conflict; agency remains with the giver.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.0)
    Single dominant stake (sacred relic vs collectors) introduced line 6; pressure crescendos when raiders’ silent cutter knifes the dusk and founders against an invisible wall amplified by their own dissonant hearts. Escalation: failed assault tightens cost for engineers—sonic system consumes Callix’s stamina and leaves both humbled under auroras. No reversal beyond initial success, yet the tightening feels final. “Cost” is visible exhaustion rather than material loss—sufficient for short-form but less visceral than stakes could reach.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will impatience be unyoked?—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when the hum begins to breathe. One meaningful deepening: the narrator’s inner drum falters as the revolution inhales. Cost is visible in the relinquished urgency and the blue arcs that “unfold, slow as moss.” Agency remains with the pair; coincidence never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—evidence against Havel—is declared early, intensifies with the worker’s confession, and tightens when the ledgers are recovered. One clear reversal: the lantern reveals the hidden chamber. Cost is social; felt, though not visceral on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake: can a mechanical heartbeat carry real apology? Pressure tightens when Maeve realizes the tune alone is insufficient; her counter-proposal narrows Ellis’s options and raises moral cost. Agency remains with Maeve; coincidence plays no role.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“ring a bell no one hears yet”—is signaled early and tightened once: the arrow’s release forecloses silence and risks ridicule. Pressure grows via corrosion losses and acid’s appetite; agency drives every beat. Cost is visible in the bell’s exile to inaudible resonance. A second tightening would have lifted it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recover deleted consciousness—tightens when corporate red warnings foreclose safe restoration. Escalation is causal: each lie narrows Lyra’s options until the final broadcast. Cost is visible in server thunder and legal sprint. Slight deduction for off-stage outrage ignition.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“map empathy onto action before storm season”—is signaled early and tightened when the emotional cartography is projected skyward. Agency drives escalation: Mara’s decision to follow, to ally, to broadcast. Cost is felt in the swaying tower and the storm’s held breath. One beat of luck (Silas already waiting) is minor.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—learning the sound of endings—tightens through salvage shifts and the storm lock-in. Agency is attention rather than overt reversal; the blizzard deepens stakes by foreclosing the clinic path. Cost is the quiet forfeiture of scheduled death, visible in her whispered thanks to the cold.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.4)
    The vineyard’s mismatched romances escalate from clay courting limestone to the narrator translating fear into patience; one deepening crystallizes stakes without needing reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: transmit wisdom without corrupting its silence. One tightening beat—unsealing then resealing the echo—forces irrevocable guardianship. Cost is felt in the “harmless stone” settling behind ribs. Stakes avoid abstraction; every escalation traces from Lira’s actions under increasing on-record pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—transmute communal pain into shared masterpiece—is signaled early and tightened when townsfolk rearrange photos, narrowing isolation to collective responsibility. Cost is the ache of recognition and Lyra’s solitary exit. One clear deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: decode living language before chaos disguises it. Pressure tightens when the tribunal arrives; Orrin’s agency crystallizes in offering the crystal, forcing the council to confront unborn paragraphs. Cost: social exile implied by their uncertain retreat. One meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“capture the sound of growing older”—tightens when the melody of aging is heard then lost. Escalation is textural: each statue’s vibration adds density until the tape records only wind, foreclosing the narrator’s original goal. Prophet’s amnesia applies external pressure that complicates pursuit. Cost is legible: the erased recording permanently forfeits the sought sound.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.2)
    The escalating stakes—“every instrument forgets the sky” if the hand spins free—are clarified on page. One tightening beat is supplied at the final stop: the hand’s stillness imposes a permanent vigilance (“ready… next tremor”), a felt price rather than an external rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—Hector’s flawless goodbye—tightens once when the shard becomes the medium for reconciliation; the cost is Mateo’s cracked posture and tears. Pressure deepens rather than reverses, sufficient for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—find where shadows go at noon—is signaled early and tightened when the corridor forces a choice between exploitation and mercy. Escalation is causal: key insertion → loop closure → exile risk → mutual blood stabilizes. Visible price is the shared blood and Vela’s flickering imprisonment. Agency drives every turn; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—restore the real child—signaled early and tightened twice: tooth fails, heart is missing. Agency drives escalation: Liora’s vow, Kedron’s bone-setting, joint descent. Cost is visceral—honey spill, garden’s hush, cradle’s creak. No coincidence resolves; every turn is earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—share light without fire—escalates as each spiral of polishing intensifies the glow’s risk of stagnation; the release into the pool forecloses keeping the pearl, with visible cost (emptied satchel).

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can living quiet survive viral noise? Pressure escalates through accretion—each seed planted is another future headline. The single tightening is the inevitable arrival of reporters; no reversal, only deepening. Cost is visible in Rowan’s tears and the garden’s coming exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—collect living silhouettes for an unwritten ending—tightens once when ink finally flows after the mirror exchange. Escalation is accretive: each cameo adds a layer of hope that cumulatively reweights the stake. The cost is conceptual but unmistakable: the book will never end, demanding perpetual rowing.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.3)
    One dominant stake—revive the Arbor Heart—tightens when story becomes literal conduit; blight is embodied in wilt. No escalation curve after song launch prevents higher band; the turn remains singular but cleanly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“translate heartbeats into maps”—is signaled early and tightened once: the sickle-seal costs Arren his lifelong counting ritual. Pressure grows via pattern completion and heartbeat synchrony; no external antagonist needed. Cost is visible: orchard exhales arrow, Arren’s stance loosens. Coincidence absent; escalation is accumulative deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore the valley’s lost wonder—is signaled early and escalates through echo density and gear recalibration. Silas’s agency drives each beat; no coincidence resolves. The tightening occurs when the timer ticks backward, foreclosing the option to hoard wonder. Cost is felt in his solitary ascent and silent smile.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.9)
    The lone dominant stake—Olivine must balance collected burdens while facing her un-woven own—ratchets once: the mirrored seam opening forces an irreversible trade-off that raises the total to twenty-four drams and reweights every thread already spun.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to live with perpetual absence—tightens through the crystallized-time beat: Mara must choose between freezing memory or letting it flow into art. Agency is renunciation: she refuses completion, paying the price of endless revisitation. Pressure escalates via density and cadence rather than external events; the kettle’s overdue scream marks the irreversible turn. Cost is felt in the unfinished lion and the phrase “absence, too, can roar.”

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—direction versus erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the ghost demands a heart-filling price. The final surrender of stories forecloses the scavenger tactic with visible cost. One clear escalation beat suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can the terminal’s spirit be resurrected via flow?—is signaled early and tightened when Milo forces the atrium doors; the visible price is physical labor and the surrender of personal acclaim. Escalation is single but sufficient under Accumulative/Textural lens: density of sound, humidity, and light reweights the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reconciling with the abandoned dream—is signaled early and tightens when Elias realizes meaning lives in pauses, not pulses. The cost is the dream’s death, felt in shared tears. One beat of escalation suffices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—expose hidden atrocities—tightens via salvage/ledger discovery, not coincidence. Pressure forces stance crystallization and a visible price for broadcasting truth.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve ancient methods—tightens when the rope message narrows options to one perilous site; the lightning strike is coincidence that complicates, not rescues. Agency is exercised in the vow to guard the seed, with the cost of perpetual deferral legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes—“write my unhealed map”—are introduced early and tighten once, crystallizing in Holt’s promise to weave healing geography. Cost is felt in the final image (thread as compass, not tombstone), but no escalation loop beyond the single tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—restore beauty without destroying the machine world—signaled early and tightened when turbines falter and palace lists. One decisive turn: fledgling ignites sigils, gears reverse, descent begins. Cost is palpable in cracking anchors and uncertain equilibrium. Agency remains Oriven’s throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: whether Maia can confront father’s legacy without self-immolation. Pressure tightens once: coin-sinking is decisive act that narrows options—no longer possible to hate the spark. Cost is embodied (tears, scar tingle, smoke departing). No coincidence resolves; pilgrimage and lagoon complicate but do not solve. Escalation legible under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—liberate memories before winter—tightens when geese prepare to migrate. Escalation is one deepening: from archival search to active summoning of rain. Cost is felt in irreversible release of voices and the geese’s departure. Agency remains with Aurin; coincidence (rain from wings) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to seal or free generational memory—is signaled early and tightened by the single decisive act of misaligning the gear. Cost is the troubling uncertainty she now carries. Pressure escalates via pattern density rather than causal reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—render collective grief honestly—tightens as each ribbon knot accumulates voices. No external antagonist; pressure is situational-accumulative. Final carving narrows options to porous form; cost is the irrevocable exposure of private sorrow to public continuation.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restoring temporal balance through personal penance—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened by each confession. The final tightening occurs when Elias must choose between protecting Clara and completing the calibration; the cost is the spoken truth. Pressure escalates via the rising tide and the diminishing weight of the bob. Agency remains with Elias; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring unfinished intentions—escalates as each decoded thread narrows Milo’s options until only the spade and sovereign case remain. The pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens; the cost is the irreversible night of labor and the exposure of Rowan’s buried regret.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—seed innovation before kingdom fractures—is signaled early and tightened by the thirty-word limit. The external caravan proves the cost landed. One meaningful escalation under causal lens; no reversals needed.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—restore narrative to a story-famine city—tightens when the pirate signal begins to fade. Mila’s agency drives escalation: she trades the signal’s secrecy for the dust’s ubiquity, a visible price that narrows her options to “life itself” as antenna.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—crystallize a fleeting emotion before dawn—is signaled early and tightens as the mask nears completion. The single meaningful deepening occurs when Silas chooses suspension over wearing, a renunciation that costs him immediate catharsis. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves. The price is felt in the mask’s “breathing” and the chair’s resumed sway.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    A single escalating pressure line—Corvin’s quest to retrieve meaning from salvage vs. Mara’s narrative imperative—tightens through one decisive encounter that narrows options under the Accumulative lens, paid for by their mutual surrender of explanatory control over the cog and city.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—saving vanishing arts through harmony—is signaled early. Escalation occurs via nightly subtraction of noise, tightening until the council confrontation. Cost is felt in the councilors’ moist eyes and the city’s unfamiliar peace, though Mara’s personal price remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore communal hope via one seed—tightens through each pruning beat; the celestial alignment creates coherent pressure that narrows the window to a single night, and the cost is the irreversible sharing of potentially godlike knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: restore power before city entropy. Escalation tightens once: ampoule retrieval triggers alarms, forcing ritual declaration with tower refusal as cost. Agency is decision (speak truth) that forecloses stealth option. Coincidence (Bram’s pre-solved riddle) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—translate the house’s hush into language—intensifies through displacement tests until tremor and gift (wishbone) reweight the option space. Cost is felt in the relinquishing of control: she pockets warmth but leaves the cottage breathing without her.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—whether certainty can survive kindness—tightens once: the ampoule’s structural weakness forces Aios to choose between total revelation (poison) and measured risk. His calibrated release narrows options and visibly pays the price of reawakening the statues. Pressure is coherent under the situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—escape vs. acceptance of regret—is signaled early and tightens with each roll. The zero/one outcome forces a visible trade-off: perpetual motion abandoned for stillness. Pressure escalates under causal lens; cost is legible in the erased chalk and the staircase continuing without them.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: can Ravi rouse kindness before dawn? Pressure tightens as moonlight wanes and brush dims; each luminous letter costs stamina. One meaningful deepening: herbs lift heads, city pauses—proof the tactic works, but exhaustion forecloses further action. Cost is visible in Ravi’s collapse among vines.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—cultural survival against creeping freeze—tightens when the lens reveals fading initials, forcing the communal bake-off that forecloses passive mourning. Cost is visible: resources are low, newcomers still arrive, yet the ovens burn. Agency is collective but steered by Iclea’s green-flash signal.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—escape fate’s design—signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened each time a gear clicks backward. One meaningful turn: the yoyo’s counter-clockwise spiral negotiates with the hunger stone, foreclosing empire and cataclysm futures. Cost is the yoyo’s death and the echoing solitude. Agency drives every beat; coincidence never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—trick fear into naming—tightens after the unbosom beat and again when masks drop; visible prices (glowing shrapnel in flesh, absent clasp) alter Eli’s options, though the escalation feels one-cycle rather than a layered squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—turn obstacles into instruments—escalates through storm pressure; Mira’s agency converts gale into counterpoint, narrowing options to “play or perish.” Cost is legible in salt-stung blossoms and the mallet’s warm hum.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—question the watchers to find Elyth—tightens when the mirrors force Corin to drop the sextant and accept the forbidden note. One decisive escalation: the beam heating the whistle until it sings, shuddering the turtles and revealing the vault path. Cost is the audible crack of self.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—rescue truth from lies—escalates through each discovery; the caretaker’s arrival tightens pressure, forcing the digital-upload bargain that forecloses silence. Cost is the caretaker’s betrayal of his former oath and Mira’s uncertain safety.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: preserve forgotten dreams against tidal erasure. Escalation occurs via dwindling time and the lockbox’s refusal to yield until forced. Each dowel driven is a micro-cost that forecloses alternative uses of energy or memory. The tightening is coherent under the Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—truth versus forgery—is signaled early and tightened when Maris detects fresh ink grooves. One decisive turn: lifting the codex triggers flood. Agency remains hers; coincidence (blackout) complicates but does not resolve. Cost is the sealed archive and her exile.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—transform grief into usable light—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when Lyra chooses to release rather than hoard the dream. The cost is explicit: “untamed sorrow could shatter the basilica,” yet she bows. Agency drives every escalation; coincidence merely complicates. One meaningful deepening suffices and lands with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent continental destruction—is signaled early and tightened when the node’s pulse matches the drones. One meaningful turn: surrendering the geode forecloses both weaponization and personal remembrance. Escalation is causal and driven by Ashraf’s agency; cost is visible in the dissolution of the crystal. No coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“decode the frequency of belonging”—tightens when the matrix chip synchronizes star trails into a single vacuous pixel labelled “home.” The drone’s pull of the telescope is the decisive act that forces the cost: once the sky sings, departure can never again feel alone.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—atonement for erasure—escalates via the watch-hand’s compulsion and the ledger’s revelation. One tightening: the corridor collapse forces Elias to speak the name. Cost is the forfeiture of his trade, visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—can Mara broker humanity without reducing people to cargo—tightens when she must literally cut the twine and risk the first exchange. The moon-phase calendar externalizes pressure; the arrival of torches marks the irreversible beat. Agency remains hers; coincidence only complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can Gideon cross the bay without compasses or absolution?—tightens when lightning strikes the farthest pole, forcing an apology that narrows options to shared steering. Escalation causal: each paddle because of regret, storm therefore demanding vocalized cost. No coincidence resolves; storm drifts north after his shout.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—empathy versus relapse—is signaled early and tightened once through the lake visions. The third vision forecloses the other two with visible cost: surrender of criminal identity for uncertain redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reforge bond beyond death—is signaled early and escalates via each spice-laden breath. The mid-story tightening occurs when metamorphosis exacts payment; final choice narrows options to shared half-form. Cost is legible in forfeited full humanity.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering lost time—tightens when Mara must trade her own glowing memories; the pressure deepens as each recollection leaves her chest, foreclosing the option to keep them, with the final upward cascade of seconds showing the felt price under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—opening the locked dimension—tightens when Griffin realizes dimensions respond only to undamaged emotion. Each nightly stitching session escalates pressure by exposing fresh grief; the final self-forgiveness is the decisive trade-off that forecloses return. Cost is visible in the silhouettes’ dissolution and the ship’s sealed silence.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.3)
    The single dominant stake—how to survive transformation itself—escalates as the firefly constellation mirrors both missing verses and ancient fossils beneath. Each tightening raises the social and spiritual cost until the final spiral unmoors. Gideon’s decision, not luck, forecloses the path; coincidence merely complicates. The volcano’s final lullaby feels coerced by the duo’s acceptance rather than random beneficence.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—silent liberation—signaled in paragraph two. Escalation tightens once: blackout nullifies electrical surge, forcing geometric improvisation. Cost is visible in the empty holder and the hush that swallows Serah’s smile. Agency drives every turn; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—fulfill the childhood promise to eels—is signaled early and escalates via each stone placement; misalignment would unleash a snarling future. One decisive tightening: final stone locks pattern, trading perpetual drift for restored friction. Cost is felt in the sudden rasp of ordinary breath.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—honest articulation of pain—tightens with each tick; the envelope’s discovery deepens rather than resolves, forcing a crystallized stance. Cost is legible: he forfeits editorial approval and carries unshareable maps next to his ribs.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—who will “conduct” the overture—is signaled by the card’s placement. Escalation is accumulative: each philosophical thrust physically repositions the card, tightening the alignment until the sundial sings. Cost is the mutual surrender of sole authorship; the portal demands co-discovery. No coincidence resolves; the beam is earned by their final accord.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can outlaw language rebuild a ruined refuge?—tightens when sirens cough and citizens drift in; the single deepening beat (Mira’s whistle calling the crowd) visibly raises the cost of exposure yet forecloses retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—surprise fate with an unplanned encore—is signaled early and tightened when trains delay themselves under the final chord. Escalation is accumulative: each reel fragment, compass flicker, and arbor gust adds pressure until the platform performance crystallizes stance. Cost is legible in the collective breath of commuters and the missed schedule chimes.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will the island remember before rain erases everything—tightens via each artifact recovered; luminous doubt escalates into the irreversible choice to sail. Cost is legible: the checker must leave the ridge unguarded to keep memory alive.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—finding the color—tightens through each pruning and compass turn; the mist’s refusal to stay raises the price of silence. One deepening suffices, but the cost is more atmospheric than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen coherently as Mara's dust demonstration transforms Jonah's "raze the greenhouse" urgency into active collaboration, but the moral calculus lacks competing goods—Jonah's insurance forms never genuinely threaten the seedlings' survival.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.1)
    Single tightening via hunters' approach as frost reveals text. Cost legible in "arrows clattered" physical danger and "fragile flame" metaphor. Agency-driven escape route using shadows fulfills Accumulative escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate through protagonist's agency: frequency choices narrow options until the final trade-off (body as buffer); visible cost ("molten snow" pain) reweights the conservatory's survival under Accumulative pressure without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten when sirens trigger nerves, but the grandmother moment is the sole option foreclosure. Escalation under Accumulative lens works, though the sanctions' pressure could deepen tactics earlier beyond scarcity lamps.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation via density increase (petals → sparks → memories) under Accumulative lens; cost unmistakable as regrets transform into constellations, altering Lysander's stance with visible trade-off (pain for revelation).

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (preserving time's texture) tightens through Quillon's agency—using design knowledge to "step sideways" under garden's pressure. Cost crystallizes viscerally in heartbeat syncing with hollow clock.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes deepen via sensory escalation (distant artillery → masonry thunder), but "wall comes down" timing lacks active complication of vault access; pressure tightens sufficiently under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes deepen through Jarom’s agency as he gathers absences to imprint silence, with the forge’s price (lost chromatic hearing) creating irreversible trade-offs, though the escalation from "desperate" to decision lacks one palpable tightening beat before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation via accumulating sensory pressure (whistles → prophecies) narrows options until jar opening becomes inevitable. Cost is legible in Mara’s hollowed chest, but the dominant stake (trading moments) resolves without tangible tradeoff—releasing moments feels passive rather than a hard-won choice.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes deepen through environmental pressure: melting ice both enables work ("ice outside finally melting") and threatens it ("treacherous tricks"). Agency shines as Mira repurposes abandonment into creation, but the single tightening lacks a visible forfeiture; cost is felt (emotional thaw) rather than dramatized as a lost opportunity.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation via net unraveling perfectly tightens the dominant stake (grounding spirit before silence numbs all), with each knot releasing memories that heighten pressure.

Agency manifests as endurance, but pressure accumulation feels inevitable rather than contested under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (resilience vs. despair) tightens causally: Ellan’s memory trade enables communal sacrifice, foreclosing passivity when "skepticism cracked."

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes ("unmake borders and children") signaled early but remain abstract; escalation via density increase (ink→ripples→maps) deepens knowledge under Accumulative lens. Cost ("deeper silence") legible yet lacks visceral weight—prophecy's danger feels conceptual rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (quarantined memory) signaled early via legends. Escalation is Mara's deepening engagement: shell's whispers peak doubt, then resonance structures force memory confrontation, narrowing options to archive or carry.

    Escalation driven by Marlo's agency under Accumulative lens: releasing stolen fragments into ghost's cavity narrows options while reweighting "regret" as currency. Cost unmistakable in cavity closure and lagoon's renewed rotation.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stake (resurrecting hope through plumbing) tightens when Milo trusts "drips over quarrelling schematics." Agency clear in conduit splicing, but cost – though physical – lacks sufficient emotional weight in peak beat. Sugar-water's viscosity waking pumps shows earned consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes (making peace with abandoned dream) clear early, but escalation lacks protagonist agency under Accumulative lens. Mother memory resolves conflict coincidentally rather than through earned deepening of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: choosing documentation over escape ("Instead I tied the box...") directly triggers station master confrontation. Cost manifests as visible transformation into legend, though company threat remains slightly off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen when weavers redefined as "instructions," narrowing options to guardianship. Protagonist agency drives escalation: decoding rope enables fulgurite discovery, with cost legible in "pledge felt like germination... roots gripping my ribs." Lacks one visible price altering tactics mid-beat for 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake ("disappearance was the realm's currency") tightens through Selene's revelations into midnight's crystallized vanishing. Holt's agency in writing ("tentative longitude") and her correction ("sorrow must border hope") drive escalation under Accumulative lens; cost is visceral in frost filming the bench and paired ghost-breaths, unmistakable at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (reawakening beauty) tightens meaningfully as gears flower and palace tremors escalate. Oriven’s agency drives escalation—speaking to egg, addressing workers—under Accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable: "stalactite anchors cracked" as beauty/ruin braid. Single deepening (hatching → descent) suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes signaled early ("paradox the town whispered"); deepening via pilgrim ritual narrows options to single crystallizing choice. Agency in threading coin over scar creates visible cost (tingling recognition), reweighting "unyielding compassion" as lived tactic rather than abstract concept.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.0)
    Geese countdown creates live clock narrowing options—bell-ringing agency forces trade-off (summon rain vs. winter’s freeze). Cost is visceral: seasonal urgency makes liberation feel earned, not coincidental, under accumulative/textural escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation under Accumulative lens is masterful: Elinon's deepening realization that calm "seals loops" drives her agency to misalign the gear, narrowing options with felt cost ("change can bruise"). The single tightening forecloses pure transmission, though the conceptual price isn't physically dramatized beyond her reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (materializing collective grief) escalates through Len's walks, with the butterfly migration imposing a live clock. Cost manifests in emotional labor ("carved through three nights"), though internal conflict could deepen the trade-off between solitude and communal healing.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Elias's agency (speaking truth) under Accumulative lens, with visceral cost in "heart paused." Tide's rise forces the Clara confession, narrowing options meaningfully for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (resolving buried regrets) tightens via tapestry visions, but escalation lacks Milo's active struggle; pressure accumulates texturally yet cost stays abstract during resewing.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (prevent coup via innovation) escalates through Estra's agency: predictive model tightens options to 30 words, writing alters reality. Cost is unmistakable—new ignorance sprouts as direct consequence. Coincidence (blizzard) complicates but doesn't resolve; constraint shapes every tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation driven by Mila's agency: signal fading forces embedding stories in city sounds, narrowing options from broadcast reliance to permanent dispersal. Visible cost in exhausted return and signal's fragility makes stakes viscerally felt under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake ("crystallize emotion before dawn") tightens through hesitation and physical trembling. Cost legible in "stitch old griefs anew," but lacks visible trade-off (e.g., time vs. perfection) to reach 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully when descent forces collaboration, narrowing options from solitary quest to shared custody. Conceptual cost (abandoning narrative purity) is legible but slightly abstract; physical constraints like mud-choked stairs deepen escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes escalate through Mara’s agency: "subtracting noise" deepens pressure by forcing debaters to suppress retorts. Cost is felt in "arguments dissolved not in defeat but in resonance." Dominant stake (vanishing arts) tightens via council confrontation, but secondary pressure (sirens/slogans) lacks on-page testing beyond Doyle’s nod.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes escalate through Moira’s pruning agency under Accumulative lens—removing "taste of betrayal" narrows options to communal nourishment, with visible cost in her silent departure. Time pressure from celestial alignment tightens tactics, though drought/war backdrop lacks on-page complication beyond setting.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (restore power) signaled immediately; escalation via ampoule alarms forcing truth declaration narrows options meaningfully, though the blackout's personal stakes could deepen beyond civic duty.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation via Accumulative lens: failed displacement (swan movement) deepens stakes before "sanctify" reweights options. Cost is visceral in the charred wishbone—a concrete artifact of past loneliness that alters Mara's understanding, making the house's "mute" state legible through physical evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake ("Can certainty hold kindness?") tightens via ampoule’s mechanics, forcing Aios’s precise action ("letting only a thread escape"). Cost is legible in statues’ fragility ("stone eyelids cracked; bronze veins lit"). Pressure deepens through revelation density rather than causal turns, fitting Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes deepen through Marlen's agency: the shift from demanding reversal to accepting texture ("Could a number reveal feel?") narrows options under Accumulative lens, with cost unmistakable in his weeping and the erased sums' "numbers lost voice."

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (proving kindness remembered) tightens via brush’s luminescent script → citywide impact. Agency clear in air-painting; cost (physical collapse) alters tactics (rinsing brush, sleeping). Single deepening suffices, but moon’s "dawn" dimming slightly softens price.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten when the lens reveals fading initials (visible cost), driving Iclea's agency toward bread-making; the "dripping wax" image transforms abstract fear into irreversible loss under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency as tower shudders with each correction; cost manifests in "liberty bore loneliness" and "echoes of paths she no longer owned," foreclosing alternate timelines with felt emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes tighten through Eli's agency (unbosoming, dictionary use), but fear's vulnerability to "vanity" feels slightly convenient under Accumulative pressure. Cost legible via breastplate's bursting and void.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation via sensory density (wind scratches threatening chaos) deepens the dominant stake organically; Mira's agency in rewiring turbulence into counterpoint forecloses safety with visible cost (cracking driftwood slabs chiming like bells), perfectly fitting the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.5)
    Stakes tighten when reed whistle sings forbidden note, shuddering turtles and revealing Elyth's coordinates. Cost is conceptual—accepting expedition "waiting for right question"—forcing descent alone. Agency clear: hand-spirals prompt mirror response; "hunger" at erased patterns slightly abstracts peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes tighten through Mira's agency: her parallel-drawing method forces the caretaker's reversal, with visible cost in "mold flourishing on walls of history" made concrete by digital dissemination.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes (memory vs. erasure) tighten through Accumulative escalation: note-placing deepens to lockbox discovery, each beat narrowing options. Agency-driven (he chooses to open box), cost legible when "pavilion wrested a burden." Minor deduction for tide's role slightly overshadowing protagonist's active choices.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten when floodgates fail—"pressure sought new paths" narrows options to stamp-or-drown. Agency shines as Maris lifts codex *then* stamps, but blackout coincidence slightly muddies situational pressure escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation driven by Lyra's agency selecting brother's spindle despite searing pain; cost crystallizes in "pain restrained is pain multiplied" with stakes reweighted when cranes "craved an exit to the night."

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation driven by Ashraf’s agency narrows options to one live choice—surrendering the geode—with visible cost (extinguishing his bride’s symbol), but the "singular node" threat lacks sufficient causal tightening beyond the final crater confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (decoding belonging) deepens organically via matrix chip progression; cost crystallizes in "hollow answer" and drained lanterns, but timeframe pressure ("after arrival") lacks live-clock urgency to tighten decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Elias's agency as he follows the watch hand's tick, with the dominant stake (truth vs. fabrication) narrowing to the ledger's revelation. Cost is unmistakable in his career renunciation, though the cave discovery leans slightly on coincidence under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes deepen texturally through moon-phase ritual, but the conceptual cost of "steady weight" remains slightly abstract; pressure tightens via untying silver twine yet lacks visceral escalation for 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation driven purely by Gideon’s agency: compass failure → storm confrontation → memory-triggered choice, with lightning strike complicating (not resolving) stakes; cost legible in "willing punishment" to "fragile grin thrown across failure’s surface."

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    Escalation via lake visions deepens dominant stake (empathy vs. relapse), but "impossible pitch" metaphor over-explains the empathy leap, slightly diluting the protagonist-driven cost legibility in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes tighten through Liora’s agency: splitting magic "like bread" forecloses full human return for both, with visible cost in halted transformation. Spice ritual’s escalation reweights reunion as coexistence, not restoration, under Accumulative lens with felt price in "galaxies blossoming inside our chests."

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes intensify through memory accumulation in saucer, but "lost time settles where forgiveness is heavier than guilt" lacks visceral escalation; cost (surrendered memories) charges the final image decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.8)
    Escalation driven purely by Griffin’s agency under Accumulative lens: his "stitching" intensifies density until self-forgiveness reconfigures reality. Cost is unmistakable—"liberation hoarded becomes another weapon" alters tactics in the final gesture to silhouettes.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes deepen through Gideon’s tactile test of transformation’s "texture," narrowing options when the volcano’s plume diverts sideways—a pressure shift driven by his stance crystallization under Accumulative escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.3)
    Blackout tightens options meaningfully—initially a barrier, then catalyst for timing—driving Serah’s agency to repurpose the sundial; cost crystallizes in silent dispersal replacing expected triumph, narrowing stakes to pure consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes tighten credibly through stone misalignment risks, yet the dust's mid-ritual vibration guiding Aikan weakens protagonist agency by introducing near-coincidental resolution pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes (truth-telling under censorship) tighten through timer ticks accumulating traumatic memories; agency-driven escalation peaks when voice breaks *then* discovers map. Cost is unmistakable in stitching envelope into coat—"perhaps never, perhaps tomorrow"—reweighting options under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    Pressure accumulates via blade movements shifting the card, but the conceptual cost of collaboration emerges too late to fully charge mid-duel escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency: Rook’s word-seed scattering deepens pressure as sirens approach, narrowing options to collective action. Dominant stake (rebuilding with words vs. silent oppression) tightens through sensory accumulation ("murmuring shelves," "tide" of people), with visible cost in parole numbers stamped on library cards.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stake (defying time's tyranny) tightens meaningfully when Clarion threads the film reel, with cost legible in "trains delayed themselves, brakes sighing." His agency drives escalation from descent to piano placement, all under "horizon invites night" pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes tighten via monsoon deadline, but protagonist agency remains passive—dreams dictate actions until final question to the shoot. Late escalation (asking if seed remembers futures) barely qualifies as meaningful tightening under Accumulative lens; cost feels external rather than earned through choice.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten through Yun's pruning-triggered compass alignment, narrowing options to descent; cost legibility falters as emotional price remains diffuse despite memory resurfacing, missing 8.8+ band guardrail.
