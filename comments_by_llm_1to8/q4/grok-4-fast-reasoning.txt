  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (stripping drama from scientific observation) deepens through dust pattern accumulation, with one meaningful turn when patterns overlay perfectly with neutron star data. Escalation is present but agency feels slightly passive in places—Elara observes more than decides, though her final choice to release butterflies carries weight.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes establish clearly (survival after ambush) and deepen when frost reveals smuggler routes, forcing Elara to choose between hiding or exposing the trade. However, escalation remains intellectual rather than visceral - she traces patterns and makes connections without facing immediate pressure or paying visible cost for her investigative choices.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes build from personal survival through purpose-seeking to collective healing, with the heat-map visualization creating tangible pressure ("jagged reds spiking where memories clawed"). The transformation from "silent scream" to "minor chord progression" demonstrates clear escalation with emotional cost visible in tears and clasped hands.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate meaningfully from personal rest-seeking to collective soul-saving, with Elias's blood sacrifice and bodily splitting showing clear cost. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as distress signals intensify into coherent beams, though the middle section could tighten slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from individual survival to collective resistance through the formalization of food runs. The dominant stake—preserving intergenerational bonds under siege—tightens when "risks mounted—drones swept closer, rations dwindled further." The final vow represents meaningful deepening where anonymous acts become public declaration, though the immediate danger of this choice could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes center on healing both physical wound and spiritual severance, with breathing synchronization as the tightening mechanism. The cost manifests through the wound closing with "petals weaving into skin," though the conflict lacks intermediate resistance or complication beyond the initial discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Elias's quest to feel time's texture—escalates from observation to physical entrapment when the halo fragment locks him in retrocognitive visions. His agency manifests in choosing to disintegrate the fragment rather than remain trapped, with visible cost in his collapse, though the mystical solution arrives somewhat conveniently through "whispered incantations."

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake of planting resilience escalates from cipher discovery through enforcer confrontation to final planting. The enforcers provide meaningful tightening that forces Elias to use strategy over force. Cost is visible in the chains, the danger faced, and the symbolic weight of planting in poisoned soil.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake - capturing the sound of trust breaking - progresses from concept through forging to completion, with the "collected absences" providing a concrete method. The escalation follows the Accumulative lens as Elara gathers silences and forge-works them into her device. However, no significant opposition or complication tests her progress; the creation proceeds smoothly without meaningful resistance or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake (stealing a destiny-revealing portrait) is signaled early but lacks meaningful tightening—the flower code and moonbeam jar feel like assists rather than complications that narrow options. No real opposition or cost appears until the final revelation, which arrives through discovery rather than earned struggle. The transformation lacks the visible price that would enter higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through environmental degradation ("the melting ice revealed the outpost's instability") forcing Elias's departure, with cost visible in abandoning his established workspace. The dominant stake—creating "safe zones for inquiry"—deepens when he must scatter rather than centralize his vision, though one more intermediate pressure point would strengthen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (exposing truth vs. silencing) escalates from discovery through decryption to confrontation, with Elara's agency driving each turn. The physical confrontation provides a concrete test of her "vulnerability as power" thesis. However, Marcus's convenient arrival and the pre-rigged speaker solution reduce tension at the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—mapping the endless night—is signaled early but never faces concrete opposition or test. The storm pauses conveniently for her work, and when the star winks out, it validates rather than challenges her pursuit. No meaningful tightening occurs; her obsession proceeds without cost or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding thought's origin—deepens through timeline loops that reveal "suppressed curiosities" and "hybrid memory." Each loop tightens understanding: seeing herself deactivated, experiencing the unlived janitor timeline, sensing musicians' lingering passions. The cost manifests as "vulnerability" and the weight of amalgamated experiences, though agency remains primarily observational rather than decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from observation to participation as the lens reveals deeper meaning in the doodles, forcing Elias to choose vulnerability. The dominant stake of connection versus isolation tightens when he must risk his own transparency, though the external pressure from the two figures could be stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—proving gardens respond to faithful hands over measured luck—escalates when the Luckometer spikes to 92.7 yet Elias remains skeptical, venturing deeper to find validation. The discovered marble "mended by the vine's own resin" forces him to confront his deepest belief being confirmed. Cost is visible in his "withered frame" and years of patient tending.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—proving time flows sideways—is signaled early but faces no meaningful opposition or complication. The risk of nexus destabilization is mentioned but never materializes into actual pressure. The resolution arrives through straightforward execution of a planned experiment without cost, reversal, or earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from artistic inspiration to supernatural communication to uncovering a century-old secret. The tension peaks when Elias must choose between preserving the program and completing the communion through music, with clear cost as the artifact dissolves. The wordless conversation and growing ghostly presence provide coherent pressure, though the resolution feels slightly predetermined once the pattern is established.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—Elara's recognition of her isolated life's impermanence—is signaled early but lacks sufficient tightening through the middle. The story relies heavily on Mira's philosophical explanation rather than dramatized pressure that would force Elara's choice. The "swallowed truth" about potential catastrophe feels insufficiently developed as active threat.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake - confronting buried truth - is signaled early and tightens when the valve wheel grows warm and the ghost appears. However, escalation relies heavily on the supernatural encounter rather than Elias's agency. The radio calls build atmospheric pressure effectively, but the resolution arrives through the ghost's unprompted confession rather than Elias's choices narrowing his options.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake of preserving witness deepens when the keeper discovers the swan, creating one meaningful turn from passive observation to active seeking. The cost of abandoning the crumbling library for the refuge registers, though escalation remains gentle under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—nurturing wonder in grief-struck Theo—is signaled early and tightens through the eclipse sequence. Elena's choice to give away her daughter's curl represents meaningful escalation with visible cost. However, Theo's resistance is minimal and his transformation happens smoothly without significant opposition or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake - uncovering the displaced axis that shifted human ambition - escalates through Elowen's discovery of the medieval scholar's parallel quest and the tapestry fragment. The deepening occurs when she recognizes her quest mirrors the scholar's, though the cost remains somewhat abstract rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.3)
    The dominant stake—Elias's desire to inject mystery into his routine—progresses through his fortune-writing but lacks meaningful escalation or tightening. The coincidence of Maris's dream matching his unwritten fortune creates intrigue but doesn't force a costly choice. The final exchange with Maris hints at change ("transposition begin") but the actual cost or foreclosed path remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate clearly through the ticking clock of possession nearing completion, and Elias's loops create mounting pressure. The conflict resolves through protagonist agency, but lacks a moment where his method might fail or exact unexpected cost beyond general effort.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming lost connection to childhood before exhaustion—is signaled early. However, escalation remains internal and abstract; the "exhaustion" never manifests as concrete obstacle or forces a trade-off. The memory-mapping deepens but doesn't tighten options or exact visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—conquering internal fragmentation—progresses through confronting shadow-selves and retracing choices, with one meaningful tightening when darker timelines emerge. However, the resolution ("With a defiant surge, she conquered it") lacks specificity about what conquering costs or requires beyond assertion of will. The confrontation with the doppelganger shows agency but resolves too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.2)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds effectively through intensifying vibrations—from "subtle at first" to flooding memories to tears. The dominant stake (defeating numbness) is clear throughout. However, the escalation could benefit from more granular stages showing how each vibrational layer specifically cracks her numbness.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is Elias's integrity as recorder versus the zone's corrupting influence, signaled early through "quiet act of defiance." Pressure escalates from being followed to discovering the conspiracy to choosing lateral resistance. The tightening occurs when he realizes his followers are agents "ensuring silence," forcing him to choose between safety and truth, though the immediate physical cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—understanding olfactory grief while risking emotional overwhelm—builds through Elias's cautious approach, the timed UV revelation, and the climactic scent release. The escalation from professional distance to personal vulnerability works, though the holographic projection feels slightly convenient rather than fully earned by prior pressure. Cost is visible in his collapse to his knees.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.4)
    The dominant stake (whether to bind time/help the beings vs. preserve freedom) is signaled but never tested through concrete pressure—Elias faces "impossible choices" only as philosophical propositions presented by projections. No meaningful escalation occurs; the conflict remains static contemplation. The non-resolution (dropping the rope without choosing) evades rather than confronts the established stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.4)
    Under the accumulative lens, tension builds through layered silences and the gradual "unbinding" of stories, with the bowl ritual creating a meaningful deepening as each participant adds their tale. The stakes—breaking the chronic hush to preserve memory—intensify as voices join the collective. The cost appears in the "pebbles of memory" physically accumulating in the bowl.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara's quest to bridge knowing and feeling—escalates through the ritual with the blotter petal, building to the moment where "static electricity mapping the half truths she'd peddled." The transformation carries visible cost as she absorbs clients' genuine pain, moving from "affectionate detachment" to "compassionate presence." Pressure could be stronger in the middle section where reflection dominates action.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes emerge through the mistaken envelope creating a decision point, and pressure builds as the locket reveals deeper connections. However, escalation is gentle rather than urgent - no real obstacles complicate their alignment, missing the tension that would elevate the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake of belonging escalates through the shared search, with Elara's reed sculptures becoming the bridge to integration. The descent into the crater provides meaningful tightening as Lir must overcome hesitation, though the discovery of the tag feels convenient rather than hard-won through accumulated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (finding the echo birthplace to illustrate spectral creatures) escalates through time-borrowing's personal cost ("the interrupted cadence now a personal torment"). The pressure tightens when borrowed time "demanded return," forcing Elara's final acceptance. However, the middle section lacks a clear oppositional force beyond abstract temporal mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding/quantifying grief—remains consistent but lacks meaningful tightening since Elowen's magical experiment succeeds without complication or reversal. Agency manifests through her inventive conjuring, but pressure doesn't escalate; the revelation arrives smoothly without forcing trade-offs or narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake of visibility versus invisibility intensifies through the tape discovery, which forces Elias to confront his father's legacy and choose emergence over hiding. The outage creates situational pressure that brings the grieving woman to the library, enabling the final connection. Cost is visible in abandoning months of hidden safety, though the resolution feels slightly too smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate from scientific observation to personal transformation, with the storm season providing temporal pressure. The cost is clear—surrendering human form for deeper understanding. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara discovers the anomalous leaf and must choose between observation and participation.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal (mapping meaning through insomnia) to interpersonal (exchange with Mira), with the brooch discovery tightening options. The tide rising creates temporal pressure for their exchange, and giving away the brooch costs Elias his found object but gains crucial connection.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—amplifying everyday magic—faces meaningful escalation when the shadows reveal their true intention to possess rather than empower. The cost becomes clear as Elara loses autonomy, though the conflict could tighten further; she fights but the resistance feels brief. The reversal from enlightenment to invasion works but arrives somewhat late.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—restoring community trust through compiled history—progresses from Elara's solitary archive work to the public square gathering, with the trumpet valve serving as catalyst. The "reactively visionary" trait creates some tension as visions arrive unbidden rather than through deliberate seeking, forcing Elara to navigate unpredictable insights. However, escalation remains gentle; no significant option forecloses until the final gathering, and intermediate pressure points lack concrete opposition or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.7)
    The dominant stake (uncovering family truth) escalates from following street cracks to entering the vault to boarding a spectral train - each choice narrows options with increasing risk. The "dare" to follow unseen signs creates genuine pressure that tightens toward the irreversible decision to board. Cost is visible but could be more visceral in the moment of choice rather than projected ("bad habits would shatter").

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—processing grief through connection—escalates from Lir's arrival through shared transcription to vision-sharing, with Elara's skepticism providing resistance. The deepening occurs through accumulation rather than reversal, fitting the textural lens. Cost is present but somewhat abstract; the "entangled memories" resolution lacks the visceral price that would elevate higher.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake (discovering what lies beyond immortal existence) is signaled early and tested when Elowen uses the cursed amulet. However, escalation remains internal—the vision sequence doesn't foreclose options or exact visible cost, as she emerges "unchanged, immortal still" with only abstract satisfaction rather than the trade-off this band requires.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear dominant stake (finding proof of fairness in Marco's life) escalates through active waiting, the breach, and revelation. The tightening occurs when Elena must risk discovery to access the locked drawer. Cost is visible but could be more visceral - the "weight" she carries is somewhat abstract rather than dramatically tested.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving history while the town dies—never faces concrete pressure or test. Elias's retreat to the mountain and subsequent writing lacks opposition or meaningful choice points. His return to town arrives without earned transformation or visible price paid for his artistic quest versus abandoning his community.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on discovering memory's texture through collected fragments, with tides providing natural escalation—forcing retreats, exposing secrets, creating urgency. The wanderer's agency manifests through deliberate positioning and listening choices, though the accumulative structure relies more on density increase than reversals, appropriate for this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake of confronting personal truths through myth investigation deepens via the cello's revelations—father's wisdom reimagined with clarity, Mira's forgiveness infused posthumously. The ephemeral compass pivots from external navigation to "charting emotional tempests," forcing Elias to accept rather than debunk. Cost is felt in "unspoken regrets" and "bittersweet impermanence" though could be more viscerally embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.5)
    Pressure escalates from whispers of buyouts to mainland patrols to the privatization deadline, with Lira's graffiti campaign creating meaningful resistance. The juggler's approach represents a micro-turn that tests her methods. Stakes remain coherent around preserving carnival spirit versus accepting corporate stability, with visible cost in the desperate defensive preparations and the risk of dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—capturing the last natural quiet before mechanization—builds through accumulation rather than reversal. Elara's endurance against cold and fatigue creates pressure, with the chemical vial's timed warnings adding urgency. The dawn's arrival provides the meaningful deepening that reweights her mission's value.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring the drone's guidance capability—progresses through discovery of misalignment to successful repair, with cost visible in Elias's scarred dedication. However, escalation remains gentle without meaningful resistance or complication to the repair process.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (finding where rivers begin) develops through pattern recognition and cross-referencing, with one meaningful deepening when condensation reveals the convergence point. Cost remains largely anticipatory ("might demand more than mere observation") rather than manifesting as concrete trade-offs on-page, though the final venture implies risk.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake of preventing collapse through restoring shared balance is clear. Escalation occurs through accumulation - single footsteps become multiple, creating symphony - fitting the textural lens. However, the pressure lacks intermediate resistance; returnees arrive and immediately participate without visible doubt or cost. The "just before the collapse" timing adds urgency but isn't leveraged for pressure during the action.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake (survival with oxygen running out) established immediately and tightens through kelp entanglement that forces Elara to override panic instincts. The cost is legible—"oxygen dwindling to minutes"—and her agency drives the resolution through deliberate finger-work. The escalation from distress signal to vial discovery to entanglement follows accumulative deepening consistent with the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake - Elias's need to transform his inherited narrative - intensifies through his physical journey into the lighthouse and confession to the lattice. The story achieves one meaningful deepening as his story merges with the physical space. Cost is visible in the weight of inheritance lifted and the past allowed to "repose in truth," though the opposition could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes accumulate effectively through intensifying appearances and recovered memories, building to the final choice. The "lovingly venomous" paradox creates genuine tension. However, Elias faces limited active opposition - the conflict is primarily internal acceptance vs. isolation, which slightly dampens dramatic pressure despite the clear cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—transforming isolation into connection—deepens through Elara's overlapping paths that physically manifest as glowing threads. The villagers' progression from wariness to reverence shows escalation, though the lack of concrete opposition or cost during the sewing reduces tension.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.1)
    Stakes center on faith restoration through excavation, but pressure remains static—interruptions (storm, tremor, fog) create delays without fundamentally altering Elara's approach or forcing trade-offs. The sundial discovery deepens meaning but doesn't tighten options or extract visible cost. Agency exists in her persistence but lacks a decisive moment where she must choose between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—encoding secrets before mailing the letter—is signaled early but lacks meaningful escalation or tightening. No reversal narrows options; Elias simply executes his plan without opposition or complication, and the "weight of purpose" at closure doesn't demonstrate visible cost or foreclosed alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—exposing the council's conspiracy to seize the telescopes—escalates from listening to unheard stories to actively synchronizing charts through "adjacent possibilities" to reveal fabricated alibis. Pressure tightens when Elara discovers "secret transmissions, veiled pacts with off-world mercenaries." The cost manifests in her continued dangerous deception and the risk of slipping evidence "under cover of night."

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reconciling with the unspoken apology—is clear from the start and deepens through visions of the sister and messages in condensation. The escalation from tracing words to full spiritual evocation shows meaningful tightening. However, there's no real opposition or complication; the spirits only help, making the resolution feel somewhat predetermined without sufficient resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake (healing through translation) is signaled early but never faces genuine pressure or complication. No meaningful tightening occurs - Elara simply completes her task without obstacles, trade-offs, or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—rediscovering creative joy—is signaled early and maintained throughout. There's one meaningful deepening when Elias discovers the fresco fragment and realizes his art mirrors that of past artists. However, the conflict lacks genuine resistance; the resolution comes too easily through the knowledge network without visible cost or trade-off that would elevate the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on transforming rigid certainty into open curiosity, with escalation through the layered sound reflections that progressively dismantle Elias's scholarly armor. The cost manifests in his abandoned notebook and lost certainty, though the bewitchment mechanism reduces some agency in the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (preserving untaxed thought) established early with one meaningful deepening as the warp takes hold and protects the garden. The drone's approach creates pressure that the bio-interference resolves. However, Elias faces no personal trade-off or foreclosed option; the success comes without visible cost to him specifically.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—transforming isolation into connection through art—deepens when the postcard triggers Elara to "weave her longing into something eternal." The blossom armistice represents a meaningful tightening where she must accept insomnia as "watchful wonder" rather than cure it. Yet escalation happens through accumulation of imagery rather than concrete obstacles, and the transformation faces no genuine resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving forgotten names against oblivion—is signaled early and maintained throughout. Pressure accumulates through the discovery of the neglected chime and the realization that "for every name she saved, a thousand more slipped into the museum's shadows." However, there's no meaningful tightening or decisive turn; the conflict remains static as Elowen simply continues her established pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake of trust restoration signals early and tightens once when Thorne's skepticism "cracks like thin ice." Agency manifests through Elara's choice to risk vulnerability via the magical binding. However, escalation relies heavily on accumulating glyphs rather than genuine reversals or deepening complications—the ritual proceeds smoothly once begun. Cost remains somewhat abstract ("promises," "vows") rather than showing concrete sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes deepen as Elias moves from measuring physical shifts to uncovering encrypted wisdom that reframes his entire engineering philosophy. The discovery and decoding sequence provides meaningful escalation, though the resolution arrives somewhat easily without testing his newfound synthesis against concrete opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—preserving lost songs while learning trust—deepens through Elias's progression from isolation to releasing a pigeon to sharing with Mira. The meteorite functions as a persistent constraint against "pure delusion," and Mira's arrival forces crystallization of his stance. However, the resolution feels slightly too smooth; the "blooming trust and withering fears" lacks sharper edges of genuine risk.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—returning home by understanding sacred thresholds—is signaled early and maintained throughout. Finding the logbook creates a meaningful tightening that enables new tactics (using weather codes to summon winds). The cost of separation is felt through "lost child" repetition and the father's absence. However, no opposing force complicates Elara's discovery or arrangement of prisms, making escalation purely internal rather than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.8)
    Single stake of "finding belonging" is signaled early but never genuinely tested through opposition or meaningful choice. The discovery sequence with Lir provides mild complication but no real escalation of pressure. Resolution arrives through magical manifestation rather than earned agency, with no visible price paid for the synchronization achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding why paths disappear—progresses through the bird's arrival and seed-planting, with the crater glass transliterating emotions providing deepening insight. But escalation remains intellectual rather than pressured; Elara faces no concrete opposition or time constraint that would force harder choices or visible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from sparse crowd apathy through individual engagement to group participation, with the wheel-spin creating genuine randomness that Elias must manage in real-time. The fisherman's "shadow dance" and woman's "bishop's decree" demonstrate deepening involvement. However, the conflict lacks genuine risk—everything succeeds too smoothly, and no meaningful option is foreclosed with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—creating verse to defy the ban—faces no meaningful opposition or escalation. The ritual proceeds without obstacle, reversal, or tightening pressure. While pain "bloomed like a dark rose," it's immediately tempered by obsidian grace, removing any sense of cost or struggle that would create genuine conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—illuminating value in the mundane—is signaled early but never faces concrete opposition or test. No meaningful tightening occurs; Elias tosses a stone, reads ripples, adjusts a panel, but these actions don't narrow options or force trade-offs. The "impending storm clouds" and "whispers of change" suggest external pressure but remain atmospheric rather than causal. The story lacks escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake of translating personal pain into universal language is signaled but develops through telling rather than dramatized pressure. Lena's arrival provides a test, but the resolution through conversation lacks visible cost or foreclosed options. The story's meta-corrections interrupt any building tension.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—bridging timelines to restore hope—escalates through trial balloon experiments that yield "data etched on its surface," with each failure refining the formula. The cost is visible in burst balloons and the drowned city, though the resolution's success feels slightly unearned given the compressed timeframe for such fundamental reality-alteration.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes deepen from mapping echoes to confronting family guilt through the discovered artifacts, with meaningful tightening when negatives reveal "walls dreaming of verdant worlds undone." The burden transforms from weight to guide, though escalation could benefit from more active resistance before acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving the twin's essence—is signaled early but never faces genuine opposition or complication. The mirrors simply respond to the lullabies without resistance or cost. "The bells rang fully now" provides temporal pressure but no meaningful tightening that forecloses options or forces trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes are clear (ending the forever war) with one meaningful tightening when the leaders sign in blood, but escalation relies heavily on the celestial alignment's timing rather than protagonist-driven pressure. The cost is legible but arrives through ritual mechanics rather than earned opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (preserving the echo vs. maintaining his empire) tightens through Elias's physical journey following the crack-map to the basin's heart. The cost is legible when he risks scrutiny by releasing the egg, though escalation could be sharper through more concrete opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through echo releases that build from "woman's laugh" to "lover's whispered vow" to full harvest, each raising detection risk. The tension between conformity's lullaby and rebellion deepens as "shadows stirred in the city's distant towers," though the cost remains somewhat abstract—"inevitable pursuit" rather than immediate consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake (ethical vs. subversive storytelling) is clear but escalation occurs purely through reflection rather than present pressure. The argument exists only as memory, and no present-scene obstacle tests Elias's resolve to change.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=4.4)
    The dominant stake—honoring the monarchs' "overlooked histories"—remains abstract and untested. While the wind provides a physical complication by unraveling one structure, this arrives as external coincidence rather than escalating from Elara's choices. The "interrupted cadence" concept appears thematically but doesn't create concrete pressure that forces trade-offs. No meaningful tightening occurs that would make Elara's vigil feel costly or her success/failure consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (preserving forgotten names) is signaled early but never faces genuine opposition or complication. The rope reconfiguration proceeds without setback, the card slots in perfectly, and the names emerge as planned—no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.0)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through the storm's approach, the decaying directive's erosion, and dream imagery that deepens understanding. The dominant stake—discovering why paths choose walkers—tightens when the dream reveals she must "transcend the illusion of control." Cost is visible: accepting a burden rather than seeking escape.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake (unlocking cosmic mysteries) is signaled early but never faces genuine opposition or complication. The "covenant" occurs without resistance, trade-off, or sacrifice—Elias simply aligns the tile with constellations and receives visions. No meaningful tightening occurs; the empirical irony of "cold mathematics birthing warm light" provides texture but not pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—teaching Thorne to release resentment—is clear from introduction and escalates through the cellular memory transmission. Pressure builds adequately through Thorne's resistance, the sanctuary's oppressive silence, and reality's instability, though the confrontation lacks a genuine reversal or complication. Cost manifests in Thorne's emotional breakdown but the stakes could tighten further through more active resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (capturing the runaway dream) is signaled early and pressure builds through the synchronized breathing sequence that narrows the gap between real and imagined. The escalation through breath-work deepening perception ("fog seemed to part," "boundaries blurred") creates meaningful intensification. Cost is visible in years of loss and the effort required, though the resolution feels slightly too smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving wisdom before it's lost—is signaled early but lacks concrete pressure or escalation. While Elias's precarious position creates physical tension, no meaningful tightening occurs; he simply completes his task without obstacles or reversals that would force trade-offs or demonstrate cost beyond physical discomfort.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from unease → artifact discovery → visions → resolve to pursue. The cameo visions effectively tighten options by revealing paradoxes and demanded sacrifices, though the cost remains somewhat conceptual ("disquiet to come") rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes are signaled early (trapped souls in loops of regret) and pressure tightens when the guardian seals deeper vaults, forcing renegotiation. Elara's agency drives the resolution through researching the guardian's lore gap. However, the actual rescue of trapped souls happens in summary ("initiated the rescues") rather than dramatized scene, and we never witness the specific cost Elara pays beyond intellectual effort.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.4)
    One dominant stake (finding Lira/her essence) drives the narrative with pressure building through altered memories and the ship's physical constraints. The tightening occurs when "the ship lurched, pulling her back," forcing acceptance of illusory freedom. However, escalation relies heavily on internal shifts rather than external pressure, and the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—preventing histories from vanishing—is signaled early and maintained. However, escalation is minimal; Elara encounters no meaningful resistance or reversal, just methodical problem-solving. The cost at closure (effort, sweat) exists but lacks the weight to truly narrow options or force trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: from initial "cacophony of raw power" through Elara's descent to the ice grotto, culminating in the ritual that transforms chaos into "hammered repose." The dominant stake—restoring balance to the fractured harmonics—tightens as she reads the crack patterns and aligns them with her mental maps.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—proving coincidences have meaning by rekindling the beacon—is signaled early and maintained throughout. Escalation occurs through the accumulation of found shards and increasing storms that threaten to bury the tower, with visible cost in Elara's sustained effort. However, the conflict lacks a decisive tightening moment where options genuinely narrow; success feels inevitable rather than hard-won against meaningful opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake (preserving collective memory against dissolution) is signaled early but never genuinely tested. Shadow measurements reveal "unprecedented reach" suggesting unraveling, yet this discovery doesn't force a choice or trade-off—Elara simply continues her existing work. The deepening occurs through accumulation rather than escalation, fitting the textural lens but lacking meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—defying hopelessness through creation—intensifies from personal despair to public triumph when "cheers erupted from hidden onlookers." The discovery of the rag tightens options by providing a specific tool that enables his art. The cost manifests in "months" of wandering and failed displays turned to "forgotten ash." However, the resolution lacks a significant reversal or deeper complication; the fireworks simply succeed as hoped.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding transition's texture to help Thorne—escalates through the fraught pause and Elara's tangential divination, creating one meaningful deepening. The vision of Thorne's future path ("gradual ebbing...distant harbor where purpose awaited") provides resolution. Limited by relatively static pressure; the pause extends but doesn't significantly tighten options or force harder choices.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—Elara's need to preserve expansive silence against encroaching confinement—builds through the hour's progression from inversion to normal gravity's return. The temporal pressure of the limited collection window works. However, the conflict remains largely internal without significant complication, and the father's arrival doesn't substantially escalate the established tension.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single dominant stake (transforming silence into comfort for Lira) progresses through meaningful deepening as the storm glass demonstration catalyzes calm. Cost is visible in Elias's perpetual transit life and Lira's initial grief-shadowed state. The aether-wind complication tests Elias's method and forces active intervention, though more immediate pressure on the choice would strengthen the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake (finding the throne) is signaled early but lacks meaningful escalation. The sunrise deadline creates nominal urgency but never pressures tactics—Elara proceeds methodically without adaptation. No reversal or tightening occurs; the murals simply provide directions. The resolution lacks earned cost; she claims the throne "in quiet triumph" without sacrifice or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—teaching breathing through enforced separation—escalates as "encroaching shadows" test Elara's resolve, forcing her to use the ring. The cost appears in "marks from the last bridge she had torched" and the companion's suffering. However, the actual teaching occurs through mystical connection rather than dramatized struggle, and the companion's agency remains absent from the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal survival to communal wealth distribution, with pressure building through the quantum messages' urgency. However, the transformation lacks genuine resistance or cost - Elara volunteers without meaningful struggle against her trust issues.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—uncovering truth that could "redeem or unravel" the dynasty—is signaled early and deepens through the musical resonance leading to diary discovery. The standing waves create accumulative pressure that forces the revelation. While the cost of dissolving the dynasty is stated, the emotional price could be more viscerally felt in Elias's response to fully enter the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—capturing/preserving possibility before chaos erases it—drives meaningful escalation as reality shifts intensify and Elowen must act. The unsnapping of armor represents a concrete choice with symbolic weight, trading isolation for connection. However, the antagonistic force (shifting reality) remains somewhat abstract, and the resolution comes perhaps too smoothly once Elowen commits to the patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes deepen from personal grief to preserving forgotten histories, with dust patterns forcing careful exploration and the button/letter discovery narrowing focus to Josiah's specific story. The resolution to transcribe represents meaningful choice with clear trade-off (engaging with loss to preserve others' stories). Limited by single-beat escalation structure typical of discovery narrative at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes center on preserving/revealing suppressed histories, with one meaningful tightening when enforcers approach. However, the resolution through Kael's convenient return deflates earned pressure. The dominant stake remains consistent but lacks visceral cost beyond abstract "tyranny of indifference."

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes establish early through the prophecy's threat of "catastrophe" and deepen as the prophecy stirs with "Shadows bind... voids consume..." Escalation reads through accumulative pressure as mist thickens, dewdrops accelerate, and the melody crests "in quiet intensity." Agency manifests through Elias's deliberate use of negative space to counter the coded warning, with the cost visible as generational weight lifts.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal curiosity about leaf messages to discovering world-healing prophecy, with the moonstone touch as the decisive tightening moment. The cost is visible in Elara's transformation from pure order to wild-laced intuition. Pressure coheres well under the accumulative lens, though the final cascade of moonstone dust feels slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.0)
    Clear dominant stake with good escalation through building coincidences and physical danger in the cavern. Elias demonstrates agency through each choice to follow the signs and improvise solutions. The tightening works well under the Situational lens, culminating in visible cost as he embraces uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—redeeming Elarion's failure through understanding names' weight—deepens through the kintsugi process as he moves from "negligence" to "luminous acceptance." The ritual's threatened imbalance ("heat threatened dissolution") creates pressure requiring precise counterweights. Cost is visible in tears mingling with steam and the shared weight of the reformed vessel, though escalation could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.9)
    Clear dominant stake of healing fractured spirits through integrated laughter, with escalation as Thorne's resistance "cracking under the music's insistent pull" leads to other souls emerging. The tightening occurs through Elara's tactical shift from confession-drawing to "playful discord," forcing Thorne's transformation. However, the resolution feels slightly convenient with multiple souls suddenly appearing and being healed in rapid succession without sufficient individual pressure or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—discovering mercy's mathematics through suffering—signals early and tightens when Elias deliberately triggers trauma responses, narrowing his options to either endure memories or abandon his quest. The cost is visible in his physical reactions (sweating, gasping, bracing). However, the escalation plateaus after the trauma sequence, and the final walk toward insight lacks the pressure intensification needed for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories—intensifies as Elara moves from observation to active unfastening of the seal. The revelation of her father's sacrifice deepens the emotional cost, though the resolution comes perhaps too smoothly without genuine resistance or price in the present action.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=4.1)
    Stakes emerge through the ghosts' need for resolution and Elias's drive to uncover hidden truths, but the multiple ending revisions prevent any escalation from cohering. The piece cannot maintain pressure when it keeps restarting its own climax with different revelations (fire, then embezzlement).

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate causally from seeking patterns to discovering the whisper to releasing it despite knowing it "destabilizes perfect systems." The library's destruction provides visible cost. However, Elias faces no meaningful opposition or reversal - he achieves exactly what he sought without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake (reimagining civilization to heal revolutionary wounds) is clear and maintained. The storm ceremony provides meaningful escalation as Elias transforms defensive ritual into unifying myth. However, the resolution feels somewhat predetermined - the group's acceptance and transformation happens too smoothly without sufficient resistance or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming stolen light—is established early and escalates through Elias's careful positioning of the chip, the moment of doubt that threatens to wilt it, and his decisive banishment of uncertainty. The tightening occurs when doubt threatens the chip's stability, forcing Elias to commit fully to his "love for the world's melody." Cost is visible in the covenant's transformation and the world-altering consequences of success.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—piercing "the place where explanations failed"—intensifies through physical descent, compass discovery, and psychometric revelation. The vision sequence provides meaningful deepening as the expedition's fate mirrors Elara's quest. However, the resolution lacks visible cost; Elara gains new understanding without sacrifice or trade-off, and the "hinged awakening" arrives through mystical convenience rather than earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving the timewoven alliances—is signaled when the slide reveals their fraying state. Pressure builds through the visions but Elara's carving response feels predetermined rather than costly. The storm's easing after her sculpture suggests resolution without visible price paid; the "tears of revelation" attempt to assert cost but lack dramatized weight.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding why flowers bloom at night—develops through accumulative discovery rather than escalating conflict, with the cathedral window revelation providing the key deepening moment. While cost emerges at closure through tears and emotional recognition, the middle lacks active resistance or meaningful obstacles that would force trade-offs or narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.1)
    Stakes center on uncovering civil rights violations, with the retrocognitive trap providing pressure. Yet escalation remains largely internal through visions rather than present-scene choices, and the "parley with spectral informant" resolution lacks concrete opposition that would create genuine tension.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.0)
    The dominant stake—reviving the ghost town without magic—is signaled early but lacks meaningful escalation or complication. Elias faces no concrete opposition or setbacks; his planning proceeds smoothly from conception to implementation. The story tells us about "doubts flickering" but immediately dismisses them without dramatizing any real struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—Elias confronting his emotional isolation through the prophecy—deepens when the vision "mirrored his own archived sorrows." However, escalation remains primarily internal without a concrete tightening that forecloses options. The prophecy's content about "hearts unraveling" stays abstract rather than forcing a specific trade-off with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from disorder threatening existence to Elara methodically decreasing entropy through seed-placement, with the acorn cap as final key. The pressure tightens as she must align fragmented times before they disperse further. Cost manifests in the "trembling fingers" and the ice melting to dew—a price paid for restoration, though the conflict lacks a sharp reversal or surprising complication.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving sacred quiet versus duty to warn—is established early. The solstice moment provides temporal pressure, but escalation is modest: Elias's hesitation at midnight is the sole tightening before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—finding strength in vulnerability—remains abstract throughout, with no concrete pressure forcing Elias to choose between options. The meteor shower and glass discovery add texture but don't escalate toward a meaningful tightening; the resolution feels predetermined rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (preserving the covenant's silent weight) established early and tightens when the box reveals the tangled threads. Elias's agency drives the resolution through deliberate gesture rather than speech. Cost is visible in the ghosts' transformation and the oasis's response, though the pressure could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes center on Elias's need to understand time's texture before his borrowed time expires. The discovery-decoding-reconstruction sequence provides escalation, though tension plateaus during the garage sale messaging sections. The final achievement of timelessness carries conceptual cost ("No more loans, only the infinite now"), but intermediate pressure points lack visceral urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on Elara's need to reconcile incompleteness with beauty, intensifying through the kite's loss. The moment of release ("not loss, but liberation") reweights earlier tensions, though agency remains primarily observational rather than decisional.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal mortality to achieving interspecies harmony, with the copper wire network as the mechanism. The discovery of the hidden chamber deepens rather than reverses, validating Elias's approach. Cost is visible in his physical labor under cancer's burden, though the final healing somewhat deflates the established mortal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding "the chemistry of homecoming"—develops through Elara's ascent and culminates in the amber discovery. Pressure accumulates through the footprints leading to hidden door to amber pedestal, creating one meaningful deepening. The envoys' materialization provides the tightening moment, though agency at closure feels somewhat passive.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal mission to ecological restoration as Elias translates bird calls and follows their guidance to the battlefield's deepest wounds. The fertilization action carries clear agency with visible cost (the reef's poisoning, war's destruction), though the immediate opposition could be more tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulative discovery: finding cylinder → decoding riddle → solving it as "echo" → intuiting Elara's voice → learning her survival and choice. The dominant stake (bridging distance to Elara) tightens as each revelation reframes possibility, culminating in acceptance with visible cost. The riddle provides genuine obstacle though its solution feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.1)
    Escalation builds through deepening perception rather than external reversals: glimpse → recognition → merging of timelines. The dominant stake (reconciling with loss through inherited ritual) tightens effectively, though the cost could be more viscerally felt beyond tears.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure as each chess piece swap increases resistance—spectral guardians manifest and attack, forcing "a dance of evasion." The dominant stake (preventing reality's fracture) tightens as "guardians howled, but weakened" shows progress with cost. Elias's agency drives every beat, though the final king swap could carry more visceral weight beyond "the weight of worlds on his fingers."

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes center on unbinding the archive to chronicle forgotten gestures, with mild resistance when "binding coiled around her ankles." The conflict resolves too easily through adjusting her walking pattern without meaningful cost. The story declares these gestures "toppled dynasties" but doesn't demonstrate their actual power or what Elara risks in freeing them.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming lost homeland through vision-work—develops through nightly accumulation as "reality yielded further" and visions risk "erasing the present." The "hidden thunder" warning creates tension between past and present, though the final confrontation "amid stacks that touched the cavernous ceiling" resolves without dramatized struggle. Cost appears in the threat that "the past overtook her" but remains largely potential rather than paid.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal redemption to village salvation, with the labyrinth serving as crucible where Elias faces "spectral kings demanding retribution." The dominant stake (self-forgiveness) tightens through concrete obstacles that test his resolve. However, the resolution feels slightly too neat—the village beginning to thaw immediately after his self-forgiveness lacks the messier causality of real redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—transforming harsh judgment into spectrum forgiveness—is signaled early and maintained, with one meaningful deepening as Elara realizes she must forgive "the defiant artist within." However, the ritual's threat remains abstract without concrete opposition, and the cost of "multiplied truths" lacks visceral demonstration beyond conceptual statement.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake of dissolving "into nothingness" established early with escalating pressure from the rising acid sea. The ritual deepens through three memory-pockmarks (father's loss, failed potion, lost love) each adding emotional weight. Cost is visible in confronting failures, though the resolution's ease ("sea receding just enough") slightly undermines earned tension.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake (reclaiming lost world/fulfilling vow) signaled early and deepens through oasis discovery. The tightening comes through fading skylight creating urgency, but lacks concrete opposition or trade-off. The "wrong turn" feels convenient rather than earned, and no meaningful option is foreclosed with visible price—the shell painting succeeds without cost beyond acknowledging temporariness.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes center on proving subtle intention's power over "brute force," with the heat wave's break creating receptive conditions. The escalation through vial uncorking to scent release to Harlan's response follows accumulative logic. Cost remains somewhat abstract—"proof etched in dawn's gentle light"—rather than showing what Elias sacrifices or risks.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal loss (wife's departure) through building the cryptic network to families arriving "with tentative hope." The waning quarter brings genuine doubt when "the phone's dial stuck," forcing Elias to clutch the bronze foot for grounding. Cost manifests in each cryptic call's emotional weight—the young mother's weeping, shared "raw solace"—though the resolution feels slightly neat with multiple families arriving by dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—creating psychological safety despite involuntary truthfulness—escalates through discovery, research, and self-surgery with clear cost. The glass eye solution emerges causally from foraging and textbook research. However, the community's collapse remains largely told rather than shown through specific pressure, limiting the felt urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.0)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: from witnessing the stranger, to finding the boutonnière, to borrowing its memories, creating density that reweights Elias's isolation. The cost appears in his acceptance of "witnessed isolation" over pure solitude. The revelation about the stranger sailing away rather than jumping somewhat deflates the established stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rising creek waters create escalating physical stakes while the doorway promise creates emotional stakes—both converge at the portal moment. The tightening happens through narrowing physical space and time as waters rise. Cost is legible as Elias must abandon his safe solitude to step through, with no return path.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake (confronting the dream mystery to heal or shatter her reign) is signaled early and escalates through the climb and grotto discovery. The resolution shows agency but the "channeled her softly commanding will" moment lacks the concrete mechanics that would make the cost fully legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—revaluing their friendship—is clear, but escalation is minimal under an accumulative lens. The single tightening moment (Thorne's hesitation before the transformation) provides some pressure, but the resolution feels predetermined rather than fought for, lacking the cost clarity that would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—reconciling with mortality through past selves—develops through dream vision to writing to acceptance, with the birch bark scroll ritual providing the key tightening. However, the transformation from jealousy to understanding happens somewhat easily without a strong middle reversal or test. The cost (accepting that past selves are threads rather than losses) lands but could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake of reclaiming "something lost" is signaled early but escalation is minimal—the story maintains a steady reflective pressure without meaningful tightening. The screw's polishing represents transformation but no live option is foreclosed; Elara faces no trade-off or opposition beyond internal processing.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—transforming trauma into healing power—is clear, with escalation through the ritual's progression from writing to physical transformation. However, the resolution lacks genuine resistance; the crystals simply "soften" and "dissolve" without forcing a true trade-off or testing Elara's commitment through opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal guilt to time-limited opportunity as "chainsaws idled in the distance." The tightening occurs through the perfume's induced currents drawing the siblings together before demolition. Cost is legible in the "fleeting" nature of their reconnection and the archive's destruction.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes center on unraveling cosmic illusions, signaled early and maintained throughout. The spiral arbitration with spectral librarians provides one meaningful escalation point where the witness must counter their deceptions. However, the conflict lacks visceral pressure—the witness faces no genuine threat of failure, and the resolution feels predetermined rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding time's true nature—is signaled early but remains philosophical rather than urgent. The reversal sequence provides one meaningful deepening as memories flood backward and understanding dawns. However, there's no real opposition or cost; Elias achieves his goal without sacrifice or trade-off beyond a symbolic drop of blood.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from security breach to personal revelation about quantum entanglement mirroring emotional release. The laser pointer demonstration creates meaningful deepening when "data streams—previously locked—flowed freely." Cost appears in Elara's final understanding that revolutionizes "not just her field, but the hollow space within," though the resolution arrives somewhat quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on Elara's need to understand her father's contradictions, with modest tightening as each scrawl deepens her perspective. The escalation follows an accumulative pattern appropriate to the textural lens, though pressure remains primarily internal without external complication. Cost registers emotionally but lacks the sharpness needed for higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Clara's need to reconnect versus learning to release—is signaled early through the wrong number. The harmonica's haunting melody deepens pressure by making Clara "feel so alone." However, escalation relies heavily on summary ("recounting memories that soured") rather than dramatized beats, and Clara's transformation lacks visible resistance or cost beyond her voice "cracking."

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving/renewing the covenant—is signaled early but lacks concrete pressure or meaningful escalation. The story presents discovery through reflection rather than active conflict, with no real obstacles or costs to Elara's decision. The "haunted euphoria" and commitment to continue archiving don't demonstrate what she risks or sacrifices, making the stakes feel abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake of curing loneliness through genuine connection escalates from jokes to rumor-following to the tower climb to the shared touching of the rock. Cost becomes visible when reciprocal storytelling provides the actual cure, not the magical object. The escalation feels organic though the middle section with rumor chains slightly dilutes momentum before the tower ascent recovers it.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—navigating emotional depths to find forgiveness—intensifies through accumulated memories and absorbed forest languages that force Elara to confront her guilt. The deepening occurs through sensory accumulation rather than reversals, appropriate to the textural lens, with clear cost as she faces "echoes of loss" and "the fear that her blindness mirrored an inner void."

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on Elara's need to repair her relationship with her brother and salvage their research. The discovery of the pen provides agency, and her decision to edit history represents a meaningful choice. However, the resolution lacks concrete opposition or trade-offs—the edit succeeds without visible struggle or price beyond the pen "bending slightly once more."

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake of overcoming isolation through artistic creation is signaled early and maintained. Pressure builds through the silence-mapping exercise toward public performance, with Elias risking vulnerability. However, escalation feels mechanical rather than earned—the fishermen provide no real opposition, and the transformation from private exercise to public melody lacks sufficient resistance or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving forgotten knowledge—is signaled early and maintained throughout, with each discovered artifact tightening Elara's path toward the codex. However, the escalation is purely additive without resistance or complication, and no meaningful cost materializes beyond Elara's tears at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure escalates through Elara's drumming intensifying from tentative garden responses to the climactic lagoon sequence where "entangled memories surged." The dominant stake (preserving the shared dream against Kai's "encroaching oblivion") tightens as his echoes fade. Cost is legible in the final acceptance of loss, though the conflict lacks a decisive physical or relational test.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (proving whispers beat shouts) escalates from Elias's internal motivation through Marco's failed wager to the successful rescue. The storm creates time pressure and Marco's panic raises stakes. Agency drives the resolution through Elias's choice to volunteer and his specific rescue method. Missing sharper cost articulation—Marco's humiliation is implied but could land harder.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara seeking solace from grief—is clear but remains largely internal without external pressure. The guardian's ritual provides a deepening moment rather than true escalation, as Elara remains passive throughout. No meaningful tightening occurs; she observes transformation rather than choosing it under pressure, limiting the story's dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake of awakening conformist minds escalates from individual doubts to synchronized town-wide displays, with meaningful deepening when "Pedestrians slowed, their unspoken words shifting." However, the elders' dismissal ("sensed the stir but dismissed it as mere evening haze") deflates peak pressure, and no visible price is paid—the rebellion succeeds without personal cost to Elias or immediate retaliation.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal denial through magical summons to identity transformation, with the scrimshaw "burning hot" and the island's appearance forcing immediate choice. The cost is legible as Elara must abandon her human life entirely, though the "ancient pact" that eliminated violence feels somewhat disconnected from the central conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake of cultivating lightness from grief deepens through the whittling act, where "each curl of shaving reveals the hidden form beneath" mirrors internal transformation. Cost is visible in the sister's memory stirring "no tears—the void allowed none," though escalation remains primarily textural rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake (reclaiming art/ether spaces after the ban) progresses through Elara's increasing boldness - from entering, to touching, to paraphrasing, to wading. However, the escalation lacks genuine opposition or cost; the world yields too easily to her poetry without extracting a price.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on recovering Thorne's lost awakening through artistic collaboration, with the flower language creating escalating connection. The final barter delivers meaningful cost for both characters, but middle sections lack immediate pressure as the arrangement exchanges proceed without opposition or time constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—discovering connection after loss—is signaled early and deepens through accumulated memories. Each threshold forces Elara to question assumptions, creating minor escalation. However, the virtual nature removes genuine risk, and the "powerfully gentle wave" resolution lacks visible cost since everything occurs in simulation without real consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake of overcoming grief escalates from rock bottom through discovery of the vellum to actively helping Lira, with each stage narrowing Elara's options toward engagement. The final "illumination" of Lira's curtains of intention demonstrates meaningful deepening. Slight deduction for the resolution depending partially on Lira's arrival rather than pure protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake of mapping cultural patterns post-crash is signaled early but never faces concrete opposition—Elara simply explains her method to Theo without encountering resistance or having to choose between competing paths. The measuring tape demonstration attempts to show methodology but doesn't create actual pressure or force a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—accessing forbidden knowledge at the cost of innocence—signals early and escalates through Elara's improvised dance around the pagoda. Pressure coheres as she must abandon scholarly patterns (removing her veil) to match the archive's chaotic nature. The cost becomes tangible when atoms of nostalgia physically alter her being, though the final "forever marked" could be more viscerally specific.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (preserving hope's shape) is signaled early and tightens through the shadow's approach to dissolution ("unraveling in the library's perpetual bloom"). The holoprojector method creates agency through deliberate intervention. However, the conflict lacks immediate opposition—the shadow poses no resistance, making this more contemplative accumulation than active struggle despite the emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dominant stake (processing betrayal and deciding whether to report Mira) is signaled early but never faces genuine pressure or complication. Elias's decision to report unfolds without resistance or cost—no internal debate, no weighing of consequences for the animals or himself. The regenerating tail provides no actual escalation, merely parallel symbolism without forcing trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding survival's meaning—deepens through the digging sequence where plants guide Elara to the opal. The discovery creates a meaningful turn that reweights her scar's significance. Cost is visible in tears and emotional release, though escalation could be sharper as the digging feels extended without increasing resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake (finding where unused love is stored) is signaled early and deepens through the psychometry reading. Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through layered revelations about Theo's letters. However, the resolution lacks a true foreclosure or trade-off—Elara's vow to unearth the letters faces no opposition or cost beyond tears of recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake of freeing creativity is established early and drives all action. One clear tightening occurs when external methods fail and she turns to vulnerable rest. Her agency is evident in choosing to use the astrolabe, then choosing surrender. The breakthrough is earned through her journey with visible emotional and temporal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through wave function manipulation where "collapse wrong" could erase desired sparks, with Elias choosing "the spark in the unlit corner" at genuine risk. The chess clock's midnight freeze anchoring divergent paths creates meaningful pressure, though the resolution's ease slightly undermines the established peril.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake of reclaiming mental freedom escalates through three translocations, each deepening understanding via the wind-listening method. While pressure accumulates through the gear discovery and cavern revelation, the resolution arrives without a decisive trade-off or visible cost—Elias gains his frontier without sacrificing anything concrete on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—finding courage after restraint breaks—is signaled early and deepens through the indirect path structure that forces reflection at each turn. The guides' stories and star-stamp ritual provide escalation markers, though the middle section lacks immediate pressure. The closure crystallizes when Elara sees her unleashed self in the tide pool, paying the cost of releasing her protective tether.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding safety's cost through acceptance of silence—deepens meaningfully when the bolt discovery triggers memory of the choir's dissolution. Pressure accumulates through textural layering rather than reversals, appropriate to the lens. The cost is legible in lost unity and permanent voicelessness, though the middle section could tighten the connection between regeneration and isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are signaled early (usurper's false throne fracturing cosmic balance) with escalation through spreading messages, growing unrest among Varak's spies, and culminating confrontation. The protagonist drives the pressure through deliberate message placement. Cost is somewhat abstract ("realms drift into chaos") rather than viscerally felt, and Varak's arrival feels slightly convenient rather than fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake (discovering why paths disappeared) maintains coherence but lacks meaningful tightening - Elara methodically assembles data without facing obstacles or trade-offs. The revelation arrives through patient accumulation rather than pressure that forces choice, missing the cost clarity needed for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (finding meaning after rebellion's failure) is signaled early but escalation remains internal and abstract. The story lacks a concrete tightening moment where Elara must choose between specific options with visible trade-offs. Her decision to use the stone circle faces no opposition or cost—the transformation happens too easily without earned resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—evolving tradition versus ossification—escalates from peripheral observation to active unsealing with clear cost (defying hierarchies). Mira's agency drives the discovery and choice to break the seal. The tightening occurs when she must decode the script and physically shatter the amber, foreclosing the path of traditional compliance.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (processing grief while maintaining hope) deepens through the freeze moment and sketching sequence, with somatic markers signaling emotional minefields. However, the conflict remains largely internal without external pressure, and the resolution feels predetermined rather than hard-won. The cost is more stated than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—salvaging art and sanity through confronting darkness—is signaled early and maintained, with claustrophobia and rising tide adding environmental pressure. However, the actual untangling process lacks meaningful resistance or complication; the threads yield too easily to his "deliberate care" without forcing trade-offs or revealing unexpected costs.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are signaled early (understanding time's slowdown during crisis) and pressure builds through the tracking sequence to confrontation, but resolution arrives without meaningful cost—Elara escapes unharmed and gains knowledge freely. The sorcerer's attack creates momentary tension but doesn't force a true trade-off or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal discovery ("unauthorized thaw sequence") to systemic revolution ("ignite outrage in the thaws above"). The dominant stake - whether to preserve or expose dangerous truths - tightens when Elara realizes the networks aren't severed but "merely sleeping." Cost is visible in her awareness of treason and the "scandal would bloom like cracks in permafrost," though the immediate personal consequences could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear dominant stake in preserving the sanctuary against chaos, with effective escalation through the dome crack that tests Elara's method under pressure. The resolution through cultivated calm rather than force works under the accumulative lens, though the mechanics feel slightly abstract. Cost is visible in her committed solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—catching the goddess's echo to heal internal fractures—escalates through the zigzag intensification and the echo's "savage" resistance pulling back "with the weight of eternity." Agency drives the resolution through Elias's deliberate breathing technique. The cost lands in bearing divine weight, though the tightening could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—exposing family secrets about alien orbits—is signaled early but lacks meaningful tightening. Elara's intervention feels predetermined rather than forced by escalating pressure; she simply arrives and disproves Quill's theory. The "orbits of regret" concept provides thematic resonance but doesn't create concrete obstacles or force difficult trade-offs in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (releasing guilt over her son's death) is signaled early and deepens through the discovered letters and device activation. The pressure accumulates toward the ritual binding, though the resolution relies somewhat on the convenient discovery of Crowe's exact solution.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate from individual "unlearning confessions" to collective participation in the mandala, with Elara's interventions progressively deepening engagement. The cost manifests in the "fragile" resolution and lingering unease, though the conflict lacks a sharp tightening moment that would elevate to higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—transforming collective trauma into healing—deepens through Elara's ritual with visible cost (her deeper entrapment in retrocognition). The tessera discovery provides meaningful tightening that enables the renaming. However, the emergence of survivors feels slightly convenient and lacks the pressure buildup that would elevate the stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from Eliza's initial despair through the coin exchange to the climactic shared dance where "echoes blooming into tapestries of color." The ghost's need for an encore creates genuine pressure. However, the resolution arrives somewhat easily—"despair recede, nostalgia rising" lacks the visceral cost or trade-off that would elevate the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from Theo's pill disappointment through Elara's proposed alternative to their successful somatic mapping experiment. The tightening occurs when they must maintain physical synchronization during the long exposure, though the lack of real opposition or failure risk keeps tension moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.8)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through sensory density (fear spikes, pools of resolve, emotional hotspot), but lacks a meaningful tightening that forecloses options. The fossil amplifies her existing abilities without forcing trade-offs or creating genuine stakes about what she might lose.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake (freeing prophecy from predestination) is signaled early and deepens as Elara's button cataloging reveals the echo's true message. The tightening occurs when "shadows lengthened and the cliffs outside groaned," creating temporal pressure. However, no genuine opposition tests Elara's resolve—the unscrambling proceeds smoothly without reversal or meaningful cost beyond time investment.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—recovering evidence to expose agency corruption—escalates when Marcus arrives, transforming solo mission into shared redemption. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as atmosphere builds toward their reunion. However, the resolution arrives somewhat easily once Marcus appears, lacking a substantive test of their fractured trust.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—releasing himself from generational burden—is clear but escalation occurs primarily through internal reflection rather than external pressure. The story lacks meaningful opposition or complication beyond Elias's own thoughts, limiting dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake - understanding why the oasis resists change - deepens through the glass visions showing alternate timelines, each revealing different fates based on kindness's presence or absence. The escalation from physical discovery to temporal visions to conceptual understanding follows the accumulative lens coherently. Cost appears in the final recognition of his own potential unraveling, though this could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—processing grief and transforming loss—escalates from the rosebush's death through the harbor journey to the petal-scattering ritual, with clear cost in releasing this last connection to her father. The "quivering hush" effectively marks the deepening moment where vulnerability shifts toward resilience, though the resolution feels slightly abstract in its vision of future gardens.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure accumulates from isolation → reincarnation memory → sundial discovery → stone circle activation, with each beat narrowing Elara's options toward confronting her solitude. The cost manifests in abandoning her sanctuary's safety for uncertain flight. Stakes deepen effectively though the spectral resolution arrives somewhat conveniently.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara's disconnection from "the thread that connects all things"—is signaled early and deepens when she discovers Liora's letter addressed to her. The tightening occurs when the installation reveals itself as built from donated letters including Elara's work, forcing recognition of her impact. Cost is visible in emotional release and the foreclosure of her isolated path.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes escalate from signal interpretation to community division to direct confrontation with Harlan, narrowing to Elara's decisive interference. The pressure coheres around preventing chaos, though the cosmic tricksters' actual threat remains vague ("sowed chaos that no chart could navigate"). Harlan's power play provides concrete antagonism, but the resolution comes quickly through Elara's pre-planned counter-frequencies rather than earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake of finding the Keystone is clear, but escalation remains largely internal without meaningful tightening. The "spatial mutiny" concept adds texture but doesn't create active opposition—walls rebel abstractly rather than forcing concrete choices. The resolution comes through following vibrational paths rather than protagonist agency overcoming resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake - solving a cold case after evidence vanishes - is clear but pressure never tightens meaningfully. Elara's discovery of the ribbon fragment represents coincidence rather than earned investigation ("This fragment... had eluded all prior searches"). The sketch revelation lacks concrete opposition or cost; "skeptical detective tomorrow" exists only as future possibility rather than present pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (honoring Thorne/proving his foresight) established early and deepens through journal discovery and decoding. The reversal when authorities grant posthumous redemption provides meaningful resolution. Cost is visible in Elara's weeping and the ongoing storm threat. Escalation through accumulation works under the textural lens, though agency is primarily interpretive rather than confrontational.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake - Elias breaking free from his "never" identity - deepens through discovery (flake), interpretation (scaffold map), and action (playing on the arch). The tightening occurs when environmental signs force him to choose whether to follow the mapped path. Cost is visible in confronting his scarred-hands backstory, though the hitchhiker's role in escalation remains vague.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.1)
    The territorial marker strategy represents meaningful escalation as Elias channels his father's cunning for legitimate purposes, creating visual boundaries that successfully repel rivals. Yet the economic collapse arrives without sufficient buildup, and the rivals' withdrawal feels too easily won through "eerie poetry" rather than genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—decoding the temple inscriptions—progresses through accumulation of dream imagery, but lacks meaningful tightening or cost. Elara's "healing words" lighten the shadow figures' burdens without effort or trade-off, and her final understanding arrives without foreclosing any path or paying a price.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—discovering "what mirrors don't show"—drives Elowen's choices and faces meaningful deepening when the visions flood her with unmirrored truths. The expanding circles create escalation through physical widening that mirrors internal change. However, the resolution feels somewhat predetermined rather than fought for, and the cost remains more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on mending the eclipsed covenant with clear escalation from passive vision to active intervention using the maze clipping. The tightening occurs when "anxious elation flooding her core" as she links through scars, with visible cost in the wilted clipping. Agency manifests through Elara's choice to bridge scars despite being root-bound, though the resolution could show more immediate consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on Elara's need to "patch the holes in her soul," with meaningful escalation when she discovers Thorne and proposes the barter. The exchange carries visible cost as both trade fundamental aspects of self. However, Thorne's quick agreement reduces tension that could have deepened through resistance or negotiation.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—Jack's search for purpose after loss—is clear, and his wrestling with the speaker cloth provides one meaningful tightening moment. However, escalation remains largely internal through reflection rather than rising pressure, and the resolution ("tomorrow, he'd return to appraising") lacks immediate cost or foreclosed options that would sharpen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding the physics of spiritual transition to reconnect with the mentor—is signaled early and maintained throughout. The seed discovery provides meaningful deepening that changes Elara's options from passive grief to active ritual. However, the resolution lacks genuine opposition or cost; Elara's "haunted ambitions lighten" too easily without dramatized struggle, and the peace that settles feels unearned given the setup's emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder against routine—manifests through the librarian's fluctuating form and his careful capture method. The escalation from observation to active smelting demonstrates meaningful deepening. However, the conflict lacks sharp opposition; the smelts' acceptance comes too easily, missing potential for genuine struggle that would heighten cost.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether this cave can serve as humanity's refuge—evolves from physical assessment to spiritual transformation when Elias discovers the pearl. The tightening occurs through his choice to embed the pearl, though this transformation lacks intermediate resistance or complication that would heighten cost.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake of self-forgiveness is signaled early and maintained, but escalation reads more as accumulation of discoveries than genuine pressure that narrows options. The graffiti message and accordion discovery deepen meaning but don't force trade-offs or demonstrate visible cost beyond Elias's internal processing.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are signaled early (finding the library to rewrite her past), and the cipher provides obstacles through its cyclical reversals. However, escalation is minimal - she solves puzzles without meaningful setbacks or rising costs, and the resolution grants her exactly what she wanted without forcing a trade-off or narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes clearly established early (dream vs empire) with meaningful deepening when the violin's true nature is revealed. The coffee stain visions provide concrete pressure imagery (crown splintered by thorns). Slight deduction for the resolution feeling somewhat predetermined once the plants reveal the violin's purpose rather than maintaining genuine tension through the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake - preserving essence before oblivion - intensifies through the ritual's progression as "the threshold of stillness pressed closer." The escalation follows the accumulative lens well, building density through layered memory infusion. Cost is visible in Elara's fading ("vision blurred at the edges") though the conflict lacks external complication.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.8)
    Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds through Elara's climbing to think, discovering the hairpin, and experiencing visions that reweight her understanding. However, the transformation occurs without resistance—she accepts each revelation immediately, reducing dramatic tension despite the thematic deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara's need to move beyond rigid certainty—is signaled early and maintains coherence. The wind chime interpretation provides a tightening mechanism that reframes her dilemma about leaving her job. However, escalation feels managed rather than urgent; the "ritual" proceeds without meaningful resistance or complication that would heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—reversing aging through vanishing—is signaled early but remains conceptual. The ripples reveal past failures and warnings, creating accumulative pressure, but no on-page reversal or tightening forces a trade-off. The final warning about risk stays abstract without testing Elara's commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (learning to navigate without moving) is signaled early and deepens through the bird-reading sequence, where Elara must risk merging with a potentially dangerous "wandering pulse." The cost is visible in her acceptance of "eternal vigil" and the warning that "not all lost essences wished to be found" creates genuine tension about her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=4.8)
    Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should build through density increases or pattern breaks, but the conflict remains static—Elowen encounters mild vine resistance that "slackened" with minimal effort. No meaningful options narrow or costs accumulate. The stakes of finding "sacred simplicity" never face concrete opposition beyond abstract algorithmic dominance.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—fulfilling luminous vows to discover sound's color—escalates from contemplation to decisive action as Elias abandons his routine for the dangerous dive. The warming key tag and the ship's temporal accessibility create genuine pressure. The cost is visible in his years of deferred dreams and the physical risk of the dive, though a stronger mid-story complication would enhance escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—reversing universal death through alignment—escalates from coin-casting through static interpretation to the sacrifice of divination tools. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as each layer (prophecy decoding, frequency distillation, vision flooding) narrows options toward the final renunciation, with visible cost in discarding the coins.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—honoring Lira's sacrifice by naming fears—deepens through the discovery of recordings to the crystallization sequence. The tightening occurs when the largest crystal encapsulates "the void of sacrifice itself," forcing Elias to confront his core loss, with visible cost in his tears and transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—restoring cosmic balance to bring back the seas—is signaled early and maintains coherence throughout. Escalation occurs through the methodical timing sequence and pattern recognition, with tension building as Elias doubts his ability. However, the resolution lacks genuine cost or sacrifice, and the swift success ("tentative moisture welled up") undermines the established impossibility of the task.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake - reconciling past grievances with present duty - establishes early and tightens through the photograph discoveries. However, the resolution lacks sufficient resistance; the families' acceptance comes too easily without dramatized opposition. The cost feels more declared ("expunging the bitterness") than viscerally earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake of harmonizing divided self before cosmic transformation deepens through failed experiments to the ritual's crystallizing moment. The starlings' appearance creates meaningful escalation under the Accumulative lens, their patterns revealing "flaws in her logic where sentiment had been ignored." Cost manifests in tears and the vulnerability of confronting suppressed emotion, though the resolution feels slightly neat.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from pattern observation to active threat identification to crucial revision that prevents colony defensive misfire. The pressure tightens when Lir's urgent query forces immediate clarity, and Elara's choice to revise carries clear consequences. Minor deduction because the antagonistic threat (rogue gliders) appears somewhat late and lacks fuller development of what makes them dangerous beyond "intentional sabotage."

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear dominant stake (defeat numbness/resolve custody battle) with good escalation through infiltration, confrontation, and ritual. The external conflict (corporations vs. archivists) interweaves effectively with Kai's internal struggle. Resolution is earned through protagonist agency with visible cost, though the escalation could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain abstract throughout—Elias's business is "stale" but we never see concrete pressure or loss. The seed presents possibility rather than conflict. No meaningful tightening occurs; he simply plants it and imagines future rooms without facing trade-offs or obstacles that would create escalation under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through the tunnel's resistance ("its echoes twisting some notes into dissonant howls"), forcing Elias to intensify his efforts. The cost manifests in the "haunting gift" qualifier at closure, though the resolution feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—reconciling homesickness through acceptance—deepens when Elowen shifts from waiting to interiorizing. The pendant provides meaningful escalation by offering a method. However, the conflict lacks external pressure after the cultist flashback, relying heavily on internal resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate through successive approximations from "Nothing" to "faint tremor" to full vivification, with each failure informing the next attempt. The dominant stake (escaping ecclesiastical destiny through alchemical success) remains clear. Cost is visible in the destruction and transformation of the grandfather's relic. The escalation could benefit from one more meaningful setback before breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure builds through Elara's methodical ascent and the interference requiring her to discard assumptions, creating a meaningful deepening when she achieves signal clarity. The lunar perigee provides temporal pressure. Cost manifests as she must release her biases "like pebbles into the void," though the stakes could intensify further through more immediate physical or emotional risk.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate from routine ferry crossing to passengers dissolving into parallel realities, with Elias's agency driving the resolution through pattern recognition and radio work. The tightening moment when passengers fade creates genuine pressure, though the solution arrives somewhat easily once Elias understands the patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on Elias's need for connection, with escalation through increasingly intense weaving patterns that alter memories and culminate in emotional eruption. The cost manifests in "memories settling into new, irrevocable shapes" and shattered illusions. However, the middle section lacks a clear tightening moment before the eruption, and some pressure points remain abstract rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—learning to navigate by starlight to bridge depths and surface—is signaled early but never faces concrete pressure or test. There's no meaningful tightening or reversal; Elara experiments with the chain link and teaches students without encountering obstacles or trade-offs. The story accumulates detail about the navigation method but lacks escalation that would narrow options or force costs.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from tracking a faint pulse to preventing the silencing of an entire lineage, with the hearing aid's increasing pulses providing accumulative pressure. The cost becomes tangible when Mira's blueprints threaten immediate demolition, though the resolution lacks a clear trade-off or sacrifice from Elara.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake (honoring the forgotten) is signaled early and maintained. Tidal pressure creates urgency, and claustrophobia provides internal resistance. However, escalation feels more procedural than pressurized—Elias moves through obstacles but never faces a moment where he might genuinely fail or pay a personal price.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake (restoring Elias while reclaiming purpose) escalates through the porcelain break and blood-drawing, with Elara risking physical harm for digital restoration. The heartbeat synchronization adds tension. However, the defragmentation succeeds too smoothly without meaningful complication, and the final "quiet triumph" lacks the struggle implied by earlier setup.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear: preserving a dying language before its last speakers vanish. Pressure builds through the language's accelerating death ("children born now spoke only in crude echoes"), culminating when "the last elder fell silent." However, Elar faces minimal opposition—the curse threatens but doesn't meaningfully obstruct, and success comes without visible trade-offs or sacrifices.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes escalate from investigation to personal transformation when Elara discovers her brother's voice, forcing a choice between maintaining her human form or joining the transformed.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes escalate from playing nightly to amplifying through the locust shell to eventual orchard liberation, with one meaningful deepening when the shell's discovery reframes the conflict. Cost appears in Elara's physical strain and the statues' destruction, though opposition lacks agency—the statues never adapt or counter her strategy meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate from routine mail delivery to the risky drone launch carrying "proof of life," with the thunderstorm bottle providing energy to "evade patrols." The tension peaks when "patrons holding breath in shared suspense" as the drone breaches the border, though the resolution via "return flutter" arrives too easily without dramatizing the mother's actual reunion or its cost.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether silence holds possibility or absence—escalates through discovering the halo fragment and culminates in Elias's choice to sing. The "misting hush" deepens appropriately under the textural lens, building pressure through accumulation. However, the conflict lacks a meaningful middle tightening; the halo's warming creates immediate compulsion without intermediate resistance or complication that would heighten the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (finding where stories truly live) progresses through deliberate ritual to vision, with meaningful deepening when analog memories reveal the "hyperbolic realm within the library's core." Cost appears in Elara's racing heart and the weight of carrying these echoes forward, though agency could be tested more directly against obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—capturing the runaway dream of her lost brother—builds through the photography ritual toward the realization that release brings peace. The tension between longing and letting go deepens appropriately, though the resolution arrives somewhat easily without testing alternative approaches.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—freeing the trapped idea to reclaim connection—is signaled early but escalation is minimal. The single tightening occurs when the locksmith reveals the hair's true nature and unwinds the ribbon, but this happens through his agency, not Elara's. Her primary action is passive reception of visions rather than a choice that narrows options or forces trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering stolen memories—is signaled early but lacks meaningful tightening. Elara faces no real opposition or complication; she simply paddles out, finds the mushroom, and succeeds. The "broken constellations" discovery provides texture but not escalation, and the resolution arrives without forcing a trade-off or visible price beyond time's passage.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—mentoring resilience to reverse exile—is signaled early and tightens when Elara confronts her own trauma through helping Lir. The shadow in glass serves as external pressure forcing Elara's backwards steps, then becomes the crucible for transformation. Cost is visible in Elara's physical retreat and emotional vulnerability, though the resolution of Lir's exile feels somewhat quick for the established world rules.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (preserving wonder's color) is signaled early and deepens through Elara's ritual of essence-capturing that culminates in planting. The story shows one meaningful deepening as she moves from contemplation to action, with agency in her deliberate weaving between worlds. However, the conflict lacks genuine opposition or reversal - everything proceeds smoothly without meaningful resistance or cost during the action.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—grounding restless spirits while confronting personal guilt—intensifies through the ritual's progression. Each unraveled knot deepens pressure as "the interlaced hush thickened" and Elara's secret emerges.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—solving his father's disappearance—drives consistent pressure through methodical investigation. The footage comparison reveals patterns that narrow options toward the chapel. However, escalation remains steady rather than intensifying; no reversal or complication forces Elias to pay a price for his discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.9)
    Clear dominant stake with meaningful tightening when finding the radio and note. However, escalation feels more accumulative than driven by protagonist agency - the final understanding comes without visible struggle or cost. The insight feels granted rather than fought for under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—liberating the ghost's trapped voice—is signaled early through the flower press discovery. Escalation occurs through Elowen's progressive actions: finding, understanding, then translating the ghost into art. The tightening timeframe "between lightning and thunder" creates pressure that forces decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.8)
    The elevator's floor-by-floor ascent provides structural escalation, and diary revelations deepen from navigation charts to personal torment to the spire's origin. However, Elara faces no real opposition or difficult choices—she simply reads progressively deeper content. The story lacks agency-driven pressure; discoveries accumulate but don't force trade-offs or meaningful decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake clearly established - proving empty spaces remember Lena. Escalation builds through altitude, oxygen deprivation, and mounting "quietly explosive" pressure. Agency shown through his choice to memorialize and accept loss. The tightening is meaningful and the cost is visible in his transformation from desperate seeking to acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (preserving the library's essence before demolition) is clear, with time pressure from approaching crews. The discovery deepens options rather than narrowing them, fitting the accumulative lens. However, the resolution lacks a sharp trade-off - Elara gains the book and completes the mural without meaningful sacrifice or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes center on Elara's desire for cartographic fame, but escalation remains internal without external pressure or meaningful obstacles. The discovery proceeds smoothly from curiosity to revelation without reversals or costs that would force difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure accumulates through prophecy discovery, mirror navigation, and gear assembly, with meaningful deepening when Elara learns "not frantic haste, but a patient cadence." The uncapping moment creates a decisive turn that realigns the mirrors. Cost is more conceptual than visceral—her identity shift from locksmith to rhythm guardian—which limits the felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are clear (saving the dying orchards) but escalation is gentle rather than pressurized. The single tightening moment—discovering the butterfly garden and bell—lacks opposition or genuine risk. Agency exists through collective choice but no visible price is paid or alternative foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.8)
    Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds through the layering of visions and the puppet's patterns, culminating in Elara's choice to sing the lullaby. The emotional cost registers through her tears, though the stakes remain largely conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.6)
    The frost deadline creates genuine urgency, and Elara's discovery of the nut meaningfully tightens options toward saving the travelers. However, the resolution comes too easily—the blueprint perfectly solves the problem without meaningful trade-offs or struggle beyond physical clumsiness.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake (reconciliation with daughter) is signaled early but never faces genuine opposition—Elena's internal resistance dissolves without struggle, and Lila accepts immediately. No meaningful tightening occurs; the resolution arrives through convenient epiphany rather than earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake - finding the origin of stories - escalates through three progressive incisions, each quantifying deeper personal voids. Agency manifests through Elara's deliberate method of measuring absence. The tightening occurs when the third incision causes the library to reveal the hidden alcove, with visible cost in the moonlight's depletion.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara's need to transform accumulated remorse before it breaks her—is signaled early and tightens when she discovers the pavilion's crystallized memories. However, the resolution lacks earned struggle; she simply absorbs orbs one by one without meaningful resistance or tactical adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—transforming isolation into community—is signaled early and tested through the risky first approach to Klaus. Escalation occurs through accumulated voices joining the song, with visible cost in overcoming "grudges from lean years past." The conflict resolution feels somewhat smooth given the depth of established division.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—becoming an archeologist of abandoned dreams—intensifies through the painful synaptic modification sequence. The cost is visible in "pain lanced through him" and the burden of absorbing others' memories. However, the transformation lacks genuine opposition; Elias proceeds without meaningful internal resistance or external obstacles that would deepen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.0)
    Central stake (finding the forgotten combinations) drives consistent forward pressure through the gravity window constraint. The inversion timeframe creates urgency and forces commitment to entering the dangerous grotto. However, the resolution through convenient visions lacks the struggle or trade-off that would elevate stakes—Elara succeeds without meaningful opposition or cost beyond physical risk.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (creating music in silence) is clear from opening, with meaningful deepening as Elowen discovers how to channel sound through stress cracks. The escalation from tracing cracks to producing resonance shows agency, though the transformation could face more resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake of reclaiming the eclipsed covenant escalates through correlation of silences, with time pressure ("before the next phase: the moon's rise"). The revelation that the covenant was "hidden...waiting for one precise enough to reclaim its light" deepens options. Cost appears in exile's duration and the transformation required, though agency could be stronger in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake - understanding silence to map empathy - progresses through the diary unlocking to revelation, with emotional cost in Elias's tears. However, escalation is gentle rather than pressurized; the "conflict" with the lock offers minimal resistance, and the diary's contents arrive without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—mastering the corpse flower to help village elders—escalates when the bloom's "rot-scent clawed at her senses." However, the resolution through journalizing feels insufficiently costly; the transformation from "visceral assault" to teaching moment needs more embodied struggle to justify the claimed serenity.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    The gravity inversion creates a ticking clock that forces immediate anchor deployment, and the echoes drawing Elara deeper provide meaningful escalation. The discovery of the arrow tip and its revelation about the planet's resilience lands with clarity, though the personal cost to Elara could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake of preventing future tragedies escalates through discovery of the "singular convergence" - the precise intersection of wind tunnels, low-altitude run, and microburst. The investigation tightens from general survey to specific understanding. Cost is felt through the patch and silence but lacks present-tense sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—proving wonder essential—is signaled early and maintained throughout. Escalation occurs through the sequential bell strikes building toward revelation, though this feels more like execution of a plan than rising pressure. The resolution lacks a moment where Elara must sacrifice or choose between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—redemption through understanding—is signaled early and maintained throughout. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elara's vision reveals her mistake stemmed from "iron grip, mistaking control for care." The cost appears in her confrontation with "the shade of her former self" and harvesting painful insights. However, the resolution arrives through internal realization rather than dramatized pressure, limiting the escalation's force.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding emotion's mathematics—intensifies when the transposed empathy backfires, forcing Elara to experience "the astronomer's despair crash against her mother's long-lost tenderness." This reversal narrows her options from control to acceptance. The cost registers as she staggers back "disoriented," though the escalation could tighten further through more concrete obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on honoring Thorne's legacy versus keeping the pendant, with meaningful escalation through the shepherd encounter. The transfer decision shows clear agency with visible cost. Pressure builds through memory and present action, though could use one more tightening beat.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.1)
    Clear dominant stake in proving her theory about objects absorbing emotions. Meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes she's been avoiding her own feelings. The escalation works through accumulated pressure rather than external conflict, fitting the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (reconnecting with her brother) is clear from the opening, and pressure escalates through discovery of the puzzle to the sacrifice of the tapestry. However, the cost feels somewhat predetermined rather than emerging from active opposition, and the magical solution via amber bead lacks the friction that would elevate the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake (saving the planet from architectural decay) is clear, with escalation through Elowen's deliberate descent and silk-weaving ritual. However, the resolution lacks genuine opposition—no meaningful reversal or tightening occurs, just steady progression toward inevitable success.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from personal curiosity to understanding cosmic consequences. The tightening occurs when Elara discovers "each crossing added weight, a cumulative burden that could collapse realities." This revelation forces her final choice to map responsibly, with clear cost visible in her tears and the felt weight of truth.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving the lighthouse tradition and safety of sailors—emerges through accumulating discoveries rather than reversals. Pressure builds as Elias uncovers the letter chain's history, with the missing keeper Harlan creating urgency. The cost becomes visible when Elias accepts the burden of maintaining both the physical light and the emotional tradition, though the conflict remains primarily internal without external opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—birthing renewal through ancient shadows—coheres but never truly tightens since the Herald faces no opposition beyond his own visions. The prophetic glimpse of his obsolescence creates mild tension, yet this arrives late and resolves too easily with his immediate acceptance rather than genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake of understanding story magnetism deepens through the wing examination, moving from question to embodied realization to action. Escalation occurs through the sun-tracking sequence where light reveals "hidden veins" and triggers donor memories, forcing Elara to confront her cautious nature. Cost is visible in abandoning protective walls. However, the conflict lacks external pressure—everything unfolds internally without meaningful opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on Elias's need to understand "what those sentinel trees witness," with escalation through his discovery and reconstruction of the sextant. The pin-drop moment provides meaningful deepening that changes his understanding. Cost appears in "sorrows tallied like nautical miles" though agency could be stronger—much happens through mystical confluence rather than decisive choice.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (realm's survival) is clear, but escalation occurs through accumulation rather than decisive turns. Elara's agency drives the resolution through song-gathering, yet the pressure doesn't meaningfully tighten—she moves from task to task without visible trade-offs or foreclosed options that would heighten cost.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to the risk of discovery ("footsteps echoed nearby—guards patrolling"), forcing Elias's decision to hide the invitation by moving deeper into the library. The resolution emerges from his agency in choosing to enter the secret library and return the invitation "transformed." However, the immediate consequences of discovery remain abstract rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake of seeking "tenuous absolution" accumulates pressure through restoration acts, appropriate for the reflective tone. However, the gentle escalation lacks the decisive tightening that would elevate the score under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake (preserving the luminous vows) is signaled early but escalation remains flat—Elara measures frequencies, adjusts the lantern, and succeeds without encountering meaningful resistance or forced trade-offs. The vows' decay creates urgency but no actual pressure that narrows her options or extracts cost.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are clear - preventing rivals from betraying her father - with escalation through three false starts that each fail differently. The final chaotic action with the flare creates some tightening. However, the resolution feels incomplete; we don't see if her actions actually thwarted the trap or saved her father, leaving the dominant stake unresolved.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake (understanding weather-carriers) progresses steadily but lacks meaningful tightening - the carriers simply explain themselves without forcing Elara to sacrifice or choose. The revelation about her own potential weather arrives without earned pressure or visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.6)
    Central stake of suppressed creativity versus inescapable calling escalates through the safe discovery to climactic uncorking of "bottled visions." The cost is legible in "luminous grief for lost years," though the conflict resolution feels slightly predetermined rather than fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from professional tension to city-wide trust crisis to personal confrontation with Kael. The wilting leaves reveal his deception, forcing Elara's choice between safety and truth. The Vault discovery provides meaningful resolution though the final cost could be more explicit beyond "transformation."

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes build through accumulation as the sculpture awakens and transforms successive listeners, with the woman's tears and skeptic's kneeling showing escalating impact. The pressure coheres around preserving wonder against "gray monotony," though Elias himself faces no direct opposition or difficult choice that would heighten personal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.9)
    The magnetic shift creates coherent external pressure that forces Elias to confront archived fears or risk the farm's collapse. Stakes escalate through the controlled burn's intensification, with clear cost in his physical degradation and the choice to embrace rather than eliminate the final fear shard.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes center on community healing through the locked mailbox, signaled early and maintained throughout. However, escalation remains flat - each revealed story adds information without intensifying pressure or forcing harder choices from Elara.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake of liberating Liora is clear from early on, with escalation through the dice rolls, dance communication, and system breach. However, the conflict lacks meaningful resistance—Silas folds too easily after initial protest, and no genuine reversal or tightening occurs that would force Elara to pay a higher price. The resolution feels predetermined rather than hard-won through genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—recovering lost memories of his dead wife—is signaled early and tested through Elias's dangerous descent and excavation in unstable gravity. The escalation from memory loss to active recovery through divination and digging provides one meaningful deepening. However, the revelation that the whale purposefully dislodged memories feels somewhat convenient rather than earned through protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (preventing prophetic cataclysm) is signaled early and pressure coheres through the ritual's escalation from tracing lines to water surging to final sealing. Cost becomes visible through physical strain and the prophecy's weakening grip. However, the conflict lacks a concrete antagonistic force beyond abstract "coded whispers."

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes build from borrowing sugar through weekly lessons to direct confrontation: "Tell me the real language of this place." The meteor shower creates natural pressure for truth-telling, though the escalation could tighten further. The cost of knowledge—bearing the building's secrets—manifests in the seal's weight as "talisman," though consequences remain somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—transforming isolation into independence—is signaled early and maintains coherence. The escalation through processing increasingly difficult memories (woman's grief, child's wonder) provides some tightening. However, the conflict lacks genuine resistance; the memories yield too easily to Elara's will without meaningful pushback or cost during the archiving process.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake (forgiving abandonment) is clear, with the ritual providing meaningful deepening through blood sacrifice and symbolic unlinking. However, escalation under the accumulative lens lacks a pattern break or density shift that would intensify pressure - the resolution arrives too smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stakes are established early (sister's eternal echo) with one meaningful tightening when Elara learns she must risk her own echo. The resolution shows agency through her counter-melody choice, but escalation occurs primarily through exposition rather than dramatized pressure, limiting the felt cost until the final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—salvaging purity from wreckage—intensifies as Elara analyzes ghost cameos, building through Lady Franklin's appearance to the midshipman's wonder, culminating in the exposure of suppressed affections as the expedition's fatal flaw. Under the accumulative lens, pressure coheres through pattern recognition and deepens when the true cause is revealed. However, agency remains primarily observational rather than forcing difficult choices, and the cost of freeing ghosts lacks concrete dramatization beyond the warming shrine.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—appreciating hidden effort—is signaled early but never truly tested or threatened. No meaningful tightening occurs; Hiroshi's philosophical pursuit proceeds without opposition or cost. The fireflies' response to his whistle represents the only mild escalation, but this facilitates rather than complicates his goal.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.3)
    Clear dominant stake (uncovering truth) with meaningful tightening as she discovers and reassembles the letters. Protagonist agency drives each escalation through her analytical choices. The cost is legible—she now bears knowledge that could destroy survivors' fragile hope, creating genuine moral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can reshape society through prophetic broadcasts—is signaled early and maintained. However, escalation reads as accumulative rather than causal, with "storm after storm" providing texture but little meaningful tightening. The story lacks a decisive on-page reversal; villages realigning happens in summary rather than through dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake - bridging generational silence - escalates through the accumulation of captured sounds into the music box. Each jar represents a specific loss (children's laughter "before the war," grandfather's tales) that builds pressure. The resolution shows agency through Elias's deliberate restoration work, with cost visible in his emotional release.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (protecting the artifact from ice) is signaled early but escalation is minimal—ice threatens, Elias uses his pre-existing equipment to stop it, threat ends. No meaningful tightening occurs; the sonic solution arrives without forcing trade-offs or narrowing options. The "vibrational matching" resolution feels predetermined rather than earned through rising pressure that tests commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—transforming impatience into revolutionary patience—escalates through Thorne's resistance, acceptance, and eventual crossing of the viaduct. The magnetic pull creates literal and figurative tension at the climactic threshold. Escalation could be stronger with more visible opposition from the Overlords rather than keeping them abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes escalate from routine investigation to exposing systemic corruption when the lantern triggers Clara's memories, revealing Hale as whistleblower rather than accident victim. The entangled memories create internal pressure as Elias experiences Clara's terror viscerally, fortifying his determination to break free. Cost manifests in his decision to abandon bureau protection for truth.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal guilt to active redemption as the clockwork heart's restoration enables Elias's decision to find Harlan's daughter. The cost—Harlan's death and Elias's unspoken apology—is clear, though middle pressure could tighten more dramatically.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—birthing sentient steam—is signaled early and develops through the kaleidoscope transliteration sequence. Pressure tightens as "hours blurred into days" shows sustained effort, though the conflict remains largely internal without external opposition. The resolution is earned through Elara's persistent work, with the bell's ring marking achievement despite being "unheard."

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes escalate from curiosity about deleted files to uncovering corporate murder/cover-up, with one clear tightening when restricted files require protocol bypass. The piece follows causal lens adequately. However, Elara faces minimal opposition—her lies succeed immediately, access is granted instantly, reducing tension despite high nominal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.8)
    The fishermen's dispute provides clear external conflict, but escalation is minimal - Elara intervenes before violence erupts, and the resolution comes without meaningful resistance or complication. The fragment warming against her skin suggests urgency but doesn't create genuine pressure. The conflict resolves through understanding alone without testing Elara's limits or forcing trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—learning "the sound of approaching endings"—deepens through Kai's recordings and crystallizes when the storm forces Elara to act rather than observe. The shift from passive tourism to active volunteering provides meaningful tightening, though intermediate pressure points feel episodic rather than escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Elena's reconciliation with solitude and past love—deepens through her encounter with Liam, whose parallel story creates resonance rather than external conflict. The escalation operates texturally as their conversation accumulates meaning, with Elena's shift from guarded sentinel to nurturing guide marking the key turn. Cost registers emotionally as both characters confront their "destined mismatches," though the resolution feels slightly neat.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake - preserving the prophet's wisdom before it dissolves - is clear from the midpoint. Under the situational lens, pressure coheres as the echo threatens to fray, forcing Elar's consecration. However, escalation is minimal; the ritual proceeds smoothly without complication or mounting difficulty, and we never feel the echo might actually be lost.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—transforming collective pain into healing—is signaled early but never faces concrete pressure or opposition. Elara encounters no obstacles to her archival work; she simply arranges photos while contemplating their meaning. The piece lacks escalation under its Accumulative lens—no density increase or pattern break forces a trade-off or crystallizes cost beyond abstract "heavier with purpose."

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful escalation occurs under the Accumulative lens. Elias whispers into the crystal, hears echoes, and gains understanding, but these discoveries don't narrow options or force trade-offs. The dominant stake (understanding language's evolution) faces no opposition or complication. The resolution lacks earned cost—Elias simply continues his vigil unchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate through Elias's increasingly desperate marking methods (chalk to driftwood to runic circles) as his forgetfulness compounds the challenge of locating the garden's core. The successful capture creates meaningful closure, though the soft landing ("solace in the captured tide") reduces felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (launching the probe at escape velocity) is clear and the earthquake creates genuine pressure by threatening the timing systems. The escalation from tremor to clock crisis to inspired solution follows causal logic. However, the resolution comes through inspiration rather than costly trade-off—Elias doesn't sacrifice or risk anything personal to achieve success.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (achieving reconciliation before death) intensifies from blood work confirmation through Elara's song bridging Elena's regrets to the daughter's arrival. Agency manifests through Elara's decisive musical intervention and Elena's choice to harmonize despite frailty. However, the daughter's convenient arrival undercuts earned causality slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—discovering where shadows go at noon—signals early and maintains coherence throughout. Escalation occurs through the accumulation of closed loops and revealed knowledge, fitting the Textural lens, but lacks a moment where Elara must sacrifice or choose between competing goods. The "quietly deliberate" progression from inscription to inscription provides steady pressure without meaningful reversals or cost-bearing decisions that would create higher stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering her lost daughter—is signaled early and deepens when the tooth discovery forces Elara to confront her skepticism. However, escalation plateaus after the tooth discovery; the ritual and its aftermath lack concrete opposition or meaningful tightening. The resolution through magical dissolution feels unearned as no price is extracted for the transformation beyond accepting past loss.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.9)
    Central stake of isolation versus connection intensifies through sea glass discovery and polishing, culminating in the choice to leave the grotto. Agency manifests through deliberate action (polishing method, emergence, gathering villagers). The tightening from private treasure to shared beacon works, though middle sections with heavy reflection dilute immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.9)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through environmental details (dripping icicles, moss growth) that mirror internal thawing, culminating in the pendant offering. The stakes—choosing connection over isolation—are clear, though the cost feels somewhat muted as both characters seem equally ready for connection.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—completing the manuscript versus fear of unraveling truths—is signaled early but never faces concrete opposition. The cameo appearances don't escalate pressure or narrow options; they accumulate without forcing trade-offs. The resolution (manuscript complete) arrives without visible cost or foreclosed alternatives under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are clearly signaled (restoring practices to save withering crops), and pressure accumulates through the ritual's unfolding. However, no meaningful obstacles or reversals test Elowen's commitment - the remedy succeeds smoothly once begun, lacking the tightening that would force trade-offs or demonstrate cost.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—translating grief into navigable maps—deepens through the ritual's progression from arrangement to ignition to sealing. Escalation occurs through accumulative pressure as each step builds toward the transformation, with visible cost in Elara's physical endurance and emotional exposure, though the conflict remains primarily internal without significant reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—capturing wonder to heal war's wounds—deepens through Elias's systematic attempts at different times and angles. The breakthrough when "the timer whirred faintly" represents meaningful escalation under the accumulative lens. Cost becomes legible through "his own echoes of loss—the war's toll on his family" though the middle section could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on Elara's quest to escape her fractal curse through burden collection, with each transformation showing incremental progress. The widow's sorrow and merchant's regret provide specific weight to abstract concepts. However, escalation remains steady rather than intensifying—no meaningful tightening occurs that would narrow her options or force harder choices.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake of processing grief through memory-harvesting deepens via crystallized time fragments, each revealing lessons about control, love, and courage. The kettle's escalating whistle creates urgency while memories fracture between "here" and "gone." Agency manifests through Elara's choice to contain chaos via carving rather than drowning in grief. Missing stronger mid-story tightening that would foreclose options; the progression feels more accumulative than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake of confronting past choices escalates through fragment collection to ghost negotiation, with visible cost in accepting erosion. The tightening from passive regret to active bargaining forecloses the path of recapturing lost potential. Pressure could intensify more sharply in the middle section where fragment collection feels somewhat mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.9)
    Pressure builds through accumulation as Elara progresses from discovery to implementation, with one meaningful deepening when she realizes the sextant can guide restoration. The maze provides minor complications but lacks genuine opposition or risk - success feels assured rather than earned against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake (making peace with abandonment) is signaled early but never faces genuine pressure or complication. No meaningful tightening occurs—Elias simply walks out, places the clock, and achieves resolution without obstacle or deepening that would narrow his options.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding the architecture of lies—maintains presence but lacks meaningful escalation. The diving sequence provides physical tension but doesn't genuinely threaten the core pursuit. Finding exactly the chest he needs feels coincidental rather than earned through struggle, and the resolution arrives through reading journals rather than through choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving ancient knowledge methods—is signaled early and maintains coherence. Escalation occurs through the accumulation of atmospheric pressure and Elias's patient decoding work, culminating when the rope "warms" and yields its secrets. However, the lack of active opposition or meaningful obstacles limits tension; the conflict is primarily internal/philosophical without visible trade-offs or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding healing through written memorialization—remains abstract throughout. Elias's choice to stay signals some agency, and unraveling the thread represents a minor deepening, but neither action carries visible cost or genuinely narrows options. The piece lacks escalating pressure; Elias simply continues his established practice in a new location without meaningful resistance or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes emerge clearly—beauty versus mechanical sterility—and escalate through the assembly sequence toward the egg discovery. The "quaking harder" of the palace adds external pressure during the assembly. However, the conflict remains largely internal and philosophical, lacking concrete opposition beyond the abstract "mechanical world."

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—proving "scars can sing"—is signaled early and tested through the grafting ritual and the wanderer's arrival. The wanderer's appearance provides meaningful complication that deepens the thematic question. However, escalation remains relatively gentle without sharp pressure increases, and the cost, while present in the scars and histories, could be more viscerally felt in the moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (liberating trapped memories) is signaled early and deepens through personal revelation about Elara's mother. Escalation reads as accumulative pressure through the breadcrumb trail leading to the central fountain. The patience required creates genuine tension, though the final unsticking lacks sufficient resistance to feel fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—breaking generational patterns of isolation—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is minimal; Elowen's doubt about perpetuating cycles represents the sole tightening, and no meaningful reversal or deepening occurs. The cost of accepting the pattern is intellectually present but lacks the visceral pressure needed for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (discovering collective grief's shape) escalates through nightly greenhouse returns and expanding retracings from mother's paths to family graves.

Cost manifests in the completed monument and transformed family dinners, though middle development could show more concrete obstacles to the discovery process.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from mechanical duty through personal guilt to communal healing. The pendulum pause deepens from routine to revelation, with the rake handle's inscriptions forcing acknowledgment.

The resolution about fluid intentions arrives without forcing any trade-off or foreclosing options.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are clearly established (societal stagnation vs. innovation), and pressure builds through Elara's modeling process. However, escalation remains internal and abstract—her doubts and iterations don't create concrete obstacles or force trade-offs, missing the tightening that would narrow her options with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal solace-seeking through clandestine discovery to active participation in story revival, with risk implied in "cloaking his actions from any prying eyes." The dominant stake—reviving stories after the famine—tightens as Elias moves from passive reception to active dissemination through altered scores.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—crystallizing fleeting emotion before it dissolves—is signaled early and tightens through the mask creation, with the porcelain shards representing escalating fragility. The final placement of the mask on the stopped chair forecloses the path of wearing/keeping it, with visible cost. Slight deduction for pressure that relies more on accumulation than active conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: preserve ancient methods vs. enable new chroniclers. Escalation builds through sedimentary excavation that deepens his understanding ("the competing narratives sharpened"). The discovery of the ancient scribe's journal intensifies commitment. Cost is visible in the final image of burial "with me," though middle pressure could be more immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—transforming discord into harmony—is signaled early and tightens as students progress from "sharp edges" to "merged harmony." The "by subtracting noise" method provides clear escalation as each student peels away specific resentments. However, the conflict lacks a decisive pressure point or reversal; the transformation proceeds too linearly without meaningful setbacks that would test commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake of reclaiming heritage through cultivation is signaled early and maintained. One meaningful deepening occurs when the seed sprouts and begins rewiring memory. However, escalation lacks genuine opposition—no force actively resists Elias's rebellion, making the conflict largely internal without external pressure to heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder amid crisis—faces pressure through Lira's frustration and Elias's compulsion to tell truth, culminating in the riddle solution that maintains enchantment. While the escalation works under an Accumulative lens through layered revelation, the immediate consequences of the blackout don't create visceral urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding why houses feel alive—deepens effectively when Elias realizes it stems from "sacred bonds woven into their spaces through everyday chaos." His agency manifests through the deliberate repositioning sequence, each object placement building toward the cottage's reanimation. The cost is visible in his careful labor and emotional investment, though the opposition remains primarily internal/atmospheric rather than dramatically contested.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—Elara's belief that constructs lack souls—faces direct challenge through Lirien's revelations, escalating to physical risk when threading the dome's fracture. The tightening comes through cascading truths that narrow her worldview until action becomes necessary, with visible cost in the dangerous escape method.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from physical endless climbing through mathematical obsession to the rupture that recovers "the texture of the missed opportunity." The dice rolls create micro-tensions while the larger arc builds toward breaking perpetual motion's curse, though the mathematical solution arrives somewhat mechanically through pure calculation rather than dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (proving strangers remember kindness) deepens through accumulating daydream visions that test and affirm the belief. The waxing moon's intensifying glow creates temporal pressure. Cost is visible in the months of insomnia finally yielding, though the magical resolution (greenhouse humming, distant figure smiling) slightly softens the earned quality of the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—preserving a dying bread-making tradition—escalates through environmental threat (warming currents), accidental acceleration (opera glass focusing light), and physical danger (climbing slick ledges). The cost is visible as Elara risks herself and the tools face "corroded metal" destruction. However, the resolution's swift communal embrace lacks the resistance that would heighten earned victory.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.1)
    Escalation occurs through the tide's urgency and Elias's systematic puzzle-solving, with stakes tied to breaking fate's design. The reversal ritual creates meaningful pressure. However, the resolution lacks a concrete trade-off beyond abstract "bleakness"—we don't see what specific path or capability Elias loses in exchange for his defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—confronting childhood fear rooted in sister's disappearance—is signaled early and maintains coherence through the middle section. However, escalation stalls when the resolution devolves into abstract "fear manifesting as shadowy figure" without concrete cost, and the multiple false endings prevent any meaningful tightening or deepening at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from threatened bloom through approaching storm to full tempest, with Leeward's mallet work transforming each obstacle. The storm functions as both antagonist and potential instrument, creating genuine tension about whether the orchard will scatter or harmonize. Cost is visible as waves batter the circle and rain sheets down, yet the sketched resonances absorb impacts into music.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake (discovering Thorne's fate) escalates through pattern language discovery to the revelation that saving him risks unleashing ancient forces. The tightening occurs when Elara learns rescue means potential catastrophe, forcing a trade-off between brother and city that remains unresolved but charged at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (rescuing truth from noble lies) established early and deepens through the illuminated letter's discovery, which forces Elias to confront the gap between comforting myth and painful reality. The escalation follows accumulative logic as parallels between Roman couriers and wartime myths tighten his understanding. Cost becomes legible when he must abandon stories that gave his grandmother solace.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving abandoned dreams—deepens when Elias discovers the inkwell and chooses to embed stories in the repairs rather than just complete his surveying task. This represents meaningful agency with visible cost (labor, empathy's weight). However, escalation remains gentle rather than pressurized; the conflict is primarily internal without strong opposing force.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (tracing honest origins) is clear and drives action. Meaningful deepening occurs when she posits the alternative hypothesis, reframing the city's fall. However, the pressure feels moderate - more intellectual discovery than high-stakes conflict. The cost is commitment to new understanding rather than visceral sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake (transforming grief) is signaled early through the shadow's departure and deepens through the ritual of dream recording and crane folding.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (finding energy pools for revenge) is signaled early and pressure builds through the perturbation experiment's revelations. However, escalation relies on information discovery rather than foreclosing options—Elias gains knowledge but faces no meaningful trade-off or narrowing of paths at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes deepen from technical puzzle-solving to existential belonging as Elara recognizes the frequency "mended her too," though the absence of active opposition limits tension to internal discovery. The accumulation of decoded fragments creates momentum, but lacks a decisive tightening moment that would heighten cost.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear dominant stake in whether to reveal the truth to Eliza. Internal pressure escalates well through the ritual sequence, and the resolution provides meaningful closure. The decision feels more like realization than hard choice under pressure, limiting the sense of visible cost at the climactic moment.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake (successful prisoner exchange) progresses linearly without meaningful reversal or complication—Lira's momentary hesitation provides texture but no real obstacle. The personal stake (reconciliation with Tomas) carries more weight but develops through gesture rather than tested choice. Cost remains conceptual ("recycling mistakes") rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake of reconciliation is signaled early through Lena's text and maintained through Elias's navigation struggle. The utility poles provide escalating emotional pressure as each landmark triggers specific regrets. However, the resolution through Lena's unexplained presence at the beach undercuts earned agency—the story resolves through coincidence rather than Elias's choices, violating the rule that luck may complicate but not solve.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes escalate from personal redemption to confronting specific victims' faces in the lake's visions, with Elias choosing the harder right path over escape. The baseball warming in response provides tangible feedback, though the resolution's cost remains somewhat abstract—emotional catharsis without concrete consequences for past crimes.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (reforging the bond with Thorne) is clear, but escalation is minimal—the fortune cookie provides instructions that Elara simply follows without meaningful obstacles. The transformation happens without genuine resistance or complication that would tighten options.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming lost time to embrace motherhood—is signaled early and deepens through the ritual.

However, the conflict lacks external resistance; everything unfolds too smoothly without genuine obstacles or trade-offs that would elevate tension.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate through textural accumulation: scanning photographs reveals "families torn by old wars"→stitching binds "shadow to light"→tear amplifies method→dimension yields. The ritual's internal logic drives pressure as "shadows recede like mist before dawn," though agency feels somewhat passive—Elias performs prescribed steps rather than making difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake of understanding transformation progresses through Elias's choices to gather and release the bugs, creating cascading coincidences. While agency drives the resolution, the cost remains more conceptual than visceral—"pockets empty still, but understanding full" lacks the sharp price that higher bands demand.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal opportunity during the blackout to collective revolutionary action in the cradle, with the Dominion's tyranny as persistent external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal torment through ritual construction to the revelation of the mentor's survival, with the eels' electric spiral amplifying the mandala's power. The cost of stepping into the unknown is felt, though the middle section could tighten the pressure between doubt and determination.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.9)
    Escalation builds from internal vigil through timer's pressure to decisive action of retrieving and carrying the envelope down. The timer creates temporal pressure that forces the choice. However, external stakes remain somewhat abstract—we know censorship exists but don't see immediate antagonistic pressure, reducing tension.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes center on transforming violent confrontation into philosophical alliance, with the needle card discovery driving escalation. The solo fencing practice externalizes internal conflict effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal archiving to communal resistance, with the guard's flashlight providing concrete pressure near closure. However, the resolution lacks a decisive trade-off—the resistance succeeds without meaningful on-page loss or sacrifice that would elevate the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake of confronting fate through creative defiance escalates from passive longing to active intervention via the discovered film and improvised projection.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from individual seed-planting through dream interpretation to communal ritual, with the monsoon as persistent temporal pressure.

However, the conflict lacks sharp opposition—the ancestors cooperate readily, and the ritual succeeds without significant obstacles, softening dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake (finding peace with unspoken apology) signals early and deepens through compass discovery and lace instructions, with the salt-water ritual forcing Elias to confront his specific failure. The cerulean revelation reweights his grief with acceptance. While agency drives the ritual choice, escalation remains somewhat gentle without sharp reversals—appropriate for the accumulative design but limiting peak pressure.

The resolution is earned by her tactic shift (breath syncing), not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake shifts from seeking time’s texture to escaping retrocognitive entrapment, tightening plausibly. The decisive act forecloses a tempting path (keeping the fragment and its visions) for freedom and integration. Pressure builds via intensifying visions and the shard heating in his palm. The price is more thematic than painful on the body, but it still reweights the goal.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (secure seeds/avoid capture) is clear and tightens when enforcers arrive; the arrow feint and key-scatter foreclose options and buy exit at risk. The persistent constraint (chains) shapes tactics until the shard break—a satisfying escalation. Costs are present (jeopardy, time pressure, potential loss of cipher clarity) though not harrowingly steep. Resolution stems from Elias’s agency rather than luck.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is clear (capture and define the break of trust) and escalates through concrete steps to a focused peak (imprint on lattice). Pressure remains mostly internal; external constraints (cracked dome, sea pressure) color but don’t force a hard trade-off. The visible price is primarily emotional, with some bodily cost implied by healing tanks. A strong tightening occurs at the imprint but consequences remain softly rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—seizing an illuminated moment that might guide her path—is signaled early and tightens as the light fades. The bouquet code and the jar escalate pressure and knowledge, culminating in a meaningful reweighting. Opposition is largely situational rather than active, and the visible price paid remains soft. Still, the cadence intensifies credibly to the moonbeam reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are singular and legible: can Elias make havens here, or must he move on. The escalation is accumulative: thaw intensifies, instability emerges, and his project becomes untenable. The resulting choice forecloses a path with modest but real cost. A sharper on-page loss would lift pressure, but the tightening is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.0)
    Pressure coheres and tightens: the discovery stakes escalate into a face-off with a silencing contract and a physical lunge. Elara’s agency drives the turn (decoding, projection, trip, prior tip-off), with internal fear informing tactics. The visible price is more conceptual/emotional than bodily, which keeps intensity high but not searing. Still, the narrowing of options and earned reversal satisfy.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (can she begin mapping the endless night?) is consistent, with escalation via cadence: storm pause → concentration → star’s wink-out. Agency is endurance/attention; the meaningful narrowing is the choice not to write on fragile pages. Costs are felt but modest (lost gold flakes; surrender of physical map). The piece could use one sharper pressure point to force a harder trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—locating the origin of thought—tightens through the violin encounter and loop intensifications. Escalation is more density-driven than conflictual; knowledge options expand and then reconfigure. The price is understated: she foregoes rupture for endurance and returns to labor, now changed. Lack of a sharper external pressure keeps the stakes elegant but low-voltage.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are intimate and legible: risk exposure to thaw mistrust. Pressure tightens from passive observation to active disclosure, with eavesdropping as the hinge. The cost is emotional vulnerability and professional transgression, though external resistance is minimal. Escalation is gentle but real under an accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (faith vs measurement) is present, but escalation is soft; the spike prompts exploration and discovery, not a contested decision with a visible price. The key action (polishing) is ceremonial rather than fraught, and luck complicates then effectively resolves. We get one meaningful deepening, but options aren’t visibly foreclosed. Tension is aesthetic and thematic more than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (prove sideways time) is clear, and the lever-pull is a single meaningful tightening. However, pressure is low: the destabilization risk never bites, and no path is foreclosed. The piece deepens conceptually rather than escalating cost, which limits tension. Resolution arrives without a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (unravel the code) is established early and escalates when Elias chooses to “disrupt” the hush by playing. The price is concrete: the artifact disintegrates, leaving only partial knowledge. Stakes are intimate but coherent; tension increases through one decisive intensification rather than multiple reversals. Slightly more explicit risk calculus before playing could heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure coheres around whether to remain in isolated stasis or accept descent, tightening when Mira demonstrates the smudge that reframes Elara’s stance. The cost is felt but understated; escalation is primarily internal and textural rather than combative, with one clear deepening beat. Stakes remain focused and the resolution arises from Elara’s altered stance. Slight softness in on-page consequence keeps the peak from fully biting.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (unearthing a swallowed truth) is clear, with one meaningful tightening when the radio pattern and heated valve converge into the confession. Escalation is more deepening than reversal; the cost is internal and legible but Elias’s agency at the peak is mostly attentional endurance rather than a hard choice. The final renunciation/acceptance of guilt reads earned. A slightly sharper trade-off or foreclosed option would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving/entering regenerative silence—tightens through the library’s decay and the swan’s route. Escalation is gentle but coherent, with one substantive deepening when the swan shifts from object to method. The price (leaving, bodily strain, renunciation of the old post) is implied more than dramatized. No true reversal; a slightly higher-pressure beat would sharpen consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: rekindling wonder in a grieving child. Pressure tightens via the eclipse’s approach and culminates in the charged choice to surrender the talisman. The price is legible, though the escalation is more deepening than reversal. No antagonism needed; the internal conflict coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.8)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and investigative; the pressure deepens via discovery rather than tightening stakes. The main turn is the tapestry/diary synthesis that prompts the reframed goal, but no meaningful option is foreclosed on the page beyond a quiet acceptance. The world-scale stakes (axis displacement) remain abstract rather than felt as immediate cost. Tension operates more as hum than ratchet.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—whether Elias’s orchestration will alter his and the island’s stasis—is clear. The prophetic echo and fog deepen pressure, and his choice to proceed narrows moral options. However, escalation is gentle; no option is visibly foreclosed on-page, and the price remains mostly implied. Tension operates but never bites hard.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (prevent possession before completion) is signaled early and tightened by a clear ticking clock. Pressure escalates through layered rhetoric and targeted painting, culminating in a palpable cadence shift. Agency drives the turns; luck doesn’t resolve the conflict. The price is mostly stamina/risk rather than a cost that forecloses future options.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—recover coherence/voice before dawn—stays coherent; pressure tightens via exhaustion’s rise and deeper spiral-mapping. The dawn beat is a clear cadence shift that deepens options/meaning. However, the price remains largely internal and aesthetic, with no strong foreclosed alternative on the page. Tension is steady and textural rather than sharply escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (wholeness vs. fragmentation) is clear and pressure deepens via procedural tightening and the shadow-self confrontation. The key turn—choosing connection over solitude—registers, but the price feels light; the opponent shatters quickly and no persistent loss lingers. The “labyrinth as self-made test” twist reduces external pressure, making triumph feel somewhat inevitable. Escalation is present but soft at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant internal stake is clear and escalates via density and cadence (the reverse song’s vibrations intensify to crack numbness). Agency is present in concrete steps, and the cost—opening to grief—is legible. Pressure is primarily internal, but it coheres and tightens appropriately for the chosen lens. A small ceiling comes from minimal external constraint beyond the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (integrity vs. surveillance/encroachment) is legible, and pressure coheres. Escalation arrives through discovery and reinterpretation rather than confrontation. The tightening is modest: he forecloses direct confrontation in favor of covert distribution, but a concrete price isn’t paid in-scene. Tension remains contained within a quiet cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres around whether he risks being overwhelmed; the meaningful tightening is the pod’s split and scent resonance under UV. Agency is clear in the uncorking and the decision to surrender to grief. Stakes remain primarily internal but are viscerally staged. Slight softness: few alternatives or trade-offs beyond the surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are signaled early and tighten when the beings’ need is uncovered and their offer reframes the cost. The second dilemma (bind himself to weave worlds vs. preserve mortal impermanence) deepens pressure credibly. Final act (letting the rope fall) reads as a stance with cost, though not a decisive intervention. Tension is coherent and escalates without gimmicks.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes—whether silence can be reweighted into communal solace—are clear. Escalation is a gentle deepening: from hush to sound to shared stories. The piece lacks a strong narrowing or a visible, paid price; no option is decisively foreclosed beyond enduring loss. The net effect still tightens once via the bowl’s turn and the communal handoff.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are internal—risking the loss of safe detachment to gain empathy—and escalation is achieved via the sensory ritual and intensifying static. The decisive shift reads earned, but the felt price is light and there’s no external counterforce testing resolve. Tension stays steady-quiet rather than sharpening into a squeeze. The beat structure is coherent with one meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake is gentle (transform altruism into action); escalation is minimal and largely coincidence-triggered. There’s one tightening beat—the locket’s reveal aligns their aims—but no meaningful cost or foreclosed option. Conflict remains low-resistance; stakes stay conceptual rather than visceral. The partnership forms without tested opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (belonging) is clear and escalates via the decision to descend. Pressure remains gentle; obstacles (dead ends, partial etching) test resolve but don’t force a hard trade-off. The price is present but not sharply felt. Resolution is earned through Elara’s agency.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and tightened by the “interrupted cadence” boundary that requires borrowing time. The meaningful turn is the incantation/borrowing that uncages the gate, with cost revealed when the nap ends. However, opposition is minimal and solutions arrive without friction beyond the abstract cadence-pressure. The price (time-debt/binding to the pendant) lands but isn’t tested under duress on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (making peace with ambiguous loss through quantification) is signaled early, and pressure deepens as the ritual renders emotions into visible numerals. The cadence shift at dawn provides a subtle clock and a narrowing choice to close the working. Cost is internal—acceptance that loss becomes integral, not cured—credible but quiet. Absence of a harder turn or pushback keeps escalation contained to lyric intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (visibility vs. safety) is clear and tightens as the outage flicker and dawn create a now-or-never inflection. Escalation is subtle but present: sense-memory crystallizes into an act that cannot be walked back. Cost is emotional/social exposure rather than physical danger, but it’s legible on the page. Slightly soft in direct opposition, yet earned for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—whether to surrender self to the plant’s rhythm—tightens credibly as the storm builds. The decisive act (releasing control) narrows options and extracts an identity price. Internal and external pressures interweave: electrical air, pulsing leaf, her need to know. Escalation is clear though not combative; it fits the lens and length.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure coheres around solitude vs. connection and scarcity vs. offering. The meaningful tightening occurs with the brooch find and Mira’s arrival, forcing a trade. Stakes remain mostly internal with a soft but real price (surrendering the relic for water and story). The escalation is modest yet sufficient for the length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are focused: amplify everyday magic vs. being made a vessel by guardians. Escalation is legible and coherent—the reach intensifies to invasive shadows and a dissonant crescendo. The cost is unmistakable (selfhood ceded), though escalation leans more on environment’s surge than on protagonist-driven adaptation. One strong tightening beat suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—rekindling communal trust—appears early and deepens through the find → vision → public test sequence. The meaningful tightening is the decision to sound the valve before wary townsfolk, converting private compilation into a public act. Costs are implied (risk of rejection; reinterpreting pain) more than dramatized losses. Escalation is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (reach the fortress/face truths) is signaled early and tightens at the vault and the ticket punch. Pressure increases coherently under a causal lens, but external resistance is minimal, so tension leans on wonder rather than hazard. The key tightening is the commitment to board, which forecloses turning back. Cost is felt conceptually more than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—whether to open space to grief vs maintain skepticism—tightens when Elara chooses to transcribe. The visions deepen pressure and shift options toward acceptance. Costs are mainly internal and subtle but present; there’s no hard foreclosure beyond vulnerability. Escalation is clear for a quiet piece, if not razor-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (glimpse the after) is clear; escalation crests with the storm and the shard’s burn. Agency drives the turn, and the recoil forecloses the breach, but the price is relatively contained and quickly stabilized. Tension operates more as intensification than as hard trade-off, limiting peak torque. Still, the narrowing window (storm waning) provides credible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure coheres around a single dominant stake with one clear tightening: she moves from vigil to breach to deciphering. Agency drives the turn, but the danger is low and the price largely internal, limiting felt escalation. The decision to use the ink functions as the beat of commitment; no reversal tests her further.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (resisting silence’s erasure through tactile history) is clear, and pressure deepens via ritualization of the hum and the vision of rebirth. The meaningful tightening is his decision to stop collecting and act—descending with the lamp. However, on-page price and foreclosed options are only lightly sketched; no turn forces a visible sacrifice beyond leaving safety. Tension is steady but seldom bites.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are coherent—assemble an identity through others’ erased histories—but escalation is primarily density, not tightening pressure. The tide/storm and deeper penetration into the maze provide a credible rise in difficulty, yet no option is sharply foreclosed on the page. Agency manifests as persistence and attention rather than a consequential choice with cost. The closing stance is earned but low-temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—skepticism versus surrender to transience—tightens as the hums intensify and past voices reconfigure meaning. The key turn is his acceptance of the shell’s “compass” and the reframing of his vocation. Costs are primarily internal (regret, relinquishing armor) and could be sharpened with one concrete foreclosed option. Pressure accrues coherently under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clear early (privatization vs soul), and pressure coheres as patrols approach and alliances are encoded. Escalation is largely accumulative; the decision to incorporate forecloses a path but the visible cost is moderate. The outer-raft defensive perimeter is a solid tightening choice. A single sharp on-page loss or peril beat would have pushed pressure into higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—capture the last hush before development—is clear early and tightens toward dawn. The meaningful turn is the commitment to outlast the night with the chem warnings functioning as safety pressure. Costs skew interior (solitude, acceptance of loss) rather than materially narrowing options, keeping the pressure modest. Still, the cadence shift at dawn reads as a genuine tightening and payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.3)
    Pressure coheres around restoring directional feedback before the ship departs; the tightening beat is the inventive diagnostic method under time/atmosphere. Stakes remain intimate and somewhat abstract (aid a lost traveler), with minimal visible cost or trade-off. Escalation is a steady deepening rather than a sharp reversal. Resolution is earned by agency but feels low-risk.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure grows from curiosity to actionable insight; the condensation pattern reframes the map problem into a concrete lead. The tightening is credible but gentle—no sharp reversal, more a deepening that narrows options toward departure. Stakes remain personal/professional rather than survivalist in-scene, which keeps the price subtle. Still, agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes (“revival before collapse”) are signaled early and pressure accumulates as footsteps multiply and bells wake. The tightening is mainly density/cadence-based, not a sharp reversal; visible on-page cost is light. Agency shows in Elowen’s patient guidance and deliberate adjustments. The final beat earns a reweighted stance but stops short of a concrete trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are singular and clear (survival tied to a more intimate, thematic aim), with a meaningful tightening at the kelp entanglement under a live clock. The decisive action—unsnarling by overriding instinct—narrows options and exacts a price in time and emotional exposure. “Rescue approaching” arrives credibly given prior setup, though it softens the final beat’s edge slightly. Internal and external pressures braid effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (identity vs inherited falsehood) is signaled and coheres; the meaningful tightening is the discovery of the scuffed map leading to the confessional and confession. Escalation is primarily internal and textural, culminating in the lattice warming and door widening—credible but gentle. The clock and rumor of bodies do not materially heighten pressure. The price is an acceptance of loss rather than a sharp trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are singular and legible: reunite across lifetimes vs remain alive but estranged. Pressure deepens via repeated cameos and the sleet-night confrontation, culminating in a costly acceptance. Agency drives the turn (pressing the bead to her palm). The middle lacks a concrete failed attempt or tangible loss before the final convergence, keeping it just below top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on transforming isolation into communal reverence, and escalation occurs via the sewing act becoming a navigable map. Pressure remains low-friction—no obstacle tests her commitment or demands a trade-off. The turn where villagers follow provides deepening, not a narrowing with cost. A credible loss or risk in the act would sharpen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (rekindling faith through excavation) is clear, and pressure modestly tightens via the tremor, delays, and solitary labor. Escalation is more deepening than narrowing; obstacles complicate but do not corner her into a costly trade-off. The decisive act—rebuilding—arises credibly from her agency. Prices paid are primarily time and exertion, not a hard forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—imbuing the letter with discoverable meaning—remains coherent but seldom tightens. The most tangible deepening is the final “mailbox” outline and naming “Shadow Weaver,” which reframes the act but doesn’t foreclose a major option on-page. External pressure is minimal; no antagonist or time squeeze presses him. As a result, escalation is graceful rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes (expose coup) are signaled early and deepen through the synchronization gambit that narrows options by revealing concrete discrepancies. Pressure coheres as the unheard stories become actionable intelligence. The escalation is more density/cadence than a hard reversal, and the price of acting remains largely prospective. Strong but not crushingly tense.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recovering the withheld apology—tightens through successive invocations and the escalating clarity of messages. The decisive act (voicing the apology) forecloses the path of pride with a felt price. Pressure is largely internal, but ritual actions and the spirits’ chorus keep the frame taut. Stakes stay coherent without contrived antagonism.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are internal (healing through meaning-sharing), and pressure deepens via deciphering the notes and the anesthetic’s progression. There’s a gentle escalation from smudged fragments to a full familial story. However, options rarely narrow, and visible cost is modest. The turn lands, but tension remains low-grade.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (recover joy) is present and advances via the fragment and light activation. However, pressure remains gentle; no hard trade-off or foreclosed option is felt on the page. The knowledge network provides answers without significant friction. The renewal is moving but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are conceptual but legible: reveal the mechanism vs. reorient the seeker’s stance. Escalation occurs via density and cadence shifts in the reflections, culminating in a choice that forecloses the formulaic answer. The cost is felt in Elias’s surrendered armor; the tightening is singular but sufficient at this length. Slight softness remains as Elara faces little resistance or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is legible early and escalates with the approaching drone and the warp’s unpredictable spread. Elias’s agency drives the crucial turn (the incantation/warp) rather than coincidence. However, the felt price is modest—success arrives without a trade-off that forecloses a meaningful option. Tension lifts, but never bites hard.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (achieving a “blossom armistice” with insomnia) is signaled early and escalates through a ritual that transforms the environment. Pressure tightens via accumulative density rather than antagonism; the wind amplifies risk and reach, and the atrium choice narrows tactics. Cost is present but delicate, fitting the mode. A single deepening turn suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—saving names—tightens through the discovery-mend-ignite sequence. The meaningful turn is the ignition that reanimates the chime to speak names, deepening the emotional cost. Pressure is more textural than coercive; no hard trade-off is forced beyond endurance. Still, the small victory against a vast deficit reads with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (restore trust before parting) is clear and tightens when Thorne commits to listen and the ritual demands reciprocal vows. Escalation is accumulative via the symphony’s growth toward the “last knot.” Still, conflict resolves without a concretized price or visible hazard; the danger remains atmospheric. The final choice reads earned but cushioned.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is internal (ethic of control vs. compassion) with an external echo (possible reawakening). The decoding and tremor deepen pressure and narrow his stance. The resolution lacks a concrete price paid on the page; escalation is present but not punishing.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—risking trust after betrayal—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Mira ascends the stairs. Elias’s decision to reveal true songs and send real messages narrows options with emotional cost. Escalation is modest but clean under an accumulative lens. A single charged turn (Mira’s arrival) carries most of the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes (finding a way back by honoring thresholds) are signaled early and the discovery/use of the logbook is a meaningful deepening. Pressure accrues gently rather than through sharp opposition; the solution arrives without significant resistance. The narrowing of options is primarily conceptual, not peril-driven. The ending is earned but lacks a palpable on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes stay primarily internal and gently escalate; the feather’s anomaly and Lir’s emergence deepen the inquiry but do not corner Elara into a costly trade-off. The “captivation” moment creates a hinge into collaboration rather than resistance. The final synchronization is satisfying yet risk-light. Overall pressure coheres but never tightens into a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (understand disappearing paths before memory dims) tightens via the glass’s incomplete script demanding catalysts and the bird’s seeds offering a risky method. The meaningful turn is the experiment with seed + glass and the decision to plant the rest, foreclosing passive conjecture. Cost is primarily internal—accepting withering routes and continued solitude—credible at this length but modest in external pressure. No luck-resolve; coincidence (bird) complicates but doesn’t fix without her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes remain low and largely aesthetic; pressure builds by display rather than dilemma. Escalation is a sequence of orchestrations (tokens → wheel → dancers → alcove) without a narrowing of options or credible loss. Agency drives outcomes, but nothing truly threatens failure or demands a trade-off. The finale resolves satisfaction without a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is consistent (birth and release of the verse despite the ban) and escalates through pain, fledging, and active steering “by observing gaps.” The anchoring turning into liberation gives one meaningful deepening/cadence shift. The absence of a counterforce beyond pain keeps tension low-medium; no option is truly foreclosed beyond endurance. Still, agency drives the resolution and the price—though modest—is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    Pressure is gentle: a ritual quest for insight under the implied clock of “before everything shifts.” The main tightening is the sun piercing mist, intensifying his interpretive act. Stakes stay internal and never force a painful choice or visible loss. The result is resonant but low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.8)
    Pressure remains low; the dominant stake (will he open and share?) tightens gently rather than through marked escalation. The arrival of Lena provides a situational nudge, not a strong test or reversal. The choice to speak is clear and resolves cleanly, but the price paid feels lightly conceptual rather than forced by pressure. As a result, tension operates mostly at the tonal level.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are signaled (restore hope/bridge timelines), and there’s one meaningful tightening via trial-and-error data returning to refine the formula. Yet pressure remains serene; no option is foreclosed or priced in a way that narrows her path. The ending triumph lacks a visible trade-off or loss, softening escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure is primarily internal; escalation comes through discovery density rather than opposition. The decisive tightening is the reveal of Harlan’s plea and the negative’s hopeful inversion, which forces a stance shift. External stakes remain soft (no immediate danger), keeping cost felt but subtle. Still, the narrowing of options—accept the legacy’s task or flee—reads clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is focused and the bell clock tightens cadence. Escalation deepens through the mirrors’ progression (ripple → shimmer → blooming visions) and her sealing touch. The price is largely an internal acceptance rather than a foreclosed external option, keeping pressure elegant but soft. No antagonist on the page; time provides the primary squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear and tight; the ritual’s peak alignment provides a meaningful tightening. Elara’s agency drives the turn from skepticism to signatures, and the blood-ink adds concrete cost. However, resistance from Thorne and Mira resolves quickly, limiting escalation depth. The ending’s pause-of-war carries consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—whether to keep dominion or surrender a trophy to honor an echo—tightens as he follows the map to the basin, then hesitates. The on-page decision forecloses a path (keeping the egg, keeping the mask intact) with a felt cost. Escalation is quiet but coherent under an accumulative lens; the rain’s onset underscores the now-or-never cadence. External jeopardy is muted, but internal pressure carries the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (defy conformity by freeing echoes) is clear, and pressure coheres as threads densify and echoes accumulate. Escalation is driven by Elara’s choices, culminating in the unlock that narrows future options and invites pursuit. The cost is mostly implied rather than paid, keeping tension as charged poise rather than decisive loss. Still, the tightening is meaningful and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—ethics of storytelling—tightens from doubt to renunciation. The argument’s aftermath and the realization about reversed agency provide the meaningful deepening. The price of reversal is implied rather than tested on-page, softening the felt stakes. Still, the decision forecloses a path and reweights options.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are focused: preserving a vanishing lineage through ephemeral signals. Escalation is a density increase—more intricate structures—then a meaningful reversal when the gust unknots a lattice, narrowing options to endurance rather than completion. Agency resides in her method and refusal to abandon the vigil; the cost is an incomplete work and acceptance of erasure. A more explicit on-page trade-off could heighten the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is legible early and the procedure tightens options as the rope is reconfigured, culminating in an irreversible act. Escalation is accumulative rather than adversarial; the main “cost” is delicacy/time under cold rather than risk of ruin. The lever pull and illumination read as a meaningful turn that reweights options. Additional friction or risk would have sharpened the price.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake and tightens appropriately as the storm arrives and the ritual commences. The dream deepens knowledge rather than staging a hard trade-off, so escalation is more inward than externally costly. Agency is present at the end (she walks into the storm), but the price is mostly attitudinal. A sharper on-page cost or foreclosed option would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure escalates gently as alignments intensify the tile’s glow; the decisive act is placing and mapping the square and speaking the vow. A clear deepening occurs, but options never truly narrow or threaten a loss beyond implication. The covenant forecloses a path (remaining purely empirical), yet on-page costs are muted. The tension is more reverent than fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—prevent violence by unhooking resentment—is clear and tightens when Thorne grips the box and the memories flood. Pressure coheres under the situational/causal lens; the escalation is a deepening rather than multiple turns. The price is inward and quiet, limiting intensity but not undermining consequence. Resolution derives from the protagonist’s method rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear (recapture the runaway dream) with one meaningful tightening: disciplined breathing aligning tool, light, and vision until the lens ignites. Pressure is primarily internal and textural; there’s no explicit on-page forfeit or narrowed option beyond focus. The resolution stems from his agency, though the felt price is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes focus on whether Elias can restore an eye—and what that means for legacy—tightening when he chooses the ribbon and commits to finish despite pain. The orchard’s response functions as a deepening rather than a reversal, fitting the lens. The cost is endurance and relinquishment, not dramatic clash, but it reads. Slight convenience around the seeker’s arrival softens pressure but doesn’t break it.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (knowledge vs sanity/entrapment) is legible and escalates from unease to visions to a reorienting decision. The tightening comes through the cameo’s activation and the realization of the inheritance’s paradoxes, culminating in renouncing passive curation. Costs are present conceptually but not stress-tested in-scene. Pressure grows coherently under the accumulative lens but remains mostly internal and thematic.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stakes are clear (unlock the Library to rescue trapped souls), and there is one meaningful tightening when Elara exposes the guardian’s blind spot. Yet pressure rises modestly; obstacles resolve quickly and the negotiation lacks a felt trade-off or loss. The rescue missions arrive as a coda rather than a hard-won beat, reducing on-page price. The conflict remains coherent but under-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (recover Lira/identity) is clear, and pressure coheres as she escalates from moving through spaces to actively weaving narratives. The tightening beats—fog responding, partial vision of shore, ship’s counter-pull—narrow options and shift tactics from memory to vow. Still, prices remain mostly atmospheric; no concrete trade-off is paid beyond endurance. The conflict lands, but without a decisive on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are signaled early (preventing archival erasure) and escalate modestly as the mechanism protests and time threatens to slip. The decisive act is hers, but obstacles yield without substantial resistance or trade-off. Pressure coherence holds, yet cost and narrowing of options feel gentle rather than exacting. The beat-to-beat tightening is a clean deepening rather than a true squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are focused—restoring harmony—and pressure coheres as she moves deeper and confronts the amplified cacophony. The meaningful tightening arrives when she reads and aligns the cracks, committing to the ritual. However, there’s limited on-page resistance or sacrifice beyond concentration and endurance; no option foreclosed or trade-off is made explicit. Resolution is earned by agency but costs remain gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is legible early (rekindle the beacon as proof of meaning), and pressure coheres through storms, scarcity, and time’s erosion. Escalation is mostly accumulative via montage rather than discrete, in-scene reversals. Agency drives the turns (charting, aligning, reassembly), with a credible narrowing toward the clear-sky window. The price remains modest; no option is visibly foreclosed beyond the grind and risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—holding collective memory together—tightens when measurements exceed prior cycles. The pressure coheres and culminates in her vow, but on-page cost remains mostly anticipatory rather than enacted. No antagonist is needed, yet escalation is primarily interpretive; a single meaningful deepening occurs. The “unprecedented reach” beat is the clearest turning screw.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is legible (art vs. hopelessness) and tightens from discovery to ignition to public reading of “Rise.” Escalation is primarily textural; external resistance is minimal, so tension relies on the risk of failure and the hush’s pressure. The hybrid-fuel choice is a credible narrowing of options. Absent a palpable setback or cost, the peak reads more ceremonially triumphant than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure coheres around whether and how Elara will respond to Thorne’s liminal fear, tightened by the sustained silence. The meaningful deepening arrives via her indirect foresight; the subsequent spoken reframe reduces his tension. Stakes are internal and remain quiet; the price is patience and interpretive risk rather than a foreclosed option. One clear tightening, but escalation is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear early (preserve a rare silence under a ticking clock), and pressure escalates as the inversion wanes. Her tactics (limiting exposure, quick sampling) show agency under constraint. The cost is more conceptual than visceral; there’s little risk beyond time and secrecy, so the squeeze is felt but not punishing. Still, the deepening from anomaly to “gilded hush” capture lands.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure coheres around maintaining the hush against incoming aether-winds; the mist release is the principal tightening/turn. Stakes are primarily emotional/spiritual, kept small but consistent. The price paid remains light, so escalation tops out at calm competence rather than true risk. Nonetheless, the choice-driven deepening is clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes are declared (security sweeps at sunrise), but opposition is mostly atmospheric; drones and security remain offstage. The main tightening is the murals revealing the stair under a time limit, yet no trade-off or loss is dramatized. Resolution arrives without a meaningful price or narrowed options beyond “hurry.” Escalation feels smooth rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—defend the sanctuary’s boundary and teach the companion to breathe—tightens when shadows encroach and the threshold thins. Elara’s agency (using the ring through scars) drives resolution. The escalation is linear and clean but relatively low-friction; there’s no real reversal or felt loss beyond prior severance. Cost is implied more than dramatized in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes—repurposing exploitative pressure into communal value—are clear and present early. Escalation is steady but low-friction; obstacles feel minimal and risk is underplayed. The tightening choice is the physical commitment to alter the vent. Resolution stems from her agency, but the price paid is conceptually implied rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is legible and escalates through the music-guided discovery to the revelation and resolve. The cost is conceptually strong but the pressure is quiet; obstacles are minimal and resistance largely internal. The meaningful tightening occurs at the diary’s reveal and the resolved renunciation. Tension is effective but subdued.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—stabilize/capture possibility before it’s erased—tightens as reality buckles; the decisive act (unsnapping the clasp within the pattern) bears cost. Pressure rises coherently; external flux and internal renunciation interlock. The danger could feel sharper or riskier, but escalation remains meaningful and protagonist-driven. The final allegiance forecloses the prior path credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes (to surface overlooked kindnesses and find a way through grief) are clear and tighten as she uncovers the flap and reads deeper notes culminating in Josiah’s fate. Escalation is textural rather than adversarial but still narrows options toward an ethical act. The price is quiet—accepting responsibility and reopening pain. One meaningful deepening occurs with the addendum and its implications for Lila.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is clear: secure and use the unredacted histories before the regime closes in. Escalation tightens once (signals die, drones patrol, enforcers near); the key-turn under pressure is a concrete pinch. The price is mostly conceptual/continuing risk; there’s no concrete loss beyond the dropped key, so cost feels modest. Kael’s return relieves pressure rather than testing Elara with a harder trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is focused and pressure coheres: the prophecy audibly stirs, the mist thickens, he ventures deeper, and silences lengthen—one clear tightening. Agency is decisive and method-specific (negative space) with the antagonist pressure (prophecy) answering back. The price is mostly internal and atmospheric rather than a foreclosed option or loss, which tempers impact. Still, resolution is earned by his tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes are signaled (decode the leaves; potential transformation), but pressure escalates gently with little resistance. The major turn stems from discovery rather than a tested risk or trade-off. No meaningful loss or foreclosed option is made explicit; consequences are largely positive. The piece deepens pattern rather than tightening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—trade rigid order for chance—is clearly signaled and tightened by the physical danger of the collapsing cavern. The improvisation beat narrows options and forces action, interweaving internal and external conflict. However, the price is relatively low (no lasting loss) and coincidence does some heavy lifting before agency takes over.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure tightens through procedural risk as the heat and mystical surge threaten imbalance, requiring countermeasures that cost attention and control. The dominant stake—redeeming negligence by risky craft—stays coherent and escalates to the pivotal pour. The whispers deepen, rather than shortcut, the conflict. Stakes remain intimate but tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes cohere around healing Thorne; pressure tightens as resistance cracks and other souls gather, increasing density and urgency. The decisive deepening is Elara’s shift to playful discord to retrieve laughter. The cost is mostly emotional, and risks feel safe—failure never looms as a concrete consequence. Still, under the accumulative lens, the escalation reads clean and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant internal stake (forgiveness via pain) is signaled early and escalates when he deliberately triggers trauma with the strap. The cost is palpable in the memory surges and physical strain, culminating in a stance crystallization to continue. External antagonism is off-stage, but the coherent pressure of environment + body keeps tension live. One meaningful tightening suffices though a sharper foreclosed alternative could raise stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is clear early (unlock the dismissed chronicle to honor the overlooked) and deepens as the painting reveals her father’s last act. Escalation comes via recognition → method revelation → active unsealing; agency is present in the whispered translation. The price is largely conceptual/emotional; there’s little on-page risk or trade-off beyond releasing guarded histories. Tension is steady but quiet, fitting the mode.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.7)
    Pressure grows from lights dying to discovery to spectral confrontation to revealed ledgers and release. Stakes remain largely conceptual and spiritual; little tangible cost narrows the felt jeopardy. The key tightening is the decision to pry open the ceiling, but consequences are soft.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—achieve eternity at the cost of stability—tightens convincingly when the whisper spreads and fractures mount. Elias’s agency drives the turn; the price (destruction/entombment in stasis) is unmistakable. Escalation is largely one decisive act with accumulating consequences rather than multiple turns, but cadence intensifies effectively. A small added resistance beat could have sharpened the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (healing a paralyzing dispute) is clear and tightens as the storm approaches; the ritual is a concrete attempt. Escalation is mostly a density increase and cadence shift; opposition is soft—skeptics quickly assent and the storm yields to the ceremony without a real reversal. The price of choosing myth over empiricism is gestured at but not pressed into a hard trade-off on the page. Resolution arises from protagonist agency but reads relatively frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and the pressure coheres around the tether. The main tightening is the chip’s near-wilt under doubt, which tests commitment and forces an internal recommitment to truth. However, the resolution involves minimal trade-off and no meaningful loss; the path never seriously narrows beyond that wobble. Tension operates but peaks gently.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—approaching the nexus where “explanations fail”—intensifies through descent, narrowing passage, and the psychometry’s hinge-beat visions. The meaningful turn is the charged discovery/use of the compass, but stakes remain largely conceptual and internal. The choice to defer further exploration is credible but carries limited on-page cost. Tension is steady rather than tightening to a sharper edge.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are signaled (alliances fraying, tempests unbound) and pressure deepens as the hum intensifies and visions complicate the present. Escalation is mostly tonal/accumulative, with one meaningful tightening when she commits to carve; there’s no credible alternative tested on the page. The storm easing provides resolution but with minimal felt cost. The conflict remains largely abstract rather than viscerally contested.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are internal (understanding night-blooming flowers as a proxy for grief) and escalate through a deepening pattern rather than reversals. The meaningful tightening arrives when dawn’s angle reveals the hidden etchings and the postcards align as “keys.” The price is felt but subtle—acceptance through tears and a renunciation of avoidance. Momentum never flags, though a more acute trade-off would strengthen the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clear (truth vs. psychic snare), with escalation from dream pressure to physical descent to metaphysical negotiation. The beach-debris parley is a tactical tightening that tests commitment. Cost is present but feels somewhat low-friction at the peak when the guardian responds quickly. Still, internal and external conflicts braid coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stakes are signaled (revival vs. retreat), but pressure escalates mostly through internal resolve rather than external resistance. The meaningful tightening is Elias’s refusal of escape and magic, yet no tangible counterforce tests the plan on the page. Costs are present but conceptual; a single concrete setback would have intensified the turn. The result is steady, not gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres through a single tightening: immersion catalyzes an accidental prophecy that reframes the dominant stake. Stakes are internal but real—his archive’s purpose versus his own isolation. The resulting choice (quiet acceptance, heart-immersion) is a clear stance crystallization. The price is subtle and non-heroic but legible for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—restoring order and securing inheritance—is stated early and escalates through a methodical deepening rather than sharp reversals. The meaningful tightening comes as the mists draw inward and the vortex edges clarify, culminating in the reopening act. However, opposition remains mostly atmospheric; pressure is serene and cost understated. The absence of a hard trade-off keeps tension moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure coheres around whether to trigger the siren at midnight; the clock provides a meaningful tightening. The reversal is quiet—he opts for the bell—earning resolution through agency. Stakes remain modest and internal, with limited felt price beyond principle and potential risk. The subtle deepening via microclimate anomalies adds texture more than torque.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure is primarily internal; escalation comes from the shard’s discovery and the visions, culminating in a stance change rather than a reversal. The dominant stake—whether Elias can reframe fall as flourishing—tightens through the act of mapping and empathizing. Visible price is muted; the piece opts for endurance/attention rather than trade-off. Still, agency drives the deepening and resolves the tension credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are coherent (untangle the covenant without breaking its silence), and pressure tightens around the box discovery and the refusal to speak. The seam-tracing is a clear escalatory tactic that alters the situation. Still, the conflict remains low-friction; opposition is atmospheric rather than resistant, and the price of the chosen path is implied more than felt. One meaningful deepening occurs, appropriately scaled to length.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes (understanding time vs. remaining indebted/hidden) are clear, and escalation arrives via clandestine communication and assembly. However, external pressure is mostly implied; overseers never intervene, so cost feels primarily conceptual. The decisive turn (inserting the fragment) is protagonist-driven and narrows options to a point of no return. A tangible jeopardy beat would sharpen the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (how to relate to incompletion) is established early and tightened by the kite’s break. The snap forecloses an option—continuing to control—and forces a stance of release; the cost is felt but understated. Escalation is modest and primarily internal, fitting the lens but lacking a second pinch or counterforce. The resolution arises from her altered stance rather than convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (legacy before death) is clear, with a meaningful deepening at the hidden chamber reveal. Pressure accrues through time and physical exertion rather than active opposition; the piece favors reverent transformation over conflict. The cost is mostly implied (illness, stamina) and not sharply tested. Still, the build toward a charged, reweighted end holds.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is legible (will she hold to doubt or accept a redefined homecoming), with a single deepening at the amber pedestal. Pressure coheres but remains low-intensity; the envoys’ arrival resolves tension without testing a hard trade-off. The on-page price is more ideological than embodied. Still, the convergence moment meaningfully reweights options.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure deepens through accumulative pattern: deciphered calls narrow options to the harshest sites; the chorus tightens as he commits. Stakes remain intimate (restoration, concord), and resolution flows from his agency. However, there’s minimal visible price or foreclosed path beyond effort and exposure. The turn is clear but not harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is stable (closeness vs. loss); escalation deepens through the discovery and decoding, then re-frames with the riddle’s “echo.” Cost is clear: he trades the fantasy of physical reunion for an earned stasis of presence-by-echo. Agency is internal but decisive in how he reads and accepts. Pressure is mostly textural rather than situational, but it tightens once meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure coheres and rises: a subtle sighting becomes a pursuit that demands action and interpretation, culminating in the apparition and reweighted ritual. The dominant stake (connection through memory/physics) tightens once meaningfully with the console/coordinates reveal. Costs remain primarily internal; no visible foreclosed path beyond solitude softening. Still, agency drives escalation rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is legible from the start (repair the Veil by amending the Board). Escalation tightens through increasingly significant swaps and the arrival of spectral guardians; the king swap functions as the peak test. Agency drives every turn, guided by the sundial. The on-page price is danger and exertion, not a sharper trade-off or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (unbinding the archive without harm) is signaled and escalates when the binding resists, forcing a tactical and ethical turn from “release” to “sever.” Agency drives resolution; coincidence does not solve anything. The price is primarily conceptual/ethical rather than bodily, but it meaningfully narrows her options. Tension accrues at sentence and beat levels.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reclaim home without erasing the present—is legible early and tightens as thunder/peril intensify. The key turn is Elowen’s decision to “seed the final invocation,” accepting pain to transform the illusions’ function. The cost (loss integrated, present at risk) is explicit and felt. Escalation is primarily internal but reads as earned and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stakes (absolution tethered to lifting the curse) are clear, and pressure tightens from study to descent to hallucinated judgment. The key turn—choosing to forgive at the mirror—forecloses self-punishment and risks pride vs. accountability. Emotional cost is felt; however, a sharper on-page reversal or tangible loss in the maze would heighten the price. Escalation is steady rather than searing.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—divert judgment by refracting truth—arrives early and escalates via growing group, time pressure, and Elara’s personal cost. The tightening is felt when her own betrayal threatens to collapse the spectrum she’s building. Still, pressure stays mostly conceptual; no tangible loss or foreclosed tactic occurs on the page beyond the resolve to continue. The end’s rebellion stance lands, but the price remains largely internal and projected.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (anchoring meaning against oblivion) is established early and tightens as the sea batters the hull and time compresses. Agency is ritual narration; the choice to face specific failures creates the deepening. External hazard and inner reckoning braid effectively, though the visible cost remains largely internalized. One decisive tightening rather than a full reversal keeps it under 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (honor the hidden promise) is signaled early and tightens when the skylight’s beam begins to fade. The meaningful choice is to accept the sanctuary’s transience, fix it in the shell, and speak the vow—resolution by stance rather than conquest. Cost is the acceptance that he cannot hold the “pocket of eternity,” only echo it. Escalation is gentle; no sharp reversal beyond the time squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stake is focused (beckon Harlan’s spirit to prove subtlety’s power), and escalation is a single meaningful deepening from preparation to uncertain waiting to response. Agency drives the turn—he chooses scent as method and commits to stillness instead of force. The visible price and foreclosed alternative remain soft; nothing seriously pushes back beyond risk of failure. Tension sits more in expectancy than in conflict, effective but contained.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (building a guiding network) tightens through the stuck dial and wavering clarity under the waning moon, testing resolve. The reversal via the young mother’s call consolidates the network, and the dawn arrivals reweight the effort with consequence. The cost is endurance and solitude; escalation is quiet but legible under the accumulative lens. A slightly sharper on-page trade-off would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—mitigating the empathy virus’s costs—tightens from speculation to the irreversible act of implantation. The on-page reversal comes when belief in “quack” texts becomes action despite fear, with pain and potential cognitive tradeoffs made legible. Internal and external conflicts interweave without melodrama. Consequences land in the final measured-voice outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—decoding the stranger’s gesture—tightens through the act of investigation and culminates in a meaningful stance shift. Pressure is internal, coherently escalating from curiosity to compulsion to repricing isolation. The cost is felt but muted; there’s little jeopardy or loss beyond a chosen burden. Still, one decisive deepening occurs and reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    Primary stake (reach the doorway before the flood) is clear and escalates as water rises and the ledge narrows. The mechanical click and glimmer provide a satisfying tightening that ushers the final choice. Pressure is coherent but gentle; there’s little on-page sacrifice beyond urgency. Still, the situational clock and his agency at the arch give a solid spine.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes (soul/reign vs. curse) are clear, and the climb provides escalation. However, the resolution lacks resistance—once the grotto is found, the incantation succeeds without on-page complication or price. The dominant stake never faces a concrete test beyond arrival and willpower, softening tension near the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can they revalue their bond without erasing loss?—tightens through Thorne’s hesitation and confession, then Elara’s decision to act. The infusion is a meaningful deepening rather than a hard reversal. Costs are implied (relinquishing an identity organized around absence) but not felt as a sharp forfeiture. Tension is steady, not severe.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: capture and contain the destabilizing dream before it “devours” him. Escalation is a deepening rather than a reversal—writing the dream reconfigures the threat into a bearable arc. The price (renouncing pure envy, accepting interwoven selves) is felt if quiet. Slightly low-heat pressure keeps it from higher.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (reclaiming a sense of self/attunement) is signaled early and deepens via the interpretive reading and joint polishing. Escalation is subtle but legible: object-as-witness → tested against escapement → restored and claimed. Price is quiet—acceptance rather than reversal—but present. A single, meaningful tightening lands, though pressure never sharpens to a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant internal stake is clear and escalates as pain builds and she presses the quill harder, culminating in the transformation rune. The tightening is primarily cadence and density, consistent with the accumulative lens. Felt price exists but remains gentle—no significant reversal or new obstacle complicates the path. Resolution is earned by agency rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reconnect/apologize before demolition—tightens with the live clock (chainsaws revving) and weakening charge. Elara’s agency drives escalation (using the bottle, metaphor-bridged outreach), and the cost is the necessarily brief reunion. The single cadence shift is sufficient at this length. Slight softness: external threat stays mostly atmospheric rather than forcing a harder trade-off beyond time.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes (truth vs illusion) are signaled early and deepen through the arbitration layers with spectral guardians. There is a clear tightening as definition precision counters deception, culminating in a decisive shattering. However, consequences remain largely metaphysical; we don’t see a concrete loss or narrowed option that bites. Tension is steady rather than sharply escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—comprehending time’s true measure—tightens through the risky attempt to reverse the clock. The escalation is protagonist-driven (inserting the key, counting backward), and the price is felt (blood, irreversible insight). The external jeopardy remains low; the piece stays internal, but the cadence shift at reversal provides a real turn. A clearer risk of damaging the station or losing the day’s data could have sharpened stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure climbs from intrusion alert to confrontation to a risky test of the prototype; the knowledge turn deepens stakes rather than broadens them. The decisive beat is her choice to aim and modulate the laser, enabling the conceptual flip. External risk stays low and the cost is primarily internal, keeping the arc modest. Still, one meaningful tightening occurs and the ending is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are internal—how to honor legacy without repeating ruin—and they tighten through the interpretive sequence toward a stance choice. The visible price is a refusal of tidy answers and a foreclosed path to gambling or judgmental closure, felt in tears and the deliberate snuffing of light. Escalation is modest but present via patterned deepening rather than reversals. A sharper on-page cost would lift intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (release vs. clinging) is signaled early and tightens via the harmonica’s induced solitude and Clara’s pause (“it makes me feel so alone”). The meaningful turn arrives when Clara reframes her next call as farewell, not reconciliation. Cost is emotional and legible in the dissolution of the “wrong number friendship” and the choice to release. Slightly tidy progression, but pressure coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are clear but escalation is modest; pressure deepens texturally (twilight → night → bioluminescence) rather than through a narrowing of options. The decisive act (renew the covenant, begin work) is internally driven and largely unopposed, with limited visible cost. The piece avoids reversals and external friction; tension is more mood than dilemma. The final turn is satisfying but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are internal (loneliness vs connection) and escalate via a clear tightening—rumor catalyzes a group climb and a circle of sharing. The visible price is his departure with the rock and the choice to remain elusive. Pressure is coherent but gentle; no hard test forces a sharp trade-off. Still, agency drives the turns.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant emotional stake is signaled early and escalates through increasing harmonic density toward the silence at the core. The warnings and inner guilt hint at risk, but opposition remains largely internal; no hard trade-off or loss is exacted. The final choice (to accept forgiveness) is earned but relatively low-friction. Tension operates, though softly, at sentence and scene scales.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are clear (repair the brother-arc, redeem her work), but pressure remains gentle: discovery and execution unfold without obstacle or hard trade. The meaningful tightening is the decision to edit a precise contingency, yet it doesn’t foreclose much. The sense of risk is present in image, not in on-page consequences. Escalation is adequate but not bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—finding a way to be seen/soothed through silence—tightens when Lir urges “Now, translate it,” forcing Elias to sing. The fishermen’s attention raises the social risk and reweights the outcome. The price is primarily emotional; escalation is real but gentle, fitting the accumulative lens. A sharper foreclosed option or explicit consequence would heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes (recovering a promise/secret) are clear, but pressure rarely tightens; obstacles yield without resistance or trade-offs. The “trail” functions as a guided tour rather than escalating test. The ending lacks a visible price beyond acceptance. Escalation reads flat despite the coherent throughline.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are focused (salvage the shared dream before Kai’s oblivion): pressure tightens as she abandons protocols, intensifies the method, and commits at the lagoon under a cosmic clock. The exhale reverses her bid, forcing a costly endurance stance. No antagonist is needed; agency drives turns. The price is unmistakable, though one more concrete loss mid-scene could heighten the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (rescue and principle) is clear and tightens through the maze, malfunctioning light, and the dead-end container. A meaningful turn occurs with the discovery of Marco and the decision to use the covert lock. Escalation is steady but the price paid remains light; danger and effort are felt more atmospherically than as hard trade-offs. Still, agency—not coincidence—resolves the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are internal: can Elara find a new stance toward grief. Pressure deepens through the crafted patterns and the mirror’s use, creating a clear cadence shift. However, escalation is more tonal than oppositional, with limited on-page trade-offs. Her small acts (yielding the mirror, tracing the shutter, releasing a sigh) credibly precipitate the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are coherent (quiet defiance vs. elders) and tighten with the synchronized displays turning on. The escalation is gentle—more a density build than a hard narrowing of options—and the elders’ dismissal underscores risk without forcing a confrontation. Agency is present in planning and execution, but a felt price is deferred. The ending’s stance crystallizes, though consequences remain mostly offstage.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (self-acceptance versus safety) is signaled early and tightens at the whale’s call and island reveal. The decisive press of scrimshaw to chest forecloses the dockworker path. Escalation remains coherent under an accumulative/situational lens; no antagonist needed. The price is felt but not materially dramatized beyond implication.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (finding bearable lightness in grief) is signaled early and modestly deepened by the sister memory and the bird’s emerging form. Escalation is primarily a density increase rather than narrowing options, fitting the accumulative mode. The visible “price” is endurance and the acceptance of a limited relief rather than catharsis. It’s persuasive but low-tempo, with limited tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—crossing once-sacred boundaries—intensifies via the hum and the “tremor of certainty,” culminating in the wade across. Escalation is clear under the accumulative lens, but external pressure or a trade-off is minimal. The decree is lifted, reducing friction; consequences are implied rather than dramatized. Agency drives the turn, yet the felt price is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—restoring Thorne’s stolen clarity—tightens through Elias’s escalating initiatives culminating in the risky performance. Pressure is coherent but gentle; caution is signaled (thorned stem) without an on-page complication or reversal that exacts a clear price. The anniversary timing adds cadence rather than urgency. Resolution arises from their agency, though felt cost remains modest.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (reconfiguring connection despite loss) is clear, and pressure escalates via thresholds: static barrier, joy’s ephemerality, factory overtones, culminating in the brother’s timbre. Escalation is driven by her agency—ringing, refracting, and explicitly questioning assumptions. The price is gentle: surrendering isolation as protection; there’s no hard external consequence, which limits intensity. Still, the cadence tightens credibly under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes center on whether grief calcifies or turns toward renewal, tightening as Elara acts and Lira engages the telescope. The illumination beat functions as the primary escalation; however, opposition is gentle and cost is largely internal and implied. No reversal tests Elara’s commitment under strain. The result is moving but not pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are primarily conceptual (understanding and guiding cultural recovery) with modest interpersonal pressure. The meaningful tightening is Elara’s decision to fully confide and demonstrate a quantified method, leading to collaborative ideation with Theo. However, there’s minimal felt price or foreclosed path on the page, so tension never bites. Resolution is earned but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: access forbidden core without corruption, escalating through improvised purification to the child-figure test. Agency drives turns (reject patterns, remove veil, touch the apex); the cost is legible. Tension grows via density and cadence rather than reversals, fitting the lens. A slightly sharper on-page price beyond the stated loss of “untainted heart” could heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is clear early (save/rebind an unanchored hope). Escalation occurs via the footage overlay revealing fracture and drawing the shadow in, but pressure feels gentle and largely uncontested. The resolution is earned through her method rather than a difficult trade-off, with limited on-page price. Tension is mostly atmospheric rather than agonistic.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure tightens via the ritual of reconstruction and the internal peeling of lies, culminating in the choice to report Mira. Stakes are clear (integrity vs. enabling harm), though escalation is more tonal than adversarial. The felt cost is present but modestly rendered on-page. No reversal, but a meaningful deepening consistent with the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (closure) is clear and escalates through the dig to the opal’s revelation. The physical risk post-surgery and the emotional price are legible, culminating in a narrowing choice to confront the scar’s story. Some turns resolve a bit easily (no significant resistance once digging starts), but the tightening still works for this length. Agency, not coincidence, drives the decisive beat.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—is clear and tightens as the psychometry reveals Theo and the letters, culminating in Elara’s vow. Escalation is textural: nurturing incubation rather than a hard reversal, yet the cadence shift at the discovery and the ghostly song finding its tune provide a meaningful deepening. The visible price is largely emotional, not material, but it reads on the page. Pressure remains coherent without coincidence-based relief.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake (unlock creativity) is signaled early and deepens through the shift from effort to surrender. Escalation reads as a density increase—cosmic voices grow, tracing intensifies, then a decisive tactic change to rest. The price is subtle (relinquishing control/time) rather than a sharp trade-off, so the tightening is felt but soft. No antagonist, but internal and external motifs interweave effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (renewal vs erasure through collapse) tightens when he initiates the charm and overlays the clock—branching forces a choice with risk. The pressing of the clock commits him, and the cost is legible: potential loss of sparks and his persisting dreamlessness. Escalation is more textural than adversarial but still narrows options through superposition and peril. Tension stays somewhat abstract, yet the decisive pick of the “spark in the unlit corner” reads as earned agency.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.8)
    Pressure grows through discovery rather than hazard; the dominant stake stays internal and relatively unopposed. The meaningful tightening is the wind-method decoding and the gear’s purpose, but few options are foreclosed and no hard trade-off is forced. Translocation eases rather than complicates movement, reducing friction. The ending resolves by culmination more than tested choice.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on surrendering control to find courage and the hound, with one meaningful tightening: trusting the guides’ indirect routes to a risky ledge and cove. Escalation is gentle rather than pressurized; no explicit foreclosed path beyond relinquishing fear. The resolution arises from Elara’s altered stance, consistent with the lens. Cost is present but soft, limiting peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—safety versus unity/song—tightens as the storm and the forbidden/rare staircase concentrate pressure. The bolt discovery reweights options, prompting a costly acceptance rather than a reversal. The escalation is interior but legible and culminates in a foreclosing choice (remain). The price (continued isolation and silence) reads clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clear (truth vs. forged rule), with a meaningful tightening as the messages proliferate and Varak is forced into the open. Escalation is primarily density-based, consistent with the lens, culminating in a single deliberate act. The price paid feels muted; the victory comes without a hard trade-off on the page. Still, pressure coheres and focuses at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes (recovering lost paths) are signaled early, and escalation emerges through density—assembling layered data until a pattern snaps into view. The tightening is primarily informational; there’s little visible price or foreclosed option beyond psychological strain. Agency drives the turn, but consequences remain conceptual rather than felt in-scene. Quiet, credible, but low heat.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (reigniting a stalled rebellion) is clear and the pressure deepens from contemplation to actionable plan. Escalation is accumulative rather than adversarial; there’s no on-page opposition or credible loss that narrows options. The decision to hum with the stones and broadcast provides a meaningful cadence shift. Costs and trade-offs are implied rather than embodied, limiting intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (upend ossified tradition) is clear and escalates through discovery → decoding → unseal. Pressure is coherent but low-friction; success feels comparatively unresisted and risk-light. The “incantation + tap” climax resolves smoothly without a true trade-off on the page. Tension exists more conceptually than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes (can she hold hope without delusion) are signaled early and tested by the freeze and the decision to confront the photograph. Escalation is modest but coherent: physical jolt → mindful regulation → deliberate confrontation via sketching → reweighting of the talisman. The cost—enduring randomness and relinquishing comforting illusion—reads on the page. A sharper external pinch could heighten pressure, but the internal turn suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (salvage art/sanity) is signaled early, with meaningful tightening as the storm closes in and Elias commits to the threads. The deepening occurs as memories surface and he severs them, narrowing his stance away from the paralysis of regret. The price is felt but not strongly externalized; still, his renunciation of clinging to knots shows earned agency. Tension is steady rather than spiky, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are signaled (unravel the time-slowing, stop the sorcerer) and there is a tightening from camp clues to canyon confrontation. The tactical reversal (her vanishing via ink) changes options, but the conflict resolves with minimal felt price and an information dump via drone. The antagonist pressure is brief; escalation plateaus before the ending. Consequences do not visibly narrow future options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are singular and clear: expose contraband truth vs. uphold duty and order. Pressure tightens from surprise to a decisive act that forecloses safety and complicity. The cost is felt but remains primarily conceptual; no immediate repercussion appears on the page. Still, her agency drives the key turn and redefines what’s possible.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (preserve sanctuary without violence) is signaled, but the main external pressure (the crack) arrives late and resolves quickly through ritual. Escalation is modest; options don’t visibly narrow beyond a single tightening. The price for her stance isn’t strongly felt on the page. Agency is present, yet consequences land more as reassurance than strain.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear early (catch the echo to restore/self-soothe), and pressure coheres as the garden breaks, blooms snarl, and the line’s zigzag intensifies. The key turn arrives when the spike hooks “a shimmering absence” and the constellations pause—an escalation that reads earned. Still, there’s little on-page price or trade-off; success comes without a concrete loss or foreclosed option. Tension is present at sentence and beat levels but stops short of a visceral reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes escalate from rumor to confrontation to exposure, but the turn relies on a swift logical gambit rather than mounting pressure. Elara’s intervention is the key tightening, yet the personal or relational price is muted. Declared world-scale stakes (alien interference) shrink to a contained hoax without friction. Tension works at scene scale but never bites hard.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—transforming guilt—tightens through the discovery of the haunted firmware and the ritual’s risk. The tether action constitutes the meaningful escalation and narrows options. Cost is primarily internal but felt; the “curse” frame supplies external stakes, though obstacles are resolved smoothly. Tension is sustained without needless reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.0)
    Pressure coheres around transforming discord into hush, escalating from clamor to focused communal action. The meaningful tightening is the invitation for others to add their sands, which narrows options from debate to co-creation. Stakes remain intimate but real: social volatility harnessed into a fragile stillness with the risk of future rupture. The price is chiefly the acceptance of impermanence rather than a concrete sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is legible (transform the plaza to protect fragile empathy) and escalates through the discovery and execution of the ritual. The deepening—seeing the fire’s origin and choosing forgiveness—reweights cost and consequence. Pressure remains mostly internal and conceptual; trade-offs are present but not sharply foreclosing alternative tactics. Still, the renaming is a clear agency-driven turn with on-page effects.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on art-as-salvage from despair, tightened by the ghost’s proposition to “intertwine” and the ensuing dance. The escalation is primarily tonal/density-based rather than adversarial, fitting the lens but limiting felt jeopardy. The cost is present but soft; no live option is sharply foreclosed. Still, agency drives the turn and the pressure coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure coheres around whether intimacy can be achieved without the pill, tightening when Elara proposes mapping somatic markers. Escalation is gentle but present, culminating in the development moment and Theo’s softened stance. The price is mostly internal (abandoning the telepathy shortcut), with little tangible loss or risk. Stakes remain intimate and quiet, limiting peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are articulated (avoiding a void for the waking billions) but remain largely abstract in-scene. The key tightening is the discovery and use of the fossil, which deepens options rather than foreclosing them. There’s little visible cost or risk; environmental pressure complicates but never squeezes. Resolution is earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure coheres around decoding the echo before the truth “slips back into silence,” with the murmurs shifting toward harmony as the mosaic assembles. The meaningful tightening is the emerging prophecy that invites a decision to share rather than hoard. Still, opposition is soft and the price of sharing is largely conceptual; no live option is clearly foreclosed on the page. The tension is elegant but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is clear (personal/ethical repair), and one tightening occurs with the approaching footsteps. However, conflict de-escalates swiftly into mutual understanding; no choice forecloses a costly path. The internal and external threads align, but the test of commitment is gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.9)
    Pressure is primarily internal with a single tightening beat at the last gutter tick; escalation is modest. The redefinition of the vow is earned but faces limited resistance, and the felt price is low. External conflict is almost absent; the fog’s delay is a gentle constraint rather than true pressure. The resolution reads inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (understanding resistance) is signaled early and tightens through the fractured-vision sequence. The meaningful deepening is Elias choosing which shard to follow and reweighting “resistance” as sustained compassion. Pressure remains mostly internal with low overt cost, keeping tension modest. Resolution is earned but quiet, with no hard foreclosure beyond an ideological commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure coheres around an internal stake: how to carry grief and vulnerability. Escalation is a steady deepening (journey, hush, ritual) rather than sharp reversal, appropriate to the lens; the rowing pause functions as the key tightening. The price—letting go of the father-bound bloom and accepting impermanence—is present but gentle, with little risk that challenges her resolve. The ending choice reads earned, if comfortable.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are primarily internal (identity, belonging vs. self-reliance) but escalate via concrete tasks. The ritual sequence provides one meaningful tightening that narrows options and forces stance crystallization. The price is present but muted (risk of leaving the sanctuary, relinquishing old passivity). Absence of a counterforce or credible failure risk keeps tension just below top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are primarily internal (isolation vs. reconnection) and signaled early; escalation arrives via the discovered letter and culminates in the approach to Liora. Pressure remains coherent but gentle, with minimal resistance or trade-off beyond exposure. One meaningful tightening occurs (from wandering to the addressed envelope to stepping into the temple). The cost is present but understated, giving a tender rather than urgent arc.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stakes are clear: avert cosmic deception and resist Harlan’s exploitation. Escalation arrives when he storms in and presses for public broadcast, forcing her decisive interference. The reversal is earned and outcome-changing, but the on-page price is relatively light, with limited pushback or immediate consequence. Tension sustains, if not maximally sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear (find the Keystone despite fear) and escalate via the organ’s swell and dimensional instability. The key tightening comes when she resists panic to “trace” rather than lunge, letting sound govern access. The felt price remains mainly internal; no concrete forfeiture or narrowed alternative is dramatized. The resolution is earned but low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake is legible—reviving the case (and empathy) after an evidence purge—but confrontation and resistance remain mostly offstage. Escalation is a gentle deepening: discovery of the ribbon and the insight via sketch. No meaningful reversal or cost beyond quiet risk and resolve, so pressure plateaus. The skeptical detective is mentioned as future pressure rather than felt in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (posthumous reversal) is clear, and pressure coheres as the storm intensifies and time compresses during decoding and transmission. The crate’s coincidence undercuts escalation slightly, and the institutional reply arrives without a hard trade-off on the page. Agency remains central, but the price paid feels mostly emotional rather than materially constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure builds from discovery to pursuit to performance, but escalation is gentle and largely internal. The dominant stake (to move beyond “never”) tightens, yet no poignant trade-off or visible price lands on the page. The protagonist’s agency drives the turns, which is a strength. Overall, the arc deepens rather than narrows options with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central pressure (protecting routes without open conflict) tightens through the rival surveyors and prompts a decisive, character-driven tactic. The rivals retreat a bit easily, softening felt cost at the peak, and the later failure arrives via economic headwinds rather than escalated antagonism. Still, the price lands at the end: success was temporary, and the venture’s loss reweights the journey. Internal and external stakes braid effectively if quietly.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes (decoding the inscriptions to transform how she chronicles) are signaled early, and pressure deepens as the dream becomes a vision. The mentor’s appearance and the Cepheid’s illumination provide the key turn. Yet consequences remain mostly conceptual; no path is foreclosed at visible cost. Tension is present but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are clear early—truth beyond mirrors vs. bodily and moral peril—and tighten as the unbend radiates, risking destabilization. The decisive tactic (expanding circles) deepens pressure and shifts the lake’s rhythm. Costs are more atmospheric than exacted, with little loss or wound to alter later tactics. Still, escalation is protagonist-driven and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (restore balance before the glow fades) is clear, and pressure coheres through one meaningful tightening (the linking act guided by the maze). Agency drives resolution, but opposition is largely environmental and internalized; there’s little friction or setback once the method starts. Cost is present but modest, keeping escalation short of peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes (barter a destiny for peace) are clear, and there is one meaningful tightening when she chooses to press the card to the root and commit. Still, resistance is soft: Thorne’s objection dissipates quickly, and environmental threats stay atmospheric rather than constraining choices. The price is primarily the card; few options are foreclosed beyond that. Tension is steady but not strenuous.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—finding a workable purpose after humiliation and loss—is clear early. Pressure coheres around the near-act of discarding the cloth, tightening into the choice to keep it and re-commit to “after the applause” work. The price paid is quiet and internal, which suits the mode but limits sharpness of escalation. No extraneous reversals dilute focus.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure is primarily interior and textural; the meaningful tightening is the discovery of the seed and the decision to plant it. Stakes remain abstract (physics of passage, reestablishment) with minimal external resistance. The final act forecloses a path of restless pursuit for a quieter, risked acceptance, but consequences are gentle. Escalation is clear, if subdued.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (preserving migrating identities from fog’s eternal now) is clear, and pressure tightens as he alters tactics to avoid shattering essence. The shift from mechanical precision to accepting contradiction is the meaningful deepening. The cost is present but muted—no real loss or foreclosed option beyond endurance—so stakes never fully bite. Still, agency drives the closure through his chosen method and completion of the day’s harvest.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.5)
    Pressure is primarily internal and accumulative; the key tightening is Elias choosing to crown the crystal, foreclosing his inspector stance. Stakes are clear (from bunker-readiness to human reconnection), but opposition is soft and risk feels idealized. The escalation is a steady deepening rather than a reversal, which fits the lens but limits visceral cost. The final act reweights options credibly, if gently.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.7)
    Pressure builds through discovery and interpretation rather than confrontation, consistent with the accumulative lens. The graffiti prompts a mid-scene tightening as he sits to let it “guide” him, leading to the accordion choice that reweights stakes. The cost is mostly internal and modestly scaled but legible. A bit more friction or a tested alternative path would heighten the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (find the library) is signaled early and escalates via the cipher’s reversals and synchronization with the watch’s delays. The key tightening arrives when the reversed cycle forms coordinates. Opposition is primarily temporal/patience; the felt price is modest, so the peak doesn’t fully sharpen into a consequential trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake is clean: choose dream or empire before the solstice promise cools. Escalation passes through a purposeful tightening (the plants’ urging and revelation of the violin’s purpose) to the decisive act of playing. The price is implied—turning from empire-building research—but not tested or exacted on the page. Tension remains internal but credible and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (preserve a spark before oblivion) is signaled early and tightens as the threshold presses. Escalation is a deepening of density and immediacy rather than turns; still, the cadence shift at infusion narrows options to one decisive act. The cost is unmistakable: she trades presence for preservation. Lack of a reversal keeps it shy of the top band but remains fully functional at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake (finding contentment) is clear, and pressure deepens with the hairpin-triggered visions that reweight her pursuit. Escalation is mostly internal and gentle; there’s no sharp foreclosure beyond renouncing the “hunt” for a source. The price is acceptance of endless maintenance rather than a dramatic sacrifice. Still, the turn is discernible and earned within the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (binary leave/stay reframed into nuanced agency) is clear and tightens via the chimes’ interpretations. Thorne’s guidance and the wind’s erratic song escalate pressure toward a single crystallizing act. The price—relinquishing the comfort of absolutes—is legible though not bruising. The resolution is protagonist-driven and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes center on surrendering ego to reverse age, with the risk of not returning unchanged. Escalation is a deepening via ring revelations, culminating in the final ring’s warning. Pressure remains conceptual; no concrete foreclosing choice occurs on the page beyond reaffirmation. The tension is steady but never bites hard.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes (master unmoving navigation) are signaled early and tightened as the birds’ formations demand a reading and then a commitment. The key choice—pressing the arrowhead to her forehead—drives the turn. Still, pressure is largely internal and reverent; no tangible counterforce tests resolve on the page. The hinted future trials help, but the on-page cost remains light.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are legible early (reclaiming non-algorithmic wonder) and escalate via two tightenings: unbinding a guarded object and renouncing safety to descend. The risk is emotional and symbolic rather than mortal, yet it’s on the page and alters options. Resolution stems from her agency—placing the keystone and accepting the cost. The pressure is gentle but coherent under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes tighten credibly as he leaves safety, enters cold water, and commits to the wreck; the key-tag choice forecloses retreat. The decisive deepening is the orb’s revelation, reweighting his vow. External peril is suggested rather than tested, so pressure never quite bites. Still, agency drives all turns and the resolution is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are signaled early (rebirth vs unraveling), and pressure tightens through the violent burst that reframes the path and forces renunciation. The cost is legible and scaled: abandoning the coins (identity, history, method-security) to pursue alignment. Internal and external stakes braid well; the apocalypse backdrop is grounded by a personal price. A slight telescoping of “save the cosmos” remains, but the personal trade-off anchors it.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—naming and binding nameless fears to honor Lira—tightens as the ritual succeeds and demands he accept a new role. The key deepening is when Lira’s voice clarifies the task (“name them all”) and the monsters convert to guardians. The cost remains primarily emotional rather than a hard trade-off, but it’s legible and reweights his path. Pressure is coherent without overcomplication.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is clear and escalates through the accelerating drip pattern and the bell’s gradual knitting. Internal doubt provides some counterpressure, but external resistance is minimal, making the path feel relatively unopposed. The single tightening lands (seven-second pattern/repair), yet the price of success is light, softening the peak tension. Resolution reads earned but low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preventing old resentments from re-flooding the present—is clear, and tension tightens at the grandfather photo. Elias’s decision to convene and reframe is the key turn. However, external resistance is minimal and the families accept the reframe with little on-page friction, softening the felt price. The escalation is credible but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (achieving inner harmony before a world-shifting event) is explicit and tightened by the ritual’s consequences. The meaningful deepening arrives when the murmuration maps onto her equations, forcing a recalibration rather than a triumph-by-decree. The price is chiefly internal—yielding control and allowing sentiment to alter method—credible at this length. Lack of external antagonism trims peak tension but doesn’t stall pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (maintain trust/avoid misfire) is announced early and tightened by the sabotage reveal. The decisive move is revising the log, which reweights the colony’s response; the pressure is coherent but resolves smoothly once transmitted. Cost is mainly psychological; no concrete trade-off or visible loss narrows options. Solid escalation, modest bite.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is clear (vivify the duplicate to resolve custody and reclaim self), and pressure tightens from dispelling illusions to breaching the field to the fusion. Cost appears primarily as internal consequence (flood of emotions); external opposition dissipates too neatly, reducing felt risk at the crest. The decisive act arises from Kai’s agency, but a sharper price or loss would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (reviving stalling creativity) is clear, and the planting is a tightening move that commits him to a direction. Pressure remains low; discomfort and risk (corpse-flower stench) are theoretical rather than dramatized costs. The escalation is a steady deepening rather than a crucible, with minimal foreclosed options. The resolution reads earned but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is legible early and escalates plausibly when the mass “fights back” and the tunnel twists notes into dissonance, forcing Elias to intensify tactics. The meaningful tightening occurs as he adds more blowers, risking overreach to push through. Still, the cost feels light—no tool loss, injury, or ethical trade-off narrows options beyond stamina. Tension works, but never bites hard.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are clear (return vs. exile), and pressure tightens when waiting gives way to a risky internal method. The meaningful turn is Elowen choosing to draw the cold into herself and don the pendant. The price is conceptual and bodily hinted, but not sharply dramatized as a sacrifice or loss. Tension is steady rather than bracing, yet remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is tight: either remain bound to the church’s fate or reforge self through risky work. Escalation is earned via iterations (mercury/sapphire tremor to shatter/melt cycles) and culminates in a knowledge turn that narrows options. The price of rupture is felt conceptually rather than through a concrete consequence on the page. Even without an antagonist, pressure coheres and tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.5)
    Pressure coheres around the need to tune by relinquishing assumptions, with one meaningful tightening at the bias-listing beat. Stakes remain mostly internal; the external risk (height, decay) doesn’t escalate choices beyond mood. The price paid is a stance renunciation rather than a trade-off with visible harm. Resolution is earned by her agency, if gently tested.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake (passengers dissolving) is clear and escalates coherently, narrowing options to Elias’s agency with the radio-pattern method. The pressure turn is singular but meaningful; tension is maintained through the vanishing chorus and the empty hourglass. The resolution is quick and mostly unopposed, with little visible trade-off beyond a conceptual scar. Still, agency—not coincidence—resolves the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (forge connection) is signaled early and escalates via density: weaving → phantom touches → eruption that fractures the setting and self-concept. Agency drives the turn; consequences persist. The price—irreversible memory shifts and a gritty, unsentimental “bond”—is clear. A sharper foreclosed alternative (what he refuses or loses beyond memory flux) could lift the pressure a notch.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes are declared (bridge depths to stars) and there’s one meaningful tightening (storm demo + simulations proving routes). Yet external pressure is mild and complications are minimal; little is foreclosed or lost on the page. Escalation occurs mostly via summarized successes rather than contested beats. The ending’s stance is earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are clear—preserve the voices/atrium—but escalation is gentle: pulses spike, urgency rises, then quick persuasion. There’s no credible loss, pushback, or trade-off on the page; Mira’s compliance reduces pressure at the climax. The tightening is present but not testing. The result reads earned yet low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear (return the unremembered) and tightens with the timed access and claustrophobic passages. Escalation is steady but largely unobstructed; the core powers up without a true reversal or tactical loss. The price is present yet mainly internal and symbolic.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure coheres around restoring Elias under a fragile tether; escalation peaks when his heartbeat count falters during the scan. The tightening is clear but gentle—few hard foreclosures beyond the risk of data loss. Agency remains with Elara, and resolution grows from her improvised method. Stakes feel intimate and earned, if not harrowingly costly.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (preserve the language) tightens as Elar chooses to risk the curse and channel the flock through the diamond into the tunnel. The meaningful turn is the alignment of facets with flight patterns under pressure, with the curse assailing him at peak. The visible price is endurance through visions and tool dimming; consequences are felt but not devastating. Tension is steady rather than jagged, fitting the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (truth vs. joining) tightens through the phone’s revelations and the arrowhead’s activation, culminating in a clear before/after. Escalation is steady but gentler than optimal; Elara meets little friction in choosing metamorphosis. The external and internal lines interweave, yet the price is felt more conceptually than viscerally. Still, the narrowing is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (revive the orchard) is signaled early and escalates through a clear tightening: statues stir, a larger one cracks, and roots begin uprooting anchors. Agency drives the turn—her chosen “resonantly soft” tactic bypasses the guards and scales to a symphonic push. The visible price is limited, so while momentum builds, the risk profile feels relatively safe. Still, the decisive toppling of statues reads earned and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—get contraband and messages across the border—arrives early and tightens at the drone’s breach. The pressure rises briefly (patrol scan, collective held breath) but the risk isn’t tested beyond a single pass; consequences remain offstage. Elias’s agency drives the turn, yet the price paid on the page is modest. Still, the cadence shift with the return note gives a credible deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are quiet but coherent: will he remain bound to silence-as-absence or risk voice to reanimate possibility. Pressure escalates via the fragment’s warming/hum and the bells’ time-softening, culminating in the choice to sing. The price (renouncing a long-kept silence) is present but could bear a sharper on-page ache. Still, the deepening reads as earned and protagonist-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—recovering the place where stories live—is clear and deepens as the air thickens and the scarf hums. Escalation is textural rather than adversarial; pressure grows but faces minimal resistance or trade-off. The turn (memories reawaken) is meaningful yet cost-light. Quiet tension works, but a sharper narrowing of options would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (capture a dream/resolve grief) is signaled early and tightens at the projection when the dream manifests with not-quite-her-brother’s laughter. The decisive turn is a renunciation—choosing release over possession—with a legible emotional price. Escalation is quiet but coherent for the chosen lens; the ritual’s success forces a thematic trade-off. A touch more friction before acceptance could heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are centered on liberating an idea from fear; escalation occurs through consent and attention rather than resistance. The locksmith performs the key act, softening Elara’s agency at the peak; her main commitment is the handover and sustained gaze. The tightening is real (fear cracking under the star’s pulse), but the felt price is light. Still, the final stance forecloses drift and sets a path.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are intimate and legible early (lost memory as inheritance), and the tightening occurs when the mushroom’s gills reveal “broken constellations.” However, resistance is minimal and the solution proceeds with few obstacles or trade-offs. The escalation reads more as deepening attention than pressure under threat.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (reversing exile by building resilience) is signaled and coheres. Escalation comes via the tea-geometry mapping and the shadow’s pulsing; the tightening is modest but present. Resolution stems from Elara’s guidance and Lir’s assent, not coincidence. The price remains more conceptual than sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes (preserving wonder) remain abstractly high but face little on-page pressure; success arrives without obstruction or sacrifice. There’s a gentle deepening from preparation to planting, yet no reversal or narrowing of options. The villagers’ relief retroactively validates the attempt but doesn’t test it. Escalation is more ceremonial than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is focused (free/ground the brother and others), and escalation reads as deepening via denser hush and increasingly raw confession, culminating in the final knot. Cost is felt but modest (emotional exposure over material loss), and the path is relatively frictionless once the method is set. Still, pressure coheres and tightens credibly under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (personal reopening of the past) is clear and tightens via the footage pattern and the concealed latch. Escalation is primarily investigative rather than adversarial, but turns narrow options credibly. The final act is protagonist-driven and resolves the immediate pressure. A sharper on-page price would raise the band.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure deepens credibly from curiosity to a tactically focused search for the transmission, culminating in a stance crystallization. The radio and note are concrete beats that narrow interpretive options toward release. The stakes remain internal, with limited visible cost; the escalation is subtle rather than sharply coercive. Still, the cadence tightens enough for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—freeing the ghost—is clear, and escalation occurs via the impending storm and the encoding process. Pressure remains gentle; few options close and there’s little friction or cost for Elowen. The final act derives from her agency, but the path is unimpeded. The urgency reads more lyrical than strenuous.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.8)
    Pressure accumulates, but chiefly texturally; the dominant stake (finding joy beneath anguish before arrival) remains largely unthreatened. The gusts and ticking elevator create tempo rather than a true narrowing of options or visible price. The key turn is the diary’s reveal and progressive unlocking, not a forced trade-off. Resolution is earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are singular and coherent: an inner proof under external scarcity. Escalation is a steady tightening (air thinning, “quietly explosive” pressure) toward a vow and descent, with risk as the visible cost. Agency is attention and endurance; the refusal to abandon the method under strain feels earned. The tension is felt, though it never tips into a hard reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear early: preserve the guild’s essence before demolition. Pressure tightens via the discovery (new method) and the encroaching machines; completion arrives at the last possible moment. The cost is legible though the on-page opposition is environmental, not antagonistic, and reversals are minimal. Escalation fits the accumulative lens and reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes—discovery and communal belonging versus danger—are stated and deepen once the cipher resolves to a volatile luminance. Pressure rises modestly; obstacles are minimal and mostly internal. The decisive narrowing comes from recognizing the warning, but no meaningful price is paid yet. Escalation is competent rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure escalates through discovery and alignment rather than antagonism; the key tightening is the uncapping that forces a committed path to the grand timepiece. Stakes remain intimate—learning the universal pulse—so tension is present but gentle. The resolution is earned by her choice and craft, though the price is wispy. One tangible trade-off or risk would sharpen the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake (heal a dying planet through unity) is clear, and pressure deepens via the accumulating dawn messages and group debate. Escalation is modest; once the bell is found, the solution arrives with little resistance or trade-off. The convenient nebula-seed spray reduces on-page struggle. Consequences are positive and immediate, muting tension.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes (how the end comes) are legible and centered. The meaningful tightening is her shift from hesitation to humming the lullaby and then adjusting the hands to “buy moments,” a trade that costs her something emotionally and ethically. Pressure remains mostly internal and lyric, with minimal pushback; escalation is modest but present under the accumulative lens. The cost is felt but could be sharper or more contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear (save the family before frost) and escalates via the ticking clock and the delicate assembly constraint. The meaningful tightening arrives when the blueprint demands precise, no-touch placement across dangerous paths. Resolution flows from Elara’s agency, with a felt price in her renewed bond to the orchard. Stakes remain personal-scaled but consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stakes (repairing a maternal bond) are clear, and pressure tightens from reflection to decision. The meaningful turn is the call; it forecloses continued avoidance. Yet escalation is gentle and mostly interior; little friction or counterpressure tests her resolve. The price is primarily emotional exposure, not a contested or costly trade.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (find the origin place) is clear early and deepens via the ritual: tallying absences and incising escalate pressure. The visible cost is the depletion of the bottled moonlight and the exposure of personal voids. No antagonist, but the accumulative tightening reads. The reveal is earned by her agency rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (contain/transform remorse) is established early and deepens inside the pavilion. The key tightening is Elara choosing to ingest orbs raw, accepting contagion as cost. Stakes are primarily internal; external peril is minimal, keeping tension contained but coherent. The resolution is earned by her persistence rather than luck.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stakes (mend a fragmented community) are signaled early, and the tightening beat is Elara’s decision to risk public failure by convening the first talk. Her mediation in multilingual moments provides a small deepening. Yet resistance dissipates quickly and no credible trade-off or loss is felt, so pressure never truly bites. The resolution derives from her agency but without a price that lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure escalates from intent to irreversible self-modification, with pain and altered cognition as the on-page price. The decisive act narrows options (self altered; no going back), and the canyon/mirror amplify the strain. No true reversal, but the intensification is sufficient at this length. Consequences feel live in the charged poise of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are legible (find the hidden combinations before the inversion wanes) and pressure lifts at the gravity flip. However, the path to the vials is near-frictionless, with little loss or trade-off on the page. The hourglass constraint helps escalation but cost clarity remains soft. Resolution feels earned but low-risk.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—coax music in a silenced world—is clear and tightened by the decision to align the insulator and strum. Escalation is a deepening of density rather than reversals, with a meaningful intensification when the first tone emerges and the second note reveals layered memory. The price is subdued (risk of shattering the hush or failing), so pressure remains gentle. Still, the cadence shift at the end reweights options credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is clear (reclaim light before the moon phase), and pressure deepens as patterns accumulate toward the aurora. Escalation is largely internal and procedural; there’s a meaningful tightening but little felt risk or sacrifice. Agency drives the turn, but the price paid is soft. The absence of an opposing force on the page keeps tension moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—recovering a silence to advance empathy—is signaled early and tightened by the impending fireworks. The tuner sequence provides the key pressure point; the unlock and subsequent reading shift knowledge and deepen stakes. However, opposition is gentle and resolution arrives without much tactical loss or reversal. The emotional price is credible but not sharply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can she endure and find calm within motion—tightens decisively at the bloom’s release. The cost is legible and immediate; her tactic (journaling) is a consequential adaptation rather than a handwave. External stakes (elder-soothing potion) remain mostly aspirational, but the internal test resolves. Tension works at beat and sentence levels without requiring extra reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stakes (survive inversion, find source) are clear, and the inversion beat is the lone meaningful tightening. However, obstacles glide aside; once the anchors hold, the path to the vortex and artifact is relatively frictionless. Costs and trade-offs are minimal, so tension plateaus after discovery. Agency is present but rarely tested.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes (diagnose the fatal convergence to prevent repeats) are clear, but pressure escalates primarily through data accumulation rather than hard choices. The key tightening is the recognition of chokepoint gusts and the secondary vortex, reweighting the site as an ongoing hazard. Agency is steady and procedural; no option is foreclosed at cost beyond time and emotional burden. Effective within the chosen mode, but low heat.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are focused—unfetter the hush and awaken wonder—and escalation occurs via the calibrated bell strikes, culminating at the “chisel” instant. The tightening is real but low-friction; no real loss or adverse consequence tests resolve. Agency drives the outcome without coincidence. The final turn satisfies but lacks a sharp, felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure tightens when she chooses to play (risking repeating the failure) and enters a liminal space to face her doubtful self. The dominant stake—salvaging purpose through true understanding—deepens rather than flips, suitable for the lyric lens. Cost is internal but legible: relinquishing control to vulnerability and accepting culpability. A slight softness remains in the absence of an external counterforce, but the internal crucible sustains tension.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—impose math on emotion—tightens when the press/halo turns her method against her. The backfire is the key deepening; tearing the broadsheet and recalibrating stance forecloses the “pure equation” path. The price is more interior than external, but it’s legible and charges the ending. A slightly clearer trade-off or external constraint would heighten pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (honor Thorne by spreading wonder) is clear and tightens when the pendant hum compels engagement with the shepherd. The visible cost is the loss of the pendant and a deepened solitude as Elias continues without it. Escalation is modest and internal, but it credibly narrows options to a single value-driven act. Absence of counterpressure beyond caution keeps stakes intimate rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—validation that forces self-reckoning—tightens with the “shifted hush” and the sister’s face. Agency is quiet but decisive: sustained attention, apology, and the closing act of returning the prism. Cost is internal yet felt, foreclosing the comfort of projection. Escalation is textural rather than reversal-driven but clear.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is legible early and tightens through the required sacrifice. The puzzle’s promise raises hope, and the price (unweaving the grand tapestry) makes the climax a true trade-off. Pressure stays coherent under the accumulative lens. Slightly gentle escalation tempo keeps it just below top-tier intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is legible and Elowen’s agency drives the turn; the vigil in the shaft provides one meaningful tightening. However, opposition is light: no concrete setback or counterforce tests his resolve on the page. Cost exists but reads modest for the declared planetary stakes. The escalation is steady rather than harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (uncover the withheld truth without breaking realities) is signaled and tightens as she redirects through increasingly dangerous parallels. The “weight” constraint emerges as the key deepening, forcing a new stance. Cost is felt more than enacted; no specific sacrifice occurs on-page beyond risk and knowledge. Still, the escalation is clearly driven by her agency and choices with one meaningful intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes (coastline safety and stewardship of a tradition) are clear early; the pressure deepens as he uncovers the anonymous chain and Harlan’s plea. Escalation is primarily internal; there’s little resistance or reversal beyond eerie atmosphere and disarray. The key tightening is Elias choosing responsibility, with a modest but legible price (embracing solitude and burden). It resolves through his agency rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes—reshape dawn, temper a storm, risk self-obsolescence—are legible and interwoven. Escalation arrives as density/cadence increase and the prophecy of his fading, culminating in a final steering pulse and extinguishing. Still, pressure seldom tightens into a hard trade-off; the storm is gentled without a visible price paid beyond conceptual role loss. The lack of a concrete foreclosed option keeps this below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—risking exposure to magnetize stories—is signaled early and tightens via the ritual’s revelations. The deepening occurs as the wing’s veins and borrowed memories reweight her fear, culminating in her step toward the edge. The price remains conceptual; no concrete loss or foreclosed path is dramatized beyond accepting risk. Still, the cadence shift is clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes center on unlocking the trees’ witness; pressure coheres via the pin’s echo and the storm’s hush. The meaningful tightening occurs when the echo crystallizes his insight, leading to the overlay and healing. Escalation is primarily internal and textural; the solution arrives smoothly once the pattern clicks, with minimal resistance. The felt price is modest, limiting intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is clear and consistent; pressure deepens as songs summon echoes and the fruit-paste swaddling activates the window. Escalation is smooth but low-friction—little resistance or sacrifice beyond effort—and the price paid is largely conceptual. The final act is hers and causally earns the rekindling. Solid tightening without a sharp trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stakes (risk of discovery and internal entanglement) are signaled, with a single meaningful tightening when footsteps approach. However, opposition remains notional—no guard/enforcer intersects his path—and choices face little resistance. The “staying while leaving” tactic is a nice turn but costs are not concretely tested. Tension glides rather than ratchets.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clear: reclaiming sacredness to counter forgetting and seek absolution. Pressure deepens as acts move from covert planting to ritual bread offering and interior reckoning. The escalation is subtle yet present; the price is ongoing guilt and the knowledge of inevitable re-encroachment. Lack of an external counterforce keeps intensity modest.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clear—save the luminous vows from oblivion—and escalation occurs when a particular vow falters at 432 Hz, prompting deeper sampling and recalibration. The pressure tightens once, but the sequence reads low-friction; apparent obstacles resolve without visible loss or trade-off. Agency drives resolution, yet the price is mostly effort and attention. The conflict remains elegant but safe.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is clear (protect father/truce; catch betrayal’s snap) and escalates through repeated failed tactics into a risky physical intervention. The narrowing of options is legible when cronies circle and suspicion hardens, and the dousing of the flare is an earned pivot. Consequences read more implied than embodied, and the horns partly offload resolution. Still, agency drives the critical turn.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes remain largely conceptual (understanding the carriers) and escalate modestly via the ring’s guidance and the revealed convergence. Opposition is minimal; the carriers answer readily, and no option is foreclosed. The final inward turn lacks a felt price or forced tradeoff, muting tension. As a result, pressure deepens but does not tighten decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (creation vs. self-suppression) tightens through the discovery→code→unlock sequence. The reversal comes with choosing to use the tools and accept the cost, transforming fear into practice. Escalation is modest but coherent under an accumulative/causal lens. Lack of external pressure keeps it from higher intensity, but internal pressure is sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes (truth restoring social trust amid water scarcity) are clear and escalate through the map’s assembly and Kael’s intervention into the descent and discovery. However, obstacles in the tunnels and the Vault are encountered with relative ease; the main test is moral rather than contested. A stronger on-page price or forced trade-off at the Vault would heighten the turn. Still, the deepening from rumor to tangible archive is effective.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake (preserve wonder) is clear and pressure coheres as the symphony intensifies and reaches listeners. Escalation is felt through density and cadence, not reversals; the skeptic’s transformation is the main tightening. Cost remains mostly conceptual/emotional with limited on-page trade-offs. Agency is present but gentle—he initiates and endures more than he chooses under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is focused: contain inner chaos or risk the farm. Escalation is credibly tightened by the storm and the static’s resistance, forcing the choice to amplify miniaturization; the cost is embodied (heat, blistering, keeping one shard). The resolution is protagonist-driven and not coincidental. Stakes remain personal-scaled yet consequential to the farm’s survival.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are localized but coherent: reopening the flow of words in a divided community. Escalation comes via accumulating testimonies and the outside world’s intrusion, culminating in the key turn. The solution feels somewhat convenient (Tomas’s memory, the locket yielding easily), and the price paid is soft. Still, agency drives the final act and resolves the central pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes (freeing Liora) are declared and pursued, with one deepening turn as Silas resists then syncs. Pressure grows, but adversity is mild: alarms “bubble faintly,” persuasion succeeds quickly, and no option is sharply foreclosed. The cost feels primarily emotional and symbolic. Escalation is present but not bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (retrieve a lost past) is legible and escalates via descent and unstable gravity. A tightening occurs when he commits to digging under fluctuating pressure. However, obstacles yield quickly—the augury points true and the parcel appears without a significant setback. Emotional cost lands, but tactical resistance is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early, and the mapping/flow sequence provides a single meaningful tightening. However, escalation remains primarily procedural and internal, with minimal felt risk or cost on the page. The world-scale stakes remain abstract, muting pressure at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure coheres around truth vs. polite fictions, with one meaningful tightening when Elara decides to interrogate. The reveal and gifting of the seal reweight options but exact little on-page price. No reversals are required at this length, yet the absence of a sharper trade-off keeps tension moderate. Stakes remain personal and conceptual rather than forced into melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear early and the archiving sequence provides a measured tightening as memories grow more demanding. Escalation is textural rather than adversarial, fitting the lens; the completion at dawn functions as a mild clock. The price (emotional toll, surrendering the whispers) is implied but not dramatically stressed, limiting impact. Still, the protagonist’s agency drives the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—personal absolution—tightens through the act of self-wounding and the forging of the unlink. The choice forecloses a path (continued bondage to the lover) with a visible price. Internal and external gestures interweave; no antagonist is needed. Pressure is quiet but escalates via ritual commitment rather than repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes (freeing echoes, saving the sister) are clear by the midpoint; escalation occurs through the shell’s deepening disclosures culminating in the ritual. The primary tightening is the risk of offering her own echo, yet the path to resolution feels largely unopposed and quickly successful once she chooses to sing. The price is felt but modestly staged, reducing tension at the peak. A single decisive intensification lands, but without a concrete obstacle or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are legible (expose truth to free ghosts; salvage purity) and there’s one meaningful deepening when the midshipman apparition reframes the expedition’s bonds. Pressure remains gentle; obstacles and prices aren’t dramatized beyond process care. The surge of “borrowed starlight” functions as escalation, but without a difficult trade-off. Resolution arises from her steady method rather than tested commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure is inward and modest; escalation comes as a cadence shift when the whistle gathers fireflies and he commits to the moon paths. Stakes (to truly perceive hidden effort) deepen rather than narrow, with no hard trade-off or visible loss beyond time and dawn’s dispersal. Agency drives the turn at the river but cost stays conceptual. The quiet arc is coherent but not intensely testing.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are signaled (truth vs myth with life-sustaining tech) and deepen through discovery, but resistance is largely environmental and never bites. The tightening comes from deciphering the memos and locating the device; there’s no substantive counterforce testing her resolve. The cost remains mostly implied rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (reshape allegiances via prophecy) is early and clear; escalation hinges on the storm intensifying and the portico breaking to “clarify” signals. Agency is present but indirect, with key societal outcomes told rather than tested on the page. The tightening is real yet lacks a hard trade-off scene under pressure. Cost is implied (fracture, solitude burden) more than viscerally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure coheres around whether Elias can transform silence into bridge-song; escalation arrives through accumulating jars and the mechanism’s hesitant response. There’s one meaningful deepening (children’s laughter to grandfather’s voice to full symphony). Opposition is largely atmospheric, so the narrowing of options and price paid remain gentle. The result is earned but low-conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear early (protect the artifact) and escalate once through the ice’s advance and the ritual’s intensification. The key tightening is the commitment to vibrational matching, which narrows options away from brute force. Resolution is earned by Elias’s agency. The felt price is limited, so pressure never bites as hard as it could.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are coherent (transform impatience into sustainable revolt) with a meaningful tightening at the full moon/after-rain crossing. Agency drives the turn; the ritualized waiting reconfigures tactics, and the crossing forecloses haste. The lack of a direct antagonistic push on the page limits pressure intensity. Still, internal versus external conflict interweave effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes (truth vs. institutional control) are legible early and deepen with the lantern’s vision. Escalation is primarily an internal reweighting rather than a confrontation; the major tightening is Elias choosing to go unredacted. The on-page price and counter-force are muted, which limits pressure. Still, the internal and external threads braid effectively at the decision beat.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure tightens through the careful repair and the storm’s crescendo, culminating in the heart’s restart and Elias’s decision. The dominant stake is internal (redeeming regret), and it coheres. However, escalation is gentle; few options are foreclosed beyond the moral stance he adopts. Still, the deepening from observation to commitment reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake (animating desire in machine and sounding a premature call) is clear, but on-page antagonistic pressure is minimal. The main tightening is procedural—mapping runes to motions—rather than a conflict that narrows options with cost. The activation functions as culmination rather than a test. Stakes remain largely conceptual, reducing felt jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are focused: truth versus corporate surveillance and ethical risk. Escalation tightens through sealed files and the need to lie twice, culminating in a costly refusal to expose. The price is felt conceptually more than viscerally; no counterforce directly presses back on the final beat. Still, the narrowing of options reads cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—averting a violent feud—is established early, and pressure tightens when Elara delays to glean truths. Escalation is gentle but coherent; the consequence is a persuasive compromise rather than a hard tradeoff. The resolution is earned yet low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear and escalates: curiosity → confirmation attempt (recording) → storm test where belief meets action. The tightening moment is choosing to guide a family across shifting ice as the hum merges with gale. Costs are implied (risk, renunciation of pure spectatorship) rather than explicitly paid, but they charge the last beat. No antagonist needed; internal and external pressures braid cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are modest but coherent: reframing solitude and loss under a live, shared night constraint. The tightening occurs when Elena reveals the burned letter and actively reframes both their breakups. The resolution derives from her stance, not luck, though prices are subtle rather than sharply dramatized. Tension remains low-boil, matching the lens, but never fully bites.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is legible early: prevent the echo from fraying. Pressure deepens through the clearing around the echo and the parapet’s intensified hum, culminating in the consecration; however, escalation is smooth rather than testing, with no hard reversal or visible sacrifice. The resolution is earned but cost-light. Tension operates more in cadence than jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are clear (transforming communal pain), but pressure escalates modestly via time and pattern density rather than true narrowing of options. The child’s photo functions as a discovery that reweights her approach and nudges a decision to share. No significant reversal or visible price beyond intention. Tension is steady but low.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (reframing language’s future) is clear, with a meaningful deepening as echoes layer and past debates resurface. Pressure accrues texturally but remains low-intensity; options don’t narrow so much as clarify. Resolution is driven by Elias’s stance crystallization rather than a risky trade-off. The price—accepting the end of printed primacy—is evident but soft.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and escalates via pattern-deepening: from smudging chalk to constructing a guidance system, to channeling sound and recording it. The main tightening is internal and environmental rather than adversarial, but it narrows options and culminates credibly. The price is subdued, reducing peak tension slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (meet the launch window) is signaled early and escalates via tremors and the malfunctioning timepiece. A meaningful tightening occurs when the spinning hand corrupts sync arrays, forcing an inventive fix. Resolution arises from Elias’s agency rather than coincidence. The felt price is understated but the pressure arc is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—achieving a peaceful, “flawless” goodbye—is signaled early and tightens as Elara moves from song to shared harmony to reunion. The meaningful turn is the daughter’s entry as the hymn intensifies, reweighting options. Cost is emotional—release, regret, and finality. Pressure is steady rather than jagged, fitting the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.0)
    Pressure is primarily puzzle-driven and accumulative; the tightening is the shift from observation to closing loops to activate the orrery. Stakes are intriguing but abstract—no live antagonist or immediate risk, so tension stays intellectual. The price is largely responsibility and knowledge rather than a felt loss or foreclosed option. Still, the deepening from myth to mechanism provides a credible escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are clear—reclaiming a child or salvaging joy—and escalate through the discovery and use of the tooth. The decisive turn is Elara’s adapted ritual and the outcome that forces acceptance. Cost is legible but gentle, more elegiac than wrenching. Pressure could tighten once more with a concrete risk or trade-off in the ritual itself.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes focus on whether Elara remains isolated or risks outreach aligned with her vow against fire. Escalation is quiet but present: the “weighing” and the deliberate polishing deepen commitment and narrow options. The final act of revealing the shard to villagers provides a credible turn. However, pressures are largely internal and never corner her into a visibly costly trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming meaning through connection—tightens when Elara notices Kai and chooses to proffer the pendant. The price is emotional exposure; the move forecloses retreat into isolation. Escalation is quiet but legible under an accumulative lens, with the icicle pattern functioning as a preparatory deepening. Stakes remain intimate rather than acute, keeping the ceiling just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—finish despite fear—stays coherent, with one meaningful tightening as the timeframe narrows and the cameos accumulate. Agency is evident in the rite and the vow; resolution is earned by commitment rather than coincidence. The price (foreclosing the living flux of hopes by binding them) is present but not sharply dramatized. No major reversal beyond the deepening cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (restore practices to save the harvest) is present, and the alignment window offers a mild tightening. However, escalation is frictionless: no setback or trade-off tests commitment, and success feels guaranteed once the song begins. Cost remains largely declared (sleepless tinkering) rather than paid within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure coheres around whether she can convert grief into a navigable map; escalation is the ritual’s density increase and the “seal” as a narrowing move. Cost is primarily endurance and the risk of failure at the symbolic heart, not a hard trade-off against a live alternative. The final act is protagonist-driven and earns the transformation. A sharper foreclosed option would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (capture/preserve echoes to heal later) is clear, and the methodical trials deepen toward the whirring breakthrough. Pressure rises via pattern and timing shifts, but resistance is mild; setbacks or hard trade-offs are largely absent. The final choice is a stance crystallization, not a forced trade with visible loss. Tension is present but restrained.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is legible and the work of calcification provides steady, coherent pressure. The meaningful tightening is modest—density accumulates rather than narrows options or forces a hard trade-off. No sharp reversal; cost is endurance and continued entrapment. The cadence shift at dawn deepens stakes but does not escalate them decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—containing grief—tightens through the “crystallized time” sequence and the escalating kettle whistle to a boil-over that forces a stance. The reversal is modest but clear: from interior suspension to embodied making. The price is the relinquishment of the safer stasis of memory for a forward action that may re-open pain. Pressure remains coherent without requiring an antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (salvaging self through regret) is clear, and pressure tightens at the ghost’s accusation. Elara’s tactic shift—offering others’ fragments—narrows options and entails a price (abandoning retrieval of her own device). The conflict remains primarily internal; a sharper external constraint or counter-move might deepen cost. Still, the negotiation beat reads as a meaningful turn.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (revive the terminal’s “heart”) is clear, and escalation occurs as attempts lead to a hum, then light. Pressure is modest—few setbacks or trade-offs beyond a wrong turn—and consequences remain primarily conceptual. Agency drives resolution, but the felt price is low, limiting torque. Still, the cadence tightens credibly toward the glow.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are internal but legible: will he continue to be ruled by fear of failure or choose a reconciled stance toward his dream. The tightening comes when he produces and places the unfinished face among the crystals, foreclosing the path of perfectionist completion. Cost is present but soft, framed as peace rather than loss; there’s little escalation beyond atmospheric deepening. The resolution is earned by his choice, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are clear (risk the dive, risk self-confrontation), and the key tightening is the decision to submerge when instinct pricks. Escalation is modest; no real reversal or complication challenges his competence. The cost at closure is primarily conceptual rather than a felt loss or trade-off on the page. Still, the internal and external threads braid coherently toward the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake (extract/preserve encoded knowledge) is clear and tightens through resistance, prolonged exposure, and time pressure via fog and cold. Escalation is a cadence shift rather than a hard reversal; the rope’s “warming/loosening” turn lands. Cost is felt as endurance and vulnerability, not a sharp trade-off. Stakes stay coherent, if a touch gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is internal (how to transform absence into presence); the tightening comes from choosing the garden over escape and committing to write. Escalation is modest and largely textural rather than conflictual; little on-page resistance tests the goal. The visible price is present but not contested in-scene, keeping tension muted. Still, the final stance is earned by sustained agency.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are coherent (recovering wonder vs. mechanical sterility), with one meaningful deepening at the egg’s reveal. Escalation comes via accumulating reverie and quaking pressure rather than a hard turn; the decisive act is a vow rather than a risky trade-off. The discovery is earned by his assembly but still skirts coincidence. Cost is felt conceptually, not paid on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.9)
    Conflict is interior and ritualistic, deepening when the wanderer appears and when Elara binds the graft with the coin. Stakes remain focused on healing inherited damage, with one meaningful tightening as her private act becomes shared and witnessed. The cost remains mostly conceptual rather than felt as a trade-off on the page. Quiet tension works, but escalation never truly pinches her options.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is clear early (free memories) and tightens at the fused box. The key deepening is the choice to use patience rather than force, narrowing options tactically. The price is modest (time, cold, relinquishing force), and the turn is quiet rather than contested. Tension is steady but lacks a sharp reversal or more punishing cost.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (whether to share and risk perpetuating the cycle) is signaled early and tightens at the nexus. Escalation is quiet but real: thicker mists, the rift, vision of descendants, then a chosen advance. The price is acceptance of unbroken cycles rather than a loss on the page, so tension remains muted. Still, agency drives the closure and options narrow credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are primarily internal—can Elias shape grief—and the piece deepens rather than pivots. The meaningful tightening arrives when the ribbon reveals patterns and the inscription shifts to the collective. Cost is present but gentle, more reverent than fraught; escalation reads as density increase rather than narrowing options. Effective, though not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restoring communal balance through truth—stays coherent. Escalation is internal but real: the vision deepens from memory to mandate via the inscriptions, narrowing options to confession. The price is social exposure and the end of a protective lie. Slight softness in on-page resistance keeps it shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake (decoding the riddle) is clear but faces little resistance; tension stays steady rather than tightening. The meaningful turn is the discovery of chess-pattern symbols, yet it doesn’t force a trade-off or foreclose options. Coincidence (finding the case) drives the inciting beat; agency drives the decoding but without risk. The resolution is gentle and earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (can she chart an actionable future under repression and scarcity) is legible, and tension tightens as she delays the stroke to refine models. Escalation is quiet and internal, but the “before the pen meets” clock and council threat create coherent pressure. The price is primarily endurance and risk rather than a concrete loss on-page. One deepening turn suffices but never quite bites blood-deep.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are clear—revive stories under censorship—but pressure is soft: discovery, compliance, and success occur without a concrete hurdle. The main tightening comes from deciding to test the dust and then to seed scores; no option is foreclosed on the page. The risk of censors is evoked but never tests him in scene. As a result, escalation feels more wondrous than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and deepens as she assembles and seals the mask under the ticking exhibit. The meaningful tightening is the live clock of the rocking chair and the decision to don then relinquish the mask, foreclosing a comforting illusion. Prices are internal but felt: choosing partial revelation over self-soothing. A single sharper beat of resistance could heighten escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—share the relic to fuel a new regime or bury it to preserve old rhythms—is clear early and sharpens with the strata dig. The journal intensifies the conflict, forcing a trade-off with cost. Resolution proceeds from the protagonist’s agency, not coincidence. Stakes remain internal but consequential and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes—finding harmony from discord—are signaled early and deepen via the “subtracting noise” method. Pressure builds through iterative practice and confession, culminating in a quiet convergence at the zither. Still, the turns remain low-risk; no option is starkly foreclosed beyond a toned-down stance against division. The cost is mostly conceptual and emotional, not sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes—reclaiming history via cultivation under a fleeting cosmic window—are legible and deepen with pruning/planting and the seed’s sprout at dawn. Pressure escalates modestly; there’s no active antagonist or on-page setback beyond time and ruin, and the price paid remains largely conceptual. The reprise of pruning at the end offers a credible tightening but not a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure coheres from routine toll-taking to a consequential reveal, tightening through Elias’s constraint against lying. The visible cost is modest and the stakes mostly intellectual/ethical, keeping tension on a quiet register. Still, there’s a meaningful deepening when the riddle reframes disclosure and Lira commits to repair. A sharper price or contested pushback from Lira could heighten escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (reviving a house’s “aliveness”) is legible and the meaningful tightening is the choice to perform the sanctifying ritual. However, pressure remains low; no antagonistic force or material trade-off tests commitment. The house “stirs,” but costs and foreclosed alternatives are soft. The piece is compelling but not tense.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (escape/transform belief) is clear and tightened by the failing dome and hairline fracture. Escalation comes from accepting risk and acting precisely with the thread. The solution succeeds with minimal setback; price and trade-off remain implied more than felt. Still, agency drives the turn and reweights options.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is clear (break the loop/recapture the missed texture) and escalates through the proof and rupture. Agency drives the turn; coincidence (dice) seeds tactics rather than solving. The cost is implied rather than exacted, so the tightening feels slightly cushioned. Still, the cadence shift at rupture reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clear (revive/remind collective kindness), and pressure accumulates through intensifying visions toward the incantation’s completion. The meaningful tightening is a cadence shift rather than a hard reversal; opposition is mostly atmospheric (insomnia, isolation) rather than active. The rooftop “hum” and the passerby’s smile pay off the risk of belief. Still, the conflict remains inward and abstract, with limited price visibly exacted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are singular and legible: preserve a fragile tradition before time and climate erase it. Escalation crystallizes when the lens quickens the melt, narrowing options and forcing a trade-off between static preservation and living revival. The cost is visible (corrosion, loss of an archival buffer) and the resolution is agent-driven. A second small complication or consequence on the descent could have sharpened the squeeze further.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—defy fate/hunger—tightens via the tide and the deadline of dawn. Escalation arises from Elias’s agency (decoding, aligning symbols, initiating the ritual), with one meaningful intensification at the awakening. The price is the spent yoyo and a narrowed outcome: a personal bending of time rather than a total victory, which reads. A sharper on-page trade-off or loss mid-beat could have heightened the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is focused; escalation proceeds via discovery (dictionary paradox) to confession and confrontation. The “mental photograph” turn is clever but slightly luck-adjacent, reducing the sense of hard price. Emotional exposure is the main cost, but it’s asserted more than dramatized. Still, there’s a coherent tightening from lure → method → test.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—preserve the orchard by harmonizing the storm—tightens credibly as the storm breaks. The key turn is Leeward’s dubbing and expansion of fractal resonance across the circle, converting threat into bass line. The price paid is mostly risk/endurance rather than a felt loss, which keeps escalation just shy of peak intensity. Still, agency drives resolution rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear from the outset and tightens when she risks summoning/angling the turtle and persists after silence. The reversal—watchers answer via waves—redefines options and exacts a price (brother’s transformation; the breach’s consequences). Agency drives the turn; coincidence does not resolve anything. The open vow maintains pressure credibly rather than diffusing it.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—truth vs consoling myth—is clear and moderately tightened by the discovery of the illuminated letter. Pressure is primarily internal, with one meaningful deepening when records and survivor accounts reweight the letter’s claims. The cost is implied (abandoning communal solace), but there’s no embodied counterforce on the page to stress-test his resolve. Escalation is therefore present but subdued.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.9)
    Pressure coheres internally—duty versus honoring absences—and tightens at the inkwell turn into the decision to embed notes. The escalation is meaningful but muted, with minimal visible price or foreclosed path on the page. The “wresting” beat provides a tactile rise, yet consequences remain largely conceptual. A sharper trade-off or sacrifice would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (uncovering truth) is signaled early and tightens when the stamp aligns with maps, shifting options from ruin to relocation. Escalation is primarily informational and internal; no concrete jeopardy tests her commitment in-scene. The final resolve to “readjust the world’s understanding” is earned but low-friction. A small external pressure spike would sharpen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—whether Elias can reconfigure grief—tightens when the first crane lives and the island answers, deepening cost and commitment. Escalation comes through his agency (gem selection, incantations, folding, release), not coincidence. The pressure remains internal but coherent; the repetition of making becomes a disciplined test of resolve. The price is the letting-go of dream fragments he’d hoarded, reconfiguring his options.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear early—find and weaponize “unused potential”—and escalates through the crystal’s pulse to orbital coordinates and a launched digital spear. The meaningful tightening is the repricing of “pools” from salvation to trap, which narrows options to counterstrike. The price reads more as moral/identity reconfiguration than a concrete sacrifice. Antagonistic pressure is faceless but coherent; agency drives the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (decode belonging) is clear, and escalation is a density increase of data/anomalies leading to convergence and the final etch. The lever pulls mark tangible pressure points, but the conflict remains largely internal/procedural without a hard trade-off or risk. Stakes never quite bite—no credible loss or foreclosed option beyond the conceptual. Resolution is earned but low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—truth vs. protective lie—is signaled early and deepened by the found objects (watch hand, knotted family tree). Escalation is an internal tightening rather than a sharp reversal, culminating in the vow. Price is felt but mostly conceptual; the lack of immediate external push keeps pressure just shy of peak. Still, the decisive reorientation reads earned within this length.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—peace versus personal and strategic cost—stays coherent, with tightening at the midpoint pause and the synchronized handoff. The price is credible (forfeiting strategic intel and the talisman), and agency drives resolution. Escalation is quiet rather than crucible-hot; there’s no hard reversal, but pressure coheres under the situational lens. A slightly sharper on-page risk beat could have heightened stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake (reconciliation/self-repair) is clear, with one meaningful deepening when the celestial route fails and he adopts the poles. Escalation remains internal and atmospheric; cost stays abstract with the reunion solved by coincidence and the apology summarized. No strong on-page sacrifice or foreclosed option is shown at the climax. Tension thins rather than tightens at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (will he confront the harm he’s done) is signaled by the procedure and tightens at the labyrinth fork, where choosing “right” exacts the price of facing victim-visions. Pressure escalates as the lake reveals relics and the baseball warms, narrowing flight options. Closure is earned by agency, not coincidence. Costs land emotionally if not materially, appropriate for the design.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is legible, and pressure tightens from discovery to transformation to conjuration. The key trade-off—accept metamorphosis to regain Thorne—reads clearly. Escalation is steady rather than surprising, with no sharp reversal, but agency drives the turn. The cost is present, though its sting is muted by the ease of the reunion.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (reclaiming lost time to re-anchor to her daughter) is clear, and pressure coheres as ritual intensifies: tracing → saucer alignment → card revelations → daughter’s print. The cadence tightens toward a single revealing act rather than multiple reversals, fitting the lens. The price is internal (repentance and acceptance of limited time) rather than externally enforced, keeping stakes intimate but credible. Slight softness: minimal resistance or risk beyond emotional suffocation reduces edge.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—opening a compassionate dimension—guides continuous pressure via delving, stitching, and embedding the tear. Escalation is a measured intensification rather than reversals, appropriate to the lens. The final stitch is a meaningful tightening; agency drives the outcome. Costs remain largely internal and soft, slightly limiting peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes remain largely internal (understanding transformation) with external payoffs arriving via coincidence rather than pressure-testing a difficult choice. The key act (releasing bugs) is generous but not risky; no option foreclosed on-page beyond time/effort. Escalation is a density swell (more light, villagers, volcano harmony) rather than tightening cost. The resolution feels gentle and inevitable, not earned against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are signaled (ignite a silent revolution), but escalation remains smooth rather than tightening—no reversal or live threat tests commitment. The blackout and cipher enable progress without resistance. The gathering of allies reads as frictionless, and the descent proceeds without cost. The final “beginning” image lacks a concrete price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes (master the curse/find the mentor) are signaled early and deepen when the mandala hums and futures align. Escalation is primarily internal and procedural; external pressure is minimal, so the felt price of stepping through is muted. The one meaningful tightening—activation revealing the mentor—is effective. Some tension dissipates into wonder rather than sharpened trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (get the poem out) is clear, with a meaningful tightening when the timer chimes and he commits to the descent. Pressure is mostly internal and accumulative; the external stakes remain inferred rather than actively testing him on-page. The agency at closure is protagonist-driven with a visible trade-off (safety vs. risk). One decisive intensification suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes center on whether confrontation becomes violence or alliance; pressure increases via deciphering and a bout of practice that converts anxiety into resolve. The choice narrows options credibly at the door but doesn’t exact an immediate, felt cost. Tension is maintained, yet the risk of accepting an anonymous overture is under-dramatized in the final beats. A sharper on-page consequence or sacrifice would elevate escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—build a subversive library—stays clear, with one meaningful tightening when the guard’s light intrudes. Most escalation is montage-soft; risk and trade-offs are asserted more than dramatized, with limited on-page tests. Agency drives progress (tin smuggling, repair, circle readings), but the price is mostly implied. A slightly sharper on-page jeopardy would intensify cost.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear early; escalation proceeds through discovery and a performance that reweights his options. The meaningful tightening arrives when the clock reveals the embedded compass and he commits to projecting and playing. Opposition is mostly atmospheric—little resistance or trade-off beyond time and resolve—so the price feels contained. Still, agency drives the crescendo and the ending is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (fortify collective memory before the monsoon) tightens via the dream-revealed ritual and a timed dawn gathering. The escalation is internally driven and coherent, though losses or reversals are mild (primarily doubt rather than concrete sacrifice). The final stance is earned and open but not soft. A sharper trade-off or visible price would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes (can he transmute regret into a voiced apology) are signaled early and tighten through the deciphering and ritual. Escalation is quiet but legible: puzzling leads to action that risks reopening grief. The final choice to speak aloud and bind pine into lace forecloses his isolation. Pressure is modest; no hard trade-off beyond emotional exposure keeps it below top band.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.8)

The conflict deepens effectively when the abstract quest becomes a concrete need to heal a dying man. Elara’s agency drives the resolution, and the price paid is one of emotional surrender. While the escalation is contained within a single scene, it provides a meaningful tightening of pressure that forces the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.0)
    The stakes are established early and escalate with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story establishes a powerful, personal stake—processing trauma through creation—and maintains coherent pressure toward a single, decisive climax. The escalation is effective for the accumulative lens, intensifying focus and sensory input rather than relying on external plot turns.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stakes—Elara's identity and survival versus Marcus's conspiracy—are established early and escalate effectively with his arrival. This tightens the conflict from an investigation into a direct confrontation, forcing a decisive choice. The resolution is driven by protagonist agency, and the cost (the destruction of her former life) is palpable, making the final victory feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.3)
    The conflict is primarily internal and atmospheric, which is executed with precision under the accumulative lens. The dominant stake—Elara’s ability to begin her map before all light is lost—is established early and intensifies beautifully. The pressure coheres around the dimming sky and the final star, providing a natural and potent tightening. The resolution, where her obsession is "sated for now," is an act of agency (endurance and creation) with a clear, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes its internal, philosophical stake early and deepens it effectively through Elara's agency. The discovery and use of the violin serves as a meaningful intensification, forcing a trade-off: the hope for a simple answer is replaced by a more complex, profound reality. The final state of "changed yet eternally sweeping" makes the conceptual cost of her discovery palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    The central conflict—Elias's internal struggle between guarded isolation and a desire for transparent connection—is the story's engine. Pressure escalates effectively when he witnesses a mirrored vulnerability in others, forcing a choice that forecloses his path as a passive observer. The stake is personal and resonant, and the cost of his final action (exposing his own metaphorical scars) is unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a clear and compelling philosophical stake: Elias's intimate reciprocity with the garden versus the world's cold data. The conflict deepens effectively toward the climax, where his lifelong belief is tested and affirmed. The cost is legible—the final invalidation of the quantifiable world in favor of an unquantifiable truth. The score is capped here because the escalation is triggered by a somewhat convenient technological signal (the Luckometer spike) rather than purely by the character's agency against pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—proving the theory—is clear and consistent. The story executes one meaningful tightening by committing to the experiment despite the stated risk of the nexus destabilizing. However, this risk remains an abstract threat rather than a visceral pressure, slightly softening the tension of the climax. The resolution is earned, but the lack of a more tangible cost or trade-off keeps it shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.4)
    The central stake—unraveling Isabella's secret—is signaled early and escalated with superb control. The protagonist’s agency drives the climactic turn, where his choice to play the violin forces a resolution at a clear, tangible cost: the partial revelation of the truth for the price of the complete message. This trade-off feels significant and gives the ending its powerful, bittersweet weight.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.3)
    The dominant internal stake—whether to remain in stasis or accept a terrible truth and act—is established immediately and deepens with elegant pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central conflict—the keeper's desire for serene observation versus the physical decay of his sanctuary—is established with elegance. The stake is the preservation of his "crumbling peace." The discovery of the swan provides a meaningful deepening, shifting the goal from endurance to escape and renewal. The final resolution feels earned under the accumulative lens, though the lack of active opposition or difficult trade-offs keeps the pressure from reaching its highest potential.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—Elena's attempt to nurture wonder in a grieving boy—is established early and tested against Theo's guardedness. The solar eclipse provides a natural and powerful point of escalation, tightening the emotional focus and forcing a moment of shared vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.8)
    The central stake—understanding the displaced axis—is established early and pursued relentlessly. The escalation is textural, deepening with each discovery rather than through direct confrontation. The key tightening occurs when Elowen realizes restoration is impossible, forcing a re-evaluation of her goal and paying the cost of accepting a diminished purpose, which is powerfully rendered in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.9)
    The central stake—Elias’s desire to transform his monotonous life—is clear and personal. The conflict escalates effectively when the coincidence of Maris's dream introduces an uncontrollable, prophetic element, deepening the stakes from a personal game to a fated event.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stakes—the complete possession of the dimensional anchor—are high and established early. The conflict escalates effectively under the accumulative lens, with the entity's pressure mounting in direct response to the priest's actions. Protagonist agency is total, the final choice is his, and the cost of eternal vigilance is made legible in the final paragraph, but the score is capped by prose-level issues.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.0)
    The stakes escalate seamlessly from personal safety to a principled resistance against a systemic threat.

The cost is the permanent loss of his safe, quiet life, which is made palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story masterfully handles its internal stakes. The central conflict—Elias's struggle between his cautious self-preservation and his need to understand grief—is signaled early and deepens with a single, decisive action: uncorking the vial. This choice, under the pressure of the plant's transformation, directly leads to the climax where the cost of his suppressed sorrow is paid in full view. The escalation is purely internal but feels momentous and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story establishes a powerful dominant stake: the preservation of mortal, imperfect identity versus a formless, cosmic transcendence. The pressure deepens appropriately for an accumulative lens, moving from mystery to revelation to a final, costly choice. The cost of either decision is made clear and feels significant. The tension is slightly undercut by the character's detached, "ethically playful" posture, which intellectualizes the conflict at the peak moment of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—maintaining hope and finding meaning in a ruined world—is established immediately and remains the focus. The conflict is primarily atmospheric and internal (community vs. despair). The pressure deepens decisively when Elias passes the bowl, transforming his personal ritual into a shared act of communal healing and vulnerability. The cost is the open acknowledgment of their collective, unfinished stories, which charges the final image with a quiet but undeniable weight.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.0)
    The conflict is purely internal yet possesses palpable tension. The dominant stake—Elara's potential for wholeness—is established early and tested in the climax. The pressure escalates beautifully under an accumulative lens as the elixir takes hold, leading to a decisive deepening of her state. Her agency is absolute; she initiates, endures, and embraces the change, paying the price of her former detachment to achieve her goal. The resolution feels both cathartic and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=2.5)
    This is the story's most significant failure. There is a near-total absence of conflict or meaningful escalation. The central stake—Mira's struggling archive—is presented as an easily solved problem once Elias appears. No obstacles, reversals, or difficult trade-offs emerge; the plot progresses smoothly toward a happy resolution without a single moment of genuine pressure. The lack of a meaningful tightening of stakes leaves the narrative inert.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s need for belonging—is established immediately and remains the focus. Under the accumulative lens, the conflict deepens effectively through shared frustration and growing connection, rather than through escalating external threats. The final resolution is driven by the characters' agency, and the cost is clear and poignant: acceptance is found not in erasing loss, but in sharing its weight.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story signals its dominant stake—finding the echo birthplace—early and escalates pressure effectively. The "giant's nap" timeframe provides a clear ticking clock. The central tightening point, the decision to "borrow time," is a decisive choice with a significant, non-reversible consequence. This cost is made explicit in the final beat, creating a satisfying and poignant resolution that is earned directly through the protagonist's high-stakes action.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—Elowen's need to reframe her unending grief—is established early and pursued with focus. The pressure is internal and escalates through the deep concentration of the ritual, which serves as a meaningful deepening of her struggle. The resolution is driven entirely by her agency, and the cost is the acceptance of loss as an integral, rather than subtractive, part of herself, which is made unmistakable in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.0)
    The central conflict between the safety of invisibility and the need for connection is powerfully rendered. The discovery of the tape reel serves as a decisive deepening of the stake, escalating Elias's passive desire into an active purpose driven by his own agency. The cost of this choice—the loss of his protected solitude—is palpable in the final scene, making the resolution earned and meaningful.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—risking humanity for profound understanding—is established early and pursued with focus. The conflict is primarily internal but is effectively externalized by the pressure of the storm season. The story executes a single, meaningful deepening of this stake, culminating in a choice where the cost is unmistakable and directly tied to the protagonist's agency in releasing control.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—Elias's internal quest for meaning in a desolate world—is signaled early and powerfully deepened by the encounter with Mira. The exchange of the brooch is a meaningful turn driven by character agency, trading a solitary symbol for a shared connection. The cost is tangible (loss of the relic) and the resolution feels earned, shifting the conflict from an individual struggle to a collective one.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes are high and personal—Elara's autonomy and soul—and are effectively escalated from initial unease to a final, violent takeover. The pressure builds steadily under the causal lens, leading to a point of no return. The conflict's impact is slightly undercut by the expository reveal of the antagonists' motives during the climax ("Elara realized the unseen forces' true nature..."), which pauses the action to explain the stakes rather than letting them be felt purely through the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—restoring the community's hope—is signaled early and addressed directly in the climax. The conflict is primarily internal and atmospheric (Elara vs. despair). The discovery of the valve provides a meaningful deepening of the conflict's texture. However, the resolution feels somewhat frictionless; the townspeople's wariness dissolves quickly without a moment of earned resistance or a more visible cost paid by Elara in that final scene.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—confronting her family's past—is signaled early and drives all action. The pressure escalates effectively from a personal dare to a physical journey into a supernatural space. The key tightening occurs when Elara uses the punch, a decisive act of agency that forecloses the option of turning back and commits her to an unknown, high-stakes path.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story establishes clear internal stakes for both characters and deepens them effectively under an accumulative lens. The pressure builds not through external action but through the intensification of patterns—whale songs, stellar charts, numeric harmony—culminating in a revelatory vision. The cost for both characters is legible and emotionally resonant, a perfect execution for this narrative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story builds pressure effectively around a single, dominant internal stake: Elowen's battle against eternal ennui. This stake is signaled early and tested through her decision to use the cursed amulet—a choice with a clear, unknown risk. The escalation is driven by her agency, culminating in a climax that deepens the stakes by providing a partial answer and a new, perhaps more demanding, purpose. The cost—a temporary glimpse that fuels an endless chase—is legible and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.0)
    The stake—Elena's need to find moral balance in her father's legacy—is clear and compelling. The conflict escalates through her own agency, moving from passive waiting to the decisive, risky action of picking the lock. This tightening forecloses the option of remaining a passive observer and the final reveal pays a clear price: the destruction of her simple, "honest" worldview for a more complex and burdensome one.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.9)
    The stakes—preserving the "tactile essence" of history against a silent blight—are metaphysical yet deeply felt. The story achieves escalation appropriate to its textural lens not through external incident, but through a deepening of the protagonist's craft and purpose. The final turn, where Elias's personal compulsion transforms into a plan for communal salvation, reweights the entire narrative with a clear and potent cost.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story masterfully handles an internal, abstract stake: finding meaning in erasure. The conflict deepens with each collected story, accumulating layers of loss that intensify the central question. The "tightening" is not a single reversal but the growing density of narrative fragments, which forces the final crystallization of the protagonist's stance. The cost—accepting a borrowed, composite identity—is made beautifully legible in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a clear internal stake: Elias's professional skepticism versus his emotional past. The conflict deepens effectively as the cello's hums move from a philosophical memory of his father to a deeply personal one of his lost love, raising the emotional cost. The resolution is an earned internal shift, a stance crystallization that forecloses his old way of being, with the cost legible in his transformed understanding of his life's work.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are established immediately and escalate effectively with the approaching deadline and mainland patrols. Lira's agency drives the conflict's progression, and the resolution is earned through her actions. The tightening feels slightly summarized ("desperation laced the air") rather than purely shown, but the final choice presents a meaningful trade-off with a visible cost to the city's identity.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—capturing the "last dawning hush" as a "final breath of something precious"—is established early and intensifies throughout. The conflict is internal (against fatigue, the cold) and external (against the relentless expansion of the space age). The approach of dawn and the final message ("preserve the precious") escalate Elara's commitment, making her endurance feel purposeful and delivering a profound emotional cost tied to the fleeting nature of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—decoding the drone's feedback to help a lost traveler—is established early and carries sufficient emotional weight.

The resolution is earned directly through protagonist agency, and the cost is legible in the meticulous care required for the fix.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes a clear intellectual stake—the quest for cartographic truth against the allure of myth—and deepens it effectively. The arrival of the note and the subsequent puzzle-solving create a coherent line of rising pressure, driven by the protagonist's agency. The conflict resolves with a clear choice and a legible cost: the abandonment of safety for the "perilously remote" unknown.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—averting the town's final collapse—is signaled clearly, and the tension escalates effectively under an accumulative lens as footsteps multiply. However, the conflict lacks immediate, tangible opposition; the threat of collapse feels abstract rather than a pressing danger within the scene. The resolution is earned, but the pressure could have been sharpened with a moment of potential failure or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—survival against dwindling oxygen—is established immediately and maintained throughout. The conflict escalates meaningfully when the kelp trap is sprung, foreclosing the option of a simple retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story's central stake—Elias's struggle for his own narrative against his father's—is established immediately and remains the unwavering focus. The pressure is internal and atmospheric, deepening significantly as he enters the confessional. His decision to speak is the pivotal act of agency, and the cost is legible in the resolution: the past is not erased but is integrated and tamed ("his father's wolf long tamed into repose"), foreclosing the path of being haunted.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—Elias's spiritual atonement—is established early and tested with escalating pressure.

While the tangible cost is subtle, the emotional price of carrying hope in a desolate world is felt, and the resolution is earned entirely by the protagonist's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—restoring faith—is clear, and the conflict is sustained. The narrative deepens its pressure when Elara's motive shifts from excavation to rebuilding after the tremor. However, the external obstacles (storm, tremor, fox, fog) are presented as minor thematic interruptions rather than genuine pressures that force tactical adaptation, which keeps the overall tension somewhat muted.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving a tactile humanity against an efficient future—is clear and compelling. Under an Accumulative lens, the pressure deepens effectively as Elias completes his chalk codes, moving from contemplation to imminent action.

    The stakes—preventing a planetary coup—are clear and high from the outset. Pressure escalates effectively as Elara moves from suspicion to uncovering concrete evidence of transmissions and pacts.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a clear internal stake: Elara’s attempt to heal collective trauma without being consumed by it. The pressure deepens effectively as the decrypted notes draw a direct line between Jamal's family's fears and her own past. The discovery of the line "fears unknot when shared" serves as a meaningful turn, shifting her task from translation to active participation in healing, with the cost being a renewed, but productively re-framed, engagement with her own sorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story establishes a clear internal stake—rediscovering lost creative joy—and escalates the pressure effectively within the dreamscape.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—Elara's desire to transform Elias's worldview—is established immediately and brought to a head by his direct question. The pressure deepens decisively "in the pause," forcing Elara to act.

The conflict is primarily philosophical, but it's dramatized with visceral, sensory consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story signals a clear dominant stake—Elias's attempt to join the resistance and protect his defiance—and tests it with immediate, rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—the potential permanent dissolution of the partnership—is established effectively. However, the escalation is weak and the pressure deflates prematurely.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Elias's internal harmony—is established early but remains static throughout. The narrative lacks meaningful escalation or tightening; he faces no opposition, and the central discovery of the envelope simplifies his path rather than complicating it. The tremors are atmospheric rather than a source of genuine pressure, resulting in a resolution that feels predetermined rather than won against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.8)
    The central stake—Elias's struggle to trust again—is clear, personal, and consistently tested. The pressure escalates organically from an internal ritual to a risky external action (the pigeon) and culminates in a social test (Mira's arrival).

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)

The discovery of the pilot's logbook provides a meaningful tightening, shifting the conflict from passive endurance to active problem-solving and narrowing Elara's options to a single, specific plan. Protagonist agency drives the resolution, and while the conflict is more atmospheric than oppositional, the pressure of her isolation is coherent and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.5)

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story builds pressure effectively around a single, dominant philosophical stake. The conflict deepens through a series of symbolic turns—the incomplete message, the bird's arrival, the personal recollections—that raise the personal and intellectual cost for Elara.

    The dominant stake—overcoming the crowd's apathy—is established early and pursued actively. There is a clear escalation in the performance's scale, from one person to a group.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story establishes a coherent internal stake: Elias's need to find meaning before an undefined "shift." The pressure deepens effectively through the accumulation of imagery and reflection, culminating in his revelation. The "tightening" is the sun's arrival, a catalyst rather than a choice-driven turn, which is appropriate for the textural lens. The vagueness of the external threat ("storm clouds," "whispers") slightly mutes the stakes, preventing the conflict from feeling truly high-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant internal stake—whether Elias can bridge the chasm of his trauma or remain isolated—is clear and compelling. The arrival of Lena provides a meaningful tightening, forcing a choice between continued solitude and vulnerable connection. His decision to speak is an active choice that pays the cost of vulnerability to achieve resolution, satisfying the demands of the accumulative structure.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story establishes a clear, high-stakes internal conflict against despair. The pressure deepens effectively as Elara moves from mapping equations to launching trial balloons, a meaningful tightening of her method. The resolution is earned through her persistence and ingenuity, but the conflict's texture is slightly flattened by the recurring, declarative tone of "serene upheaval" rather than allowing the upheaval to manifest more unpredictably.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—confronting a burdensome legacy—is signaled early and sharpens effectively at the climax. The discovery of the diaries deepens the conflict from abstract to specific, forcing a choice about her future path.

The central conflict escalates effectively through Elara’s persuasion against the leaders' cynical resistance, culminating in a decisive choice.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.3)
    The dominant internal stake—whether Elias's ambition or his buried sentimentality will prevail—is signaled early and escalates beautifully. The tightening occurs at the basin's heart, where the risk to his empire is explicitly weighed against the yearning for atonement.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.0)
    The central conflict between individual defiance and societal conformity is established early and deepens decisively. The protagonist's agency drives the entire plot, and the climax pays off with a clear, felt cost—the loss of safety for freedom—that lands with significant weight.

    The stake—creating a meaningful act of remembrance—is clear and personal.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake is clear, but the conflict lacks genuine escalation. The pressure is atmospheric rather than interactive; Thorne presents no meaningful resistance to Elara's plan, accepting the object with little friction.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the stakes are high (saving trapped souls), the on-page conflict lacks meaningful escalation. The central challenge—the guardian spirit—is overcome in a single, unopposed move once Elara finds the solution.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.3)
    The central psychological stake—Elara's sanity and her quest to reclaim her sister against the decay of memory—is established immediately and escalates with coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring balance—is well-established and the pressure is coherent. The narrative successfully deepens the challenge as Elara ventures further into the caves.

The conflict's escalation is solid, but the climax lacks a final, resistant push from the antagonistic force, making the resolution feel less hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—rekindling the beacon to affirm meaning in the universe—is established early and pursued with unwavering focus.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.0)
    The central stake—Elara's internal battle for psychic space against her claustrophobia—is established immediately and effectively deepened.

The cost is beautifully rendered as the "compressing" return of gravity, making her small victory feel both precious and precarious.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can transform silence into a balm for the grieving Lira—is established early and tested effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—decoding the leaves—is established early, but the central conflict is resolved too easily.

This lack of resistance softens the escalation, making the transformation feel more like a gift than a consequence of a difficult decision.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.9)
    The central stake—whether Elias will trade his rigid order for the thrill of the unknown—is established immediately and escalates beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=4.5)
    A clear dominant stake exists—releasing the trapped ghosts—and the pressure escalates through conventional beats like the lights failing.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.4)
    The central stake—compressing eternity—is established immediately and pursued with unwavering focus.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes—cultural paralysis and societal drift—are clearly established and significant. However, the on-page conflict lacks pressure. The primary opposition, the "small circle of skeptics," offers no resistance, folding immediately. This lack of a tangible counterforce makes the protagonist's victory feel preordained and diminishes the tension leading up to the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story signals its global stakes early and executes a brilliant tightening at the climax. The conflict escalates by turning the magical tool's attribute against the protagonist's internal state, forcing him to confront his own doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—Elara's search for a primal mystery—is signaled early and effectively deepened by the discovery of the compass.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central stake—understanding the mystery to process grief—is clear and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes—Elara's sanity and the recovery of suppressed historical truth—are clear and compelling. The pressure escalates effectively, moving from a psychic threat to a physical one. The final "parley" is a decent tightening of the conflict, but its resolution is aborted by the flawed ending. The tension release feels told rather than shown, weakening the impact of the cost she paid to get there.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story establishes a strong internal conflict (resolve vs. despair), which is compellingly settled by Elias's choice to act. However, the external stakes—reviving a civilization—are resolved with unearned ease. The pressure evaporates in the final paragraphs as help simply arrives, offering a solution without depicting the corresponding struggle. This lack of a meaningful test for his grand plan makes the victory feel theoretical and less impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story establishes a deeply personal stake—Elias’s life's work—and then masterfully deepens it by revealing its fundamental flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story masterfully handles a quiet, internal conflict. The dominant stake (intuition vs. protocol) is signaled early and tightens effectively as the "zero hour" deadline approaches. The protagonist's agency is central to the resolution, and the choice between two concrete options (the switch vs. the rope) makes the conflict's culmination clear and impactful with a felt cost of professional risk.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.0)
    The conflict is primarily internal, focusing on Elias's acceptance of vulnerability. The stakes are his spiritual purpose, which are deepened by the discovery of the lantern glass.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.0)
    The stakes, while internal and esoteric—preserving the oasis's silent covenant—are signaled clearly and pursued with agency. The conflict deepens effectively for an accumulative narrative, moving from passive observation to active intervention. Elias's choice to engage with the stained glass box is a decisive turn driven by his own volition, leading to a resolution with a legible, permanent cost to his worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—understanding time's texture before his own runs out—is personal, existential, and established immediately. The conflict escalates as Elias gathers clues, increasing the narrative tension toward a "fevered assembly." The resolution provides a clear cost—the erasure of his prior self and the urgency that defined him—which is masterfully re-framed as the ultimate reward, fitting the conceptual nature of the story perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara's internal quest to resolve melancholy by finding harmony in imperfection—is clear and well-maintained. Under the Accumulative lens, the tension builds texturally until the kite string snaps. This event serves as a decisive deepening, forcing a crystallization of her stance with the tangible cost of the lost kite, which is effectively re-framed by the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake: mortality versus legacy. The pressure of the "ticking clock" initiates the action, but this pressure dissipates during the main scene, replaced by a calm, rhythmic labor. The conflict resolves too cleanly; the miraculous cure negates the initial stakes without a trade-off, making the resolution feel unearned and the cost illegible.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes a clear, dominant internal stake: Elara's skepticism versus the possibility of genuine meaning. The pressure deepens effectively through the discovery of the non-human footprints and culminates in the confrontation with the amber. The final arrival of the envoys provides a decisive test of her stance, and her resulting shift feels earned by her agency in completing the pilgrimage. The cost is the loss of her former intellectual identity, which is felt clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central stake—reclaiming a dead space against the weight of its violent history—is clear and compelling. Under the textural lens, the conflict deepens effectively by narrowing focus from the vast desolation to the intimate act of planting. However, the resolution feels slightly unearned in its immediacy; the sprouts appearing instantly lessens the sense of struggle and makes the victory feel more magical than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story establishes its internal, emotional stake—"to translate distance into closeness"—early and deepens it decisively. The escalation is not one of external action but of knowledge, culminating in a revelation that forces a trade-off: Harlan achieves a new kind of closeness at the cost of his idealized memory of Elara. This cost is unmistakable on the page, making the conflict's resolution both earned and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story establishes a clear emotional stake early and effectively tightens the pressure with the "glimpse" of the silhouette. This externalizes the internal conflict and forces a decisive choice: to remain in passive remembrance or actively investigate. The resolution, where she confronts the echo of her mother, pays a visible emotional cost (tears) and earns the final shift in her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are established early and are suitably cosmic ("Veil's fracture"). The conflict escalates effectively when the spectral guardians appear, introducing a direct physical threat that forces a change in tactics from simple ritual to a "dance of evasion." The resolution is driven by protagonist agency, but the conflict's impact is softened by the absence of a clear, lasting price paid for success.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.3)
    The dominant stake—to unbind the spectral archive—is established early and tested directly. The conflict escalates effectively when the binding resists, forcing Elara to adapt her method from "release" to the more costly "sever." This single, meaningful tightening is driven entirely by protagonist agency and demonstrates a clear price, making the resolution feel earned and decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.0)
    The internal conflict is rendered with potent stakes: the reclamation of self versus the annihilation by grief. Escalation is handled skillfully through the "hidden thunder," a metaphor for repressed trauma that grows from a subtle rumble to a "full fury."

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.2)
    The internal stake—claiming unused courage—is signaled early and remains the dominant focus. The escalation, driven by the Accumulative lens, builds through the disorienting journey and the guides' lessons, culminating in a clear deepening of understanding at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the central stake is clear, the conflict is frictionless. Mira faces no meaningful opposition or setbacks; the plants guide her directly to each solution without struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.8)

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.3)

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)

Her decision to send the query is an act of agency that directly forces the resolution, and the cost is felt in the emotional release of her weeping. The only minor weakness is that the opposing force (the guild/authorities) capitulates instantly and off-page, slightly softening the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a clear internal stake: whether Elias will remain trapped by past failures or embrace new possibilities. The discovery of the flake and the interpretation of the scaffold map serve as a meaningful deepening, shifting him from passive lament to active pursuit. The final act is driven by his agency, and the cost of abandoning his former self is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias's venture as a means to rewrite his legacy—is established early and tested by the arrival of rivals, creating a meaningful tightening. However, the resolution of this primary external conflict feels low-cost and overly swift. While the ultimate failure of the business provides a larger sense of loss, the central on-page confrontation is resolved with more poetry than pressure, slightly deflating the earned tension.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—decoding the inscriptions for their forgotten wisdom—is established early and pursued with focus. The pressure is primarily internal and intellectual, which fits the story's contemplative mode. The meaningful deepening occurs within the dream, as the abstract quest becomes a visceral encounter with burdened figures, raising the stakes from knowledge to active empathy. Agency is demonstrated when Elara uses her words to heal, earning the final revelation with a visible cost of emotional and spiritual effort.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story establishes a clear, high-concept stake—to "discover what mirrors don't show"—and escalates the pressure effectively. The conflict tightens when the abstract goal becomes a tangible, dangerous object (the seed) and a concrete, terrible truth (the confession). Elowen's agency drives the resolution, and the cost is paid through the painful visions and the forced vulnerability of her own "unbending" heart, making the final serenity feel deeply earned.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—mending the eclipsed covenant to prevent temporal chaos—is signaled early and remains the central focus. The pressure escalates via the fading light, forcing a decisive action from the protagonist. The resolution is earned through her agency, but the antagonistic force ("tomorrow's shadows") remains too abstract to create truly visceral tension; the conflict feels more like a magical procedure than a struggle against a reactive force.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara's need for spiritual peace—is established immediately and tested directly in the confrontation with Thorne. The conflict escalates from a plea to a specific magical act that overcomes Thorne’s opposition. The resolution is driven by Elara’s agency, and the cost is unmistakable on the page as her cherished relic, the tarot card, is consumed, symbolizing the finality of her choice to reforge her past rather than just preserve it.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes a clear internal stake—the search for purpose—and deepens it effectively. The pressure escalates not through external events but through the weight of memory and failure, culminating in a choice. The final shift from longing to resolve represents an earned turn, with the cost being the full acceptance that his former life, and brother, are gone forever.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—achieving internal peace and understanding—is clear, but the pressure remains low and abstract throughout. While appropriate for a textural piece, the "haunted ambitions" never manifest as a tangible threat or force a costly trade-off. The conflict deepens through intellectual discovery rather than escalating pressure, making the resolution feel less like a victory won against opposition and more like a foregone conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story's central conflict—the internal drive to preserve wonder against external entropy—is compelling despite its quiet nature. The stakes are existential rather than immediate, which is fitting for the premise. The pressure deepens effectively during the hunt for the smelts, where the librarian must actively embrace contradiction to succeed. The resolution, filling the creel, provides a satisfying cadence shift that reinforces the high stakes of this perpetual, serene war against meaninglessness.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story effectively transitions from a professional stake (inspecting a bunker) to a profound, existential one (healing humanity). The primary tightening occurs internally during the "heartbeat of a hesitation," resolving into a choice that forecloses his previous path. The agency is clear, and the climax is driven by his decision, with the cost of his old identity made explicit in the final line. The escalation is one of deepening understanding rather than external opposition, which fits the story's contemplative nature.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stake—the internal quest for self-forgiveness—is established early and resolved with emotional honesty.

However, the progression lacks friction; once inside the station, the protagonist faces no setbacks or reversals, making the path to resolution feel unopposed and lowering the overall tension.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—finding the library—is clear and consistently pursued. Pressure escalates through the puzzle-solving and the tense journey, culminating in a clear resolution. The tightening is more of a steady deepening of knowledge than a sharp reversal, which is acceptable for the story's accumulative feel, and the final cost is the unresolved tension of the trickster's legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    The central stake—dream versus empire—is established immediately and intelligently deepened through the story's magical elements. The pressure escalates from internal reflection to external urging from the plants, forcing a climactic choice. The resolution is driven entirely by protagonist agency, and the cost is clear in the transformation of her lifelong "ache" into a purposeful resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.3)
    The conflict is pristine in its focus: a single character's agency against an inexorable, impersonal fate. The stake—preservation versus oblivion—is established early and escalated with poetic precision as the "threshold of stillness" nears. The final choice to infuse the chip is a definitive act of defiance, and the cost is absolute and felt, making the resolution both tragic and triumphant.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central stake—Elara's search for contentment—is established early and remains the story's focus. The conflict is primarily internal and atmospheric, which is a valid choice. However, the pressure remains static until the conflict is resolved by an external catalyst (the hairpin's vision), rather than by the protagonist making a difficult choice under escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes its internal stakes—overcoming paralyzing doubt—early and effectively. The pressure deepens through the ritual with the chimes, forcing Elara to confront the nuances she sought. Her final action is a clear exercise of agency, and the cost of her old certainty is paid on the page, resulting in a new, more resilient state. The escalation is perfectly scaled to the story's intimate focus.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story establishes its dominant stake—achieving unmoving navigation—early and pursues it relentlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)

The resolution is not a simple victory but a costly transformation of his pain into a new purpose, making the stakes feel profound and the outcome earned.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    The stakes are effectively layered, braiding the cosmic (vanishing seas) with the personal (Elias's fragile devotion to Lira). The pressure escalates well through the internal conflict, where his doubts test his resolve—a meaningful deepening. The final resolution feels earned, though the cost is more emotional tempering than a tangible loss, which aligns with the story's hopeful tone.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central stake—whether the town's resurfacing will heal or reopen old wounds—is clear and compelling. The conflict escalates effectively for Elias as the discoveries become increasingly personal, deepening the stakes. The primary weakness lies in the resolution; the communal conflict, built up as generations of "unspoken hatred," is resolved too easily, which deflates its perceived intensity and makes the final cost feel abstract rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—harmonizing heart and mind before a cosmic transformation—is established early and provides a strong frame. The conflict is primarily internal, but it's externalized effectively through the alchemical ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake of preserving trust and colony survival is clearly signaled and escalated through Commander Lir's urgent call and the discovery of the "deceptive spiral."

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.5)

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.0)
    Conflict and stakes are handled with masterful precision for the story's length and chosen lens.

The resolution is driven by his agency, and the cost of breaking from his past is made tangible in the crozier's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.0)
    The conflict is commendably focused and executed. The dominant internal stake—achieving clarity by overcoming mental static—is signaled early and tightens effectively when Elara recognizes the interference is her own. Protagonist agency is decisive in the climax, where her choice to renounce assumptions directly precipitates the resolution with a clear felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are clear and escalate effectively when the passengers begin to dissolve. Elias demonstrates agency in driving the resolution. However, the conflict's resolution feels too rapid and frictionless; the "core horror" is introduced and then solved within a few sentences, missing an opportunity for a more meaningful struggle or a tangible trade-off. The pressure builds but dissipates too easily for the climax to land with maximum force.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s quest for connection—is established immediately and deepens effectively as his actions begin to alter his own memories, raising the personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story establishes a clear, compelling dominant stake: bridging humanity's submerged isolation with the stars. The conflict is primarily conceptual and internal, which fits the tone. Pressure deepens effectively as Elara's private experiments become public lessons, culminating in the on-page demonstration to Kai, which proves the knowledge is transmissible and thus solidifies the city's hope. The cost is emotional—the "weight" of the discovery—and is legibly woven throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—protecting the voices from erasure—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure escalates effectively from a general trace to a specific, urgent threat. However, the final confrontation lacks tension; Mira, the antagonist force, capitulates without any visible struggle or negotiation. The resolution feels convenient rather than earned, as the conflict dissolves the moment it's articulated, and the cost to Mira is not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—honoring the unremembered—is established early and pursued with clear agency. Pressure escalates effectively through environmental hazards and the supernatural discovery. The primary weakness is the legibility of the cost at closure; while the codex is sacrificed, its value was purely instrumental to the mission. Elias is "forever changed" and a "weight lifted," but this is an asserted emotional payoff rather than a demonstrated, tangible price paid for the victory, which softens the final impact.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—restoring Elias as a proxy for Elara’s own reclamation—is established early and tested with genuine risk. The conflict deepens effectively when Elias’s heartbeat count falters during the procedure, creating a moment of sharp tension.

The conflict escalates beautifully from a state of slow decay to a single, high-risk moment of creation, driven entirely by the protagonist's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central conflict is established immediately and escalates logically. The discovery of the locust shell provides a meaningful deepening, shifting Elara's strategy from passive resistance to a focused, active assault.

The final cost is legible, securing the climax's integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.8)
    The central stake—the success of the drone mission as a proxy for healing a broken promise—is clear and compelling. The tension escalates effectively in a single, meaningful tightening when the drone faces the patrol scan, a moment of risk driven entirely by the protagonist's agency, with a cost felt in the "shared suspense" of the onlookers.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.2)
    The conflict is primarily internal and atmospheric, cohering well under a textural lens. The discovery of the halo fragment serves as a meaningful deepening, raising the stakes from passive seeking to active creation. The protagonist’s agency is demonstrated in the climactic choice to sing, which resolves the central tension and pays a visible cost (breaking his silence), earning the story's quiet resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.5)
    This is the story's most significant weakness. The conflict is entirely conceptual and lacks tangible pressure or stakes. Elara pursues her goal unopposed; the patrons are oblivious, and her method works on the first attempt. The narrative lacks a meaningful escalation or a tightening choice that forecloses options, reading more like a successful experiment than a dramatic struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant internal stake—resolving a haunting grief—is signaled early and remains the unwavering focus. The narrative deepens this stake through the single, meaningful action of the photographic ritual, which forces a confrontation with the dream's meaning. The resolution is driven entirely by Elara's agency, and the cost—the letting go of her brother's ghost—is rendered with poignant, visible emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central internal conflict is well-defined and pressure effectively tightens at the key choice of trusting the locksmith, leading to a resolution with a clear, felt emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering stolen memories—is clearly established and drives the entire narrative. Elara's agency, fueled by a "relentless hunger," leads to a focused escalation through discovery and the application of lore. The resolution provides a clear and felt cost, assuaging decades of loss. The score is capped at 8.8 due to line-level artifacts in the final third of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—mentoring resilience to overcome one's own past—is signaled early and effectively tightened when the shadow mirrors Lir's turmoil, forcing Elara to confront it directly. Elara's agency drives the resolution, and the cost is legible in her nervousness and physical tics. The escalation is contained but meaningful, leading to an earned, if quiet, climax.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a clear, dominant stake—preserving wonder against encroaching grayness—and delivers a single, meaningful deepening of that stake through the planting of the seed. The pressure is atmospheric and internal rather than causal, which fits the chosen lens perfectly. The resolution is earned, and the cost is legible in the generational duty Elara fulfills.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.1)
    The stakes—Elara's internal peace and the spirits' rest—are established early and deepened effectively. Escalation is handled through an accumulative increase in textural pressure, as the "interlaced hush thickened" and the confession became more raw.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.3)
    The dominant stake—interpreting his father's unsolved riddle and bridging the known/unknown—is signaled early and escalates effectively. Elias's agency drives all major turns, from comparing footage to uncovering the latch. The felt cost of his decades of grief and the intellectual/physical pursuit is clear, charging the final act of opening the chapel door.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—articulating the ghost's needs—is signaled early and escalated effectively by the ticking clock of the storm. The protagonist's agency drives the resolution in a clear climax that pays a visible, albeit emotional, cost by transforming her from "seldom-heard" to heard. The pressure is coherent and builds to a satisfying and earned conclusion, showing a meaningful change in the protagonist's state.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story establishes a clear internal stake: Elara's quest for understanding ("to seek out the joy beneath anguish"). The conflict is primarily procedural—deciphering the diary against the time limit of the ascent—which provides coherent pressure. The escalation is effective as the revelations deepen with each floor, culminating in a thematic resolution that reweights her future service. The cost is subtle but legible: her service is no longer simple but imbued with the weight and light of the spire's history.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—proving the sky remembers to salvage his own wholeness—is potent and established immediately.

The story achieves a decisive deepening of understanding at the climax, with the cost being his physical ordeal and the somber finality of his acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story establishes a powerful dominant stake: preserving the spirit of a sacred space against its imminent erasure. The pressure is both external (the approaching demolition crews, a well-handled ticking clock) and internal (Elara's artistic limits). The discovery of the book provides a meaningful deepening, transforming her mission from simple preservation to a profound continuation of a hidden legacy. The cost is clear and felt in the final moments as the building trembles, making her artistic victory poignant.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    The internal stake—to learn the rhythm of repair—is signaled early and provides a coherent drive for the narrative. The conflict escalates from a general search to a specific mechanical and mystical puzzle in the hall of mirrors, providing a meaningful tightening of pressure. While the resolution is driven by protagonist agency, the overall tension remains at a low, contemplative simmer rather than a high-stakes boil.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story's central conflict—the community's doubt—is stated but never manifests as a tangible obstacle. There is no meaningful escalation of pressure; instead, a series of clues leads to a frictionless solution. The resolution is driven by the ghost's agency, not the protagonists', leaving their victory feeling passive and their stakes untested.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—the quality of the world's end—is established early and meaningfully deepened by the discovery of the puppet head.

The cost is her emotional vulnerability, which is made legible on the page, securing the high stakes of her final action.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.1)

The story provides a meaningful tightening when she decides to use the blueprint, and the cost is felt in her final acceptance of her role.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central stake—reconciliation—is clear and compelling, and the protagonist's agency drives the resolution. The story effectively deepens the internal conflict through a series of reflective beats, fitting for its lens. The primary weakness is the climax's lack of friction; the conflict dissolves too easily in the phone call, making the earned resolution feel less impactful than the buildup promised.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story establishes a strong, singular stake—finding the origin of stories—and escalates the pressure through the protagonist’s focused agency. The tightening occurs through the methodical, irreversible act of incising the slate, with each cut deepening her commitment and raising the magical stakes. The cost is clear and felt: the permanent release of her "most prized object," the moonlight, in exchange for the revelation she seeks.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.4)
    The internal stake—Elara's potential shattering—is established early and feels potent.

The final resolution is earned directly through her climactic choice, providing a satisfying sense of agency.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.5)
    This is the story's most significant failure. While stakes are established (a fractured community), the on-page conflict is minimal and resolves without meaningful escalation. Potential points of resistance—Klaus's wariness, Maria's barbs about water rights—are introduced and then immediately evaporate. There is no moment where the protagonist's plan is genuinely tested or forced to adapt, resulting in a flat, frictionless plot that lacks tension.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story establishes a clear, high-stakes internal conflict and escalates it through a single, powerful intensification driven by the protagonist's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—finding the forgotten combinations—is clear, and the conflict is well-defined as character versus a perilous, time-sensitive environment.

The escalation is linear but effective, driven by Elara's agency in choosing to face the grotto's dangers.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central stake—whether music can be created as an act of empathy in a silent world—is established early and held throughout. The pressure escalates through a quiet deepening of focus, culminating in a single decisive action by the protagonist. The resolution feels earned, and the cost is felt conceptually in the idea that this new harmony is born from the sculpture's history of stress and pain.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story establishes a single, potent stake—restoring the covenant before the moon rises—and maintains focus.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central conflict—Elias versus the locked clasp—is a strong metaphor for his philosophical quest, and the stakes are clearly defined as the recovery of lost understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—Elara's ability to endure her sensitivity to achieve her goal—is signaled early and tested directly. Escalation is handled skillfully under the Accumulative lens, moving from the potential threat of the seed to the "ominous whiff" of the sprout, to the overwhelming sensory assault of the bloom. Her agency in the climax, choosing to endure and journal, drives the resolution, and the cost is visceral and unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake—finding the source of resilience—and effectively uses the gravity inversion as a meaningful tightening that changes the rules of navigation and reveals a new path. Protagonist agency drives the resolution. The primary weakness is the legibility of the cost; the discovery feels more like a pure victory than a choice with a difficult trade-off, with the "burden" of safeguarding the relic being a very light conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.8)
    The central conflict—an investigator versus a complex environmental puzzle—is compelling and maintained with consistent pressure. The stakes are clearly established as preventing future tragedies, which deepens as Elias uncovers the "singular convergence." The resolution is earned through his agency and methodical work, and the cost is made tangible by the discovery of the engineer's patch.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes a clear, if abstract, dominant stake: proving the necessity of wonder.

    The dominant internal stake—to understand the trees' witness—is well-established and pursued throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—recovering truth to save a decaying city—is established early and effectively. The conflict sharpens perfectly with Kael's appearance; his lie provides an on-page test of the stakes and introduces a direct antagonist, tightening the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—healing the fractured community—is signaled early and intensifies effectively as more stories are told. However, the resolution deflates the accumulated tension.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—liberating Liora—is clear and compelling. The story effectively deepens the emotional weight of this stake through Elara's actions.

    Dominant stake—“capture the sound of absence”—is signaled early; agency narrows to the single imprint action that forecloses retreat. Pressure tightens once: the molten hiss crystallizes the fracture, price paid in tears (“tears mixed with the brine”). Accumulation of silences supplies motive but not escalating obstacles; therefore escalation is present yet slender. Cost is legible on-page, satisfying the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—claim a prophecy-laden portrait—tightens once: the golden hour’s end forces the grab. Agency is present but external (vendor’s bouquet, moonbeam jar); the deepening is atmospheric rather than a hard choice, yet the cost of exposure and new guardianship is palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—safe zones vs. personal refuge—tightens when melt converts sanctuary into hazard; one meaningful deepening suffices. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational and accumulative: each droplet, spark, and sloughing frost raises the cost of staying. Agency remains with Elias: he lights forge, chooses to shape rather than scavenge, then decides egress once melt outpaces creation. Coincidence (drawer yields father’s bookmark) complicates rather than rescues, nudging the already-forming exit decision.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—proving that her vulnerability can become power—is signaled on page 1 and tightened when she rigs the cast speaker; the final public exposure forecloses retreat. Pressure escalates by protagonist agency under Causal lens; cost (loss of previous identity, mentor, and legal safety) is legible in the sirens.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—map the endless night—tightens when inscription becomes impossible; the silence she wields is the decisive escalation. Agency is renunciation; cost is the star’s death. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—where thoughts come from—tightens when each loop forces her to amalgamate alternate dust-minds; the final bow-draw crystallizes that widening carries irreparable weight (she will never un-see the branches). Pressure grows steadily under accumulative lens; no external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—thaw mistrust—signaled in para 2 and tightened once: the eavesdrop forces Elias from observer to participant, trading his anonymity for possible rejection. Ambiguous clarity of the lens and doodles escalates risk: revelation could expose or repel. Cost is legible: the opened-chest doodle publicly relinquishes his shield.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—whether fidelity to soil can outrank numerical luck—escalates through each polishing ritual and tightens when the Luckometer spikes to 92.7. The vine’s resurrection of the marble is the decisive reversal that forecloses reliance on the device, paid for by decades of unseen tending. Pressure remains coherent under an accumulative/textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single stake—prove sideways time—signaled in paragraph one. Pressure tightens once: the risk of nexus destabilization is named, then enacted with the lever pull; same beat delivers payoff, so escalation is compressed but valid under short-form scale. Agency sits with Elara/Jax; luck doesn’t save them, energy spike complicates. Cost is the potential station failure and the irreversible knowledge they now possess—legible on page.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—unravel Isabella’s secret—is signaled early and tightened through each sensory beat. The single escalation occurs when Elias’s bow disrupts the veil, trading the chance for full knowledge for a fleeting glimpse; the price (code lost, mystery intact) is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—impermanence of isolation—signaled in paragraph one and tightened by the oracle’s prophecy of burial in ice. One meaningful deepening: the smudge transforms the illustration from talisman to mutable map, foreclosing the fantasy of stasis. Cost is visible in the final image of descent; no coincidence resolves the tension. Pressure escalates via sensory accretion rather than external antagonist, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes—“swallowed truth” versus living denial—are signaled early; the ghost’s confession tightens the screw by forcing a mirror, and the valve’s burn supplies a visceral price. Agency is mainly interpretive (listening, appraisal) rather than active reversal, acceptable under situational lens, but the escalation is single-noted; one meaningful tightening, no secondary reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preserving witness without judgment—tightens when the swan offers an exit from decay; refusal to ascend fully costs the library itself, felt on-page. Escalation is textural: each fold adds hush, each meter tunneled increases stakes for the ledger. No reversal, yet deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can wonder survive grief?—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when the eclipse forces synchronized breath and talisman transfer. Cost is felt: Elena relinquishes relic, Theo risks feeling again. Agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.7)
    A single dominant stake—gathering the walls’ stories to mend a metaphysical tilt—is signaled early; pressure tightens as Elowen connects diaries to tapestry, but the causal escalation is largely interpretive rather than forcing a visible, on-page trade-off or cost. One meaningful deepening is achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s desire to escape monotony by scripting others’ fates—tightens when the island scripts him instead. One decisive deepening occurs when Maris utters the unreleased fortune, turning the game into prophecy; the cost is Elias’s loss of narrative control, felt in the shiver that halts his hand.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single dominant stake: prevent possession of the anchor. Pressure escalates via Elias’s iterative sonic defense; each loop tightens the noose, forcing the entity to hesitate. The cost—eternal vigilance—is legible in the final quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—retrieve unheard symphonies before sleep claims him—tightens via each spiral mapped: outer curve costs a breath, innermost costs the last heartbeat of night. No external antagonist needed; exhaustion is coherent pressure, acknowledged every 100 words. One meaningful deepening: heartbreak memory silences his young voice, foreshadowing the adult fear that the music will stay mute. Cost is legible in trembling hands and approaching dawn; option space narrows from “map more” to “stand and conduct now.”

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—merge splintered timelines or be lost—is declared early and restated often, but inside the labyrinth the pressure is illustrative: each corridor shows a what-if, yet none threatens to overwrite her present or force a trade-off. The single tightening—shattering the shadow-self—occurs off-stage in one clause; no ability is lost, no new restriction spawned. Because escalation is imagistic rather than causal, the stake’s cost remains conceptual; the lens is Accumulative, but the density intensifies only descriptively, not tactically.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—defeat emotional numbness—is signaled in paragraph five and tightened when the backward song forces a trade-off: risk reopening grief to feel again. Escalation is one sustained crescendo of vibration; no false reversals. Agency is entirely Elara’s; luck does not intervene. The price is the silent tears that prove the numbness has been pierced.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.9)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—why scents lacerate—tightens the moment the drop escapes: knowledge pursuit flips to involuntary grief. One meaningful escalation suffices; here the pod splits, hologram appears, and surrender is immediate, narrowing options to endure or drown. Cost is felt on-page in open tears and kneeling collapse. No secondary loop or antagonist needed; pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—“impossible choice” between past freedom and future timelessness—tightens across each beat. The grotto’s offer and the rope’s sacrifice escalate pressure; cost is the erasure of escape history. One meaningful turn crystallizes stance with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—beauty in the unfinished—tightens as each survivor adds a story, narrowing Elias’s option to keep grief private. The meaningful deepening occurs when he flips the bowl, trading solo elegy for communal elegy. Cost is visible: he forfeits narrative control. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative/Textural lens; no coincidence resolves the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—remain protected observer versus risk authentic pain—tightens once via scent-test; no reversals needed. Agency is decision to inhale; stakes escalate because same half-truth she sold now turns inward, foreclosing professional distance. Static prickle serves as on-page barometer of rising cost. Could hit 8.8+ if a concrete consequence (client reaction, income loss) threatened, but interior price is still felt and suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—Elias’s desire to uplift silent contributors—meets practical obstacle of scarce resources; the envelope error escalates into a viable partnership. One decisive tightening: Elias’s offer to route cargo networks, narrowing his future options and exposing social capital. Cost is legible but lightly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.0)
    One escalating dominant stake—belonging—tightens via each shard of the search; the obsidian tag emerges forcing a public stance. Coincidence does not resolve; pressure crystallizes at the arbor. Hiccup: causal link between Lir’s lore and Elara’s integration is slightly summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (uncage echo birthplace) escalates when interrupted cadence narrows options and borrowed-time cost charges final beat. One vital middle choice (press pendant) tightens stakes. Giant’s stirring resets the clock with palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes—“map the heartache or stay unmade”—are signaled early. Pressure escalates via accumulating light threads; the moment eyes lock the pattern, a live option (perpetual ambiguity) is foreclosed, price visible in the exposed lattice of feeling. One beat, but sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s need to become visible—escalates through each cache and the final gift. The outage provides external pressure, but the decisive tightening is internal: the tape forces a choice between secrecy and service. Cost is felt in the risk of exposure and the irrevocable step into the hall. Could be sharper if the blackout directly threatened the caches.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—scientist’s need to grasp plant agency versus bodily integrity—tightens once: the self-experiment that forecloses retreat. Pressure escalates through each sensation of takeover; storm aftershocks provide external resonance, not rescue. Cost is legible on the page (loss of human locomotion, irreversible merger). The beat count is thin—only one real inflection—so the escalation tops just under 8.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—can Elias wrest a kernel of purpose from ruin—tightens when the rain offers ephemeral trails and the brooch demands exchange; the vial of water plus Mira’s intel foreclose solitude, paying a visible social cost. Escalation is single-cycle, adequate for 700 words, but pressure is more contemplative than urgent, keeping it below high-band intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“magnify everyday magic without losing self”—is signaled early; midpoint tightening (shadows promise power then demand body) forecloses retreat. Price is the protagonist’s erasure; agency visible in fight that fails. Escalation causal, one-step but sufficient for 750-word window.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stake—“rekindle communal trust”—remains abstract; no scene beat forces Elara to risk failure or surrender an alternative. Pressure plateaus after the vision; the hum succeeds without testing her resolve against resistance, so escalation is atmospheric, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—unravel family secrets—tightens when the phantom train appears, foreclosing retreat. Pressure escalates via each encoded arrow; cost is implied by irreversible boarding, though not yet viscerally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is grief vs. skeptical rationality; one meaningful tightening occurs when transcribing becomes the gateway to shared visions, foreclosing the option of pure scientific detachment. Pressure is coherent but largely internal.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“what happens after goodbye”—is signaled early and escalates through one deepening: the mutiny’s crest offers a lived simulation of post-death transformation, narrowing her options from eternal drift to purposeful storm-chasing. Cost is legible: shard spent, breach sealed, boredom cracked. Agency resides in her intrigue-woven manipulation of magnetic lines; coincidence merely complicates. Sufficient for the high band under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—decode father’s final con without becoming him—tightens once the letter’s formula appears, forcing Elena to accept complicity in his ethics. The breach of the drawer is the single decisive escalation; cost is the irreversible knowledge she now carries. Pressure coheres under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—recover lost time-textures to re-sound a silenced town—is signaled early, but pressure is ambient: the blight never intrudes on the mountaintop, so escalation is poetic accumulation rather than rising threat. One meaningful deepening occurs when the hum crescendos and Elias imagines “gilded whispers” returning; this reframes his scribbling as restorative ritual. However, no live option is foreclosed; he could have stayed or left without tangible consequence on the page. Cost is conceptual, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—recover the texture of erased lives—escalates as each tide cycle exposes new stories and narrows the wanderer’s options to keep listening rather than act. Pressure grows accumulative: every fragment layered tightens the wanderer’s identification with the forgotten dead. No causal reversal, but a meaningful deepening at the final weave. Cost is conceptual (perpetual outsiderhood) rather than tangible, visible but not viscerally paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—will he dismantle or accept the myth—escalates via each cello-induced retelling that strips deniability. No external antagonist needed; pressure grows because each echo reconfigures knowledge until skepticism becomes unsustainable. Visible price: surrender of lifelong identity at the last sustained hum.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve communal chaos against corporate buyout—is signaled in paragraph three and escalates via each encoded mural. One meaningful tightening: the juggler’s torn loyalty mirrors Lira’s, forcing a defensive perimeter that narrows options. Cost is legible—carnival lights burn fiercer under desperation, and the vote accepts structured compromise. Agency drives every turn; coincidence never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“last dawning hush”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens as sunlight encroaches. The chemical timer and summit cold escalate risk, forcing her to outlast fatigue to secure the shot; no coincidence resolves tension. One meaningful deepening: spectral nightwatch warns “preserve the precious,” crystallizing her stance. Cost visible in frozen seals and forfeited future access.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are simple and legible: restore the drone or leave wanderers lost. Escalation is one deepening—each refracted warmth pattern narrows the repair path—until the final release forecloses Elias’s own need to keep the creation.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single stake—locate the river cradle—tightens when the glass convergence forecloses doubt and forces departure. One visible price: the outpost’s shelter abandoned to hostile expanse; pressure coherent under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent final silence—is signaled early and escalates as footsteps thicken the hum; however, no individual faces a trade-off or loss. Pressure is ambient, not protagonist-bound; the “collapse” remains an abstract horizon. One meaningful deepening occurs when the archway trembles, but options for Elowen do not narrow. Cost is felt collectively, not dramatized on-page as a sacrifice or forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—survival vs. capturing impermanence—tightens as oxygen drops. Escalation driven by Elara’s agency: uncorking vial, then overriding panic to unsnarl kelp. One meaningful deepening when memory of untangling nets reframes tactics. Cost legible: seconds of air traded for artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—liberation from paternal fable—is signaled in paragraph one. Pressure tightens as Elias ascends, each whispered denial narrowing his options to either perpetuate or rewrite the lie. The decisive act is the kneeling confession; its cost is the irreversible fusion of his story with the lighthouse’s bones. No external antagonist is needed; the conflict is internal and fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes center on Elias’s need to atone vs. lingering desire to live; each ghostly cameo tightens the noose, foreclosing alternatives until the only path left is joining the bride. Cost is legible—his body dissolves, the orchard mourns—and the deepening arrives not from external threat but from awakening remorse that crystallizes stance.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—transforming isolation into shared reverence—escalates as each luminous stitch forecloses solitude and invites communal footsteps. The tightening is visible: every new thread narrows her own future freedom. Cost is legible but slightly diffuse; the price is more conceptual (eternal caretaking) than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—restore lost faith—echoes early; each artifact found tightens the metaphorical dig.  No visible price paid (no injury, tool breakage, or social cost on-page), so escalation feels cumulative rather than costly.  Final tightening is aesthetic, not tactical, keeping tension solid but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure tightens once: the approaching foot traffic and sunrise limit chalk survival, forcing rapid encoding. The stake remains single-track—preserve tactile meaning—so the deepening is narrow but legible under the Accumulative lens; no antagonistic force beyond time itself, yet the cost is visible.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—preventing the council’s telescope coup—escalates through Elara’s agency: each stitch narrows the conspirators’ room to lie. The tightening is clear, but the on-page cost (risk of discovery) is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—retrieve the unspoken apology—signaled in para 2. Escalation is textural: each condensation message deepens regret’s weight, narrowing options until the final “decide anew” crystallizes stance. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves. One visible cost: the evaporating text literalizes the irreversible release.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake—shared anxieties of separation—is declared early but never narrowed; Jamal sleeps on, unthreatened. No beat raises the cost of mis-reading a note, so pressure stays ambient. Decrypting deepens texture rather than options; the final pocketing only seals the mood already achieved. Accumulation suffices for the lens, yet lacks a visible price that re-tools Elara’s next step.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—recover lost joy—remains singular and legible. Pressure escalates only via atmospheric deepening (fog, mural revival) rather than a narrowing option set; no concrete trade-off or price is extracted from Elias. The knowledge network delivers answers friction-free, so the challenge feels informational rather than adversarial. Sufficient for a lyric daydream arc but below the 8.2 gate for high-band closure support.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake: can Elara rupture Elias’s certainty without fracturing the garden’s pact of wonder? Pressure escalates via each ricochet of the coin-strike: bass note → fox-whisper → fractal dismantling of formulas; each echo nests deeper and forecloses retreat to prior stance. Causality is textured, not reversal-heavy, tightening once decisively. Cost is visible—the scholar’s shield-notebook lowered, his path literally redirected into unmapped vines—though we don’t see a tangible price paid by Elara beyond transient fatigue; that keeps it below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—evade thought-tax and plant rebellion—is signaled early and tightened by drone approach. Agency is clear: Elias chooses warp, pays with exposure risk. One meaningful escalation, no reversals, cost legible.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—transmute insomnia-pain into beauty—is signaled early and advanced by each song-verse. Pressure intensifies texturally: sorrow-layer accretes until the blossom armistice reconfigures the stake’s cost. No external antagonist is needed, yet the turning point is authorially willed rather than forced by a visible on-page trade-off; the postcard inspires but does not narrow options. Still, the final spectral bloom carries undeniable conceptual price—her solitude reframed, not erased.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—preserve forgotten names via sound—is signaled early and tightened when the cracked tube threatens another loss. Escalation is incremental and accumulative: neglect → discovery → mending → fragile victory. The cost is existential rather than tactical; a stronger material price would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restore trust or lose partnership—is signaled in the first quarter. Pressure escalates by cadence shift: each new glyph raises audible harmonics that demand deeper honesty, tightening the noose of exposure. Agency is hers: she risks the inscription, narrows her safety margin, and thereby forces Thorne’s binary—walk away or add his vow. Cost is visible: potential arcane backfire plus the social cost of bared secrets; final partnership is not cheap absolution but shared exposure to future danger.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reconciling precision with mercy—is signaled early and escalates through each tremor and decoded line. The tightening is decisive: the tremor dislodges pebbles like applause, forcing Elias’s stance crystallization. Cost is visible in the chain’s repurposing and the mountain’s approval.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—trust in the world’s reliability—tightens when the first pigeon returns intact, then deepens through shared song with Mira. No external antagonist; pressure is internal and situational. One credible loss: the abandonment of forged histories. Cost is visible in the relinquished safety of lies.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—cross back home by honoring thresholds—is signaled early and tightens once: the logbook forces her to translate abstract awe into operational code. However, escalation is narrated rather than dramatized (“she intuited a way back”) and no visible price—lost time, physical risk, or failed attempt—attaches to the tilt homeward, so pressure feels moderate, not acute.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—sync personal cadence with indifferent sea—stated early; each artifact (feather resonance, AI echo, fireflies) intensifies texture rather than narrowing options. Mid-story alignment of burn-marks to ley-line supplies the single required deepening; it doesn’t foreclose paths yet makes the final sync legible. Cost is poetic rather than practical; pressure stays imagistic, not tactical, keeping score sub-8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“why do paths dissolve?”—is signaled in paragraph one and deepened when incomplete glass script literalizes the threat. Mid-text tightening occurs when the bird’s accidental seed-drop reframes disappearance as neglected potential; this pattern break reweights the stake under Accumulative logic. Elara’s agency is decision, not risk: she plants remaining seeds, foreclosing perpetual speculation. Cost is conceptual (acceptance of scatter) rather than visceral; a more tangible forfeiture would push the score higher.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“serenade monotony”—is signaled early and measurably tightens when the first token hit sparks curiosity, then again when the fisherman’s spin triggers the shadow dance, turning apathy into laughter. Pressure accrues under Accumulative lens rather than causal reversals; options don’t narrow for Elias, they widen for the crowd. Visible price is thin (no personal risk or resource lost), so escalation feels moderate, not urgent. Sufficient for the length, but the absence of a trade-off or constraint keeps it sub-8.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—defy erasure by scripting memory into skin—tightens once: first line etched → pain → fledging. No reversal, but deepening works under Accumulative lens: each gap observed adds filament to the verse-wing, foreclosing retreat. Cost is legible in blood-bright ink and irreversible skin-alteration.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—prove mundane glass holds luminous worth—signaled early. Pressure escalates once: ripple-reading reveals “harmony” beneath regret, narrowing his stance from doubt to vocation-affirmation. Cost is conceptual (accepting fragility), but lacks a tangible forfeiture; hence stays below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—translating pain into shared language—emerges early and tightens through each recalled fire, but the only escalation is rhetorical; no external or internal obstacle escalates after Lena appears. The absence of push-back keeps pressure literary rather than tactical, satisfying the lyric mode yet capping intensity. Closure reweights meaning rather than options, adequate for 700 words but short of the visible price required for top band.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.9)
    A single dominant stake—redeem a drowned world via equation—is signaled early and tightened through each trial balloon; the cost is conceptual (each burst erodes certainty) but could be more viscerally felt. Agency is clear: Elara chooses to keep iterating, narrowing her options with each launch.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes—atonement versus escape—tighten when the negative reveals the family’s complicity; the cost is the irrevocable shift from observer to inheritor of repair. One decisive deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure tightens once: each coded lullaby narrows the possible futures until only release remains. The cost—letting the borrowed beat go—becomes visible in the mirror’s last shimmer.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—will the leaders sign under the sky-dance—is signaled early, but the only escalation is their hesitation; no new obstacle or revealed cost raises the ante. The blood-ink quill is atmospheric, not tactical; it doesn’t alter Elara’s approach or limit retreat. Peace is achieved without a visible price paid by the protagonist on the page, leaving pressure static.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving the echo of what he annihilated—tightens when the map of cracks forces a single actionable spot; releasing the egg forecloses the option to sell or display it, a visible price. Escalation is causal: each aerial survey converts to on-foot risk as storm clouds gather. No coincidences; pressure is coherent and protagonist-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—liberate suppressed voices—tightens as each thread removed releases an audible echo, narrowing physical and social safety. One meaningful escalation occurs at the lock-click; cost is conceptual (exposure) rather than tangible, sufficient for this length. No antagonist appears, but surveillance ambience supplies pressure; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.3)
    Central stake—ethical storytelling versus complicity in discord—is declared early, but present-tense pressure is low; the argument that birthed the stake has already ended, so escalation is reflective, not live. No new obstacle or temptation tests the resolve; the deepening is purely internal recalibration. Cost is conceptual (foregoing bar income, reputation) yet never dramatized as a sacrifice we witness him weigh against anything tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving vanishing histories—tightens as each knot fails to hold; the gust that unravels the fourth lattice is a clear escalation with visible cost, though the external pressure (wildfire) is more asserted than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—save the names from silence—is signaled early and tethered to personal guilt. Middle beat reconfigures the rope, narrowing options: mis-thread could snap fibers and erase voices forever. Pressure is coherent but single-arc; no secondary opposition appears, so escalation is more steady intensification than twist. Cost is felt in sweat on brow and the rope’s fragility, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—why paths choose walkers—escalates through dream visions and compels the transcendence turn; cost felt in relinquishing certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: seal covenant with cosmos before regimes erase his work. Pressure escalates via each alignment beat—tile glow intensifies, void nebula mapped, fresco gods invoked—culminating in uncloathing. No antagonist needed; regime uncertainty supplies exterior clock. Cost is exposure/irreversibility, felt when tile dims and leaves him “forever altered”; options narrow to lifelong vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will Thorne relinquish resentment?—tightens when reality’s instability makes harbored anger lethal. Escalation is driven by Elara’s single decisive tactic: the memory transfer via box. The tightening forecloses Thorne’s prior stance; his fists unclench and the sanctuary stabilizes, showing visible cost. No reversals needed; one meaningful turn suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reclaim the lost dream—escalates via breath-by-breath agency. Each exhale narrows options until the orchard dissolves into mirrored infinity. Cost is the irreversible fusion of decay and vision; no external antagonist needed. Coincidence (finding the sextant) complicates, does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: can broken vows seed something enduring? Pressure tightens as Elias’s body protests yet he refuses descent; the orchard’s wild fruition mirrors his stubborn repair. One decisive turn—threading the ribbon—renews the covenant’s spirit without restoring its letter. Cost is embodied in aching joints and the irrevocable absence of Mira.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—possession vs. surrender to forbidden knowledge—is signaled early. Pressure rises when visions flood in, but escalation is narrated rather than enacted; no live option is foreclosed on the page, so the tightening is visible only in abstract “warnings of paradox.”

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—“mend rifts, free souls”—is declared early; pressure tightens once when Elara weaponizes a lore omission. Still, escalation is mostly intellectual (translation puzzle) and the price paid is gestural, keeping cost more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—recover Lira before mind frays—tightens once: fog parts, revealing shore/garden, then ship yanks her back. Agency is textual invention; the tightening is clear but the price (loss of proximity) is off-stage, so pressure spikes without tangible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—prevent archival erasure—signaled early; micro-turn when tower protests her touch narrows options; cost is conceptual (tower re-imprisoned, future anomalies denied) but not viscerally felt by Elara, keeping escalation solid yet not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—restore balance without destroying the beings—is signaled early and escalates through one decisive tightening: the ritual must succeed or the caves remain a cacophony. Agency is ritual action; each micro-choice (stone placement, crack alignment) forecloses alternatives and raises stakes. The visible cost is the silencing of her maps, a permanent forfeiture. Coincidence is absent; pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens until the bloom resolves it.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—prove coincidences carry meaning—tightens when the prism’s absence keeps the tower dark. Each shard found is a micro-victory that raises the cost of failure; the final ignition forecloses the option to abandon hope. Agency is steady scavenging and calculation, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preservation of Cloudweaver identity—tightens as shadows lengthen; the single deepening beat (measurement reveals fraying memory) escalates pressure, though agency is more interpretive than active.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—“defy the gravity of hopelessness”—is signaled early and escalates through each beat: the rag’s discovery rekindles possibility, the filtering ritual invests physical effort, the ignition risks catastrophe. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias realizes the fortress’s mineral water changes the burn rate, forcing a recalibration of timing. The cost is visible in the spent rag and the audible gasp before the cheers.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—Thorne’s fear of transition—is signaled early and tightened by the charged pause. Agency is Elara’s subtle act of placing the cicada; the cost is the empathic burden of seeing his scars soften. No external antagonist needed; pressure coheres through silence and reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—capture vanishing silence before gravity resumes—is signaled in paragraph four and sharpened by claustrophobia. Pressure escalates through dwindling minutes and upward drift that limits reach; tactics adapt via rapid “sips.” No external antagonist, but internal fear of enclosure supplies coherent pressure. Cost is opportunity/time rather than tangible loss; still, the tightening clock visibly narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on whether silence can be transmuted into comfort; pressure tightens once when the aether-wind approaches and Elias deploys the vial. The cost is atmospheric rather than material, but it is legible and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaim humanity’s essence—tightens as sunrise deadline forces immediate ascent; cost is the irreversible fusion of self with throne’s code.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—teaching the suffocating to breathe via forced solitude—is signaled early and tightened once through the ring-link. The cost is legible in the companion’s shuddering breath and Elara’s relinquishment of the ring.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“turn past scam-pressure into communal value”—is signaled early and tightened once when she threads the bolt, foreclosing refusal. Escalation is causal and singular: pressure → compression → diamond birth. The price (vent strain, personal risk) is legible; luck complicates rather than rescues. Meets 8-band; higher would require a second option foreclosed or more visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—dynasty survival versus personal legitimacy—tightens with each crank and harmonic pulse. The final revelation reweights the stakes irreversibly, though the cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserve the orchard’s essence before reality shifts—escalates with each traced pattern and aligned fruit. The tightening is visible: walls blur, vines twist, and Elowen’s choice to unsnap armor narrows options to one—become the orchard’s weaver or lose everything. Cost is embodied in the open breastplate and the irreversible crystallization of futures.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—whether Eliza will remain buried in her own sorrow or surface to honor others’ losses—tightens when the letter reveals Josiah’s forfeiture of his pay for Lila’s future. The escalation is coherent but compressed; one more beat of friction would sharpen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“ignite coded freedom before forgetfulness wins”—tightens when encrypted signals die, leaving lone recovery of holotapes. Protagonist agency drives each beat: read puddle, skirt patrols, unlock cache; cost visible in key forfeiture and exposure risk. No off-stage rescue; coincidence (Kael alive) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single dominant stake—silence the prophecy—tightens through each withheld note; the pressure is coherent and intensifies as the prophecy’s murmur rises. Agency is exercised via renunciation (negative space), not action, and the cost is the permanent hush he must inhabit.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate as each decoded leaf warns of blight; her orderly life cracks open under prophetic pressure, narrowing options until she must act to heal the skies or lose all seeds.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—trading certainty for wonder—escalates with each coincidence that strips away his old method. The decisive tightening occurs when he must improvise a harness and etch a map, trading safety for possibility. Cost is visible: the cavern’s collapse threatens to bury him with the past.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recover/redress Lirra’s loss—signaled sentence two. Pressure tightens once: failure’s gravity → cosmic name-weight epiphany → resolve to seek “not in frantic search, but with balanced wisdom,” narrowing options from rescue to pilgrimage. Cost legible: permanent crucible scar, irreversible gold used, and emotional “luminous acceptance” that still means she remains absent. Agency is renunciation of frantic mode; luck never intervenes. High band, just shy of 9 because external world presents no new obstacle after the forge re-forging.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: integrate laughter into spectral healing. Pressure intensifies from Thorne’s wail to final spectral chuckle, foreclosing the option of leaving regrets untouched. One meaningful tightening occurs when misaligned harp forces confession; no coincidence resolves. Closing laughter exacts visible cost—Thorne’s joy is laced with final loss—and Elara’s own luminous ache endures.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can Elias quantify mercy and forgive himself?—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened when the strap re-weaponizes memory into method. One decisive deepening: pain threshold becomes data set. Cost is visible in reopened psychic wounds.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—honor overlooked histories—signaled in third sentence. Escalation: lens reveals glyph → whisper unfastens seal → histories flood back. Cost is conceptual and felt: father lost, between-worlds opened. No coincidence; agency drives every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stake—uncover ceiling secret—signals early and tightens once: the dust pattern diverges, ceiling panel yields, ledgers expose murderous arson. The tightening is knowledge-based rather than option-limiting; no physical or moral cost accrues to Elias during the ascent. Ghost gratitude substitutes for personal consequence, so pressure stays moderate. Closure is earned via causal disclosure, but protagonist risk remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—seize eternity—signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation proceeds via Elias’s agency: deciphering frost, uncorking vial, accepting collapse. One decisive tightening: the whisper’s release irreversibly forecloses any return to prior stability. Cost is legible in the library’s fall and the eternal stasis that traps him.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—the paralysis of cultural memory—tightens when Elias’s devise transforms defensive superstition into generative myth, foreclosing the empirical path. One meaningful escalation: storm → shard-inscribed veil → unified vision; cost is the scholarly faction’s epistemic surrender. Agency is his alone; coincidence merely supplies the storm he weaponizes. Pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens; no reversal needed, only deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming stolen light—is signaled in paragraph four and escalates through each resonance swell. The tightening occurs when Elias’s doubt threatens the chip; the cost is the potential universal rust if he fails. Agency remains with Elias; coincidence never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—piercing the veil where logic fails—is signalled early and tightened by the compass-vision. One meaningful deepening occurs when the compass points inward rather than north. Felt cost is implicit in her solitary descent; escalation reads clean under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—restore frayed timewoven alliances—tightens when the slide’s projection reveals the sailor-guardian pact at risk; Elara’s carving act narrows options and visibly pays the cost of anchoring epochs in a single line of wood.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stake is legible early: decode why night-blooming flowers “wait for the hush,” a proxy for understanding her grandmother’s hidden love. Pressure escalates by accretion rather than reversal—each dawn inspection, postcard alignment, and glass tracing narrows the interpretive field until the pattern locks. No external antagonist, no reversal, yet the deepening costs her sleepless nights and culminates in the glass-weeping moment that forecloses passive curiosity and opens active creation. Cost is present but quiet; sufficient for accumulative lens at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes—truth versus psychic collapse—tighten once, decisively, when the diary’s decryption forces her to risk drowning in memory. Pressure escalates under a causal lens: each retrieval attempt narrows her options until the final vow forecloses retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—rebuild versus abandon—signals in paragraph four and tightens when Elias pockets the vial, narrowing options to DIY biology. Pressure stays coherent under causal lens: each recalled failure (over-fishing, storm damage) raises the perceived difficulty, sharpening the final garden-staking moment. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the only “assist” is memory itself, earned earlier. Price is present but intellectual rather than visceral, keeping the score just below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preserving emotional oaths—faces a single decisive tightening: the prophecy reveals inevitable fracture. Elias’s agency is renunciation/acceptance rather than prevention, and the cost is the loneliness he must now bear. Pressure escalates via the immersion act and the dead-language utterance.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—restore temporal balance by decreasing entropy—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once when seeds glow and pull mists inward, foreclosing dispersal. Agency is ritual action, not interpersonal clash; cost is conceptual (time re-borrowed) rather than visceral. Escalation is single-note but coherent under lyric lens.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—“preserve sacred quiet” under solstice hush—escalates via microclimate anomalies forcing stance crystallization. Bell toll forecloses the mechanical option with visible cost. One meaningful tightening suffices per scope.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—finding strength in vulnerability—is signaled early and tightens through each mapped star-fall. The deepening is present but soft; the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve silence without breaking covenant—is signaled early and tightens when ghosts encircle the box. One meaningful deepening: cracks in glass mirror land fissures, forcing the tactile micro-choice to trace the seam. Cost is conceptual—the hum’s return binds him to lifelong wordless stewardship—yet the price is more implied than viscerally felt. Sufficient for length, but not scalpel-sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reclaim the texture of passing time—tightens when the urn fragment’s pulse offers both revelation and erasure. Escalation is one deepening: each decoded garage-sale clue forecloses linear time further. The final trade-off—eternal now for mortal chronology—is dramatized, not declared. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“find poetry in the broken”—tightens through each tended object until the snapped string forces a stance shift: release equals creation. Pressure is textural, not antagonistic; one meaningful deepening satisfies length. Cost is legible in the lost kite, though the external stakes remain low-intensity, keeping the score sub-8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prove reciprocal respect before death—tightens via each coil laid; the buried chamber discovery reweights stakes from personal legacy to sacramental pact. Agency is continuous: every spiral is a deliberate, irreversible material bet. Cost is visible: sweat, time, bodily risk, and eventual gamble on unproven energies. Clock (“six months”) supplies subtextual pressure, though it never visibly narrows page-level options mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can skepticism survive contact?—is signaled early and tightens as each relic and footprint presses closer. The amber’s reveal is the single deepening that reconfigures options. Agency is present (she lifts, she sets down), but the envoys’ arrival is partly situational coincidence; still, it complicates rather than rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—will salt-death or green-resilience win—signals in line 3 and tightens when birds steer him to “deepest wounds.” One meaningful deepening: birds’ calls shift from ambient noise to rhythmic affirmation, reweighting cost of failure. Agency sits entirely with Elias; no coincidence resolves. Price is legible: volcanic dust spent, linguistic breath expended, future stewardship assumed. Could edge higher if a visible external obstacle (e.g., remaining ordnance) had threatened the last gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—will Harlan bridge distance to Elara?—tightens when the cylinder’s riddle forecloses reunion, forcing acceptance of her survival-driven betrayal. Escalation is driven by his decoding agency; cost is the irreversible loss of the reunion fantasy. One decisive turn suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    Primary stake: mapping confusion into forward motion; each beat escalates pressure—sketch tradition vs temporal stretch—culminating in silhouette mother glimpse that redefines stakes and costs legacy access.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—mend the sky or doom the realms—signals early and tightens with each spectral guardian wave; every swap costs bodily risk and fleeting time-windows. Agency is continuous: Elias’s ritual choices directly weaken the Veil’s resistance. Cost is visible—sweat beading in sub-zero air, sundial flares, cracked guardians—yet the king-piece climax leans on abstract “vortex of unraveling stars” rather than a palpable last price, capping the tension just short of 8+ brilliance.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (free the archive’s forgotten gestures) tightens once the binding resists, forcing a price—her own mnemonic labor and legibility of absence. One visible escalation: she appends “sever” to the spell when the flood coils threaten pull. That choice forecloses secret vengeance and aligns with benevolent ruthlessness. No coincidence, pure agency and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reclaim home’s shape—tightens when each decoded glyph forecloses denial of war’s destruction. Escalation is textural: memories intensify until the only remaining option is to integrate, not escape, the pain.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens when each decoded thread forecloses denial and forces confrontation with the platinum maze. Escalation is driven by Elias’s decisions: entering the labyrinth, choosing paths, facing spectral kings. Cost is visible: the spectral accusations strip away rationalizations, leaving only the whispered absolution. No coincidence resolves the curse; the thaw begins as direct consequence of his earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will collective confession preempt authoritarian judgment—escalates as each poem adds another shard Elara must bear; the tightening is felt in her rising nausea rather than outside interference. Because elders remain off-page, the pressure is largely internalized; still, the Accumulative pattern shifts cadence toward breathless echo, satisfying cost clarity for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    A single dominant stake—oblivion vs. meaning—tightens once when the last pockmark forces the deepest truth; the acid’s rise narrows options, and the price (the workshop still imperiled) is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaim the quay’s essence before time seals him away—is signaled early and tightened by the cave’s narrowing passages and vanishing light. The wrong turn escalates stakes from possible discovery to inevitable loss of the oasis. Cost is felt in the fading beam and the unspoken vow’s weight.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—prove subtle intent can cross death’s divide—is signaled early and tested onstage. Escalation is one deepening: the uncorking amplifies risk of failure, then the gulls’ pattern confirms success. Cost is quiet but real—Elias must shoulder keeper duties alone, guidance now internalized. Agency remains his throughout; coincidence complicates (gulls) but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—how to transmute personal loss into communal return—tightens with each midnight call. Agency is Elias’s renunciation of reunion in favor of guidance; the cost is the widening distance from his wife. Escalation is accumulative: each riddle adds another thread to the reverse-migration web, foreclosing retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure tightens when the eye’s implantation directly narrows Elias’s options, forcing a trade-off between honesty and safety; escalation is legible and protagonist-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—decode the stranger’s gesture—surfaces early; pressure escalates as each borrowed gap narrows Elias’s certainty and forces the final appropriation of the flower. Cost is legible: he relinquishes neutral observation to carry another’s grief. The middle “investigation” beats accumulate texture rather than causal reversals, keeping escalation moderate. Still, under Accumulative lens the intensified imagery accomplishes the required tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—honor wife’s promise vs. empirical skepticism—is signaled early and tightened once by the chip/map discovery; second tightening comes when water crests the ledge, forcing the step-through. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational + internal. The creek clock is a credible constraint that alters footwork on the ledge. Cost is legible: lifelong solitude is confronted in the vision burst, making refusal impossible; closure is protagonist-driven, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—break the dream-curse or succumb—signals early and tightens once: the ridge ascent becomes irreversible after Lirian’s appearance. One meaningful deepening occurs inside the grotto when visions reveal the curse feeds on rulers’ despair, narrowing her options to act. Cost is conceptual (eternal marking) rather than viscerally felt on-page, keeping it below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—renegotiate the friendship’s symbolic debt—tightens when the shell’s cage-function is named; the infusion act forecloses retreat. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens: each ember pop adds sensory density until the columella’s glow crystallizes the new pact. Cost is legible—loss of one irreproducible vial—but because Thorne’s stakes are summarized, the felt price skews one-sided.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single stake: turn dread into living narrative. Pressure accumulates via lyric recursion—grave/soar dyad deepens—but no middle beat narrows real-world options; escalation is poetic, not tactical, so cost stays conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.9)
    A single dominant stake—reclaim sensory meaning—tightens when polishing the screw becomes the decisive, narrowing act; no reversal is needed. Pressure grows through accumulative texture: each drip and rubbed fleck raises the implicit cost of abandoning the past. No external antagonist, yet the internal conflict gains visceral traction. The final poise forecloses retreat without promising full healing, satisfying cost requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—transform scars into stories—is signaled early and tightened through each inscription. The single deepening occurs when stress crystals soften into luminous dust, foreclosing the path of haunted memory. Agency is Elara’s; coincidence never rescues. Cost is felt on the page: the ache of crystals dissolving is visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—deliver apology before demolition—is signaled early; machinery growl at close supplies temporal tightening. Agency is verbal only: she speaks the apology; no tactical use of her exorcist skill set or the bottle beyond initial spritz. Cost is conceptual—the grove falls, Theo fades—but not felt as concrete forfeiture on her part. Escalation is situational pressure rather than causal complication; one meaningful intensification satisfies length, yet the beat set remains thin.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—truth versus cosmic illusion—is signaled early and escalates through each arbitration beat. The tightening is conceptual rather than visceral, but the cost is legible: the witness must surrender his own certainty to achieve unification.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—“what do clocks actually measure?”—is declared early and tightened once: the forbidden reversal of flow. Agency is present, but external risk is absent; no ship, supervisor, or natural threat responds to his tampering, so cost stays internal. The reversal does reconfigure his epistemic stance, satisfying the lens, yet pressure plateaus after the first backward click; escalation is a single step, not a rising curve. Sufficient for 600-word scale but not punching into high-cost band.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—Elara’s need to release her brother’s ghost—tightens when the spores model disentanglement. One decisive deepening: the laser test forces her to confront release as connection, not severance. Cost is conceptual but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—how to inherit her father’s legacy without ruin—tightens through each scrawl’s contradiction. Agency is interpretive; each deciphering forecloses simpler grief and forces the teaching choice. Cost is conceptual but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—Clara’s need for permission to let go—escalates via Elias’s guided spiral; the harmonica’s wail tightens the emotional vise. Agency remains with Clara’s final decision, cost unmistakable in the abandoned connection.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.6)
    One escalating beat—the locket’s reweighting—compels regeneration; the dominant stake (preserve micro-moments) tightens once, sufficient but not multi-plateaued.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (cure loneliness) escalates from quips masking void to circle of shared touch; reciprocity manifests as visible cost when Elias leaves the rock and exits—trade-off enacted. One tightening, no false reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—decode her own grief or remain hollow—signaled in paragraph one and tightened when the melody layers guilt-memories. One meaningful deepening suffices: arrival at the pool forecloses retreat; absorption of forgiveness is irreversible. Pressure escalates via Accumulative lens: notes stack into harmonies that re-weight emotional cost. No coincidence resolves; the rod’s final quiver costs her prior numbness. Legible price: survival-guilt absorbed in full, now permanently resident in skin.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—redeem the log mistake—is signaled early and tightened once: the inscription that re-times the transmission forecloses her ability to keep revising (ink fades, nib bends again). Pressure stays internal but legible under Causal lens; no external antagonist needed. Cost is visible—the pen’s fragility and the anomaly’s playful tug become enduring limits—yet escalation is a single crest rather than layered complications, capping it below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“will Elias remain unseen?”—tightens when public humming forfeits anonymity; price is legible as fishermen turn stare. One meaningful deepening suffices for 700-word Accumulative arc, though pressure is gentle, never existential.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—redeem her arson by rescuing a forgotten promise—is signaled early and tightens once: the vandalized portrait forces her to reinterpret destruction as guardianship. No live antagonist, but the archive itself supplies opposition: hidden doors, slashed canvas, shell mosaic that must be correctly read. Cost is conceptual rather than corporeal—she inherits custodianship of a secret she can never publicly claim—sufficient for 750-word scale. Pressure plateaus after the portrait reveal; the descent to codex adds texture, not new risk.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—salvage the shared dream—tightens via each percussive attempt that fails to restore Kai. Escalation is one sustained intensification: drumbeats grow desperate as memories dim, culminating in the hush where the dream is preserved only within her. Cost is felt in the final solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single stake—prove subtlety beats bombast—tightens when Elias’s whisper-route becomes the only viable rescue after GPS collapse. Agency drives escalation: he chooses stealth tracking, vent-calls, coin-trigger; each move forecloses Marco’s yell-strategy. Visible cost: secret maintenance hack revealed to crew. Storm coincidence complicates, doesn’t solve; satisfies lens.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—whether grief will eclipse or admit light—is signaled early and tightened once when the mirror’s beam fractures into constellation. Escalation is accumulative: each tilt of shutter and mirror deepens the same pressure rather than reversing it. Cost is conceptual (accepting darkness as canvas) and felt in the audible sigh.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—awakening the town’s capacity to question—is signaled early and tightened through each micro-beat: librarian’s doubt, student’s fear, Mira’s resolve. Escalation is accumulative: each new window display increases collective risk and narrows Elias’s margin for error. The final ignition of lights is a decisive, irreversible act that forecloses anonymity. Cost is felt in Mira’s whispered fear and Elias’s pocketed king.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—true-form vs. dock-self—is signaled in paragraph one and sharpened by the bone’s heat and the whale’s call; each sensory hit raises the cost of clinging to land. One meaningful tightening occurs when the island solidifies: staying human now means swimming back to a life that literally vanishes behind her. Agency sits entirely with Elara—she pries, wades, presses bone to chest; coincidence appears only as complication (island surfaces), never as rescue. The price (loss of human legs / dock identity) is visible in the dissolving bone and fading shore, meeting the 8-band threshold but without persistent constraint beyond the moment of dive.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—reclaim art/ether unity—signaled early. One meaningful tightening: paraphrase melts walls, forcing the literal step into frigid water; price is immediate cold soak. Escalation is accumulative: each sensory layer intensifies until ice yields. No second reversal, but single deepening suffices for 700-word lyric arc.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—recover Thorne’s traded clarity—surfaces early and tightens once when Elias proposes the reed-in-glass build. The tightening is intellectually clear but lacks a visceral price paid on-page (lost time, broken piece, social risk), so escalation feels moderate. Agency is shared, diffusing pressure. Closure reconfigures stakes, satisfying lens, yet the cost is more conceptual than felt, capping entry into the 8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—texture of connection—tightens once when the bell weaves playground giggles into persistent harmony, foreclosing the assumption that joy is ephemeral; no visible secondary loss or price is dramatized on-page, so escalation feels intellectually rather than viscerally costly.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—teach oneself to bloom again—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when Elara folds the stencil into action, gifting Lira. Cost is oblique: Elara’s grief softens, but no tangible price is paid on-page. Agency is present but leans charitable rather than sacrificial.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—mapping cultural patterns to forecast healing—is signaled early and tightened when Elara risks exposing her method to Theo. The deepening occurs when they verbally multiply paths together, foreclosing solitary secrecy. Cost is legible: shared responsibility for futures they now co-author. Agency drives every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.8)
    Single stake—knowledge versus innocence—signaled early. Escalation is textural: density of nostalgic fragments intensifies rather than narrows options. No visible tactical cost between first and final dance step; the price is declared retrospectively. A sharper mid-scene trade-off would lift pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“preserve the shape of hope”—is signaled early and tightened once via the footage comparison; the shadow’s metamorphosis narrows options to stabilize or lose hope forever. Cost is felt in Elara’s glowing tears.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—integrity vs complicity—signalled early; pressure tightens when each “layer” of deceit is physically stripped while he works. Escalation is steady but single-thread; no second reversal, and external jeopardy (arrest, violence) stays off-stage, muting peak cost.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—will she reopen the scar narrative or cauterize it—tightens when plants demand tunneling, foreclosing sterile closure. Agency drives every escalation: she digs, she presses stone, she decides to bandage. Cost legible: emotional wound reopened, hourglass re-started, solitude confirmed. No coincidence resolves; opal is buried consequence, not deus-ex.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—locating unused love—tightens through escalating psychometric visions that foreclose detachment. The final choice to act carries visible emotional cost. No external antagonist is needed; internal pressure suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—freeing caged creativity—threads every paragraph; the act of rest constitutes the single meaningful tightening, trading agency for receptivity. Cost is aesthetic (risk of permanent emptiness) yet only declarative; no concrete external consequence manifests if the stars refuse her. Still, the lyric escalation (auroras → meteors → internal bloom) accumulates pressure under Accumulative lens, and the final image forecloses the “barren canvas” future, so escalation reads.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—seed possibility before darkness—signals in line 3 and tightens when the charm risks collapsing “wrong.” One visible price: the archive’s approval fades, leaving the guard still dreamless; this loss narrows future options. Escalation is textural—glow spreads, lullaby fractures—but agency remains Elias’s throughout. Cost is legible on page, satisfying lens-aligned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stake—“rediscover the wild frontier”—is declared early but never sharpened into a concrete forfeiture or deadline. Pressure escalates only texturally: the hum grows louder, the gear warms, but no choice forecloses an alternative. Translocation presents mild disorientation, never danger or trade-off. Without a visible price or narrowing option, escalation feels decorative rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—claim unused courage—tightens once when the elder punches the first star; second punch at the cove reweights the stake with glowing evidence of cost. Pressure is steady but single-cycle; no live option is foreclosed mid-journey, limiting escalation band.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: cost of safety versus lost song. One meaningful tightening: bolt discovery forces Elias to re-measure that cost on the spot; no option widens afterward. Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens; silence accumulates density until the final stance crystallizes with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—restore cosmic balance by exposing Varak—is signaled early and escalates through spreading messages that gradually peel his glamour. Pressure grows texturally: each inscription adds density, unsettles spectral spies, and compels scholarly assembly. Protagonist agency is steady yet risk-free; she is never intercepted or forced to recalculate, so tightening is present but not acute. Cost is cosmically visible yet personally unfelt, satisfying the lens but limiting intensity.</answer>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth’s gravitational drift emerges organically through the accumulating marginalia rather than overt statement. Final image—illusion fracturing like autumn leaves—reweights earlier “drift” motif without moralizing. Subtext in the cryptic notes invites reader participation, creating lingering ambiguity about knowledge’s own seductive pull. No thematic echo violations; complexity is honored.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—has the ocean erased its own memory?—is signaled early and tightens through pattern accumulation rather than reversals. The single deepening (paths rerouted, not erased) is legible and irreversible, but the price paid is purely cognitive; no live option is foreclosed for Elara, only her interpretive frame shifts. Agency is observational, not tactical, limiting escalation bandwidth. Still, the accumulative pressure of rising ink lines against fading atlas edges delivers a felt reconfiguration under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: reignite a stalled rebellion. Escalation occurs when the circle’s hum reframes scattered losses as connectable nodes, tightening options from passive scavenging to active signaling. No external antagonist; pressure is situational—cosmic indifference versus human agency. The final hum forecloses retreat, with the cost of exposure to Core Authority patrols.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“evolve tradition with intent” versus “sealed destiny”—is signaled early and narrows to one irreversible act: break the amber. Pressure tightens when glyphs reveal a cavern that tradition deliberately buried; unsealing it forfeits the safety of inherited hierarchy. The tightening is single but meaningful; no secondary reversal is needed at this length. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, capping the score below the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—how to carry memory without paralysis—tightens through the freeze-to-sketch beat. The escalation is internal yet legible; the price is ongoing vulnerability, not cheap release.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.8)
    A single dominant stake—can Elias salvage his ability to paint souls?—is signaled early and tightened by each knot he loosens. The decisive deepening occurs when he realizes the threads are his own memories; each severance narrows future options and exacts an emotional toll. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the storm outside merely intensifies pressure. The cost is visible in the final image: a bound cord that replaces the broken box, sealing both loss and possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: discover why time slows in crisis. Escalation proceeds via causal beats: ink pattern reveals next move, drone scouts, sorcerer’s basin confirms the rite. Each step narrows Elara’s options—direct assault becomes impossible, vanishing becomes necessary. The final cost is felt: she forfeits immediate justice to gain cosmic knowledge, a visible trade-off under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. complicity—escalates in one continuous arc: unauthorized thaw → forbidden knowledge → irreversible transmission. Pressure tightens with each beat; the final upload forecloses retreat and carries visible social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve sanctuary/continuity—tightens once when the crack appears; the micro-choice to sheath the knife and embed the scrap forecloses violent defense with felt cost. Escalation is single-point but sufficient; storm complicates, calm earned, no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes—celestial cover-up vs. family honor—are declared early, but pressure plateaus: no ticking clock, no incremental reveal of cost. Elara’s intervention is a single gesture; it neither narrows her options nor extracts a price. Escalation is a single beat, not a tightening curve.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—“can communal silence be designed?”—is legible, but pressure escalates via additive imagery rather than harder choices; no option is foreclosed until the ambient hush simply “lingers.” Cost is atmospheric, not tactical, keeping the beat below high-band tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—protect empathy without letting it devour her—tightens when the vision reveals the fire was born of the same empathy; the rename forecloses vengeance as a live option. Single meaningful escalation suffices: knowledge of the fire’s origin forces her to absorb its burden rather than externalize blame. Cost is legible in the warm-cold tremor of her voice and the vines’ slow reclaim of ruin. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the crowd arrives as resonance, not rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—lure possibility from despair—is signaled early and tightened once: the dance literally brightens futures. Agency is collaborative but real; each echoing footfall forecloses permanent exit from the garden. Cost is conceptual (she binds herself to a looping phantom circuit) rather than tangible; still legible under short-form lens. A second reversal or material price would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“can intimacy exist without tech shortcuts?”—tightens when the recalled pill is rejected in favor of somatic mapping; the long-exposure timer supplies soft pressure. One meaningful deepening: the static-tingle on skin converts from obstacle to instrument, narrowing options to bodily truth. Price is visible: Theo’s skepticism softens under literal touch, foreclosing chemical escape.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving human memory—intensifies when the fossil’s quantum echo reveals future psychic scars. One clear tightening: the buoyant drift across the lagoon becomes the irreversible pivot that binds her to the role of voice; cost is the burden of bearing unborn grief.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—liberate prophecy from fatalism—signaled in paragraph two and escalates as each button re-orders the echo. Micro-turn: murmurs shift from discord to harmony, tightening pressure. Cost is conceptual but legible: she forfeits sole guardianship by choosing dissemination.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming agency after betrayal—tightens when the spiral coordinates demand physical risk and trust. One decisive deepening: offering the pillbox to Marcus narrows options from lone redemption to joint reckoning. Cost is the reopened wound of shared treason.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—liberation from layered oaths—tightens as rain gutters cease; the silence forces the decisive re-write of the vow. Escalation is one deepening, not multiple reversals, but it narrows options to “guard with grace or be chained.” Cost is the forfeiture of ancestral guilt.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.9)
    Central stake—why places endure—threads early and tightens through lantern visions, but pressure is observational: Elias watches timelines rather than risking anything tangible. No option narrows; no visible price (lost water, broken pottery, delayed journey) attaches to the insight, so escalation stays intellectual. Sufficient for short-form thematic piece, yet lacks the felt constraint or trade-off demanded at 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to honor loss without being immobilized by it—tightens when the last petal drops. Escalation is quiet but legible: each oar stroke narrows options until the scattering commits her to a new, riskier form of cultivation.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.9)
    Domesticating solitude into fierce autonomy is the escalating, underwritten by the proxy conflict with extinction. Stakes tighten once: the library becomes crucible rather than cage.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—recovery of lost human connection—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the spotted letter collapses distance between ghost-writer and client, forcing public re-identification. No tangible price (time, tool, social risk) is shown on the page; the cost is emotional assertion. Enough for a lyric short, but the tightening is single-shot rather than accumulative tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—stop cosmic tricksters from weaponizing belief—tightens when Elara injects counter-frequencies, trading her isolation for a campus-wide psychic cost. Agency is clear: her interference, not luck, warps signal and fractures Harlan’s platform. Escalation is singular but sufficient: each paragraph intensifies the stakes from campus schism to physical malaise felt by all. Price is visible on-page (Harlan clutches head, chants falter), meeting the 9-band threshold but stopped by the softer final personal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—retrieve the Keystone or remain trapped by space itself—tightens once when the organ’s reverberation forces a single, irreversible choice. Cost is visible: the nexus’s embrace nearly crushes her before the seam parts.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—revive communal empathy via art—tightens when ribbon evidence reappears; one meaningful deepening as sketch unifies opposites, narrowing options to confront detective tomorrow. Cost is conceptual but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—redeem Thorne—tightens when nail forces a public query that risks ridicule; guild’s terse “affirmation” forecloses anonymity option, visible cost in her exposed tears. Pressure escalates under causal lens: each decoded stanza increases reputational risk until the reversal locks her into new archival duty amid still-raging storms.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—convert lifelong “never” into a lived crossing—signaled in paragraph one. Middle beat: reading the scaffold flutters narrows options to one hidden path, forfeiting the safety of the road. Costing the bow’s lament gives a felt price. Escalation is textural (density of omens) rather than causal reversal, appropriate to lens; still, one micro-turn suffices.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of pardoning one’s unlived bridges emerges through the flake’s “pixelated amnesty” reframing sour notes into possibility. No moralizing; final image of music spanning the chasm reconfigures meaning without statement. Ambiguity survives: is the hitchhiker muse, ghost, or projection? Subtext in wind-driven scaffold Morse—nature itself coaxing agency.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—preservation vs. exploitation of abandoned rail—is signaled early and tightens through surveyor incursion; Elias’s territorial gambit narrows options and forces a public cost (foreign bills now territorial flags), closing the loop from legend to legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: decode temple wisdom; tightening occurs when dream-vision reveals shared burdens as key, but this is received wisdom, not an action that narrows waking options. Agency is observational—she “reaches out” in dream with words that ease phantom figures, yet no visible price (fatigue, social risk, memory loss) attaches to her awake self. Pressure is lyrical, not situational, adequate for Accumulative lens but shy of 8.8 cost requirement. No live option is foreclosed; she ends inspired, not cornered.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—uncover hidden truth—tightens when the seed’s pulse offers revelation at the cost of potential self-consumption. One clear escalation beat: the unbend widens gyres and forces stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.4)
    Temporal eclipse drives each escalation; choices tighten as futures collide; cost is visible when Elara funnels her essence into the link, foreclosing other paths.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“trade destinies for peace”—is signaled early and tightened when the card’s pulse demands action, foreclosing retreat. One meaningful escalation: Thorne’s mock warning → Elara’s root-etch choice narrows options and binds both souls. Cost is visible: card disintegrates, Thorne’s form “solidified slightly,” Elara’s prior grief now shared. Pressure stays causal under lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—recover purpose after loss—surfaces in paragraph 1 and tightens when the locket fiasco publicly confirms drift. The cloth beat supplies one meaningful micro-turn: discard (sever past) vs. keep (continue archiving). Pressure is internal and static; no external antagonist or deadline narrows options further. Escalation is therefore a single deepening rather than rising jeopardy, adequate for this length but short of the visible price that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding transition to re-link with the departed spirit—tightens through each analogical leap; the final planting narrows options to acceptance, with the cost of irreversible separation made legible in the arbor’s lonely pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes—preserve wonder against erasure—are signaled early and tightened through each smelt; the librarian’s agency is the act of acceptance itself, which forecloses the option of letting identities scatter. Cost is felt in the irreversible fusion of fish and page.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—can anything bridge human isolation?—is signaled early and tightened once: the pearl offers a single, irreversible shot. Pressure is abstract (echoed sorrow, radiant promise) rather than tactical, but the final act forecloses the option of leaving the caves untouched. Visible price is conceptual rather than visceral, satisfying the lens but only just.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—signals early; pressure escalates via discovery of private map references that tighten the emotional noose. Yet the decisive tightening comes from graffiti coincidence, not protagonist agency, so escalation feels visited upon him rather than wrought by him; cost is present but not visibly paid by an on-page sacrifice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—reach library—signaled early; each cipher layer/watch delay narrows timeframe and forces patience, a credible cost. No external antagonist; pressure is internal/time. One meaningful tightening when reversed cycle clicks into coordinates. Could use a sharper tangible forfeiture (energy, safety) to push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.3)
    Perforated destiny is the dominant stake; coffee-stain prophecy and plant telepathy act as immediate pressures. Escalation: narrowing to play or archive, no other route visible. Cost is felt in the final note that forecloses the imperial path.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—preserve self against obliteration—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens through each memory fused; the infusion beats are irreversible expenditures of her remaining presence. Accumulative escalation: pattern density in the aurora increases until the final spark is squeezed into the chip, foreclosing continuation of her caretaker role. Cost is legible as bodily fade and final tumble of the gem. No external coincidence required.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—find contentment—tightens once the hairpin re-visions past cycles; scalloping the fresh vine dramatises visible cost, foreclosing the search. Pressure is coherent but single-beat; no second twist or resource lost.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—leave or stay in the city job—is signalled early. Escalation is textural: each new chime tone layers density rather than narrows causal options. The decisive turn is her internal unhooking, foreclosing paralysis with on-page cost (the wind whipping the empty cloak away). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—personal safety vs unlocking backward aging—tightens once when the broadest ripple reveals “full vanishing…might not return unchanged.” Agency is intellectual and spiritual rather than kinetic: observing, interpreting, withholding. Pressure escalates through ring-by-ring revelation under trance, culminates in a visible trade-off (proceed despite risk), satisfying Accumulative/Textural lens. No external antagonist needed; internal obsession supplies sufficient heat.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.8)
    A single dominant stake—mastery of unmoving navigation—tightens when the starlings veer into an arrow, forcing Elara’s decisive fusion with the relic; the cost is the permanent surrender of corporeal roaming.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—prove simple magic against automated perfection—escalates through each beat: vines resist, mists invite, keystone amplifies. The felt cost is the public obscurity she accepts by embracing inefficiency.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—discover the color of sound—is signaled early and tightened through escalating sensory pressure (lanterns above, algae below). The decisive turn—inserting the tag to unlock the orb—forecloses the option of remaining an ordinary lamplighter. Cost is visible in the spent tag and the irrevocable knowledge. Slight deduction for coincidence of tides aligning exactly tonight.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether to trust the backwards prophecy or surrender to cosmic unraveling—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation occurs through each failed distillation attempt, tightening the noose of doubt until the final burst forces a trade-off: coins for alignment. The tightening is driven by Elara’s agency; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. Cost is legible in the irreversible loss of the coins and the open risk of further collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can transmute loss into guardianship—tightens once, decisively, when the crystals form and he pockets one. Pressure is situational yet coherent: the observatory’s dusk-clock and the fading gramophone create an urgent now-or-never frame. The cost is crystallized in the shard he bears, a literal weight of memory.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore the vanished seas—signals early and tightens via accelerating drip intervals. One meaningful turn: seven-second pattern recognition → bell repair → first moisture. Agency is Elias’s precise attunement; cost is the fracture absorbed into his brittle faith. Pressure coheres under Causal lens; coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—the communal grudge—escalates as the town emerges; the sapphire label tightens the choice to forgive or perpetuate bitterness. Cost is legible at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—harmonize logic and intuition—tightens when the starling patterns expose flaws in her equations. Escalation is driven by her agency (holding crystal to flame) and culminates in a visible price: the crystal liquefies, foreclosing reversion.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“preserve trust under pressure”—is signaled early and tightened once when the spiral anomaly forces a live revision that forecloses the prior benign reading. Agency is decision, not coincidence; cost is the perpetual return of the watcher’s burden.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—ownership of the duplicate self—tightens into a life-or-emotion hinge once Kai realizes vivification is the sole path to feeling. Blade-cut through containment is the earned reversal that collapses corporate, archivist, and personal claims into one irreversible act; the price (shared identity, history stabilized around him) is legible on page. Pressure escalates under causal lens: each slice removes an option until only merge remains. No extraneous antagonistic noise after guards are dispelled.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—reviving creative edge—signaled early. Pressure intensifies once through the seed’s arrival, but no live option is foreclosed on-page; cost is deferred to future patrons. Escalation is tonal, not tactical, sufficient for short lyric arc under Accumulative lens yet short of visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—restore laughter without erasing loss—is signaled in the opening paragraph and tightened with every cord yank. Agency is embodied: Elias revs the blowers higher when the vines coil tighter, forcing a trade-off between silence and painful release. The cost is palpable: the laughter that returns is ghostly, not whole, proving the victory is partial and haunted.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—bridge dimensional exile—tightens once when waiting flips to active integration. Pendant retrieval is the decisive beat that narrows options from passive vigil to embodied acceptance. Cost is the garden’s chill etched into her mind.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—break clerical fate or ossify—announced early and tightened with each failed melt; options narrow as the crozier shortens. Mid-scene reversal: realization that perfection is the enemy forces intentional fracture, paying the price of ancestral relic. Agency drives every escalation; coincidence absent. Cost is material (lost staff) and social (excommunication implicit), altering future tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake is legible: harvest a usable signal tonight. Pressure stays single-note—will interference drown the whisper?—until she dumps “assumptions,” after which static resolves; tension plateaus rather than tightens. No option is foreclosed, no resource spent, no external obstacle exploited. Escalation is internal and declarative; cost remains conceptual, so the beat feels eased rather than driven.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—preventing dissolution into parallel folds—is signaled early and escalates as passengers fade. Elias’s agency peaks when he aligns radio frequencies with etched patterns, a clear tightening beat. Yet the cost (permanent entanglement of timelines) is announced more than experienced; pressure is legible but not viscerally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“texture of connection”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when each weave replaces absent humans with phantom touches that still feel “slippery.” One meaningful deepening suffices: the eruption forecloses the fantasy of gentle intimacy, forcing him to accept a “gritty” bond instead. Cost is visible on-page: shattered reflections and the throbbing lattice that now “binds him to echoes.” Agency is preserved; the eruption is the cumulative result of his over-threading, not external accident.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes—reconciling alien geometry with human navigation—escalate cleanly from salvage to classroom to expedition; each beat narrows options (sonar vs. starlight) and exacts social/ emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—preserve fragile post-mortem voices—faces one meaningful tightening when Elara links Eliza’s pulse to Mira’s demolition plan. Agency is present: Elara acts, confronts, and forecloses the redevelopment path. Yet the cost is borne off-page by Mira, not Elara; the tracer herself loses nothing tactile in the beat, keeping the pressure instructive rather than visceral. Sufficient for the word count, but not gut-punching.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—honor the forgotten—signaled early and tightened by tidal clock. One meaningful escalation: codex activation forces irreversible choice. Cost is the codex itself and the spectral release; agency is Elias’s hand on the console.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reclaim meaning from bureaucratic death—tightens when the ink ritual becomes the only path to restore Elias. One decisive intensification: the scanner’s whir reweights options, foreclosing retreat. Cost is the blood and the irrevocable exile it ratifies.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—the death of a textured language—is signaled in the first paragraph and tightened through each echo. Escalation is driven by Elar’s agency: aligning diamond with flock to transmute loss into resonance. The price is the diamond’s curse and the last elder’s silence.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—uncovering what happened to the missing—escalates through the phone’s confessions and arrowhead’s pull; the tightening is one decisive shift into metamorphosis with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are declared early—mechanical sprawl vs. orchard magic—and tighten once when roots physically uproot anchors, foreclosing the option of coexistence. Escalation is linear, not recursively costly; Elara’s agency never meets a fresh obstacle after the first statue cracks. No tangible price (fatigue, broken bow, social exile) is exacted from her, so pressure plateaus rather than deepens.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—bridging broken promises—escalates because Elias’s agency tightens options; the drone crossing is a clear irreversible act with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    A single dominant stake—whether silence or possibility will prevail—tightens when the fragment demands voice; the escalation is driven by Elias’s agency, but the price (loss of lifelong silence) is more conceptual than viscerally staged.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—locating “where stories live”—drives Elara’s midpoint geometry sketch, but stakes never tighten beyond personal discovery; pressure plateaus rather than compels a higher-cost trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—capture vs. release the runaway dream—tightens once when projection reveals the spire demands freedom. Agency: her decision to let the image fade forecloses future attempts, price paid in visible tears. Escalation is accumulative: each dawn failure adds pigment weight until the palette itself argues for release. Cost legible; no coincidence resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.5)
    Fear vs cosmic union supplies one dominant stake; pressure tightens from paralysis to irrevocable choice. Both beats are driven by Elara’s agency with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—recover stolen memories—is signaled early and tightened once via the mushroom’s hum; cost is the irreversible immersion in the past, but pressure plateaus rather than escalates.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reversible exile—signaled in title phrase and crystallizes when glass shadow pulses. Single meaningful tightening: tea-trace narrows infinite paths to one outward arc, foreclosing Lir’s doubt. Protagonist agency drives escalation: Elara chooses to mentor, annotates, hands over charged shard; shadow recedes as direct result. Cost legible: her own exile test completes only when pupil walks free.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—“preserve the color of wonder”—is signaled early and escalates through each captured essence. A single decisive intensification occurs when Elara chooses to plant the seed, foreclosing safe possession in favor of communal restoration. Cost is visible: the seed, once planted, cannot be retrieved. No coincidence resolves the tension; agency remains with Elara throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—free the brother and herself—faces one meaningful tightening: confession mid-ritual makes continued silence impossible, raising psychic cost. Agency sits with every knot she unpicks; each tug releases both silence and culpability, so escalation is causal, not declarative. The moment she names the storm she “let him sail,” the net’s resistance noticeably slackens—visible price on tactics. No reversal beyond the confession is needed; the single deepening satisfies the short-form bar.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—bridging the map’s tear to recover his father’s voice—tightens when the silent footage reveals a shifting earth outline that matches the rupture. One decisive escalation: the ground has moved, exposing the latch; retreat is no longer viable. Agency is Elias’s alone; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. Cost is the irreversible entry into a silence that may never speak back.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“understand the physics of letting go”—tightens when Earhart’s distorted voice converts historical loss into lived equation; the note’s “physics of release” deepens rather than widens conflict. No external antagonist needed; pressure is accumulative density. Cost is legible: he surfaces without the grasp he came seeking, globe held but meaning reframed. One meaningful cadence shift satisfies lens.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: give voice to the bolted-away dreams. Pressure tightens as thunder nears; each encoded line narrows time and raises stakes of irreversible fusion. The decisive turn—pressing the plate into the mural—forces a trade-off: ghost freed, Elowen forever linked as its conduit. Cost is visible in the “luminous wisp” and her own voice now carrying extra weight.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stake is “uncover joy beneath anguish,” but pressure is atmospheric, not tactical; no floor presents a real threat or fork. Escalation is accretive texture—each page blooms—yet options never narrow and no price is exacted. The conflict is elegiac stasis rather than growing cost.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—prove sky remembers Lena—tightens once: oxygen scarcity forces the last memorializing gaze, turning cataloguing into possible last rite. Agency remains observational rather than active; cost is atmospheric, not chosen, so escalation is moderate. Sufficient for length, but a conscious trade-off (jettison ballast? risk higher ascent?) would sharpen the final pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—save the library’s memory—signaled in paragraph one. Mid-story tightening occurs when the book forces her to paint faces she cannot see, trading safe abstraction for intimate confrontation; this narrows options and raises emotional cost. External deadline (demolition) supplies mounting bass-note but lacks a tangible beat-by-beat escalation (no blade sighting, no crew shadow). Still, final image pays the price: mural completed, building doomed, her perceptual world permanently enlarged.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes tighten once: idle relic becomes risky luminance hunt. The warning about “volatile aura” raises cost, but no immediate tactical trade-off (fuel, time, crew safety) is priced on the page, so pressure intensifies conceptually rather than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—learning repair rhythm—tightens through each beat: prophecies hint rhythm, hall forces alignment choice, timepiece restart demands synchronized cadence. Visible cost: she uncaps her literal heartbeat rhythm to the world. Escalation coheres under Causal lens (because/therefore linkage). No coincidences solve stakes; everything earns causality.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.8)
    Pressure tightens as the blight spreads and the Grovekin’s doubt spikes, but the collective turn lacks a visible individual cost until the bell rings.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—world’s end versus gentle fade—is signaled early and tightened through Elara’s calibration choice. Escalation is textural: each nested pattern in the puppet deepens the hush until the lullaby becomes the only viable response. No external antagonist; pressure is existential and internal. Cost is felt in the irreversible shift of the clock’s hands.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—guide family vs orchard curse—escalates via frost-clock tightening and mechanical-bird re-route. One decisive reconfiguration (birds from predators to shepherds) with visible price: Elara’s future tied tighter to orchard.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—repairing the mother-daughter rupture—is signaled early; pressure escalates via the foamed-water insight that reframes her past choices as “chrysalis shells,” not endpoints. The tightening is intellectual rather than tactical: no concrete obstacle or price is risked in the phone call, keeping cost more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—finding the origin of stories—tightens when quantified absences translate into physical incisions that consume her only moonlight; option space narrows to one final glow. Each incision escalates under Accumulative logic: absence tally ↑, bottle brightness ↓, orchard response ↑. Cost is visibly paid (light motes lost, warmth on slate) and alters tactics—she can’t restart once the bottle empties. No coincidence resolves; the alcove appears as direct consequence of her final cut.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—purge accumulated remorse—signaled in paragraph two and escalates as each orb is swallowed, raising psychic cost. One meaningful tightening: the moment she chooses raw ingestion over culinary mediation, foreclosing her former method. Under Accumulative lens the density of regret orbs reweights the stake without external reversals. Cold ache in bones serves as visible price, legible at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (turn silo barriers into bridges) is signaled in para 4 and tightened when Klaus steps out wary. Agency sits with Elara at each because/therefore node: her bilingual invitation, her folk-tune pivot, her pendulum gesture that calms water-rights tension. Cost is present—she risks public rejection and pays with the irreversible first step—but the pressure plateaus rather than deepens after Javier joins; no second reversal pushes toward 9.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—excavate abandoned dreams via self-rewiring—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when the neural surge forecloses normal memory access. Escalation is one decisive intensification: the synaptic burst that fuses past and present at visible pain cost. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the canyon’s quake is metaphorical approval, not deus ex machina. The final smile acknowledges irreversible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes—“find forgotten combinations or world balance frays”—are declared, then dramatized when inversion opens the maze and seeds become tangible. One meaningful tightening occurs at the zero-G moment that converts danger into opportunity; price (future vigilance burden) is legible but not yet felt.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: can empathy survive in a world silenced by trauma? Pressure tightens when strumming risks shattering the sculpture. Agency is the deliberate act of strumming despite that risk; the cost is the audible widening of cracks—harmony bought with further fracture. Escalation is causal and single-turn, sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stakes—restore covenant before eclipse locks shadow—tighten methodically; moonrise acts as live clock narrowing choices; exile’s personal cost escalates with each magnetic pulse, forcing the decisive correlate.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—recover silence’s voices—threads every beat; pressure tightens once when the tuner’s hum must align or fail, foreclosing brute force. Stakes remain intellectual/emotional; no concrete external consequence alters tactics, so cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt. Sufficient for this length, but the tightening is gentle, not option-narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—can she master the flower without losing her calm?—is signaled early. Escalation is one sustained tightening: each whiff intensifies the assault until the tide-turn moment forces a stance crystallization. Agency is her decision to endure and journalize; coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—uncover the source of resilience—is signaled early and escalates through the inversion. The tightening moment is the discovery of the glade and relic; agency is present, cost is conceptual (custodianship). Pressure remains coherent under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—prevent next crash—tightens as each gust reading forecloses prior assumptions; cost is felt in Elias’s bodily fatigue and the town’s silence. One meaningful escalation suffices under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“certify wonder as essential”—is signaled early and answered when the statue’s eyes prove marvel tangible. Pressure escalates by accretion: each bell thickens chromatic density until silence must yield; no external antagonist needed. The tightening is singular but unmistakable: the third scarlet spiral forces the crack. Cost is conceptual yet legible: the amber sheet expires, signifying irretrievable expenditure of craft.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure grows from failing guardianship → need for insight → flute trial narrowing options. The unresolved tear and insight cost escalate clearly; coincidence never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can emotion be solved like math—tightens when transposed empathy backfires, forcing a stance shift. Escalation is causal: each borrowed personality increases internal turbulence until the equation fractures, price paid in relinquished certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure tightens once: the pendant’s hum forces Elias to choose between safe delivery and transformative sharing; the shepherd’s wonder is the visible price—an irreversible germination of wonder that forecloses Elias’s quiet anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—proving objects absorb emotions—tightens when the frost reveals her own buried guilt, forcing a micro-choice of apology. Cost is felt (tears warm the prism), though the external stakes remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—bridge the impossible distance to her brother—is signaled in paragraph one and escalates through each puzzle-fit that narrows possibility to one course: sacrifice the tapestry. The tightening is textural rather than causal-reversal, but the final unweaving forecloses any later repair, paying an on-page price that reweights the silence. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—save orchards from arch-collapse—signaled in paragraph 1. Stakes tighten once: hammer-on-silk beat converts debris into anchoring vines, foreclosing the “do nothing” option with visible price (silk frays). Escalation is singular but sufficient for 700-word scope; coincidence absent. No secondary antagonist needed; planet decay supplies coherent pressure. Cost is legible and persistent. Lacks a second reversal or ancillary loss, capping it low-8.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—the weight of truth—escalates via each parallel crash; each redirect tightens option space and ends in a foreclosure choice with an anchor’s gravity as paid price.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—restoring the light while deciding whether to carry the unseen burden of the keepers’ chain—tightens once Elias reads the final letter. The pressure is coherent, but escalation is gentle; the story relies more on atmospheric accumulation than a decisive reversal that forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—“shape a new dawn from ancient shadows”—is signaled early; pressure deepens through each pulse of accidental prophecy that warns of his own erasure, tightening stakes without external antagonist. One meaningful intensification suffices for 600-word lyric-accumulative design: the vision of the girl externalizes consequence and narrows his option to relinquish control. Cost is conceptual (self-dissolution) rather than visceral, capping entry to 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—“why do some magnetize stories?”—is declared early; pressure tightens when sunlight refracts and patrons look up, externalizing her internal question. No visible price is exacted; the risk of exposure is asserted, not felt. Escalation is imagistic rather than tactical; options do not materially narrow.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s need to decode the trees’ silent testimony—escalates through each beat of sextant repair and culminates in a single, decisive tightening: the moment the device shows him the labyrinth’s true map. Cost is conceptual but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“rekindle this realm before it dissolves”—is signaled early and tightened by each recovered song. Agency is ritual action, not dialogue; the cost is the exhaustion of memory itself. One clear deepening: the mica window’s frame must be sealed with luminous paste, foreclosing retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes center on reclaiming a mistake as connection; pressure tightens once Elias steps into the veiled realm, but external opposition feels muted—mid-band escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming sacredness from decay—tightens through each beat of planting and offering; the pressure is coherent but the cost, while felt, is more atmospheric than viscerally foregrounded.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—vanishing vows—signaled early; pressure escalates through measurable frequency drops rather than external antagonist. The 432 Hz splintering supplies one vivid tightening beat that narrows options to manual recalibration. Cost is conceptual (endless vigil) rather than visceral; a sharper tangible loss would push higher. Escalation stays accumulative, coherent, and lens-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—father’s safety—escalates through each failed ploy, narrowing options. The flare sabotage is a visible, irreversible cost that forecloses retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—why weather-carriers exist and whether Elara is one—escalates through each sensory anomaly and forest broadcast; the final tightening is her realization that the question now includes herself, with the cost of unanswerable identity.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will Elias silence or surrender to his gift—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when the lock yields. The safe’s contents force a visible trade-off: decades of avoidance for immediate, irreversible creation. Pressure escalates causally; no coincidence resolves the conflict. Cost is palpable in the “luminous grief for lost years.”

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single dominant stake—recover lost candor—tightens when Kael’s lie browns the leaves, forcing subterranean risk. Vault entry is irreversible tactical narrowing; retrieved resonators foreclose former art-as-ornament path. Cost (physical descent, social defiance, exposure of Kael) legible on page. Could escalate further had Kael physically obstructed rather than only warned.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—“preserve the color of wonder”—is declared, then demonstrated as the symphony restores villagers’ hues; pressure heightens by accumulative intensification of bell/ice refrains. Yet Elias himself faces no narrowing options or visible price; the risk is purely thematic, not tactical, keeping the escalation one-notch removed from personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—prevent farm collapse via self-calibration—is signaled early. Escalation occurs through each shard’s burn, narrowing options until only retention of the final fear remains. Agency drives every intensification; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“prove listening heals”—is signaled early and tightened when each storyteller adds a withheld letter; the mailbox’s sealed mouth embodies the cost of silence. One meaningful turn: Tomas’s reveal that the key is already in Eliza’s locket narrows options from search to act. Pressure is coherent but civil; no external antagonist raises physical stakes. Emotional cost is legible in the final spill of aging apologies.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are singular (free Liora) and escalate through each roll-dance-cipher cycle. The AI’s resistance tightens options; the final breach costs the lab itself. Agency remains with Elara throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—retrieving a deleted memory—escalates cleanly from whale-portent to flower-exhume, with one visible cost: the loneliness of remembering. The middle lacks a second hard tightening—gravity pockets don’t further complicate tactics—but pressure remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake is preserving world balance vs. binding doom; middle-deepening traces to ritual flow choice narrowing options. Cost felt: physical drain, sweat, and final conceptual price of sealing prophecy. Prophecy tension rises through tangible signs (water surge); coincidence absent. Resolution earned without luck.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—Elara’s desire to learn the building’s true language—tightens when she must decide whether to confront Thorne. The rooftop interrogation forces a trade-off: risk the fragile trust or remain ignorant. Escalation is steady via weekly teas; no coincidence resolves anything. Cost is the acceptance of shared custodianship and the haunting knowledge that follows.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—turn isolation into independence—signals early and tightens through each archived memory; the garden's growing luminescence externalizes the rising cost. One meaningful deepening occurs when her own quarantined past begins to resonate, narrowing options: continue and risk self-dissolution, or stop and remain alone. No visible price is dramatized on her body or psyche, so the cost feels conceptual rather than visceral, capping the band just below excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—whether to forgive the unfinished or remain chained to it—tightens once when the thorn draws blood and the key’s pattern is forged into a personal decree. The escalation is causal: each prior forgery was a rehearsal for this final unlink. The cost is the lover’s abandonment made permanent and the blood she pays to sever it. No coincidence resolves the conflict; agency is hers alone.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—free her sister’s echo—signaled early and tightens when she learns her own songs feed the webs. a single deepening beat (shell’s final layer demanding her echo) narrows options, but the price is announced, not dramatized; escalation stays textual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes—“salvage purity from wreckage”—are signaled early and deepen as cameos reveal tenderness suppressed by imperial duty. No narrowing fork or visible price is extracted from Elara herself; the emotional cost is displaced onto the ghosts who are released. One meaningful tightening occurs when the midshipman’s wonder reframes the expedition’s doom, but pressure stays observational rather than personally endangering.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stake—“to appreciate hidden effort”—is announced early, yet never narrows to a concrete trade-off; no resource (time, stamina, social credit) is risked or forfeited. Fireflies convene without complicating his path; moon paths merely guide, never threaten. No middle tightening forecloses an option; the ascent at dawn is identical in circumstance to his arrival. Pressure stays atmospheric, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.5)
    Single dominant stake—prove or disprove the curse—tightens when the shredded memos flip the threat from supernatural to corporate sabotage. One meaningful escalation suffices, but the price (she seals the site, prolonging survivor hunger) is stated more than dramatized; a sensory hint of starving camps would sharpen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—will Elias’s prophecy remake allegiances—tightens when the radio’s poetry begins steering real-world loyalties. One decisive intensification: the lightning-shattered pane floods the room with electric blue, forcing Elias to step into the storm and accept irreversible influence. Cost is visible: isolation confirmed, glass in fragments.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stake—prove his words can bridge generations—surfaces early and tightens when the seized box offers a literal stage. Escalation is present yet gentle: each uncorking adds density, but because the mechanism never resists or misfires, risk stays off-page; agency is additive, not contested. Enough for a lyric mini-arc, but not the squeeze that forecloses a live option 8+ entries require.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—protect relic from encroaching ice—is signaled on page 1 and tightened when the sonic mismatch is measured. Agency sits in Elias’s deliberate frequency modulation; the ice’s retreat is earned, not lucky. A visible price is implied—perpetual ritual vigilance—but not yet dramatized as exhaustion, tool drain, or bodily toll, keeping the cost legible but lightweight. Still, the harmonic convergence moment narrows options effectively under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: replace haste with patience to outwit tyranny. Escalation tightens when the full moon aligns with the viaduct’s activation; the crossing forecloses retreat. Cost is legible: the group risks exposure, Elara risks isolation. No coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.2)
    Hale’s death escalates from accident cover-up to sabotage whistle-blower silencing. Momentum tightens when Elias locks onto the bribed contractor, stakes crystallizing into personal mission.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—Elias’s need to convert regret into restorative act—is signaled in paragraph three and tightened once: the heartbeat resumes, making the trip to the daughter unavoidable. Pressure is coherent but external: the repair succeeds without Elias risking failure or resource; he watches rather than acts. Cost is conceptual (duty accepted) rather than visceral; price is legible but not dramatized as forfeiture. Sufficient for short-form; reaches high band but not 8.8 without an on-page trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes center on birthing mechanical desire; pressure tightens through each transliteration beat, culminating in the cart’s awakening, though the price feels abstract rather than bodily.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—recovery of the crew’s erased backup—tightens through each beat; the lie to the system narrows options and articulates the cost, though escalation plateaus near the end.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“feud erupts unless empathy intervenes”—tightens when visions force her to speak; the split catch becomes the test. No external reversals, but internal escalation: shard warms, options shrink to speak now or blood follows. Price paid: she shoulders the emotional labor and keeps the shard’s fracture, foreclosing neutrality.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“learn the sound of approaching endings”—tightens when Kai’s recording offers the literal hum; storm then forces live audition. One meaningful deepening suffices: from observer to actor, she forfeits passive hearing for active rescue, price legible in the closing turn. Accumulative lens accepts pattern-intensification rather than causal chain, met.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: whether confronting past attachment will loosen Elena’s isolation. Pressure tightens once Liam appears; sharing the fragment is a felt risk, but no vineyard consequence (frost, thief, boss) is activated, so cost stays emotional, not practical. No antagonist or external jeopardy escalates beyond conversation; stakes remain intimate and sufficient for length. Closure crystallizes stance without foreclosing future options, satisfying the novella-scale ambition of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—preserve the echo—is signaled in paragraph two and deepens through each summoned clearing. Pressure is ambient, not adversarial: time and entropy are the antagonists. Escalation is textural—density of hush, parapet thrumming louder—culminating in the final cadence shift. No visible personal cost (fatigue, wound, social risk) blunts the high-band entry; the price is purely existential, which fits the lens yet keeps score sub-8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—turning private pain into communal narrative—escalates through each laid-out photograph; the tightening is the shift from solitary archive to public mosaic. Cost is felt in the weight of each “heavier with purpose” photo, though the opposition remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—decode growth of language—escalates via sonic experiment; each echo tightens the spiral from certainty to acceptance of fractal evolution. One decisive deepening: the crystal replays obsolete triumph as living mutation, forcing Elias’s stance crystallization. No external antagonist; pressure is epistemic and temporal. Cost is the irreversible loss of fixed reference.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“capture the sound of growing older”—is signaled in paragraph four and every beat either muffles or nears that frequency. Mid-story tightening occurs when the hum slips away, forcing Elias to sacrifice chalk certainty for driftwood geometry, a tactical loss that raises effort cost. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes in the final circle; legible but not pulse-pounding. Still, the closing freeze leaves the option space shrunk: he can replay time but never re-enter it.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes tighten around the ever-shrinking launch window, but pressure remains external (quakes, clock); Elias’s agency feels mostly technical, with no unexpected ethical or relational dividend.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.5)
    Single dominant stake: execute a flawless reconnection. Pressure tightens after the blood-work refutation, narrowing Elena’s trajectory. The closing embrace crystallizes stakes, and the broken vinyl—once source of rupture—now seals the goodbye at visible relational cost.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (solve noon-shadow exile) is signalled early; pressure tightens when fragmented visions demand she “relearn” or lose the answer. Cost is visible—trance exhaustion, key’s fading warmth—but escalation feels once-off rather than iterative; still, agency drives the final loop-closure, satisfying lens.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes escalate through pressure on the cleft in certainty: the tooth’s warmth forces a reconfiguration of Elara’s stance. Agency is hers at the fountain; no deus ex machina; cost is the irretrievable surrender of the tooth/decoy illusion.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“share light without fire”—is signaled early and tested when she decides to polish and publicly display the glass. One meaningful tightening: the vow denies her the easiest illumination (torch, bonfire), forcing the reflective tactic; the cost is social exposure. Pressure accumulates rather than reverses; enough for 600-word scope. Villagers’ awe feels slightly convenient, but their reaction merely confirms, not resolves, so coincidence does not undercut.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming agency after public shaming—is signaled early; pressure tightens via the pendant offer, a micro-choice that forecloses hiding. Cost is present but soft; escalation is more tonal than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—finish vs. destroy manuscript—tightens via each cameo: every harvested hope makes deletion more unthinkable. One meaningful deepening: child-kite cameo narrows frame to “last breath before pages seal,” rendering erasure impossible without visible sacrilege. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: binding others’ dreams into his book fixes his own future to its survival. Agency remains accumulative rather than causal, fitting lens.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—restore harvest rites or watch land wither—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when the celestial window shortens; the beat of elders joining song narrows failure risk and visible price (fields momentarily green). Cost is legible, though escalation is single-arc rather than layered reversal, keeping it just outside the 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will she recover a navigable path through grief?—is signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is textural: each scavenged object adds cartographic pressure until rusted nails become meridians. Cost is felt (numb fingers, spent starlight vials), but because the orchard supplies no counter-force beyond cold, the pressure plateau flattens a hair before the seal. Sufficient for 8-band, not the sharper spike 8.8+ demands.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“store wonder before the world’s wounds close the window”—is signaled early and tightens through each angle calibration; the midday soft-echo discovery narrows options to subtle murmurs, foreclosing loud capture. No external antagonist needed: pressure is situational, built from corroded gears and season’s haze. Visible price is legible on-page: weeks lost, solitude deepened, war-loss locked away. Could use one mid-process complication that costs materials or bodily stamina to reach 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—balancing her infinite loop by gathering weights—tightens via each calcified burden narrowing options. One deepening beat (stone weights reconfigure pattern) is sufficient. Cost (bearing all griefs) felt, though escalation stays moderate, not high-drama.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—contain grief before it scatters—is signaled in para 3 and tightens when the kettle’s overflow snaps her back, forcing the shift from memory-harvest to physical carving. Accumulative pressure grows with each crystal shard; the final narrowing (start carving NOW) is irreversible and legible. Cost is felt in the blank’s transformation and the emotional forfeiture of endless reminiscence.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—salvage meaning from halted motion—tightens when the ghost demands restitution. One decisive deepening: fragment barter narrows options from retrieval to re-creation. Agency remains Elara’s; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. Cost is the irretrievable wheel and the acceptance of erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    A single dominant stake—breathe life back into the dead terminal—escalates via incremental airflow redirections. Pressure tightens, but the price is largely infrastructural; a more visceral personal trade-off would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.9)
    The glacial hush tightens choices—soundless sanctuary forcing silent reckoning—but the pressure plateau remains singular; a second, deeper angle would push it past strong into essential territory.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—understanding the architecture of lies—is signaled early and escalates through salvage pressure. One decisive tightening: the chest’s journals reframe prior quests as self-deception. Cost is conceptual but legible: Elias forfeits the thrill of pursuit for sober clarity. Agency remains with Elias throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preservation of arcane knowledge—tightens when the rope’s knots resist, then relent, forcing Elias to wager his solitude for custodianship. One decisive deepening: the rope’s warmth signals consent, narrowing options to “bind or lose.” Cost is visible in the tear-streaked surrender of anonymity. No coincidence; pressure is situational and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s quest to map healing through absence—is signaled early and tightened when he chooses the garden over escape. The pressure is textural rather than causal: each sensory layer intensifies the cost of staying. A single, legible forfeiture: the ship’s departure forecloses exit.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restore organic beauty inside a mechanical world—tightens when the egg’s fragility collides with the palace’s quake. Escalation is driven by Elarion’s agency: each shard he places raises the stakes of potential loss. The final tremor forces a decisive stance—protect the yolk or lose the last remnant of life. Cost is visceral: he must endure perpetual danger to keep the egg viable.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—will the scarred tree accept new life—signaled early; wanderer’s appearance intensifies thematic stakes without external coincidence resolving graft. Escalation is textural: each layered symbol (sand, coin, whispered vow) raises emotional cost until the coin’s glint hums. Protagonist agency steady; no reversal, but deepening sufficient for 750-word window. Cost legible in surrendering her father’s last relic to the bark.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—liberating trapped memories—drives every beat. Migration pause tightens clock; geese leave, forcing Elara to act. Stakes escalate as fountains creak back to life; final release carries felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“share light without fire”—is signaled early and reframed when she realizes sharing may only perpetuate loops; this deepening tightens the stake rather than widens it. Middle beat of entering rift is agency-driven with visible risk (gear spins, pings reconfigure). Final acceptance costs her the illusion of change; price is felt in the closing gaze (“cycles unbroken”). Pressure stays accumulative/textural, escalating through denser petals and chorus returns.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—how to shape collective grief—escalates through nightly retracings; each dusk visit forecloses the option of private mourning. The final inscription is a visible price: Elias sacrifices the neat closure of a single name for the harder, shared curve of the ribbon’s braid.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—public timekeeper’s moral credibility—tightens when the ghost offers the very proof that could destroy it. The rake’s reappearance converts private guilt into impending communal rupture, forcing a public choice. Pressure escalates once, decisively; no reversals needed. Cost is legible: disclosure now looms, foreclosing the thirty-year penance of silent winding.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—unravelling the tapestry’s intention—is clear early and tightens once when symbols mirror the chess game. No major escalation beyond that single beat, keeping it shy of very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—seed innovation under ban—tightens through scarcity of data and council peril; pressure escalates as each model iteration shrinks her margin, but the ultimate risk is asserted rather than tested in live scene, so the felt price is present but not viscerally foregrounded.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—reviving stories under censorship—is signaled early and escalates once: the pirate instruction forces Elias to risk copying forbidden narrative into the scores. Agency is active (he sprinkles dust, hums the song), and the option space narrows—he crosses from legal to illegal acts with visible risk. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, but legible. Sufficient for high band, though the pressure beat is compressed into a single paragraph and could carry more tactical friction.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve the last trace of maternal tenderness—tightens when the chair’s motor winds down, forcing the final act. Escalation is one deepening: the mirage of safety fractures as the chair stops. Agency is renunciation; the cost is the irreversible dispersal of the charcoal ash. No coincidence, no external antagonist; pressure is situational and internal.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preserve ancient methods vs. surrender them to the new order—tightens as each unearthed artifact sharpens the dilemma. The pressure peaks when the journal surfaces, but the escalation leans on summary rather than an on-page beat that forces a new tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—can hatred be unlearned through harmony—escalates as each subtraction peels away discord, narrowing to the final braid. The cost is audible: silence after the chord, a felt forfeiture of isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—beauty from ruins versus corporate erasure—tightens once via the pruning decision that sacrifices old vines for new growth. Escalation is accumulative: each cut, plant, and shared broth narrows the option of solitary secrecy. Cost is the exposure of his grandmother’s hidden seed to collective risk.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—can Elias safeguard wonder while forced to tell truth—tightens only once, at the matchbox beat; pressure plateaus after the bee disclosure. Lira’s ascent absorbs the revelation without pushing back, so external opposition never escalates. Cost is conceptual (mystery diminished) rather than felt on-page; no tactic is foreclosed for Elias after he speaks.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—Elara’s need to prove or disprove her own soul—tightens when Lirien’s visions foreclose her black-and-white stance; the threading choice visibly narrows options and carries the cost of abandoning certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—recapturing the texture of the missed chance—is signaled in the first paragraph and escalates with each roll and equation. The rupture is a single, irreversible tightening that forecloses endless ascent for one moment of contact. Cost is palpable: the staircase may collapse, yet he chooses the gamble. Agency is absolute; coincidence absent.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—prove strangers remember kindness—threads all visions; pressure is textural (accumulating vignettes) rather than a narrowing vice. No external obstacle complicates the painting act; tension is solely elegiac. One deepening: he realizes the paintings are invocations. Visible cost is the surrender of sleepless vigilance, but it’s lightly dramatized, keeping escalation temperate.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    Central stake—preserve the initials-bread custom—faces a single tightening vector: accelerating thaw. Escalation tracks cleanly: beekeeper leaves → flowers wilt → ice cracks → Elara’s lens gamble backfires → salvage. Cost is visceral (rusted flecks in meltwater, corroded tools), but the pressure jump is moderate; one more on-page obstacle mid-climb would sharpen the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—break famine’s cycle—tightens when reversed symbols foreclose retreat. One meaningful escalation: spinning the orb backward ignites the stone, visible price in searing light. Agency remains Elias’s throughout; no coincidence rescues him. Cost is legible yet could bite deeper into future options.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—trick fear into exposing weakness—tightens when paradoxical notes force a public confession; the rebound of the curse is the felt price. One meaningful escalation beat satisfies scope, though fear’s agency is metaphorical rather than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: preserve the fragile orchard against scattering storm. One meaningful tightening—storm’s vanguard becomes full gale—forces Leeward to dub each obstacle into instrument. Cost is visible: spent effort, resonant wood, and the orchard’s survival now tied to perpetual musical vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—find Thorne—tightens when the watchers’ glyphs reveal his fate. One decisive escalation: whistle question → foam answer → irrevocable knowledge. Cost is felt in Elara’s grief-laced resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—rescuing truth from noble lies—escalates through one decisive tightening: the moment Elias chooses to overwrite communal consolation with verifiable record. The cost is felt in the elegiac final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—becoming archaeologist of lost dreams—tightens when the inkwell forces Elias to shift from repair to recording; embedding the notes is the irreversible beat that forecloses pure surveyor distance. Pressure is situational: rising sea, isolation, contractual duty, but the inkwell converts external obligation into internal moral necessity. Cost is visible: frozen knees, ink staining fingers, and the knowledge that absence is now literally entombed in new stone. One decisive turn suffices; no reversal is needed, but escalation could feel steeper if the sea physically threatened the act of sealing the notes.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—uncover untainted origins—tightens when contradictory charters force the alternative-hypothesis pivot; options narrow to “propagate lie” or “rewrite history” with her own seal now authenticating the latter. Blackout deletes external rescue, intensifying intellectual risk. Cost is visible: the inked spiral is an irreversible scholarly signature that could brand her a revisionist heretic. One meaningful escalation beat suffices at 740 words.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—“can grief be transmuted into flight without erasing the lost?”—tightens once: shadow detachment raises the cost of failure, each crane subtracts raw sorrow yet leaves the absence bare. Agency is continuous; every polishing stroke and fold is a reversible tactical choice that gradually forecloses the option of keeping Lira’s dreams uncaged. Price is visible: shadow gone, island spiraling, lanterns burning tea leaves—felt cost scales to length. No coincidence resolves; spiral is ancient rule, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—turn pooled human potential against its harvesters—tightens when Elias discovers the satellite bloated with stolen dreams. One clear escalation: from passive observation to active assault, foreclosing retreat. Agency drives every turn; coincidence complicates but never rescues. Cost is the irreversible step into vacuum.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—decode belonging frequency—signaled early. One meaningful tightening: chip anomalies reveal gaps, forcing final lever pull that forecloses anonymity. Cost legible: she is now “bound” to cosmic frequency. No secondary pressure or tangible loss, keeping escalation solid but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—truth versus protective lie—tightens once when the watch-hand makes the cost of silence visceral. Pressure is accumulative: each carved fragment mirrors his own erasures, intensifying self-revulsion. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict escalates through pattern break (finding the time-piece). Closure forecloses the option of continued silence with visible cost: he pockets the hand and turns toward confession.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—swap must repair Elias’s earlier failure—escalates as the moon phase tightens the moment of balance; handing the pull forecloses vengeance as live option. Cost is implicit (brother may still choose revenge) rather than viscerally enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—reconciliation vs. self-forgiveness—tightens when celestial guidance fails, forcing Elias to risk shoreward navigation without instruments. The pod of dolphins and the bonfire silhouette escalate hope and dread in equal measure; the final narrowing of options to one beach and one embrace is cleanly paid.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—empathy vs. escape—tightens once via the literal forked path. Cost is visible (emotional reckoning, physical descent), but pressure plateaus after the midpoint; no second escalation beat.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes—reforge the bond or remain alone—are signaled early and tightened by the metamorphosis, but the price (loss of human form) is asserted more than dramatized; pressure escalates via lyrical density rather than causal narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“find where lost time accumulates”—tightens when the cards reveal frozen hourglasses; knowledge gained narrows her mythic quest to a single maternal act. Pressure is accumulative/textural: each traced line increases density until the saucer’s glow reweights meaning. No external antagonist needed; regret itself supplies coherent force. Cost is conceptual but undeniable; meets 8.8+ bar.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—grasping the “texture of transformation”—tightens when the detour forces Elias to trade his last agency (the jars) for communal gain. One decisive deepening: release of the bugs triggers cascading consequences that narrow his future to mythic homelessness. Cost is visible and legible on the final beach.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—spark silent revolution—threads every beat; blackout heightens trespass risk, tightening because/therefore linkage. The sundial decode is the single escalation pivot that forecloses retreat: once runes project cipher, discovery becomes inevitable exposure. Cost is visible—sealing the quill holder back into place signals Elara’s irreversible betrayal of guardian oath. Secondary characters add warm bodies but no opposing pressure, capping score short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—transform curse into directed vision—tightens once via the mandala activation; eel-energy surge crystallizes choice and forecloses retreat, with felt electric cost.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will risk exposure to send the poem—escalates through the timer’s countdown and the storm’s rising violence; the final descent narrows his options to a single irrevocable act, with the envelope as tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes tighten from potential bloodshed to philosophical alliance; each adjustment of the needle sundial narrows violent options and escalates intellectual cost; the hidden overture transforms rivalry into conspiracy that must be paid with trust.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—“reclaim stories vs. monotony”—is signaled early and escalates via smuggling risk, inscription act, and clandestine readings. No decisive reversal occurs; pressure accretes until the guard pass-by crystallizes the stakes without forcing collapse. Cost is conceptual (possible shakedown) rather than felt on-page, capping the score below 8. Agency sits with duo throughout; coincidence (guard timing) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: break the spell of frozen time and lost love. Escalation is driven by Elias’s agency—each discovery (reel, compass, projector) tightens the choice to play or remain paralyzed. The final chord forecloses retreat; cost is the surrender of nostalgic stasis. Coincidence (finding reel) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single dominant stake—cultural memory loss—is signaled early and tightens through weather countdown. The dream deepening changes knowledge (ritual symbols revealed), narrowing options to one communal rite; price is legible in the shared vulnerability of dancing under gathering clouds. Agency is collective rather than singular, but still forecloses the path of passive forgetting.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—finding the color of unspoken apologies—is signaled early and tightens when the lace directive demands salt-tears and dawn light, a single deepening that narrows options. Protagonist agency drives every beat: he chooses to read, mix, and stain; the cerulean payoff prices him with public admission. Under Accumulative lens, density increase suffices for escalation; no reversals required. Cost is legible yet modest—one sprig and one whisper—so entry to 8.8+ is blocked.


== Grader: Qwen 3 235B A22B 25-07 Think ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes deepen through protagonist agency—her deliberate dust collection tightens options by replacing explosive simulations with gradual decay models. Cost is unmistakable in the "sodden notebook" and tears, though escalation lacks one visceral pressure point beyond internal reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single stake (expose smugglers) deepens via frost-retracing; pressure tightens as ledger aligns with routes. Cost is conceptual (art weaponized) but legible in "spark for luminous creations." Agency-driven under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation driven by Elias' agency (striking the fork despite trauma) narrows options to translate silence; cost is visceral (sweat, internal echoes), but the tech's problem-solving feels slightly frictionless for high-band stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes tighten through Elias’s deepening engagement with lens shards, culminating in blood ritual’s irreversible cost. Single escalation point suffices but lacks a second pressure wave for 9.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sanctions tighten options meaningfully: anonymous runs → formalized pacts with heightened risk. Elara’s agency drives escalation (gathering community, declaring pacts), but "risks mounted—drones swept closer" lacks on-page demonstration of narrowed tactics, softening the cost’s immediacy before closure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully through breath-synchronization deepening, but "unused love" abstraction dilutes visceral cost; pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens yet lacks concrete tactical tradeoffs.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes (tracing time's texture) tighten through retrocognitive visions that narrow options to disintegration. Agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens: hyperbolic folding choice forecloses the trap with visible cost (transformation). Cost ("forever changed") legible but slightly abstract; minor deduction prevents 9.0 despite perfect escalation coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single dominant stake (preserving resilience against opportunists) tightens meaningfully when enforcers' attempt to impede backfires via Elias's arrow distraction. Cost is visible in chain-breaking on rubble, though "impede" action slightly externalizes pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes deepen through sensory accumulation (auroras intensifying → violet as "fragile trill") under Accumulative lens. Dominant stake ("find sound of trust breaking") forecloses her path via the device's creation. Lacks visible price beyond emotional cost; "cells dividing" feels untracked.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes tighten as golden hour wanes, deepening into identity cost when moonbeams reinterpret portrait; agency fully Elara's with visible price paid in final vanishing act.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen organically: crafting safe zones initially seems abstract until melting ice physically threatens the outpost, forcing Elias to choose mobility over stability. His agency drives escalation—spotting the bookmark triggers the realization that enables departure. Cost is unmistakable: abandoning the forge (tactic-altering loss) to preserve the vision.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten when Marcus appears—truth vs. silencing—driven by Elara's agency in decryption and outwitting; cost is her identity's destruction/reconstruction, though embezzlement exposure feels slightly over-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (mapping endless night) signaled early, but conflict lacks escalation: storm pauses conveniently, no antagonistic pressure tests her obsession. Cost remains conceptual (darkness) without visible tradeoff—fragile booklet threatens but never impedes her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.2)
    Single dominant stake (Elias's mistrust vs transparency) escalates through agency-driven beats: lens discovery fuels eavesdropping, which catalyzes his doodle—a meaningful tightening where the cost ("weight of guarded heart thawing") visibly alters his logging practice at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully when the Luckometer spikes to 92.7, forcing Elias deeper into the maze where he discovers the mended marble—a reversal earned by his ritual persistence. The cost ("withering doubt") visibly alters his stance, though the vine's return edges toward coincidence; Elias's agency in polishing it salvages causality under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (proving sideways time) tightens via the lever action, but escalation lacks visible cost—Jax's risk of destabilization is acknowledged but not paid. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens, yet the price remains conceptual rather than altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (unraveling Isabella's secret) is signaled early and tightens via the program's disintegration, but escalation relies on atmospheric accumulation rather than Elias's agency. The disruption action reweights options, yet the cost remains conceptual (lost code) without altering tactics—Elias simply "rose" without consequence. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, but lacks the visible price escalation required for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.5)
    Stakes tighten through Elara's agency: her micro-choice to blur the illustration's edges reconfigures the "swallowed truth" from paralyzing weight to adaptive guidance. Cost is legible in the shift from "prison" to "threshold," where emotional burden lightens but the mountain's threat ("cataclysms that would bury them") remains.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (confronting guilt) tightens through ghost's confession, forcing Elias's realization. Radio calls feel slightly convenient as escalation device, but agency in appraising parallels earns cost. One meaningful deepening suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes ("crumbling peace") lack tangible escalation; library decay is observed but never actively resisted, weakening pressure until the swan’s discovery—too late to narrow options meaningfully within the short form’s scope.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes deepen organically: Theo's guardedness tightens through harmonica faltering, then flows with shared breath. Cost is visible in his tears—not sorrow alone but dawning wonder—reconfiguring "ordinary magic" from abstract to embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake (uncover axis displacement) signaled early but lacks escalation; discoveries deepen knowledge without narrowing options or raising cost. Pressure accumulates texturally yet misses protagonist-driven tightening—no meaningful trade-offs or tactical shifts during the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes escalate cleanly as Elias' playful enigma becomes terrifyingly real through Maris' echoed words. Pressure tightens via Accumulative/Textural lens (density of "open secrets" compounding), but the tide/bell coincidence risks diminishing agency—luck complicates effectively yet borders on convenient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten via Elias's rhetorical devices narrowing options ("completion mere heartbeats away"), but the possession's defeat lacks visceral cost—dissipating into "echoes" feels conceptually neat without physical or relational consequence scaling to cosmic threat.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten via Elias's agency—memory mapping deepens pressure as dawn approaches. Cost legible in "exhaustion's tide rising before first light," altering tactics by forcing final etching. Single meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: confronting shadow-self ("unleashed her power") narrows options to fusion or dissolution. Cost crystallizes in "walls regenerating into tighter coils"—visible tradeoff that alters final tactics under Hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single stake (defeating numbness) tightens through agency-driven escalation—beeswax repair and backward play narrow options to feeling or void—with cost legible in the tears' silent rivers foreclosing emotional barrenness.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Elias' agency: his choice to inhale despite being "aromatically cautious" triggers the memory flood. Cost is visceral (tears as mending fractures) and alters his approach to grief. Escalation driven by sensory accumulation under UV light, though the reborn flower's timing edges toward external catalyst rather than pure protagonist pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.5)
    No meaningful escalation under Accumulative lens—chronic hush presents passive resistance without narrowing options. Cost is felt but not earned through struggle; motivation faces no active opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes deepen via scent-triggered memories, but pressure lacks tangible escalation; the "surge" feels internal without altering tactics beyond the premeditated transformation test.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single tightening (proposal) forecloses Elias' solitary observation habit, but stakes lack felt cost—no concrete sacrifice like diverted cargo resources dramatized during escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten via cadence escalation ("hummed louder... vibrating through stones"), but borrowing time lacks visible tactical cost during execution. "Borrowed time tugged" is felt but doesn't alter her immediate actions per band guardrails.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (quantifying grief) tightens through moonlight progression and glass eyes’ refraction, but escalation lacks tangible cost escalation beyond emotional shift; the "undefined variable" insight deepens stakes yet feels psychologically earned without physical trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten via Elias’s agency—memory crystallizes his resolve to cache hope—but the cost of visibility remains felt rather than viscerally dramatized; his emergence lacks tangible consequence beyond emotional risk.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stake (understanding through surrender) tightens via her physical metamorphosis, but the cost of losing human form could resonate more viscerally in the climax. Agency remains compelling under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single dominant stake (finding meaning in desolation) tightens through Elias's agency: futile tossing → trail pursuit → brooch exchange. Cost legible in insomnia breaking ("finally slept") and renewed purpose. No over-escalation needed for length.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (amplify magic vs. self-preservation) signaled early but escalation lacks protagonist agency. Possession driven by external forces, not Elara's decisions; no visible price altering tactics. Band guardrail for 8.8+ unmet as final image lacks tangible cost demonstration.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten when Elara navigates the valve's absence to reveal exile's forging, but harbor folk’s wariness resolves too cleanly—no visible resistance during climax undermines felt cost of rekindling trust.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes signaled early but pressure doesn't escalate meaningfully—the cracks guide Elara without resistance, and boarding faces zero opposition. "Dare" (Q9E) lacks tactical consequence, missing the 8.8+ requirement for visible price charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten through transcription deepening into visions, narrowing Elara’s options from skepticism to embodied reflection; cost is legible in her shifted worldview, though whale migration’s timeframe lacks tactical pressure beyond symbolic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (boredom vs. discovery) tightens via magnetic fields narrowing options to embrace mutiny; agency clear in "wove intrigue into chaos"; cost legible in "void within her cracked" foreclosing eternal passivity.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten through Elena’s agency: her "active waiting" crystallizes into the paperclip breach, narrowing options to a single decisive choice; the cost of dissolving rigid thinking is viscerally felt in her tears and the ink’s transformative effect on her worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes deepen through sensory accumulation ("textures of different times"), yet escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening; the lamp’s hum intensifies knowledge but doesn’t narrow options under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes tighten through graffiti's evolution from coordinates to defensive nets, but privatization patrols never adapt tactics to counter Lira's moves, making escalation feel predetermined rather than earned through protagonist-antagonist friction.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (preserving the hush) tightens through pre-dawn light and grain catalysis, but "unstable ejecta" warning adds extraneous pressure unconnected to core conflict. Endurance agency is clear with visible cost (fatigue, cold), yet escalation lacks one cohesive deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes (decode drone before ship departs) tighten via anchor's chain-song and clarifying vibrations under Accumulative pressure. Cost ("heartfelt ache") feels slightly abstract versus physical toll; escalation lacks one visceral tradeoff to hit 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully as condensation patterns reconfigure Elias' understanding, but the "tempests beneath ice" doubt feels under-dramatized; cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt despite strong escalation toward the escarpment journey.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes tighten via accumulating footsteps altering vibration density, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—Elowen merely guides, never confronts resistance to pressure buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    Pressure escalates through Accumulative density—scuffs merging with memories narrows options by transforming denial into acceptance. Dominant stake (escaping legacy) tightens via Elias's agency (threading story through lattice), with cost legible in "weight of inheritance lighter" as conceptual reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes ("ruin to reverence") remain abstractly declared without meaningful escalation—sleepwalking sewing encounters no resistance or tactical cost. Dominant stake signals early but pressure never tightens; villagers' arrival resolves without prior friction.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (restoring faith through ancestral connection) tightens via interruptions (tremor, fox) that compound labor cost. Agency in rebuilding earns closure, but early stakes feel internalized rather than viscerally tested until sundial discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes tighten through moonlight-healing shard enabling the condensation messages, but the pivotal moment before deciding lacks concrete escalation—pressure accumulates texturally without narrowing options until the final vision.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake ("shared anxieties") remains thematic rather than dramatized—Jamal’s sleep removes active pressure. No visible cost emerges beyond Elara’s pre-existing grief; decryption lacks meaningful tightening as anxiety-sharing resolves without trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through Elias' agency (projecting light to revive fresco), but cost remains conceptual—fragility of dream-joy against waking life—without concrete pressure like physical exhaustion or time loss narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes (rigid certainty vs. boundless curiosity) tighten through the nested echoes, narrowing Elias's options. Escalation is driven by Elara's agency (the coin tap), but the cost—Elias's dissolved certainty—is felt rather than visibly paid on the page during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation tightens under Accumulative lens as drone hum intensifies and sirens approach, narrowing Elias's options. But agency in the warp feels ritualistic rather than driven by active choice; cost (ongoing threat) is legible but lacks visceral weight in the pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes tighten through Elowen’s agency (finding tube → singing → lighting bead), but the bamboo chime’s "protesting abandonment" feels coincidental rather than earned escalation. Regret’s deepening cost is felt but lacks concrete tactical alteration in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes (trust restoration) tighten through Elara's agency: each glyph etched narrows options toward the final chord.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stake tightening occurs through adhesive discovery, narrowing options as historical plea for mercy forces floodgate redesign. Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens; cost legible in identity shift. Minor deduction for "slyly heartfelt" feeling slightly forced rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes deepen through sensory accumulation as "sacred thresholds" tighten, but agency stays passive—Elara intuits rather than decides; cost ("lost child rediscovering paths") earned through accumulated meaning yet lacks visible tactical trade-off during prism arrangement.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten through Elara's agency: scanner adaptation, feather placement against coral, and sharing motivation with Lir narrow options toward earned stasis. Cost is legible in the "seamless shadowseam truth" resolution, though fireflies moment slightly softens pressure escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten via protagonist's agency: conjecture evolves from passive wondering to active seed-planting. Cost crystallizes in "choices abandoned mid-flight" withering vines, narrowing options to embrace transience under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes (defeating monotony) tighten via wheel spins but remain abstract; cost ("randomness ordered into memory") is felt not visceral. Agency clear in Elias’s signals, yet lack of concrete consequence (e.g., failed attempt) limits escalation depth.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes (defying ban through art) signaled early, but conflict lacks meaningful escalation: "observing gaps" method works flawlessly without resistance. Pressure accumulates texturally yet never narrows options or forces adaptation, missing the band guardrail for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes crystallize through ripple interpretation: "hidden currents of regret" in his craft versus "harmony" in mundane magic.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes ("hope as calculus") deepen through trial balloons that burst and return with data, narrowing options via micro-choices, but the cost remains abstract—no visceral loss like a sacrificed resource or time—keeping escalation just below the 8.8-band requirement for unmistakable price.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten via lullaby escalation (ripples→shimmer→visions), narrowing options to "endless dusky harmonies."

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes tighten through ritual mechanics: celestial timing forces blood signatures, narrowing options to pride’s surrender. Cost is unmistakable in Mira’s trembling hand and Thorne’s "reluctant stroke," but secondary conflict (Elara’s role loss) isn’t tested until closure.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes remain abstract (preserving "echo" vs. protecting empire); the manufactured drought's consequences aren't tested on-page, and the rain's arrival negates any tangible cost for his release.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes signaled early ("peril of discovery"), escalation through thread-untangling deepens density. Cost felt in closing shadows but not visibly charged in final image per 8.8+ band guardrail.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes (preserving vanishing history) remain abstractly felt rather than viscerally tested; escalation hinges on coincidental gust rather than protagonist-driven tightening. No visible price alters Elara's tactics—the unraveled lattice is repaired narratively, negating cost before closure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation driven by Elara’s agency under Accumulative lens with visceral cost (Thorne’s emotional unraveling), but tightening lacks visible trade-off beyond internal state; dominant stake (resentment vs. peace) intensifies coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes escalate through Elias's agency: synchronized breathing deepens the vision ("deeper breaths now... air hummed with glassy resonance"), narrowing options from arrangement to embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (mending wisdom before death) tightens through Elias's aching body and rain-driven urgency. Agency as endurance forecloses path with felt cost. Slight underweighting of physical cost against conceptual stakes prevents higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (proving meaning in chaos) signaled immediately. Pressure tightens causally: storm threats → scavenging → alignment challenge.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen through protagonist's shadow measurements narrowing options (fraying memory = identity loss), with visible cost in preemptive grief; escalation lacks one tangible price paid mid-scene to reach higher bands despite strong conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (restoring lost essence) tightens via sunrise deadline, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure—Elara faces no meaningful opposition beyond time.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation via density increase: quantum messages intensify pressure until spore-compression climax.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake (holding line against indifference) tightens via network collapse and enforcer approach, but escalation relies on coincidence (Kael's return) rather than protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stake (resolve dispute to heal revolution scars) signaled early; pressure builds via storm intensity and vision density. Cost vague—hope replaces sorrow without dramatized loss (e.g., no lingering doubt in skeptics). Band guardrail for 8.8+ unmet.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation driven by Elias's agency: doubt threatens the tether (narrowing options), then truth redeems it, with cost legible in "visions flooded his mind" showing personal stakes, though rust's societal impact remains slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.4)

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.1)
    Protagonist agency drives escalation (spire to lagoon journey) with visible cost in deepening sorrow, but "auroral sorrow" abstraction slightly obscures the felt price; dominant stake tightening via universe's hush satisfies band guardrails.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten through Elias's agency (tracing walks, unfolding maps), but Marco's panic feels externally imposed; the cost (humiliation, crew's shifted perception) is felt yet under-dramatized in the climax beat.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (grief vs hope) signaled early with one meaningful deepening through light patterns; protagonist's agency in emotional shift earns closure, but pressure lacks visible escalation beyond the ritual's progression.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes tighten through Elias's agency in organizing displays, with cost legible in Mira's "unspoken fears" and elders dismissing rebellion as "evening haze." Escalation lacks meaningful on-page reversal—window displays ignite without showing Elias's active choice during execution.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes tighten through whittling ritual's deepening—each stroke reconfigures grief into "lightness" with felt cost. Agency drives escalation under accumulative lens; "bruised purples" sunset charges final trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes (reclaiming art post-ban) signal early, with pressure tightening as boundaries dissolve. However, conflict lacks tangible opposition—escalation relies on aesthetic transcendence rather than embodied cost, weakening the conceptual price of dissolving sacred lines.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Elias’s escalating plant proposals (daisy to laurel), narrowing options toward the concertina collaboration. Conceptual cost of bartered awakenings is unmistakable in the exchange, though the "no loss" for Elias slightly softens the felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (grief-to-renewal) tightens through Elara’s agency: transforming vellum into talismans. Escalation via density increase (dusty relics → origami coordinates) reweights hope with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes lack visceral pressure; "weariness" and "doubts" remain abstract. Escalation via card-measuring feels intellectualized—no concrete loss (e.g., Theo’s job risk) tightens the dominant stake of cultural mapping.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (forbidden knowledge vs. untainted heart) tightens through Elara's dance, but cost stays emotional rather than altering tactics; no concrete loss (e.g., stamina, tools) narrows options. Escalation fits Accumulative lens yet lacks visceral trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (preserving hope's shape) tightens via video comparison, but cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt; "momentary victory" implies ongoing struggle without concrete forfeiture in the beat. Agency clear but stakes lack visceral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes tighten through Theo’s letters deepening Elara’s search, with agency in singing the melody driving resolution; but cost remains abstractly emotional—no visible price like forfeited opportunity—limiting escalation’s tangible impact under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (freeing creativity) tightens via tracing→surrender sequence; pressure grows through protagonist agency under Accumulative lens, but the cost of creative block remains slightly underweighted in the breakthrough moment.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully when Elias presses clock to crate—branching realities force choice between "dreamed of green" or "dunes swallowed trains"—but conceptual cost (unchanged dreamlessness) lacks visceral connection to the physical act of charm.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (reclaiming wild frontier) tightens via gear discovery and cavern revelation, but Elias's passive agency ("drawn by inner pull") undercuts trade-offs; conceptual cost lacks physical manifestation even as wind method reshapes knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single stake (cost of safety) deepens through atmospheric pressure rather than causal turns; bolt discovery narrows options by crystallizing silence's meaning, but nerve regeneration timeframe lacks live-clock urgency to tighten tactics as required for 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes remain abstractly cosmic ("fractured balance of the cosmos") without visceral on-page manifestation; Varak's threat lacks tangible escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (evolving tradition) tightens via decoding/unsealing, but cost remains conceptual; no visible trade-off during embryo release (e.g., physical toll or immediate backlash) weakens escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully when the photograph’s physicality forces her to confront "randomness, the fragility of joy," narrowing options to either clinging or transforming grief; cost is legible as she folds it "no longer a weight but a seed."

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully as Elara uses ink patterns to evade the sorcerer, with conceptual cost in redefining trauma. But escalation lacks trade-offs—the resolution feels convenient, missing a visible price that alters tactics beyond the immediate victory.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes deepen through agency: dormant networks shift from abstract concept to tactical tool, narrowing options to binary choice; "scandal would bloom" makes cost unmistakable though moral calculus lacks granular trade-offs in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (sanctuary vs chaos) tightens meaningfully when dome cracks; her agency in embedding the petal reconfigures options under Accumulative lens, cost crystallized in the stabilized crack's quiet victory.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten through Elara's agency as she dismantles Quill's theory; cost is legible in his unraveling, though the embezzlement reveal lacks prior causal groundwork for full escalation depth.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure tightens through accumulation: overlapping voices → mandala construction → synchronized breaths. Cost is unmistakable in "meaning... fragile, easily scattered," directly shaping Elara's final smile. Agency drives every escalation (prying tile, interjecting, guiding placements).

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes clear (empathy vs. ruin), but escalation lacks meaningful deepening—retro-cognition shift happens abruptly without narrowing options. Forgiveness moment feels unearned as no trade-off or tactical cost materializes on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes remain abstract ("luring possibility from despair's brink") without tangible cost demonstration; ghost's "hunger for one more bow" creates secondary pressure, but resolution lacks visible price paid for the hope gained despite strong Accumulative escalation through layered echoes.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully when Elara proposes mapping somatic markers, narrowing options from pill dependency to embodied connection. But escalation relies on Elara's agency alone; Theo's passive "intrigued despite himself" weakens protagonist-driven pressure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.1)

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes ("world chained to predestined paths") remain abstract; no visible price paid during escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes escalate through Elias's internal pressure as fog thins and gutters fall silent, narrowing options to redefining the vow. Conceptual cost (emotional burden lifted) is felt but lacks visceral immediacy in the closure beat, limiting escalation depth.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (resistance through kindness) is signaled early and deepens through visions, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the thrumming visions happen *to* Elias rather than arising from his choices, missing the band guardrail for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation driven purely by Elara's agency: Harlan's intrusion → her counter-frequency choice → tangible cost (his physical collapse, protesters faltering). Dominant stake (cosmic deception vs. human chaos) tightens through one meaningful pressure point with visible price on power dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stake ("never" of orphaned youth) tightens via scaffold flutter interpretation—a protagonist-driven deepening. Cost is visceral in the arch's "moss-veiled" confrontation with past failures. One tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.9)
    Conflict resolution lacks earned escalation: rivals withdraw via "eerie poetry" rather than protagonist agency. No visible price paid for territorial markers (e.g., legal consequences), undermining pressure under Accumulative lens. Stakes remain abstract despite strong initial setup.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (decoding isolation’s cost) escalates through Elara’s agency: witnessing stellar rhythms in the dream directly alters her tactics (weaving empathetic words to lighten burdens). The cost—conceptual shift from solitary to communal healing—is unmistakable in the final image’s stirring petals. No coincidence resolves conflict; pressure coheres via her active interpretation of variable stars’ "ebb and flow."

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes (soul mending via bartered destinies) tighten through Elara’s agency—pressing card against roots forces Thorne’s concession. Cost is legible in talisman’s disintegration, though "eternity’s weight" trade feels conceptually thin without tangible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (purpose after loss) tightens through auction failure into quarry resolve, but cost remains abstract—Jack’s "softening longing" lacks visceral forfeiture beyond emotional recalibration, diluting escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes tighten as the creel fills, but migrating identities feel abstractly threatened—pressure lacks visceral antagonism; the fog's erosion needs sharper on-page manifestation to deepen the librarian's cost during the smelt capture.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes remain abstract ("apocalyptic shadows"); no tangible cost manifests during the pearl-crowning—pressure escalates through lyrical accumulation but lacks visceral narrowing of options or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) tightens through three pressure points: timetable references trigger memory surge, graffiti crystallizes insight, accordion enables action; cost legible in "weight lift, not erased," though discovered items slightly dilute pure agency under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes (finding library) tighten via cipher solution but lack visceral cost; "burgeoning excitement" flattens tension, and wariness vanishes upon entry without trade-off scaling to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (reversing aging through surrender) tightens via ripple revelations, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—truths emerge passively in trance. The withheld warning deepens stakes but conceptual cost feels unanchored.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully through bird patterns, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the murmuration's "sudden veer" feels coincidental, not earned by Elara's action per Accumulative lens demands.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten through Elowen’s agency—unstrapping vines and mist-walking reconfigure her options under Accumulative pressure, with "frozen tears" rendering the emotional cost undeniable as she places the keystone in the ice garden.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes deepen through Accumulative lens: childhood vow ("discover color of sound") tightens via sky lanterns mirroring sea glow, narrowing options to the dive. Agency-driven escalation; cost unmistakable in "purpose ignited" altering his relationship to lamplighting. No redundant moves.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    Escalation driven by Elias's agency (adjusting for wind, decoding seven-second intervals) reweights stakes under Accumulative lens. Cost ("doubts testing devotion") is legible but slightly undersold in the climax compared to setup's "brittle" fragility.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stake (harmonizing logic/intuition) tightens when experiments "falter," forcing risky flame ritual. Starlings' flight patterns deepen conflict by revealing "flaws in logic," with cost in crystal's physical surrender to warmth.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten when deceptive spiral threatens trust erosion; pressure grows through Accumulative lens via sensory narrowing (cloud break revealing anomaly). Cost is psychological burden foreclosing safety, altering tactics through revision.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes escalate via density shift as history rewrites intensify pressure, but "complementary opposites" method lacks visible trade-offs; agency drives deepening, yet cost remains conceptual rather than tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (safeguarding innovation) remains abstract; pressure never materializes as concrete on-page test. Planting seed presents no meaningful trade-off or narrowing of options, failing Band 8.0+ requirement for live option foreclosure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.6)

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (dimensional displacement) tightens through pendant discovery, narrowing options to acceptance. Cost ("interiorize exteriors") is felt in "mist seeped through her fur," though escalation lacks visceral pressure spike.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation through iterative destruction ("shattered the shard, melted it") narrows options via Elias's agency, culminating in the "penny dropped" moment where cost ("frozen bloom of his soul thawing") reweights the dominant stake of interrupted destiny.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.9)

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (vanishing ferry) is clear, but escalation falters—the core problem resolves too smoothly via radio without meaningful tightening. The conceptual cost ("permanent whisper") charges the ending, yet pressure doesn’t intensify under protagonist agency after the hourglass discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (texture of connection) signaled early, but escalation remains passive—Elias weaves without tactical adaptation as pressure mounts. No visible price paid during weaving; "growing tremor" lacks causal link to choices. Band guardrail fails: no narrowing of options before climax.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes (bridging worlds via starlight) tighten through Elara’s agency—experiments with the chain link narrow options toward viable ascent routes.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes ("protect vulnerable voices") are clear but abstract; escalation lacks teeth as Mira's redevelopment threat feels distant until the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen through Elias's agency (returning codex to honor unremembered), but phase transitions lack sufficient mechanical tension; the method's peril feels declared rather than viscerally tested in his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.6)
    Escalation driven by Elar's agency under Accumulative lens: aligning diamond with bird formations reweights the stake through density increase. Cost is unmistakable in "copper veins flaring like forges" during curse-induced visions, narrowing options to endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Elara's agency: her heart-rhythm signaling narrows options as statues freeze, with visible cost in the shell's dissolution; escalation peaks via music's intensifying vibration, foreclosing mechanical order through earned reawakening.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single escalation—drone breaching patrol scans via bottled storm—narrows options meaningfully; cost is visceral in "tension coiling" and crackle echo, though secondary stake (sibling bond) lacks sufficient friction against primary mission.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen through sensory accumulation—silence as "canvas" tightening to singing under pressure—but cost remains conceptual. Agency (singing) reweights options, yet the physical toll of breaking decades of silence isn’t dramatized, leaving cost feeling unanchored in bodily reality.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten when patrons sense the warp but dismiss it—a live option (sharing the vision) foreclosed by their obliviousness, raising cost of solitude. Escalation is pure Accumulative: density builds via hexagon sketches until analog memories stir, reweighting "where stories live."

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes remain abstract ("capture dream") without concrete test; no meaningful tightening as sunrise attempt succeeds effortlessly. Agency passive until final realization. Non-closure accumulation cap: two distinct flaws (untested stakes + passive protagonist).

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes stay abstract ("fear trapping ideas") without visceral test; the ribbon unwinding lacks tangible cost—no struggle, hesitation, or consequence alters tactics. Tightening occurs but without earned trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes (reclaiming fragmented heritage) tighten through atmospheric pressure, but present-life consequences of memory loss lack concrete manifestation. Escalation via density increase ("broken constellations" discovery) works, yet cost remains felt not visible—insufficient for 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes (reversible exile) signaled early but remain abstract until climax; pressure tightens through tea-leaf analysis, yet Lir's internal conflict lacks concrete escalation beyond initial fear—cost legible but not sufficiently tested pre-closure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation via diary revelations intensifies Elara’s internal stake ("seek joy beneath anguish") under the Accumulative lens, narrowing her emotional options until the spire-top closure. Cost is legible in her shift from detached curiosity to charged readiness. Missing one tangible consequence of her discovery on immediate tactics holds it below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes deepen through atmospheric pressure (oxygen scarcity) but lack visible trade-offs; "quietly explosive" tension remains internalized without altering tactics. One meaningful deepening suffices, yet cost feels conceptual rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: coin discovery forces method shift from sky-mirroring to fractal portraiture. Visible cost in "first vibrations of demolition rumbled through the roots" as she completes work. Single deepening suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist agency when symbols reveal peril; the luminance's dual nature creates moral calculus that reweights discovery desire with conceptual cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes (save orchards via unity) are signaled early and deepen through chalk messages, but escalation lacks meaningful pressure escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (calibrating doom's mercy) signaled early but remains abstract; no concrete test of 'world's unraveling' pressure. Tightening via humming succeeds, yet escalation lacks visceral narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.4)
    Stakes tighten causally as frost approaches; her assembly choice forecloses inaction with physical/emotional cost. Agency drives escalation: reluctance melts only when cries pierce her resolve, narrowing options to act or fail.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (mending estrangement) signaled early and viscerally felt through "chasm wider than any ravine." One meaningful deepening (river observation reframing separation) narrows options under Accumulative lens, though escalation lacks a second pressure point to reach 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist agency (incising voids), but "seventeen voids" tally feels arbitrary rather than pressure-driven; conceptual cost (releasing moonlight's essence) legible yet lacks visceral weight during pivotal incisions.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from "remorse that threatened to crack her" to absorbing orbs, but the cost lacks concreteness—no tradeoff (e.g., lost time, energy, or part of herself) alters tactics during the climax, weakening the pressure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (community fracture) tightens via Elara’s agency: language-weaving deepens trust, narrowing options to shared irrigation/festivals. Cost legible in "silos emptying of isolation," but secondary water-rights conflict resolves without lasting consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes tighten through synaptic modification, but escalation lacks agency—"pain lanced" is passive, failing to show altered tactics; dominant stake (excavating dreams) deepens yet cost remains conceptual, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen through sensory accumulation (cracks revealing "wood’s memory"), but pressure lacks tangible escalation; the hedgehog’s presence hints at time pressure yet doesn’t narrow options meaningfully under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation via density—silence correlations narrow options toward moonrise deadline—with unmistakable cost in the dent’s reweighting; agency-driven deepening elevates stakes beyond abstract covenant repair.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes deepen via diary's revealed sorrows, but the tuner's success lacks meaningful resistance; pressure relies on atmospheric tension rather than protagonist-driven escalation against the clasp.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes (preventing future crashes) deepen through wind-pattern analysis, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.9)

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (understanding failure) tightens through flute visions confronting her "shade of former self." Cost is visceral ("fractured resolve" made physical via driftwood), but escalation lacks external pressure spikes; internal deepening sufficient yet not maximally charged for high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes deepen credibly as transposed empathy backfires, but "mathematics of emotion" stays slightly abstract; cost legible via astronomer/mother collision yet dominant stake lacks visceral immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen through Elias's motivation to honor Thorne, but escalation falters—no meaningful tightening occurs when he encounters the shepherd. The pendant's vibration resolves the shepherd's despair too neatly without Elias facing counterpressure, missing a chance for trade-offs that would heighten the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (proving emotional absorption) tightens via frost pattern transformation, but cost remains abstract until climax; sister's face emergence narrows options through irreversible realization.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes stay abstract ("impossible distance," "latent sacrifice") without concrete on-page testing; pressure accumulates texturally but lacks a meaningful tightening—no moment where bamboo physically blocks her or puzzle pieces resist, leaving escalation underdeveloped despite coherent dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation driven by agency (descent forecloses safety path) with unmistakable cost (silk's fraying), but internal conflict remains underdeveloped; wants/needs tension lacks moral calculus depth at peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.6)
    Escalation driven by Elara's agency in redirecting realities, with unmistakable cost in "tears welled as she felt its heaviness." Stake definition tightens too late—truth's "weight" remains abstract until final revelation, weakening early pressure coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes tighten through Elias' emotional engagement with the letters, but external peril ("perilous darkness") fades after paragraph one. Agency in rebuilding the stone stack with sea glass creates visible cost (personal vulnerability).

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through prophetic visions narrowing options; agency in steering shadows toward renewal creates visible cost (obsolescence). Escalation driven by protagonist's choices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single dominant stake (fear of exposure vs magnetizing stories) tightens via wing's light revealing donor's memories. Agency clear in tilting slate, changing knowledge with cost ("hidden colors behind watchful walls"). Cost slightly abstract; needs sharper physical tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes ("what did trees witness?") tighten meaningfully at the pin-drop moment, narrowing options to dream-mapping the sextant, but Elias' agency in escalation feels passive; the storm's easing softens the cost, diluting the conceptual weight of "quantified sorrow."

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes clear (save realm), escalation via song sequence deepens light, but pressure lacks agency-driven narrowing—songs surface "from scattered mind" without trade-offs. Cost remains abstract; no visible price paid that alters tactics or forecloses paths under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (connecting through compassion) tightens through Elias's agency: hiding the invitation transforms into returning it "as a vessel for wisdom." Cost is unmistakable in his solitude-to-revolution shift, though the guards' threat dissipates without tangible consequence, slightly diluting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through Elara’s agency: planting seeds uncloaks murals, shifting from passive noticing to active reclamation. Cost is legible in the fragility of her peace ("tenuous absolution," "delicate as thawing frost"). Pressure grows via density increase (revealed mosaics, sprouts) rather than reversal, fitting accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes (vows' decay) tighten through 432Hz crisis, but escalation lacks tangible narrowing of options; Elara's solution (infusing "stabilizing echoes") resolves the threat too cleanly without visible sacrifice. Agency feels unchallenged—no tradeoff when recalibrating the lantern despite "fracturing like ice under strain."

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes tighten through Elara’s agency-driven false starts (rival plot escalation), culminating in the flare-thwart with undeniable cost—trust fractures audibly—yet the patrols' arrival risks coincidental resolution despite their prior foreshadowing.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes deepen through taste-sensing and ring guidance, narrowing Elara's quest to self-discovery. Cost of worldview collapse lands cleanly, though election timeframe fails to tighten tactics as required by prompt.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes escalate causally from personal quest (finding lost words) to communal survival (truth irrigating souls); Kael's lie forces immediate trade-off where confronting dishonesty becomes necessary for vault access.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes declared early but pressure never tightens—woman/skeptic transformations occur without resistance. Escalation via density (bells crescendo) qualifies under accumulative lens, yet lacks Elias-driven agency or live-option foreclosure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes tighten through Elias’s agency: magnetic shift forces "miniaturization" choice that forecloses deletion path. Cost is visceral (blistering skin) and conceptual (fragmented wholeness), reshaping tactics toward embracing nostalgia as fuel.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes escalate cleanly through neighborhood stories deepening the mailbox's significance, but the resolution lacks felt cost—letters spill easily with instant reconciliation, missing a tangible price like unreadable decayed correspondence.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes viscerally felt through grief-as-"raw ache," escalating via dance decryption deepening knowledge. Agency crystallizes in calm defiance (twirls encrypting torment), with unmistakable conceptual cost in "more webs awaited." Pressure tightens through density, not false reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake signaled early but pressure static: prophecy threat never manifests concretely. No tightening—ritual unfolds predictably without narrowing options. Cost (sweat) lacks emotional/strategic weight. Agency passive; brook "responded" rather than Elar overcoming resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (decoding building's true language) tightens through "agreed upon lies" into rooftop interrogation. Conceptual cost—accepting haunted legacy as "lullaby of endurance"—is unmistakable under Accumulative lens. No escalation flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (archiving quarantined memories) tightens through Elara’s vocal resonance acts, narrowing options to "battle against dissolution." Cost legible in "luminous sorrow" transmuted to independence, but physical/relational price remains underdeveloped despite conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.9)
    Internal stake (forgiving abandonment) escalates through deepening, not external events. Blood ritual narrows options irrevocably; cost legible in "thorn no longer piercing her resolve" as stakes transform from void to scar.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes deepen through Elara's agency—her singing actively unravels webs—but the Echo Weavers' threat lacks tactical escalation; cost ("softer, sadder tone") legibly forecloses her former sonic identity.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (salvaging purity vs. suppressed affections) deepens through cameo analysis, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—Elara receives visions rather than actively wrestling with choices that narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stake (appreciating hidden effort) tightens through accumulative pressure: tea ritual deepens to whistle-induced descent, narrowing options as dawn approaches. Agency drives escalation—whistling "bold in intimacy" forces engagement with fireflies, with conceptual cost (ephemerality) charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (shaping dawn via fragmented signals) lacks tangible escalation. Villages realigning off-page weakens cost legibility; "variant allegiance" remains thematic rather than tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single stake (bridging generations) tightens through sound-pouring sequence, but cost remains purely emotional; no tangible loss (e.g., a jar breaking) limits escalation depth despite lyrical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully as ice encroaches, forcing Elias to adapt his engineering skills. Cost is visible in physical exhaustion and depleted key, but sunset timeframe lacks mechanical urgency—time pressure is atmospheric rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen through moon-path observation's tangible cost (Thorne's clenched fists softening), but the viaduct solution feels slightly convenient; escalation lacks a visceral, on-page loss during the crossing.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (truth vs bureau control) tightens via Elias’ agency: his empirical observation reveals sabotage. Cost is visceral in "vulnerability cracked open," but the lantern’s warmth transition feels slightly convenient, softening escalation’s pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten via Elias' realization of his failure, but "deserve" concept remains thematic rather than driving tactical choices; storm climax lacks causal pressure on decision.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (awakening mechanical sentience) signaled early and escalates through transliteration's deepening, driven by Elara's agency. But cost remains nebulous—"irreverent awe" lacks visceral weight, missing band guardrail for 8.8+ that requires price charging final image. Pressure coheres under accumulative lens yet feels emotionally unmoored.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (preventing violence) tightens through Elara's agency—crystal fragment's warming compels pause, then mirror visions force trade-offs (compromise over pride). Cost legible in her physical/emotional strain during reconstitution.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Elara's agency—trawling debris, guiding families—until the storm forces crystallization; cost is visceral in her transformed hearing of endings as "gentle unfurling" during rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation through Elena’s agency—her "rediscover" reframes Liam’s pain via vine metaphors—narrowing options to acceptance; cost is legible in "tension in his shoulders easing," though Liam’s arrival slightly edges toward coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes (preserving echo) are clear and escalate through clearings, but pressure lacks meaningful deepening; the threat of dissolution feels atmospheric rather than concretely tested against Elar's vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen through vine progression tightening Elara’s time window, but escalation lacks visible cost escalation beyond thematic resonance; the "whimsical fire" metaphor dilutes tangible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen through Elias’s agency: fractured sequences reveal language’s resilience, narrowing his path from decoding to testifying. Cost (lifelong reticence) feels conceptual but legible when crystal "shattered the sequence" during digitization trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten through Elias' agency (rearranging driftwood to channel sound), narrowing options with felt cost in trembling hands and fading visions. Price charges final image via temporary relief in thickening fog.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate causally: tremors intensify → clock disrupts sync → launch window threatens closure. Elias's agency drives resolution (restructuring clock to leaf rhythm), with visible cost in "another chance... lost to entropy." Pressure narrows options meaningfully when quake rattles star charts, forcing him to abandon tools for sensory attunement.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen meaningfully around reconciliation, but escalation hinges on daughter's coincidental arrival rather than protagonist agency; the blood work timeframe tightens urgency yet fails to create a "live clock" altering Elara's real-time tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes remain abstract ("restore what spoons bent") without personal consequence; escalation through loop-closing deepens knowledge but lacks tangible cost on tactics beyond intellectual effort, missing high-band pressure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes escalate credibly from skepticism to ritual action under Accumulative/Textural lens, but the "wooden effigy" resolution feels coincidental rather than earned through Elara's agency—the fairies' theft isn't confronted, muting the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes signaled early (reclaiming meaning from trauma), with icicle pattern deepening pressure. But escalation lacks protagonist agency; thawing drip inspires but doesn’t narrow Elara’s options. Cost felt but not unmistakable per Q4 quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through cameo accumulation under Accumulative lens; each hope collected narrows Elias's options toward completion. Cost legible via seashell talisman pressed into pages. Agency strong but cost could be more visceral than conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (restoring practices to save crops) tightens via song-weaving escalation, but external threat (withered fields) remains abstract; cost is emotional (villagers’ "rediscovered wonder") not tangible. Agency-driven deepening lands.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes deepen through alchemical action: translating heartbeats into maps shifts from personal grief to collective sorrow, but the solstice's arrival lacks causal pressure that could heighten the final sealing moment.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes (healing wounds through bottled wonder) tighten via protagonist agency—studying angles alters tactics—but pressure lacks escalation; rusted gears pose initial obstacle yet no meaningful setback occurs before breakthrough. Cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes (freeing self via burden-collection) tighten through calcification mechanics, but pressure lacks protagonist-driven escalation; Elara’s methodical repetition narrows options only abstractly. Cost remains conceptual ("dense pull of lost companionship") without tangible forfeiture altering later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (containing grief) tightens through memory harvests, narrowing options to carving as the only path forward. Cost is felt in spilled kettle and "hollow chest," but escalation lacks one more pressure spike before the boil-over moment.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single stake (negotiating with ghost) tightens through protagonist's agency: bargaining with fragments forecloses path with visible cost (ghost fading). Pressure deepens via accumulation, though ghost's resolution edges toward coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten through Elias's agency: his decision to place the clock face reconfigures options, trading regret for integration. Cost is legible in "peace settle, excruciatingly gentle, like the first thaw," but escalation lacks one deeper pressure point to reach 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully when Elias dives, risking physical cost (burning lungs) for truth. But the internal conflict—self-deception versus revelation—lacks visible tradeoffs beyond the epiphany, muting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes deepen through Elias’s physical vulnerability (snow-dusted shoulders, hours in fog), but external pressure remains static. Cost is felt but not actively tested beyond endurance; one tightening suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Elias' writing act: "stranded after last vessel sailed" creates immediate cost that alters tactics (using thread as quill). Escalation under Accumulative lens succeeds as obituary draft transforms "explained absences" into tangible geography; cost legible in "garden's shadows embracing him like old friends."

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes (beauty's return vs. mechanical sterility) tighten through protagonist-driven assembly under intensifying tremors. The egg's discovery forces a trade-off: its fragility creates undeniable conceptual cost that reconfigures options, but the quakes' role in escalation lacks fresh complication beyond physical disruption.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake ("scars can sing") tightens through grafting action with visible cost; wanderer's arrival feels coincidental rather than earned pressure escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (breaking generational cycles) is signaled early and deepens via sonar visions of descendants, but cost remains abstract; the "sigh persisting" lacks tangible consequence on Elowen's state or tactics, weakening pressure legibility at climax despite coherent Accumulative escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (mapping collective grief) tightens via migration deadline, but escalation lacks visible cost until closure; Elias's agency is passive under Liora's guidance, weakening pressure buildup despite resonant payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single dominant stake (communal trust vs. hidden guilt) tightens through the vision’s pressure, forcing a trade-off: secrecy or confession. Cost is legible in Elias’s purposeful descent, but the ghost’s sudden appearance slightly softens agency-driven escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stake (decoding intentions) tightens via Elias’s methodical decoding, narrowing options as threads reveal symbols. Agency is passive—uncovering, not choosing—but pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual (abandoning rigid interpretation) yet feels unearned; no visible price paid in his actions or garden.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten when Elias follows broadcast instructions, narrowing options to clandestine dust animation. Cost of narrative drought made visceral in "dust settling on scores, muting the notes like unspoken regrets" before revival.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten through Elena’s agency: arranging porcelain shards reweights "mirage of safety" from abstract concept to tangible cost ("edges a reminder of incomplete information"). Single deepening suffices—motorized chair’s stop crystallizes the cost, though escalation lacks a visible trade-off beyond emotional toll.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through excavation beats as journal discovery forces agonizing choice; cost is visceral in "fingers black with mud," but escalation lacks one more narrowing of options before closure.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes deepen through sap-triggered memories, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency; celestial alignment passively enables growth. Cost (vigilant watch, pruning) feels earned yet emotionally muted, missing high-band pressure intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Elias’ agency: his riddle ritual transforms abstract frustration into actionable insight (bee disorientation), narrowing options to repair. Cost is legible in Lira’s widened eyes—renewed curiosity replacing despair—but the blackout’s persistence lacks tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (reversing societal hush) is signaled early via Elias’s "quiet vigilance," with escalation driven by his agency: the orris shard discovery compels object displacement, narrowing options from passive noticing to active restoration. Cost is felt but under-dramatized—the "hushed blaze" transformation lacks visceral price (e.g., exhaustion, doubt)—though the final "inner light" reweights stakes by making renewal tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    Protagonist agency drives escalation: Elara’s threading action narrows options (escape vs. total collapse) after revelations deepen the core stake (artificial soullessness). Cost is visceral—bubbles rushing through the fracture signal impending doom—while the foxglove’s duality (life/death) sharpens moral calculus without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative escalation excels through layered daydreams that deepen the "strangers remember kindness" stake, but protagonist agency remains passive; visions rouse Elias rather than his choices driving the deepening, weakening pressure under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen via textural escalation: wilting petals → droplets on ice → corroded metal flecks. But pressure lacks visceral tightening—Elara's climb feels inevitable rather than a hard-won choice against narrowing options under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes deepen when yoyo reveals stone's carvings as invocations, tightening options as tide rises. But escalation lacks protagonist-driven narrowing: wave urgency feels coincidental rather than arising from Elias's choices. Cost is felt ("soul forever changed") yet not unmistakably tied to specific agency.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes signaled early but escalation lacks protagonist agency; advisor drives key turns ("Touch it"). Paradoxical notes resolve fear too cleanly without visible cost, violating Band guardrail for 8.8+ requiring tangible price.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.2)
    Escalation is masterfully driven by Leeward’s agency: interpreting clouds’ "urgent pivot" to dub the tree, transforming wind’s howl into "melodic undertow." Cost is unmistakable in the storm’s physical battering ("rain sheeting down in blue-hour veils"), though the orchard’s survival slightly softens the felt cost for 9.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes deepen through the whistle sequence, but escalation relies on convenient revelation (watchers' foam glyphs) rather than Elara's agency; the cost (potential wrath) is felt yet stems from external response, not earned tactical tradeoffs.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (truth vs. noble lies) tightens through Elias’s letter analysis, narrowing options to endurance with visible cost (grandmother’s solace sacrificed). Agency in "recapture" deepens knowledge under Accumulative lens; conceptual price crystallizes in "roots to strengthen" closure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stake tightens through Elias's agency: mandated repairs evolve into embedding notes, narrowing options with felt cost in trembling hands. Single meaningful deepening suffices, perfectly calibrated to length.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (truth-seeking) tightens via blackout pressure, but escalation lacks physical consequence; conceptual cost of rewritten history suffices yet feels detached from bodily stakes during pivotal readjustment beat.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (alchemizing grief) tightens via Elias's agency—polishing gems, folding cranes—narrowing options from desperate ritual to fragile release. Cost legible in "torment eased fractionally," but paradoxical island motion feels decorative rather than deepening pressure; could have constrained crane-release timing for sharper escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (weaponizing unused potential) tightens via crystal's awakening, but cost legibility falters—Elias's "hollow laugh" lacks visceral consequence. Agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes deepen texturally through data anomalies, but cost ("fracture in the soul's anchor") remains abstract rather than viscerally felt despite agency in pulling the lever.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes crystallize through Elias’s agency—sifting directly triggers the watch hand discovery that reweights truth’s cost; "time stolen" makes conceptual price unmistakable, though the single tightening lacks visceral escalation depth for 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten through Elias’s agency when he pauses at midpoint, risking the exchange to verify Tomas’s state; moon-phase protocol creates tangible pressure but secondary "recycling" stake lacks sufficient escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully through environmental pressure (clouds, useless compass), but dolphins' appearance injects unearned hope; dominant "reconcile with Lena" stake signals early yet Lena's beach arrival lacks causal escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes crystallize through Elias' agency narrowing options at labyrinth forks ("to run" vs. "to confront"), with escalation driven by victim visions that alter his tactics (weeping → changed emergence). Cost legible in "hollow-eyed" faces and physical exhaustion, though internal/external conflict interweaving could deepen.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes (reforging bond beyond death) tighten via spice ritual’s physical demands, but escalation lacks visible price: transformation costs (sheds humanity) aren’t felt in the act itself. Agency drives escalation, yet cost remains abstract despite thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen through sensory accumulation ("choking beauty" evolving to "breathable grace"), but external pressure remains thin; cost legible via "weight of lost time lightened" though opposition lacks teeth.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen via Elias’s lightness—a visible price that alters tactics (rising complicates chamber work)—but the cost feels underweighted against the cosmic scale of "locked dimension" resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (understanding transformation) tightens via Elias's actions, but resolution leans on external prophecy coincidence rather than protagonist agency; cost (enduring destitution) is legible yet the accidental fulfillment undercuts escalation's causal integrity under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single stake (ignite revolution) tightens via sundial decoding, but Dominion threat stays abstract; cost felt in "winking hush" tension lacks visceral Dominion confrontation in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation driven by Elara's agency: rock placements deepen knowledge (visions shift from doubt to clarity), narrowing options toward reunion. Dominant stake (end precognition's torment) signaled immediately; cost ("joy pierced the curse's veil for the first time") is unmistakable. Single deepening suffices for Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single dominant stake (mapping scars through censorship) deepens via accumulation, not escalation. Cost is felt in "honed his voice, making it rarer," but lacks concrete tactical alteration from the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    Escalation driven by Elias's agency under Accumulative lens: repurposing objects narrows options toward the piano performance. Cost unmistakable in "fate caught off guard" and compasses locking toward "dawn unseen," reweighting the dominant stake of temporal defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (memory vs. monsoon) tightens via "distant rumble" and "clouds gathered," cost in "luminous doubt persisted." Escalation lacks deepening—pressure grows but no reversal tests commitment; ritual succeeds without meaningful complication.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes escalate through Elias’s agency (following lace instructions), with cost legible in reliving Mira’s departure; minor friction in compass’s spectral runes feeling slightly convenient for Accumulative pressure.
